[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.760]   This week at Google is brought to you

[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.800]   Yes, it's once again that time of year
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.960]   where we give everybody the week off
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.240]   and we let you watch reruns.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.640]   But these are special reruns.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.200]   The best moments of 2014 from this week in Google.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.880]   I love doing this week in Google.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.400]   I, Jeff Jarvis, he's such a brainiac
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.560]   and expert on media, a deep thinker on Google,
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.240]   a deep thinker on issues like privacy
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.160]   and the right to be forgotten and all of that.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.240]   And like Songzuch recht and all that stuff.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.240]   Of course, Gina Trapani, who doesn't love Gina.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.040]   We're all in love with Gina, a developer, a brilliant mind,
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.120]   a Google expert.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.160]   You couldn't find two better people
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.200]   to anchor this week in Google.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.200]   And we have some great clips from this week's--
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.120]   sorry, this year's shows.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.200]   Let's start off with a little rant.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.840]   Jeff Jarvis, apparently he doesn't like local TV news.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.360]   In particular, one thing that local TV news does--
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.160]   let's watch.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.560]   All journalism is telling a story about something that
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.640]   happens so that people understand it better, right?
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.760]   Well, that's one form of it.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.680]   I think the other form is included.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.520]   I should say that to the professors here.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.400]   They probably will spank me for saying that.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.840]   But it strikes me that that's what we need is we need the story.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.040]   We need-- we understand things in terms of story.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.640]   Humans do.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.640]   Many of my professors would say the same thing.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.000]   I argue that stories are only one tool we have,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.400]   and we're not primarily storytellers.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.280]   What's the other story?
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.080]   What's the other way to do it?
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.800]   Data?
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.320]   Data?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.200]   But raw data is not as valuable as--
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.040]   That's why we're looking for it.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.880]   If you give me the raw data, that's one thing.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.760]   If you explain the raw data, i.e. tell a story about it--
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.040]   I'll give you an example.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.640]   After Hurricane Sandy or tomorrow,
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.800]   after whatever weather channel is calling the next storm
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.480]   to hit Gina, we'll get stories.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480]   You know what the stories will say?
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.560]   I can write them right now.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.800]   Gosh, a lot of snow fell, city digging out.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.880]   On TV, they're going to put rulers in the snow and say,
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.400]   guess what?
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.080]   It adds up over time.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.640]   They're going to tell us all this crap--
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.840]   So what would you like?
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.760]   I want a tool that says what streets are open,
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.840]   what streets are closed, and I want that data to come--
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.920]   Is that journalism?
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.320]   Yes, you bet it is.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.120]   It enables a community to share what it knows.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.840]   That's journalism.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.840]   OK.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.680]   Would you agree, boss?
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.680]   Yeah, I mean, that's sort of some of the thinking
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.640]   that we're doing right now is, should we
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.040]   be teaching our students how to be community organizers,
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.600]   basically to engage individual communities
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.320]   and help provide information that helps them organize
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.080]   themselves.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.400]   And that's sort of a new--
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.040]   That's a broader definition than the truth.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.560]   It is.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.920]   Yes.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.760]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.680]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.880]   I've been writing this--
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.760]   That's librarian.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.120]   No, it's a platform maker.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.160]   That stopped us in our tracks.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.240]   Who you calling librarian?
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   Librarians.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.920]   Just stuff.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.440]   OK.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.640]   Meanwhile, we want to destroy some things.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.480]   Part of the reason that I wanted to bring, especially Sarah
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.880]   here, was to look at the wonders that are
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.720]   Twet and reinventing TV news, which I think is vital.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.320]   Well, I'm never doing another stand up.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.480]   I can tell you that after you're vlog.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.840]   There's a very funny Fox 5 video on there of a guy who--
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.440]   I think it's the top one.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.200]   Because you got interviewed by Fox.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.960]   By Fox 5 New York about the stupid things
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.040]   they do and whether a story--
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.080]   I'm surprised that they wanted to do that story,
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.080]   to be honest with you.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.840]   But that seems self-defeating.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.040]   Chat will have to play.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.680]   I don't have the capability of playing videos back in.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.000]   What happened to your laptop?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.040]   My daughter has it.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.800]   Ah, she's using it for work.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.040]   During the Chrysler president--
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.400]   This is an ad, unfortunately.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.840]   But--
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.360]   Sorry about that.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.520]   I should have worn your chin.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.320]   It's all right.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.440]   I like Dwight David Eisenhower.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.480]   I particularly like Robin Williams' rendition
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.040]   of Dwight David Eisenhower and the Butler.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.760]   Did you see that?
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.240]   No.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.640]   Very weird.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.040]   That's not the first person I'd have Robin Williams play.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.540]   No.
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.000]   We ain't get sick of hearing our own voices sometimes.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.520]   Local news really can be a bit much.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.360]   We know that.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.840]   What?
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.120]   This is a local news guy.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.200]   You know what we are talking about, obviously.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.360]   There are silly stories, pointless live shots,
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.160]   endless cliches.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.280]   And then there's Joel Waldman.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.000]   Joining us about our building.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.840]   Perfect.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.600]   I couldn't resist.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   You're putting the hand to the earpiece
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   so we can hear the egg.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.080]   You've been in the--
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.000]   Let the lower third.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Joel, can you hear us?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   That's all right.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.600]   Let's do that.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.200]   In case you were in--
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.240]   Stephen, I love putting my hand up to my earpiece here,
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.680]   otherwise known as an IFB for all of you at home.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.600]   We didn't know this.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.000]   Look behind me over here at Fox 5 News.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.280]   There's absolutely nothing going on right now.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.680]   So we decided to turn it all around for ghosts,
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.000]   no me get in, and tell all you concerned citizens at home
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.080]   exactly what annoys you and us most about this job.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.480]   Time.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.760]   We never have enough.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.200]   A shocking revelation.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.320]   Thanks, local news.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.160]   Think again.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.520]   Time is valuable.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.040]   Honestly, who is time to waste?
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.840]   Maybe you do.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.400]   If you're watching this right now,
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.440]   for the first time ever, in this exclusive local news story,
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.320]   we ask the tough questions.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.360]   Does news ever annoy you?
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.280]   We put CUNY Professor Jeff Jarvis on the hot seat
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.240]   to give this story at least an ounce of legitimacy.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.200]   Doing a story about local TV news is a bit naval gazing,
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.080]   but it's a good start because it shows me
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.120]   that you're willing to ask the tough questions about what's
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.840]   annoying about TV news.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.160]   Like sticking rulers--
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.600]   Almost an inch and a half.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.680]   Not an inch and a half.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.200]   And please, no more.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.120]   Wicked winter weather gimmicks.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.080]   Thanks for that cliche, reporter man.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.280]   And please stop, reporter woman.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.120]   I've got this wind meter right here.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.920]   The winds are literally ripping across.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.320]   If you think this station had enough reporters covering
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.640]   its city severe weather, its first night, this was the second.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.440]   At times news, we come across another chilling reality--
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.000]   reporters stretching the truth.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.240]   Are these holy men walking on top of water?
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.880]   Holy smokes, a canoe in just a few inches of water.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.520]   But I've never wanted to need anchors as badly
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.640]   as during these recent blasts of cold arctic air.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.600]   All right, we get the idea.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.640]   We don't have to keep going.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.720]   Give me a little feral, isn't it?
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.240]   That's good.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.880]   I like that.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.360]   Yeah, that's funny.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.440]   I don't think you're going to stop doing stand-ups.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.600]   I would defend the stand-up.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.160]   But I'm, whoa, okay, I try.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.200]   Try.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.760]   Well, again, this comes--
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.520]   I see I understand now why you guys don't want to accept
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.560]   the fact that really what we are a storytellers.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.200]   Because that allows some subjectivity to creep into--
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.700]   No!
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.480]   No, activity is right.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.960]   You want some subjectivity.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.080]   But the fact is, the human brain wants people.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.280]   They want faces.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.280]   They want pictures.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   This is one of the reasons why I was reluctant to do video.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.100]   Video is-- it's very clear to me.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.600]   The audio is intellectual.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.800]   It's abstract.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.840]   It's ideas.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.200]   Video's all about emotions.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.720]   Video wants pictures.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.800]   And so for television news to abandon the stand-up would be--
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.400]   what do you get?
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.760]   You get the McNeil-Lair, a news report, a news hour.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.720]   You get the PBS news hours.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.920]   But then when you also get more information,
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.760]   you get more value.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.880]   Well, but people don't--
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.000]   Well, people don't--
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.520]   For you, people don't want that.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.240]   The example.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.720]   What is the job of the journalist?
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.240]   Are we the Brussels sprouts of media?
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.120]   Or are we here to help people understand stuff
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.720]   in a way that is palatable?
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:09.680]   I would rather be a Egg McMuffin with some broccoli in there.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.680]   Then to be just the broccoli on the plate.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.760]   I can't think of any food analogy here.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.960]   But I mean, it's not--
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.720]   again, it's not one thing or the other.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.920]   Well, you go right ahead and be deep data.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.800]   I don't care.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.120]   No, I mean, it's a mix of things.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.000]   There's sometimes when I want to analyze data.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.480]   There's sometimes when I want to have a story that moves me.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.240]   There's sometimes when I want some deep complex analysis.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.680]   There's sometimes when I want breaking news.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.720]   I mean, those are all forms of journalism.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.520]   They're all critical.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.840]   I'm just saying you understand why local news has a ruler in the snow.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.040]   That's real fun.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:40.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.080]   It tells people what's going on.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.040]   But here's the wind meeting.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.040]   Here's the example.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:44.960]   Here's the example.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.480]   I know they shouldn't lie about a rowboat in three inches
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.120]   of water.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.720]   That's stupid.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.520]   No, they're just bad.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.720]   But there's also stupid pictures of the blog.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.240]   People standing up in front of the George Washington Bridge
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.080]   and the Christie scandal.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.280]   We have a New Jersey.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.400]   There's no journalism to be had there.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:58.960]   No, of course not.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.240]   There's no visuals there.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.200]   There's no victims there.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.360]   There's no sources there.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.240]   If you do TV, I'm sorry.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.360]   You have to have pretty pictures.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.920]   You don't think Christie's pretty?
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.420]   No.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.740]   Yeah, he's pretty.
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.140]   I would have a picture of Chris Christie.
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.100]   In fact, I'd have him on there.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.740]   Of course.
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.220]   You want TV.
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.660]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.580]   You have a-- as soon as you go to video,
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.260]   you have a responsible to fill the screen.
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.980]   You're responsible to fill the screen with something.
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.580]   And you might as well make it pretty.
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.900]   Ooh, well, OK.
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.740]   So there's a jury on the trial.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.020]   Does it mean you can't have solid information?
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.300]   So what I think is very important-- and I know you guys
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.420]   teach this-- is that there'll be this very solid foundation
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.380]   of journalistic ethics where you don't make up stories.
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.540]   You don't fudge things.
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.700]   You don't attempt to prove a point by editing.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:45.020]   You care most and most deeply about communicating
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.780]   to your audience the truth about a story
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.300]   to give them the information they need to make the judgment
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.420]   that they need to make as good citizens.
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.700]   And you do the things that are in the service of that.
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.260]   Yes.
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.780]   All of that we agree--
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.280]   It does.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.060]   --that is the foundation of what you teach.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.500]   So all we're disagreeing about is how you present it.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.740]   And I would say that sometimes you
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.300]   want to present it with a little bit of--
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:04.740]   But here's--
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.220]   Let me give you another example.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.620]   So the jury's out in the trial.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.220]   I use this example in the blog.
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.500]   And what do they do?
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.220]   The anchor says, the trial's going on.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.660]   This is what happened in the trial.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.620]   Now we're going to go to the--
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.220]   Gina, Japani in the panel courtroom.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.620]   Gina, Japani is going to say, in that closed door behind me,
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.100]   there's a jury.
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.660]   We don't know what the F they're doing.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.340]   I actually have nothing to say to you.
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.980]   But yeah, the trial's going on.
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.100]   It's about this and that.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.980]   Now back to you, the anchor coming back and says,
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.300]   we'll tell you as soon as we hear anything, all of which
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.380]   can be summarized in, jury's still out for more go to the web.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.920]   And then they could get another story and they get more
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.420]   value in.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.940]   It's a waste of precious journalistic resource.
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.460]   The reporters don't report.
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.420]   They are--
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.740]   Well, say I would question whether-- how precious
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.180]   there are these sorts of-- there's
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.860]   a lot of people that you could put out there with the camera
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.420]   operator.
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.540]   That stuff's not precious.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.180]   That's what TV news does.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.660]   And I would just say that if you did this imaginary TV news
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.180]   station that you would like to do,
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.900]   no one would freaking watch it.
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.580]   And part of your mandate is not merely to tell the truth
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.820]   and get the story out, but to get somebody to watch it.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.100]   Nobody's watching it now.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.500]   I mean, the numbers--
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.260]   Well, that's only because there's other places
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.500]   you can have people staying in.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.380]   But I don't know.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.020]   You have kids.
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:14.660]   I have kids.
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.700]   They don't watch YouTube.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.580]   They watch any news that they're getting.
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.740]   They're getting on the laptop.
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.060]   There's stuff on YouTube that is any less.
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.220]   YouTube's full of stuff is stupid.
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:23.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.780]   The guy's shooting out there with it.
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.500]   It was not trying to be news.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.020]   So it's not trying to be fun.
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.300]   If you look at the presentation on YouTube,
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.660]   there are a lot of attention to presentation.
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.540]   Otherwise, nobody watches it.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.620]   Watch Epic Meal Time, which has no content.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.100]   Do we have to?
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:37.540]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.260]   Has no content.
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:43.100]   My son loves it because of what they're seeing and doing.
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.180]   He loves.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:44.980]   They're mushing the hand.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:45.820]   I don't just do a giant--
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.420]   Here's where I'm at.
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.020]   I think the conflation of informing and entertaining
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.500]   is the issue.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.380]   Now, that's usually said in terms of, oh, it's crappy TV.
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.300]   What I was trying to say is something different.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.540]   Is that if I want to read a long--
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.340]   if I want to read a novel, that's entertainment.
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.700]   I want to read a long New Yorker story.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.860]   That's often entertainment.
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.340]   Snowfall, the times dead that everybody loved
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.500]   was really, to me, entertainment.
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:06.980]   Because I don't--
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.100]   That was a waste of time.
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.660]   As much as everybody loved it, that was a waste of time.
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.340]   And money.
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.340]   And a lot of money.
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.420]   And this is very not politically correct.
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.380]   I would complain far more about that than some idiot anchor
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.580]   with nice hair standing out in the rain.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.100]   To me, that is a bigger waste of money and resources
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.660]   that added nothing to the conversation.
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.420]   And I think there's ways that we could probably inform you
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.300]   when I had my coffee with Katie Kureg.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.780]   Did you mention this to Katie?
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.300]   Yeah, well, I'd be curious what she thought.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.340]   I wanted to know how long it was going to take you to get out
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:37.340]   of it.
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.580]   I know, it was a little bit longer than I thought.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.580]   You hear the show so much.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.900]   There was too long this week.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.420]   And so one thing I said was the one difference I see in going
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.100]   to Yahoo is you don't have to fill a clock anymore.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.100]   We over-fill the clock here at Twin.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:53.900]   But you don't have to--
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.700]   Never had any problem filling a clock.
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.940]   You don't have to fill the clock anymore.
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.260]   And if you want to say what's new in a story,
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.460]   you can do that in a minute 30 and then not have to say anything
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.420]   more until something actually happens.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.980]   So part of what TV does is we have to have video, video, video,
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.780]   video, because we have to fill an hour.
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.020]   Well, if you instead your job is to inform people,
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.420]   maybe you can do that in a minute 30.
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:11.740]   You're not--
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.420]   Oh, my experience of television is very different from that.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.620]   In fact, my experience of television
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.620]   was that we never had enough time,
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.020]   that there was always the urgency to get stuff done
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.540]   in less time.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.100]   And that hurt TV more than anything else.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.020]   That's where you edit out the pieces of him
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.300]   downloading the malware.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.300]   Because it's not because you don't want that information,
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.500]   because it takes too much time.
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.020]   There's never enough time in mainstream media.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.380]   So why do they waste so much of it
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.540]   on idiots standing upward?
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.460]   Nothing happened in less than hours.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.940]   I don't think they consider that wasted.
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.340]   I think they consider that the way
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.500]   that they make a palatable product.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.940]   That's my problem is that's the orthodoxy of old TV.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.260]   This is the way we make TV.
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.340]   It's got to be the only way, because it's
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.420]   the way we've always done it.
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.580]   And I'm saying, you know what you're going to do?
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.100]   What?
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.020]   I'm bringing you to New York.
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.820]   We're having an event at CUNY in reinventing TV news.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.340]   We should have a debate.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.060]   Now I'm going to have you in a hacking TV event.
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.220]   I would just--
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.500]   I feel like I want to argue the case for the average Joe, who
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.140]   sits down in front of the TV.
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.060]   And I understand what you need to do in television.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.300]   Which we don't do here, but you need to make pretty pictures.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.740]   I think you're the proof that you don't need to.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.740]   You need to make a picture.
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.500]   You physically are the proof that you don't need pretty pictures.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.500]   That's why we have Gina, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.940]   She's a trippani.
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.300]   Jeff, I really like that thought that you were bringing up
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.460]   circa was really at, circa is that that news app.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.100]   I love it.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:26.540]   I love it.
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.340]   I barely look at it, but it notifies me when I need--
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.660]   so you can follow a story.
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.060]   And it notifies me when there's something new.
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.740]   When there's an update to the story.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.740]   And I really like that.
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.660]   And I like that you're pointing that the way the TV news works
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.620]   now is that it's just people explaining the same story.
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.140]   If you have all the background, you're
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.220]   just hearing the same thing repeated over and over and over
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:48.820]   again.
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.780]   But what you really want is just to know,
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.260]   has did the jury come back?
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.140]   What was the verdict?
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.140]   Well, you raised that.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.860]   Don't tell me whether or not-- only tell me if they have,
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.220]   right?
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.740]   I don't want to hear anything else.
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.180]   We went to visit circa this week as well.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.940]   And they make a big point of that,
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.500]   saying that once you already know enough in the story,
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.980]   then all you want is the update.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.260]   And you want to follow the story.
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.620]   That's a new opportunity we didn't have in big old news.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.180]   You know, circa came out of Ben Ha of Iken has Cheeseburger,
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.060]   actually saying, I think we need to rethink
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.100]   how we deliver journalism.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.540]   In fact, I remember going to food camp.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:19.980]   He was there.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.940]   Were you at that food camp?
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:21.740]   Gina, I think we were--
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.220]   We went back to the cottage and did the show
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.140]   within afterwards.
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.140]   I remember him.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:25.940]   He had done it.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.300]   Yeah.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.340]   Before he did circa, he said, I want
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.820]   to talk with you about what's wrong with journalism,
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.340]   what's wrong with news, and how we can do a better job.
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.980]   And then circa, I think, is quite successful.
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.020]   But it's a different thing.
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.940]   I mean, connected devices are a little different.
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.620]   They are more goal-oriented than sitting down
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.740]   in front of a television.
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.260]   Or are you--
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.580]   Real you question the orthodoxy of television.
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.180]   You blew up the orthodoxy of television,
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.740]   yet here you are defending it to me.
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.180]   I am defending it because it works really well.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.580]   I hate to tell you--
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.260]   Here's the bad news.
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.100]   It's working.
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.020]   The audience is dying.
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:58.900]   I want measure.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.260]   By what measure is it working?
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.260]   Well, OK.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.380]   OK.
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.420]   You would say TV news is that thing that's on the box that
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.340]   comes with the air.
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.740]   I would merely say video news, and I would say YouTube counts.
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.340]   In other words--
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.140]   Oh, well, where are we defining that?
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.060]   Well, no, circa is very different.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.220]   So there are ways of getting information
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.740]   of via web browser and so forth.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.700]   But I think what succeeds is people like to--
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.980]   this is why we spent $1,000,000,000 to do this.
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.580]   People like to watch video.
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.140]   They like to the leanback experience
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.580]   is not a dead experience by any means.
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.660]   In fact, I will give you the measure.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.500]   People watch more television now than they did 10 years ago.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.660]   That's the bad news.
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.620]   The number of hours-- look it up.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.980]   Look at the TV news portion.
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.980]   Ah, well, maybe--
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.780]   And the age they're on.
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.700]   And the age of the people who are watching TV news.
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.420]   And the portion of the TV news segments that is actually
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.460]   news as opposed to weather or sports.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:53.980]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.100]   Well, that I agree with.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:55.980]   Well, that I agree with.
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.580]   But that is the failure of local news.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.220]   That is the failure of local news.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.580]   Local news has always been horrific.
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.340]   Well, that's really what we're focusing on.
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.260]   Well, I agree with you.
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.220]   But I don't think the stand-up is the problem there.
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.340]   I think the biggest problem with that
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.420]   is underestimating the intelligence of your audience.
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.700]   And this comes, again, from many years--
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.660]   More years in the snow.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.900]   I have worked for all the networks.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.060]   And I know they don't want you to think of the audience
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.380]   as intelligent.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.140]   And that's kind of a mistake if you ask me.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.820]   Because guess what you get?
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.620]   Stupidity people.
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.860]   But that's-- anyway, this has nothing to do with Google.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:30.260]   Hi, Gina.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:30.740]   How are you?
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.580]   How's things up going?
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.620]   I find it annoying.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.980]   My car's always saying, you're out of gas.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.460]   You're out of gas.
[00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.460]   You want to see gas stations?
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.460]   No.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.980]   I want to keep driving.
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.900]   Are you one of those horrible people that drives down
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:43.420]   the fumes?
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.460]   Yep.
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.420]   You're also one of those horrible people that also
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.460]   appears two minutes before the flight takes off?
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.860]   If possible.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.220]   Sometimes that's not always easy to do.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.820]   But I try.
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.140]   I like to walk in that plane as they're closing the door.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.620]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.060]   Like, do you like to have a close?
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.420]   Two hours ahead.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.620]   My mother made me neurotic as hell.
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.060]   I feel like this says a lot.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.580]   This says I'm learning a lot about you.
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.060]   Five years later, I feel like this is indicative.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:13.940]   What about you, Gina?
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:14.540]   Are you the--
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.020]   I'm trying to figure that out.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.380]   I aspire to be Jeff, but in reality, I'm Leo.
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.980]   Like, I come late, but I'm like,
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.420]   Harry'd and freaked out.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.860]   And like, I'm late because, yeah.
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:26.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.820]   I'm always late for everything.
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.060]   I just show up late.
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.420]   You're the only TV network on Earth
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.140]   that doesn't give a crap about the clock.
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.300]   And I'm proud of that.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.220]   Even though it drives our audience crazy.
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.260]   I don't know.
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.940]   Drives them crazy.
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.260]   And they don't want to drive our audience crazy.
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.060]   I should do a Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.620]   We built this station on the notion
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:54.020]   that no show should start on time, but now we want to take care
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.660]   of you, our audience.
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.140]   I'm pretty much never ready to start right at four,
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.060]   so I'm really glad.
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.300]   Like, that's what we felt for me.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.340]   Yeah, see you and I.
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.260]   This is actually the week after next.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.260]   I'm going out to Google for to do a privacy talk, right?
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.340]   The next Wednesday morning, I either fly back,
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.620]   and I think I would land at 2.30 at Newark.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.380]   And I live 20 minutes away from Newark Airport.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:20.140]   So now the Leo would say, no, swap, right?
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.700]   Jeff would say, hmm, I'm usually home at least an hour
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.060]   before the show.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.700]   Something could go wrong.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.780]   Then I'll be really nervous.
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.060]   And I can't tell you because I'm in the air.
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.580]   Maybe I'll stay two more days just so I can be on the show.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.540]   That's the way I think.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.740]   They should have on Google now like a setting for that.
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.580]   What kind of person?
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:39.940]   Are you a Jeff or a G?
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.140]   You're a Jeff or Leo.
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.020]   It's an erosive slide.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:44.540]   I don't know.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:44.980]   Yes, you know.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.100]   Slider.
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.820]   I play, you know, it's 15 minutes past showtime and Skype's
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.380]   like, hey, do you want to install updates?
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.820]   I'm like, what could go wrong?
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.300]   Like, what?
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.100]   I did that too.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.620]   Yes.
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.580]   Christ, Jack, crazy.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.580]   Yeah, let me just update Mac the Mac right now.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.900]   It's not just right or no, it's not.
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.900]   I do it in shows.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.740]   [LAUGHING]
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.900]   Actually, I was so proud because I flew to Colorado
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.740]   to see my son on Thursday last.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:13.060]   And I arrived just as the boarding began for my row.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.140]   I walked in.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.140]   That's what I want.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:16.980]   That's what I want.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.780]   I'm so proud that I am now--
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:20.860]   here's how to run a time.
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:25.380]   I'm now global services on United.
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.420]   We go on before the pilots.
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.220]   We go on the first, right?
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.500]   And it's that horrible moment when
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.220]   I used to hate those people that say, excuse me.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.060]   Excuse me.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:34.860]   I'm global services.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.500]   Let me throw it over.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.820]   Oh, I hate those people, yeah.
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.320]   I know.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.060]   I'm obnoxious, right?
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.820]   So even though I know I'm the first to board,
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.820]   I don't have to line up.
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.780]   I don't have to do anything.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.980]   I still show up early.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.060]   Good man.
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.380]   Because I'm neurotic.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.940]   Remember that demo we saw at Google I/O where they were
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.060]   running Android apps in Chrome OS?
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.740]   That is happening for everybody.
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.940]   So we got four Android apps now available to run on Chrome OS.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.100]   Duolingo, which is a great app.
[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.700]   Evernote, sight words, and Vine are all
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.820]   available in the Chrome web store for Chrome OS users.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.820]   So this is Jeff.
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:11.900]   I installed the Evernote.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.100]   Yeah, and it's great.
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.220]   I mean, it works now.
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.420]   Because I complained before I stopped using Evernote
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.340]   because it wasn't native on Chrome.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:24.380]   And so when computer died, which is very rare on my Chrome
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.700]   local, when it did, I lost the material
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.700]   because it wasn't saved to the cloud.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.820]   Now it does save locally, which is very important.
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.340]   And that means that other applications
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.100]   will do the same thing.
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.100]   And that's a big deal.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.380]   So it's the tablet optimized layout,
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.300]   because it's on your Pixel.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.460]   Your Pixel's touch screen.
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.660]   So when you launch Evernote, it looks
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.940]   as if it's on a tablet.
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.700]   And you can touch it to interact or use your keyboard,
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.620]   obviously, to type into it.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.420]   Let me call it up here.
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:54.860]   And it just acts like it's on your Nexus 7.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.820]   Well, what's weird is that I can't find it.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.180]   Because I have an Evernote web.
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.380]   That's what I've been using.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.820]   So I do use Evernote on it.
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.540]   I just know I can't save stuff.
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.060]   You can't-- in the web, you can.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:07.900]   Right.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.700]   But that's still in my applications.
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.500]   No, I can't find the Evernote.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.260]   Yeah, I didn't get a chance to add that to the Skillback.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:22.260]   Oh, because you can't have to optimize the apps on--
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.980]   I know that really bothers me.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.620]   You can drag them around, though, right?
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:25.940]   Can't you?
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:26.780]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.900]   Yeah, but that can drag them into any order you want.
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.860]   I can stop.
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.900]   I don't have time to drag stuff.
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.260]   But I have a beautiful--
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.580]   That's what the alphabet's for, to put stuff in order
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.700]   in some random order based on the first letter of their name.
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.020]   Please.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.900]   That's why we created the alphabet.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.940]   XYZFG.
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.460]   I don't care anymore.
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.300]   Speaking of crazy, a man and his wife in Columbus, Ohio
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:57.740]   subjected to hour-long interrogation by the FBI
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.300]   because employees at the AMC movie theater
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.580]   saw him wearing Google Glass.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.180]   And I didn't believe this story at first,
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.980]   but it's been confirmed since.
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.820]   It's just ridiculous.
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:10.980]   This poor guy.
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.340]   This poor guy.
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:14.660]   So he's been in this theater before.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.740]   This is Columbus, Ohio.
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.620]   He's been in this theater before.
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.060]   He's an hour into watching the movie with his--
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.260]   I think with his wife or his partner.
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.540]   He's got Glass on.
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:28.300]   These guys come and grab him and grab Glass off of his face
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.620]   and take him into an interrogation room.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.180]   I'm laughing.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.100]   It's not funny.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.100]   But I just can't imagine getting like--
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.460]   He blogs.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.700]   He blogs on the gadget here.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.700]   It was quite embarrassing.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.780]   Outside of the theater, there were five to 10 cops and mall
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.020]   cops.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.500]   It was like major bust.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.500]   First of all, of course, because it's Glass,
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.940]   he could have been recording the movie, right?
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.660]   Yes.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.460]   He could have been.
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.820]   So he could have been recording it on his phone.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.580]   Right.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.100]   But people do that, and you will get--
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.020]   I mean, that is a crime.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.020]   But I just--
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.380]   He's going to buy that "World's Worst" video.
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.300]   That's what's so absurd about it.
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:01.940]   Oh, but they do.
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.380]   I mean, they do.
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.820]   I mean, there's camcorders people are getting up and down.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.660]   The "Sattest" term of a people do it, and people sell it.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:13.860]   But is this really a commensurate response?
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.340]   Somebody who's horrors--
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:16.580]   Our Google plot is a--
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:17.420]   Taping a movie.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.780]   Even if he was taping the movie, it
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:24.100]   takes five to 10 police officers to take this man down?
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.100]   Search?
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.020]   This theater had trouble with bootleg
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.820]   with people recording movies in the past.
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.700]   So I guess when they were interrogating him, they were saying,
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.020]   hey, man, just give up your ball.
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.460]   Like, who are you working for?
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.500]   Just give up the guy up the chain, and we'll let you go.
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.820]   And he was saying, hey, just plug in my glass to a computer,
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.660]   and you'll see there's pictures of my wife and my dog on there.
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:46.940]   I didn't record the movie.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.100]   And it was an hour, or quite a bit of time
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.940]   passed before they actually looked at Glass
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.860]   and tried to see whether or not--
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.220]   --he was actually recording.
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.620]   He says, he writes, I insisted they connect to the Glass
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.020]   and see that there was nothing on it.
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.460]   I also insisted they look at my phone and clear things out.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.220]   But they wanted to talk first.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.420]   They want to know who I am, where I live, where I work,
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.220]   how much I'm making, how many computers I have at home,
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.780]   why I'm recording the movie, who I'm
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.260]   going to give the recording to, why don't I just give the guy up
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:17.220]   up the chain because they're not interested in me over and over.
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.780]   You know, there is something really
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:22.220]   wrong when federal law enforcement officials
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.780]   are doing the bidding of the Motion Picture Association
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.980]   of America like this.
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.980]   When there's real crimes going on, this is ridiculous.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.420]   You know, if you're going to question them--
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.500]   what was-- I think there's so much I found disturbing about it.
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.300]   Like, are you going to be ripped out of your seat?
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.100]   OK.
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.860]   But you're going to be questioned without being written
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.820]   your rights, but you're not actually under arrest,
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.780]   but you're clearly being detained.
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.860]   Technically, he should have been able to walk at any time
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.340]   he wanted to.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:49.860]   They said that.
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.820]   They said, you're not under arrest.
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.380]   But if you choose not to cooperate, bad things may happen.
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:54.700]   Right.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.500]   And really, at that point, you can say, well,
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.420]   then bring on the bad things because I'm leaving unless you
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.500]   want to arrest me or whatever.
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.540]   So there are all these things.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.460]   But what was disturbing to me was that there's
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.140]   no technical expertise.
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.860]   If you're going to go after somebody,
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.260]   and these people, some of them, when
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.460]   they seem to have some knowledge of the bootlegging
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.860]   how it's going on or whatever, and you see
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.700]   that someone has these Google Glass,
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.980]   you think you would at least Google a little bit
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.420]   of information about them.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.420]   Or at least--
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:22.900]   Or at least--
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.260]   And in short order, you'd understand things like,
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.780]   well, you're going to get maybe 45 minutes of the movie
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.940]   recorded.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.860]   Or if he is telling you, well, you
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.020]   can take a look at the want or whatever with it from there,
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.140]   then do it.
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.300]   Right.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.620]   He said they released him five minutes after they checked.
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.900]   Once they went through my phone, and five minutes later,
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.620]   they concluded I had nothing wrong and offered him four passes
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.660]   to another movie at the theater.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.660]   There is a lesson to be learned here, though.
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.580]   Don't wear your glass into a movie theater.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.700]   No, there's a lesson to be learned, not for that guy,
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.460]   but for stupid movie theater owners and for stupid cops.
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.300]   No, I disagree, because I think that if you did the same thing,
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.580]   if you held up your phone and did this,
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.980]   or if you had a even camcorder, they would go in and arrest you,
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.260]   and they would be within their rights.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.580]   That's against the law.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.940]   His-- he had prescription lunges attached to his glass.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.940]   Those are his glasses.
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.940]   Ah.
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:20.940]   Yeah.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.460]   OK.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.460]   I didn't know that.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.060]   He wears glasses.
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:23.900]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.300]   You know, it's funny, Leo.
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.340]   I actually don't get that it's-- and even the recording device,
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.220]   it's like--
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.380]   The battery left five minutes.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.460]   Because it's a recording device, it is also your phone.
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.700]   If I'm wearing my smart watch to the thing,
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.660]   I don't get arrested because it has a recording device.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.020]   No, but you would if you held it, pointed at it.
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.020]   And the problem with glass is it--
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.020]   I'm going to keep-- if I hold my watch--
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.020]   Oh, it's watery.
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.020]   You get shot at it.
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.020]   And I go to look at it.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.020]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.020]   Now my king's up or whatever.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.260]   I could be having glass on because I
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.740]   want to sit in the movie theater for whatever reason.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.020]   I want to get a notification on email.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.700]   I want to get a text message showing up
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.220]   so that I know if I'm having a problem with my babysitter
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.060]   or whatever.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.100]   Just because it has a recording device doesn't mean
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:04.620]   that it's recording.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.700]   But I think this is the fundamental problem with glass
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.780]   is that it does have a recording device that is pointed at you,
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.980]   and you don't always know if it's recording.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.220]   It's the same societal problem of going into a bathroom
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:14.980]   with glass.
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.260]   And people, if you want to have glass take off,
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.260]   you better be very sensitive to this.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:20.780]   Right?
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.340]   Leo, I felt the same way that you did
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.700]   before last night's episode of All That Android, which I'm
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:27.820]   going to plug right now.
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.860]   Because we had a guest on Cecilia Boddy, who was the woman who
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.540]   was stopped and given a speeding ticket on the road
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.740]   in the San Diego area.
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.060]   But she had glass on while she was driving.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.060]   And the cop also tried to find her
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.220]   for wearing glass.
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:43.780]   And to me--
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:44.540]   She had the fight in court.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.460]   And one, by the way.
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.540]   She had the fight in court.
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.660]   And she won, because they couldn't prove
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.900]   that she was watching the video on glass,
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.460]   which is what the law prohibits, is
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.260]   that you're looking at the second screen.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.900]   And my attitude was like, why would you wear a glass while
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:58.420]   driving?
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.180]   Or why would you wear glass to the movie theater?
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.540]   That's just dumb.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.740]   And especially driving, because when you open the package,
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.860]   one of the first things it says is like, hey,
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.260]   this is not lawful to wear while you drive.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.580]   I mean, Google basically says, don't wear it while you're
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.100]   driving.
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.780]   But Cecilia, you explain, first of all,
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.540]   she's a CTO of a company that develops glass wear.
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.740]   She wears glass all day long.
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.100]   She wakes up in the morning, puts them on,
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.780]   and she's a very dedicated explorer.
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:23.940]   They're just her glasses.
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.180]   She doesn't think about it anymore.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.620]   She puts them on, and wears them.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.060]   And it sounds like this is the situation
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.980]   with this guy on the movie theater.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.580]   And it didn't occur to her to take them on,
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.540]   as she was driving.
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:37.220]   And she wasn't watching Netflix on her glass or whatever.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.540]   She was just driving.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.140]   And particularly with driving, it's like navigation
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.940]   is a totally legitimate use case for wearing glass while driving.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.420]   So I mean, look, I think that the Explorer program--
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.340]   and I said this on the show last night--
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.860]   the Explorer program is very much the sort of like canary
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.860]   in the coal mine thing.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.980]   I mean, I think that Google is figuring out,
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:30:00.900]   like, where does glass create these issues or these problems?
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.380]   And I think that movie theater officials and cops
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.260]   on the highway are figuring out what is glass?
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.420]   What is-- when they're on, does that
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.740]   mean that they're recording or not?
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.420]   I mean, I think it's just a misunderstanding of the technology.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.060]   But unfortunately, you have people like Cecilia
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.500]   and this guy in Ohio who have to be the ones to deal
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.900]   with these sort of legal--
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.940]   Yeah, I think there's some onus--
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.340]   there's some onus, though, on glass owners
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.460]   to be aware of the sensitive nature of this.
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.060]   And while I don't care if he's in a movie theater,
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.500]   I do think that glass owners need to put the glass up
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.420]   in their head when they're in a men's room.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.020]   I feel like it's kind of a little tone deaf
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.820]   on the part of glass owners to say,
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.820]   hey, man, these are my prescription glasses.
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.300]   What's your problem?
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.420]   You're wearing a recording device in your head.
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.180]   So you'd be aware of that, and some people
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.340]   are going to take Umbridge.
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.740]   Some of them will be federal law officials.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.780]   So it might behoove you just to avoid the problem.
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.220]   Like, if that's his only pair of glasses?
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.220]   Well, he explained quite a bit, actually,
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.420]   that some other things I was reading
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.620]   on how he has a spare pair, but he's actually
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.780]   been using them as his ordinary pair of glasses.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.980]   Well, he needs to kind of wise up.
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.020]   Yeah, but you know, he'd also said
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.700]   that he's been to the theater before,
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:11.860]   and if you can--
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.180]   So we got away with it before.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.180]   That doesn't mean it's not--
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.860]   I was like, I didn't wait with anything.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:16.860]   Leo, hold on, hold on.
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.860]   What do you think?
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.460]   Yes, it is.
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.260]   Wearing a recording device in your head
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.980]   carries a higher responsibility than not
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.540]   wearing a recording device in your head.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.900]   Will you not agree to that?
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:25.900]   I want to repeat this.
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.140]   We're recording a device that has like five minutes of battery.
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.380]   No, I don't care.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.220]   You're wearing a recording device in your head.
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.140]   Leo, I would agree with you in general.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:36.460]   For example, if I go into a restroom
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:37.940]   and I am actually wearing glass, I
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.860]   will put them on my head when I walk in.
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.220]   Oh, God.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.220]   OK.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.620]   No, but I want you to slide that up.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:43.860]   It's a big deal.
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.300]   If you really think--
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.020]   It's just swimming in the world, Jeff.
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:47.860]   You got people.
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:48.620]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.260]   Let's go to that.
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.500]   At the place that I don't have to worry, I'm going to go.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.940]   And then they're going to go.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.260]   And then, you know.
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:54.780]   But it's like--
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:55.780]   Yeah, if you really think--
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.100]   It's like a-- it's like a-- it's like a--
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:57.580]   It's like a--
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.580]   Any consideration to do for anybody--
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.980]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:02.780]   Let me write back.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:03.780]   Let me write back.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:08.060]   If you really think that every man on earth wants
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.100]   to shoot other men's junk, the only thing stopping them
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.740]   is they don't have a camera on their head.
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.300]   No, that's not what we're saying.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.500]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.400]   You have to be where it's entirely sensitive.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.060]   If you-- look, if you go around with a tape recorder
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.380]   like this, people are going to take Umbridge and write a sound.
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.100]   You're not wearing glasses that have technology on it.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.740]   Jesus, I mean, is this-- this week in Ludditeism?
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.900]   What happened?
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.620]   I'm just saying that, yeah, I can see Leo's point
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.460]   that you might want to think about a bit more
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.580]   when you're using technology that you are not as familiar with
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.940]   and might be a bit freaked about.
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.020]   You-- no, I'm asking you to give credit to people
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.180]   that they're not going to suddenly be bad because they
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.020]   have technology attached to their head.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.740]   I understand that-- I'm not saying that they are.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.460]   I'm not even saying this-- I'm not saying this guy did
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.500]   anything wrong.
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.340]   I'm saying if you're--
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.620]   And you don't have to act--
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.820]   You're saying he should act as if people should
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:57.860]   assume that he does.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.900]   He should be sensitive to the fact that--
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:03.020]   No, I would say he should act as if he is virtuous
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.580]   until he does something wrong.
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.980]   You have to make it a yokey before he's proven guilty.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:11.660]   I'm saying, for example, if I'm wearing glass on occasions
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.460]   and I'm sitting at a table with someone
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.260]   or I'm talking with somebody or interacting with somebody,
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.820]   I may move it to the top of my head
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.620]   just so that they don't think I'm going to be suddenly
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:21.820]   being distracted.
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.620]   It's the same way that if I'm talking to somebody
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.380]   and I look at my phone while I'm talking to them,
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.900]   that can be interpreted as real.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.460]   Jeff, are there--
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.420]   Let me ask you this, Jeff.
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.380]   Are there no places you can envision where it would be
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.820]   inappropriate to wear glass?
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.140]   That's the issue of wearing it.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.660]   I don't think it's a matter of inappropriateness.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.180]   No.
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:40.620]   I don't think it's appropriate.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.700]   So there's nowhere you could imagine somebody wearing glass
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.220]   where it would be appropriate to put them away
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.700]   or to take it off.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:47.860]   I think it's appropriate--
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:48.460]   I think it's appropriate--
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.100]   In every circumstance.
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.820]   I think it's appropriate to say to someone, are you recording?
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.100]   It's appropriate to say, I'm not recording.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:55.620]   That's fine.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.380]   So if I'm going into a locker room,
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.260]   if I'm going to a locker room where there are children changing
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.820]   and I'm wearing glass, I should say, hey,
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.900]   I have a right to wear this.
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.860]   I'm not saying it's about right.
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.620]   I'm saying that you are presuming
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.940]   because someone is using a technology to use it with as bad.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:10.980]   Yeah, you are.
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.660]   And that's an issue because the knee jerk of the techno panic
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.460]   crowd is that any use of technology-- if it could be done
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.380]   bad, it will be done bad by everyone.
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.900]   And none of us should use it.
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.060]   And I'm objecting to that logic.
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:27.100]   Jeff, if I carry an axe around and I-- oh,
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.460]   I have no intent to chop anybody.
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.500]   This is for wood.
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.100]   If I carry a gun around, I have no intent to shoot anybody.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.940]   I use this to shoot deer.
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:35.500]   Leo, what are you doing?
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.420]   Are there not things that are just--
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.020]   I mean, maybe legal, but societally,
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.460]   it might be nice if people showed some consideration
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.060]   for other people.
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:46.460]   Leo, an eight far away from you, the people
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:50.220]   driving around with gun racks in the back of their pickups.
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:52.340]   And if you went up to them and said, I object to you doing
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.100]   that, you shouldn't do that.
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.820]   I want to dash cam on that scene.
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.540]   But I can assure you if they came in here carrying weapons.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.740]   In fact, you go to Texas, every bar has a sign that says,
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:05.100]   please don't bring your gun in here.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.660]   Is that wrong?
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.140]   Are they in some way--
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.500]   Glass is not a gun.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.700]   I'm just saying there are behaviors.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.900]   There are things you can have.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.300]   Whether you intend to do anything wrong or not,
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.300]   that would just be polite to take them off.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.380]   It's the same discussion, though.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.740]   The guy's glasses.
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:26.180]   When I get the glasses and I get prescription lenses on them,
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.940]   I'm not carrying around an expert glasses
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.180]   and changing them all the time.
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.380]   That's my glasses.
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.340]   Well, I think that--
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:35.220]   I just think this is going to be an issue going forward.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.260]   And it could be very--
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.620]   When we have the same issue, it was the same argument
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.660]   when cameras went on to cell phones.
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:43.980]   And it was, oh my god, we can't allow them anywhere.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.660]   There are gyms.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:47.980]   How many stories have you seen of sickos taking pictures
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.700]   of gyms we didn't see it?
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.860]   Because we're not sicko as a society.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.380]   Yeah, but I have to say, if I go in a locker room--
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:55.420]   They're from.
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.820]   I don't go in a locker room like this.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:58.980]   Hey, everybody.
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:35:59.620]   But if somebody--
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.180]   But if you're wearing it on your head, it's OK.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.980]   OK, Leo, if they've got their phone out on their text,
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:04.420]   you'd like this.
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:06.500]   And the camera could be pointed at your junk,
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.540]   but they're doing this.
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.620]   Well, I think that's rude.
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:09.820]   I don't think you should do that.
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.820]   I think that's extraordinarily rude.
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.180]   When I was at CES, I was in a restroom.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.140]   And like I said, if I had had glass,
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.140]   when I walk in, I probably would have moved at the top of my head,
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.060]   just not because I'm worried that some guy standing next to me
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.140]   thinks I'm taking a picture of him,
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.300]   but just because the entire bathroom area
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:28.300]   tends to have some degree of privacy expected into it.
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.180]   So I'm like, for whatever reason, I'll put it there.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:34.500]   But as I was in this restroom, the urinals in this restroom
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.460]   started to get too graphic.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.500]   But last week, we talked about a lot of your social--
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.020]   This particular hotel thought it was funny that above all
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.980]   the urinals was pictures of women making funny faces
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:43.820]   and pointing down at you.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:44.540]   Yeah, looking at your junk.
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:45.540]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.380]   You know, so--
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.300]   That's in Vegas.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.980]   Yeah, I've seen that.
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:49.980]   How did you--
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:50.820]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:51.900]   But I wanted to share that.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.260]   I took a picture of it with my regular phone.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.300]   But before I did that--
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.300]   Yes, how did you say a picture?
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:58.980]   I was really, really careful to make sure--
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.060]   Nobody's in there.
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.380]   If somebody's standing at the urinal,
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.060]   you do not take that picture.
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.340]   I'm not saying you would take a picture then.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.540]   And I'm not saying that just because I have a camera with you.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.180]   But yes, we can't tell with glass.
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.060]   Let me just say it's somebody to do--
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:11.620]   Yes, you can.
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.980]   I can tell you're taking a picture?
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.100]   OK, glass.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.700]   No, no, but you don't have to do OK, glass.
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:18.900]   You can wink.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.540]   No, no, no.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.900]   You can't--
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.580]   You can go like this and wink.
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.340]   You can--
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:27.140]   I think you're playing in a technopatic.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.500]   And so there was no justification
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.340]   for the treatment of this guy in this theater
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.660]   for wearing his glasses that happened to have a camera attached
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.500]   that he was not using.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.740]   No, the right thing for the theater to do
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.980]   was to say, I'm sorry, you can't wear your glass into the theater.
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.780]   No, the right thing to do is to say, remember, sir,
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.100]   please don't use that camera.
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.620]   Oh, yeah, that'll work.
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:50.260]   Once again, what faith you have in mankind?
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.660]   I mean, the reality is if he had actually been recording
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.020]   the movie with glass, it would have been at the worst
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.740]   recording if he had been had a giant camcorder on his shoulder
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:58.860]   because he wouldn't have had a--
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.300]   That doesn't stop people from doing it and selling it.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:06.660]   Yeah, but then he also would have had 45 minutes of the movie.
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.580]   OK, I mean--
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:12.060]   It's just-- it can't do two hours of video.
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.100]   So that's like saying--
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.540]   Well, you know, you know, you know,
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.540]   I have this camera phone and I'm holding it like this,
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:19.100]   but you don't have to worry because it only can record,
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.900]   you know, 720p.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.180]   I mean, I don't think that that's really--
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.580]   Yeah, but I think part of the issue--
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:30.180]   again, this is a precursor of what's going to come.
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.340]   I think we are going to have glasses that have recording
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.380]   devices because they make a lot of sense.
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.860]   So the issue is not going to go away,
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:40.660]   and it's going to become even more complicated because, yeah,
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.260]   if you are having glasses where everything can fit into an
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.220]   ordinary frame, those would be your main glasses.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.620]   The reason I don't wear glasses when I go to the movie theater,
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.700]   by the way, is because, well, aside from the fact
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.580]   I don't need them, I like to wear my regular glasses
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.540]   to let me see you at distance, right?
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:00.380]   So I'm not going to double stack them or whatever.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.700]   I don't need them for most things.
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.300]   But, you know, if I had a pair of glasses,
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.700]   or especially around here, sunglasses--
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.860]   I'm desperate for a pair of sunglasses--
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:13.100]   I use glass here in Newport as my sunglasses.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.940]   You know, if I'm going out on the paddleboard or something
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.780]   like that, the sunglasses are great.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.020]   I can take pictures of stuff, and I don't really give it a
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.100]   second thought because, you know, there's a great use case.
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.140]   And so when they become just this ordinary device that
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:25.340]   you're wearing, it's going to be everywhere.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.700]   And so then, you know, I don't know what you're going to do.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.660]   At that point, do you stop everybody who walks into
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.260]   theater because of the attention?
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:35.220]   I'm telling you, this is a rerun of 1890 and the
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.060]   Co-estining--
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.580]   You're not allowed to carry a camcorder into a theater, either.
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.540]   I mean, I don't think that that's so--
[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:42.220]   that's an unreasonable restriction.
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.700]   Admittedly, they overreacted in what they did was wrong.
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.700]   But I think--
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.500]   So to go both ways and think to what--
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.380]   I think to what Chef is saying, when you eventually get to
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.500]   everybody has these recording devices, you get to the point
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.940]   where people start to relax about them and freak out.
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:56.700]   Yes.
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.940]   And we can have more norms.
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:01.660]   You'll probably become pretty clear that a movie recorded
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:05.460]   from someone's head is not going to be as great, you know,
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.780]   even as things improve.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:07.340]   But I think--
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:11.940]   Do you think that we have a legal right to wear glass?
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:12.940]   Yes.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.420]   Oh, she--
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.980]   A legal right to wear glass.
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:19.620]   I have a legal right to carry around a pencil and paper.
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.780]   When Glenn Greenwald's husband was prevented from writing
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.500]   down the name of the agents interrogating him, at the
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.340]   border of the UK, I was offended by that, that you couldn't
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.140]   record something by--
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:36.340]   What if I go in a theater with a go-prote step trap to my chest?
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.340]   Well, no, I mean--
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:37.860]   You look like a girl.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.980]   A restaurant that says, like, shirts and shoes, please.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.460]   You know, you can't--
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.780]   That's a different thing.
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.020]   I mean, I think if a bar said--
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.180]   I know you have to go pro to see the movie.
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.900]   And that's where the private business has--
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:53.140]   So do you have a legal right to go into a private business
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.060]   wearing glass?
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:54.900]   Probably not.
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.300]   The theater has every right to say, you may not wear glass
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:57.940]   in this theater.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.300]   Unless you can prove some, maybe there's
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.780]   like an American--
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:01.580]   The handicap.
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:02.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.060]   Right, ADA says I can wear glass in this theater.
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.060]   Yeah, actually, I had the right to do it.
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.740]   But in most cases, no, a private business probably could
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.380]   prevent you to do it.
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.780]   Do you have the right to be detained
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.100]   because you're wearing something by law or so
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.140]   without being arrested?
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.380]   Well, no, but that's recent law that says you cannot record
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:18.820]   a movie.
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.980]   And that is a law.
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.900]   I mean, I think they overreacted,
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.220]   but they have the right to do that.
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:28.020]   They did not act illegally.
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.500]   Otherwise, there would be a lawsuit going on right now.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.300]   They did not act illegally.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.740]   I'm about to ask my Dvorak moment, Masc.
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.340]   Did nothing happen this week?
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.100]   We're moving on.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.420]   Let's see, in Google land, there is some big news.
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.940]   Europe has said, you have the right
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:44.100]   to be forgotten.
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.780]   The European Court said Google must
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.700]   edit sensitive search results.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:56.540]   People can ask Google to take stuff off of their index.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:01.700]   There are 180 similar cases right now in Spain.
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.700]   This is a very popular thing.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.860]   In fact, I think it was the EU's privacy czar who
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:08.940]   proposed this.
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:09.460]   For proposed, yes.
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.500]   Nelly Crows.
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.140]   Well, actually, it was the other one.
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.700]   It's the other one.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.500]   So first of all, as you understand,
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.980]   you are our reporter from Europe.
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.620]   You're a terrorist.
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:21.420]   You've been there, right?
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:21.940]   I'm closer.
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.420]   Yeah.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:22.980]   You've been closer.
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:23.780]   She's genius closer than I am.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.380]   She's about two miles east.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.620]   What is the right to be forgotten?
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:31.260]   The argument is that when something bad about you is online,
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.340]   you should have the right to get rid of this.
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.020]   But clearly, clearly, that has an impact
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.780]   on the other party's free speech.
[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.380]   Well, what you could do is go to the place where it is.
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.260]   Oh, I guess if you were--
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.660]   I don't know, there are pictures of you in an orgy
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:47.380]   that were distributed widely.
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:51.180]   Or the only place you could get it turned off is Google.
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.140]   Well, the original site.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:54.980]   But if it's like 100 sites--
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:57.060]   If it's spread all over, then you can probably
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.980]   cut access to it, but it's still on those sites.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:00.540]   Google's defense would be, I imagine,
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:01.660]   well, we're merely--
[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.820]   Google Search Analytics merely indexes the state
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.100]   of the internet as it is.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.340]   But the argument that comes back then is, well,
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.620]   what's your algorithm?
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:12.780]   And they always risk this danger of the demand
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.900]   to reveal the algorithm.
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.420]   And how did that end up on top?
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.140]   But this is a really--
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.860]   Can't Google defend that by saying, well, we have PageRank,
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:22.900]   and this is how we use it.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:23.580]   But here's the problem.
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.940]   They don't have a First Amendment.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.780]   There's no right to free speech in Europe.
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:29.500]   Well, right.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.340]   There's not the same guarantee in the same kind
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.340]   of absolute way.
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:34.380]   At CUNY on Monday, we gave an award
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.460]   to Alan Rusperger, the editor of The Guardian,
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:39.580]   and Floyd Abrams of the New York Times, who defended the New
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.060]   York Times, and the Pentagon Papers, please.
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.100]   Case both spoke.
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.940]   And Alan keeps on going on about the need for a First Amendment
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:46.540]   and the rest of the world.
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.060]   We're the only ones who have one.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.700]   It seems like an absolute right to speech.
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.660]   Even more, in my opinion, seems to reflect
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.060]   a misunderstanding of technology.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:55.580]   Wow.
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.260]   A deep misunderstanding of technology.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.660]   I think the right to be forgotten is a wonderful thing.
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:00.820]   And I wish it existed.
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:02.700]   But it doesn't, because you're not
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.820]   eliminating these websites at all.
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.060]   Well, but it's worse than that there,
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.620]   because what you're really saying
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:10.300]   is that you're going to control knowledge.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.260]   It's a men in black pen moment, right?
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:13.540]   And you forget.
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.300]   So you're telling the world to forget something.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.740]   The world already knows.
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.460]   That is offensive to the notion of knowledge.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:23.860]   That says that we're trying to control knowledge,
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.020]   it's mind control, it's propaganda, it's tyranny.
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.380]   All these things leave that.
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.780]   You would think if anyone in the world
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.540]   has learned this lesson, it's your--
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:33.620]   all right, but let me put a counter example.
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:37.780]   So you're a person who doesn't have a lot of a presence
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:40.660]   on the internet, doesn't participate in the internet.
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:42.180]   It's not part of your life.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.020]   You don't have a Facebook page or a Twitter page.
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:47.300]   You, in fact, never put anything online attached to your name.
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.260]   But somebody, a bad person, decides
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.540]   to write something bad about you.
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.580]   That bad person has a popular website or whatever.
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.540]   And that bad thing gets spread everywhere.
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.900]   That is the entire Google search result for your name
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.060]   is that bad stuff.
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.380]   May even be a lie, may be in libel.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.220]   What do you do then?
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.620]   Well, we have a cure for that.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.420]   That's libel.
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.260]   It's libel law.
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:11.580]   We already have that legal mechanism.
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:14.220]   And in fact, in the UK, it's so wacky people
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.980]   around the world go to sue on libel there.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.180]   So there's plenty of mechanisms to say something
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:19.900]   is set up by you.
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:23.260]   But the other case is, what if you got arrested for drunk
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.420]   driving 10 years ago, and that's online somewhere?
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:27.220]   And you say, well, really, it's been 10 years.
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.140]   Can't you just forget?
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:28.500]   Right.
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:29.700]   But it's public record.
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:31.900]   Not in the internet, you can't.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.740]   Right.
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.380]   And I think that blaming Google is what's really puzzling.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:37.900]   Well, that's the anti-tech part.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:41.020]   That's the lunite moment here.
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:42.660]   Because this is just an index of what
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:43.820]   already exists on the net.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.580]   And they're saying, well, since we can't delete what
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.020]   already exists, what if we just control your ability
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.220]   to find it?
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:52.780]   But that's not Google's fault?
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:53.820]   No, it's not at all.
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.620]   And again, I still want to come back
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.420]   to this notion of free speech.
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.260]   Because in any transaction of information,
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.580]   there are two parties.
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.740]   And if you say something bad about me, and I go on and say,
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:05.780]   well, I just didn't like that.
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:07.780]   Or in the words of this, it's irrelevant.
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:08.940]   And I make Google take it down.
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.020]   And you want to-- you have the right to be able to say, no,
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:11.300]   no, no.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.820]   What I call Jarvis a jerk is because he is a jerk.
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:14.820]   It's because I mean it.
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.860]   And I have a right to call him a jerk.
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:20.100]   And now that right has been impinged.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.300]   So the ruling, which was in Luxembourg,
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.220]   because it's the European Union Court of Justice,
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.580]   was in a case where a Spanish man complained
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.140]   to the Spanish Data Protection Agency.
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:31.900]   It's interesting that you have such a group.
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:32.900]   It's a fun group, yeah.
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.740]   That an auction-- this is the same country that brought you
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.940]   the inquisition, just in case you were.
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:41.700]   That an auction notice of his repossessed home showing up
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:46.620]   on Google, that infringed his privacy.
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:51.940]   Now, the company-- well, this is a quote from the judges.
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.300]   "If following a search made on the basis of a person's name,
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.900]   the list of results displays a link to a web page, which
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.220]   contains information on the person in question,
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:05.460]   that data subject may approach the operator directly
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:07.820]   and where the operator does not grant his request
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.900]   to bring the matter before the competent authorities in order
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.060]   to obtain under certain circumstances.
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.860]   The removal of that link from the list of results,
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.860]   the judge is conflating the listing
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:23.180]   of the repossession, which is presumably not just--
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:25.540]   Google's pointing to a page somewhere.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.700]   But he's conflating that with the Google search results
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.540]   saying that Google is, in fact, presenting that information.
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.740]   It had this idea that Google is the internet.
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:35.860]   And Google-- this is what Eric Schmidt always says,
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.300]   because Google is the largest entity on the internet,
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.940]   anything people don't like about the internet,
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.220]   they're going to go after Google for.
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:43.300]   This is the biggest issue.
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:46.060]   The judges said an internet search engine operator
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:47.900]   is responsible for the processing
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.340]   that it carries out of personal data, which
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.780]   appear on web pages, published by third parties.
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.980]   That is so important.
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:57.300]   Well, what if Google took out any extract that
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:00.860]   said what that content was, but merely a link to the page?
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:02.460]   Well, look at it from Google's perspective.
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:05.780]   Now, they have to become the court of what's right and wrong.
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:07.980]   So I come to you and I say, you should take down
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:08.780]   that foreclosure notice.
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.980]   And then Google says, well, were you foreclosed?
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.100]   Was it true?
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:12.940]   Is this libelous?
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:13.980]   Is this wrong?
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:18.100]   Google can't be the court of hurt feelings.
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.020]   Can you hear what it says?
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:21.060]   It's not even practical.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.740]   Well, this is hard.
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.820]   I'm going to try and take it from the other perspective.
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:26.580]   I mean, I think in these situations,
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.100]   I try not to think about it necessarily
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.740]   from the perspective of Google, but maybe
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:33.420]   from the perspective of someone who has a genuine issue.
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:34.420]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:37.620]   What if when Etta grows up, she doesn't like the things
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:38.940]   that I wrote about her, the pictures
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.220]   that I published of her when she was a child,
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.420]   she wants to be defined other than how
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:46.100]   I defined her or worse.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.700]   You have those sites where like,
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.060]   ex-boyfriends publish, you know,
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:52.180]   private photos of their girlfriends.
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:54.100]   That's a better example because that's so
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.500]   obviously harmful.
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.300]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:49:00.020]   I mean, of course, I don't think that Google can decide
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:03.500]   what's right and wrong and decide what's fact and what's not.
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:05.700]   But the truth is, I mean, it is kind of privacy
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:06.420]   through obscurity.
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:08.740]   If it's not listed in the first page of your Google search
[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:11.100]   results or the first few pages, it might as well not
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:13.540]   exist, people can't find it.
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:16.020]   Or if someone's been docked and they're, you know,
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.420]   a address in Social Security number has been, you know,
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:20.140]   published somewhere for some reason.
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.660]   I just, it feels like there are so many instances
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:27.660]   where an individual who can't practically reach out
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:31.540]   to all these third party websites and ask them to remove,
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:34.900]   you know, private and embarrassing, potentially harmful
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.780]   information, like doesn't have any recourse.
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:40.180]   So I'm trying to figure out, you know,
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:45.180]   I'm reaching back into my, in my two elderly memory right now.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:49.900]   But wasn't there a feature on some search engine or some
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:54.300]   such somewhere once that allowed you to annotate things
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:56.580]   and say that there was a response, there was more of a
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:58.820]   right to response than a right to erase.
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:00.740]   Remember that?
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:03.620]   There should be a right to put, do anything to the Google
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:04.460]   index.
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:06.420]   Well, I mean, like, like trackbacks, that kind of thing.
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:07.260]   No, it wasn't that.
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.380]   It was, it was, it was, there was some kind of iconic
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.740]   chat room and like crazy, wasn't there a moment
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:14.060]   where there was an effort to be able to add
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:16.580]   onto church results and church results?
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:20.300]   I guess my question is, is the solution for an individual
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.900]   what Schmidt suggested that we'd have to change our name?
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.540]   If we wanted to invent ourselves.
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:27.980]   No, I know it was a joke, but like, but if I'm an individual
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.060]   who has a history of, you know, of, of, you know,
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:33.620]   whatever, well documented online, I'm trying to reinvent
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:34.860]   myself and trying to be a better person.
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.460]   I'm trying to be a different person.
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:38.140]   And I, and I can't get that information out.
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:38.980]   I mean, do it.
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:41.220]   So the solution is a more tolerant society.
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.340]   The solution, sorry, it's this big.
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.260]   The solution is a more tolerant society that
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.620]   recognizes that we all do things that we were mistakes.
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:50.740]   We all do things that were ashamed of at some point.
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:53.540]   We all learn lessons and learn life as we go on in our one
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:54.620]   attempt at it.
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:57.060]   And this idea that off with your head, if you do one thing
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:59.380]   wrong at one point, or if somebody doesn't like that you're
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:04.180]   gay, that's the larger issue is tolerance.
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:07.900]   We can't solve that through trying to sanitize Google of
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.700]   things some people don't like or for even so fine.
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:14.700]   Gina, take Google out of it and now just say the internet.
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:15.700]   Okay.
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:18.820]   So now say that you said something about me that I didn't
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:19.820]   like at some point.
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:23.740]   I said something stupid like I like wave.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:27.220]   And as a technology genius on this show, Gina.
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:29.380]   Which is I would never mention that book again.
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:29.900]   Yeah.
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:36.860]   So just because I don't like it, can you come to me and say
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:40.300]   that you have to take down what I don't like?
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.780]   I mean, so there's the internet and there's most people's
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:43.700]   lens into the internet.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.980]   I think Google search results are most people's lens in the
[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:46.340]   internet.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.380]   You know, does the book, if you can't find the book in the
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:53.500]   library, you know, if it's not in the, you know, Oregon, in the
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:55.940]   dude decimal system, if it's not in the catalogs, like no, no
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:56.900]   one can find it.
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.300]   Sure, it exists.
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:02.140]   But, but it's, you know, look, the reality is that employers
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:05.980]   and clients and mothers and siblings, all Google people,
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:06.480]   right?
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.020]   That's what you do.
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.740]   You Google people to find out something about them.
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:12.460]   And there might be a time when, you know, you, I mean, I get it.
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:13.020]   I get it.
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:13.820]   It's a tough issue.
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.140]   I just--
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.700]   Well, the next step of this is that if Google can be forced
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.980]   to take it down, then any and every site, including us, will
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:22.580]   be forced to take things down.
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:24.860]   And we'll be held liable in Europe.
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.940]   If we say something, if I say something, you know,
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:30.660]   Hairschmitt is a dork.
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:33.700]   And now, Hairschmitt can go to the EU court and say, you
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:35.820]   must take that down, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:37.220]   I said, no, he's a dork.
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.900]   And this just proved it because he went to the court to ask
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:39.540]   me to take it down.
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.500]   No.
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:41.140]   I don't like this.
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:41.940]   It is irrelevant to me.
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:42.660]   You must take it down.
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:44.860]   That impinges upon my speech.
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.860]   I just can't get past that.
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:49.460]   Well, what if something's verifiably untrue?
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:53.260]   Someone says something verifiably untrue about Leo, you know,
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:53.700]   but overall--
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.340]   Well, it happens all the time.
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:56.660]   It happens all the time, right?
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:57.300]   So I'm just--
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:59.820]   I mean, I understand both sides.
[00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:02.460]   But I think that it's like saying, well, let's just not
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:05.540]   have an internet because then this
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.060]   is a problem.
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:10.580]   And I think that unfortunately, punishing Google for this
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:13.300]   is, first of all, is ineffective.
[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.820]   It seems misdirected.
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.340]   I understand what you're saying, Gina,
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:18.500]   that it's the card catalog.
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:21.220]   And if you take the book out of the card catalog,
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.260]   it doesn't matter if it's in the stacks.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:25.460]   But even if you look at things like the Knowledge Graph,
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:28.220]   I mean, Google has taken upon itself the idea
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:29.860]   that it's this repository of facts
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:32.300]   that you can ask it questions and it will give you answers.
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.700]   What if something is the wrong answer?
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.060]   If something is untrue, I mean, do they
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.940]   become the arbiter of truth at something like that?
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:38.300]   Truth is a very hard statement.
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.620]   And that's a problem is that this puts them in the position
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:41.340]   to do that, right?
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.460]   They now have to be a judge.
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:46.140]   I mean, this is a tough one.
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:46.940]   I don't know what the answer is.
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:47.860]   It's tough.
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:50.540]   And I actually tend to agree with both of you.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.500]   I'm just trying to--
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:56.460]   I like to take the perspective of the person who's less empowered.
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.900]   I think this is less about someone calling someone a name
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:01.300]   and more about someone who's in position
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.740]   where information about them, which is either untrue
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.140]   or which is truly private or should be private.
[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:07.940]   You know.
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:09.980]   But that's one of the years I think, Gina,
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:13.820]   is that the horses out of the barn, the cat out of the bag,
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:17.620]   we're in a world now where knowledge passes around quickly,
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.500]   information passes around quickly.
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:21.900]   And all in all, I want that.
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.980]   And it comes with a price.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:27.820]   So we also have to teach people to check things first.
[00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:29.340]   We have to teach people to--
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:32.340]   that they do have to go online and say something in response.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:36.060]   We have to recognize that people make mistakes early in life.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:38.140]   These are new realities.
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:43.100]   And trying to hold back the technology in going to work.
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:46.060]   And so we have to deal with that reality, I think.
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:51.340]   And meanwhile, you have the freedom to annoy in New York.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:51.900]   Did you have that?
[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:53.020]   Yeah, you got a problem with that.
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:55.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:56.540]   Ah, the right to be forgotten.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:59.660]   I have a feeling we won't get to forget that issue too
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.220]   quickly in 2015.
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:05.020]   In fact, I feel like we've just opened up a can of worms here.
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:07.740]   Keep watching this week in Google for our analysis.
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:09.860]   Our show today brought to you by good friends
[00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:11.580]   at personal capital.
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.860]   This is a great time of you to start thinking about your future.
[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:17.900]   In fact, if you've made a resolution for 2015,
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:21.420]   exercise more, eat better, I hope one of those resolutions
[00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:23.940]   is to make sure that the money you put away
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:26.140]   for your retirement, for your future,
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:30.140]   is being responsibly cared for.
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:32.580]   It's kind of up to us to take care of ourselves
[00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:33.540]   in our old age.
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.340]   That's why I suggest you sign up for personal capital.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:38.980]   It's free, it's easy, and it'll give you
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:42.820]   a dashboard that shows you exactly how your money's doing.
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:45.620]   Take all your accounts, your mortgage, your checking,
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:48.420]   your savings, all your assets, and most importantly,
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:49.420]   your investments.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:51.380]   You put them into personal capital.com,
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.060]   and now you're going to get a single page in your desktop,
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.540]   your laptop, your tablet, even your phone.
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:58.660]   That'll show you exactly how you're doing.
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:00.380]   They even have an Android Wear app,
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:02.660]   which means you're going to get alerts and updates
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:04.940]   if things start happening to your investments.
[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:06.420]   Now, a few things you'll learn from this,
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.420]   and it certainly helps you with budgeting,
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:09.700]   planning for the future.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:11.340]   But you'll also find out, for instance,
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:13.100]   if you're paying too much in fees,
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.300]   if you're kind of frittering away that money,
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:18.340]   you worked so hard to earn, and you stowed away
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:20.380]   in your savings or investments accounts.
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:22.180]   If it's getting kind of dwindling away
[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:24.740]   because of paying too much in fees, that's not good.
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:26.940]   And you may not even know it, personal capital,
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:28.260]   will give you some awareness on this.
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:30.860]   They can also help you rebalance your investments
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:32.700]   for your goals for the future.
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.860]   Make sure everybody's got unique needs.
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:37.660]   Make sure your needs are being met.
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.060]   Personal capital, help you do it.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:41.180]   It's best of all, it's free and it's easy,
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:42.220]   and you could sign up right now.
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:45.100]   Make this your New Year's resolution for 2015.
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:48.860]   Go to personal capital.com/twig.
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:51.300]   I did, I use it every day.
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.820]   Even if you don't move your money around a lot,
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.780]   which I don't, it gives you a great sense
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:00.220]   of well-being to know that you're doing the job right,
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.260]   your paying attention, and then your money
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:04.420]   is growing inappropriately.
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.540]   It's well worth it.
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:06.380]   And again, it's free.
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:09.900]   Personal capital.com/twig.
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.740]   Please do me a favor for 2015.
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.820]   Set it up, try it, do it.
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:17.620]   You will thank me later, maybe when you retire.
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:18.860]   Now, let's get back to work.
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:21.340]   This is a very hot topic for us.
[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.580]   It has been all year long.
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:26.260]   It's the notion that while the internet brings us
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:29.180]   so many wonderful benefits, it also
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:34.540]   can give rise to some unhealthy and undesirable behavior.
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:37.980]   I'm talking about trolls watch.
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.420]   What is a troll?
[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:41.260]   All right, I love that question because when I've
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:43.140]   been writing about trolling this week--
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:45.260]   and by the way, I have to say that the reason I wrote that
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:47.620]   column, the reason I've been writing about trolls
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.980]   is because of last week's this week in Google
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:52.380]   got me thinking about it and that sort of thing.
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:54.580]   So that was a really great conversation last week.
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:57.300]   But a lot of people don't know what a troll is.
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:01.300]   And essentially, people think that somebody who sort of
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:05.060]   pastors somebody or is a troll, which I don't believe it is,
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:09.020]   or somebody who's won a troll--
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:11.460]   got a big argument with them on Google+,
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:13.340]   they were saying a troll is anybody who
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:15.540]   wants to be an influencer.
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:16.620]   And that's absolutely not true.
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:19.180]   To me-- and let's see if you guys agree or disagree
[00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:24.420]   with this definition-- a troll is somebody who
[00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:29.540]   liberally creates emotions in the minds of other people
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.220]   that in a conversation to either hijack the conversation
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:35.260]   and get attention on themselves, or to get a sort of
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:39.100]   sociopath kind of thrill out of upsetting and disrupting
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:40.820]   a constructive conversation.
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.940]   That's my definition of what a troll is.
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:46.820]   And I think people use the word troll very broadly
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:47.780]   and unnecessarily.
[00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:50.420]   I think the trolling phenomenon is something very specific
[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:51.940]   and very real.
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:53.340]   Mike, I think that's good.
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:56.100]   So I just put a link through a piece I wrote on Medium,
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:59:01.180]   and Leo, am I allowed to spell out a whole word?
[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:02.340]   Yes.
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:03.220]   OK.
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.660]   So because it's a book title.
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:06.540]   So an asshole's a theory, which by the way,
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.820]   I assigned in a curriculum for our new degree.
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.340]   It was one of my favorite moments
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:12.900]   was to assign that book.
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:18.260]   He, Aaron James, defines that person.
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:23.340]   And he talks about the motive.
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.100]   So then what I did was that I argued
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.140]   what the distinguishes a troll from a mere asshole.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:30.020]   And I believe it's that he, and as I pointed out,
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:33.300]   it's usually men, one has a target.
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:36.780]   Two seeks to get a response, a rise out of the target.
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:39.660]   And three believes he is acting out of some ordained moral
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:43.860]   principle to destroy or to bring down his target.
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:44.340]   OK.
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:45.500]   That's my definition of a troll.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:50.020]   I'm going to read one from 1999 from alt.troll.
[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:54.180]   This has been going on for so long on Usenet
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:57.060]   that they actually have alt.troll.
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.980]   And this is a definition.
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:00.660]   What is trolling?
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.940]   The use of the word trolling comes from the fishing technique
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.580]   where a baited hook--
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.380]   this actually might be useful to understanding this--
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.740]   is dragged through the water in attempts
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.340]   to attract a catch of fish.
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:15.220]   Usenet trolling is the act of posting an article or troll
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.340]   to Usenet News Group with the intention
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.820]   of attracting the native inhabitants
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:23.180]   and provoking an emotional response, at which point
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:25.260]   they're caught as a fish would be caught.
[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:28.420]   The phrase was originally coined as trolling for flames.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.540]   That's the historic origination.
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:34.340]   The poster's intention was to incite a flame war, which I think
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:37.540]   is actually really more to the point.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.740]   I don't want to impute an intent on a troll,
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:43.820]   except that they get off in some way
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.980]   on the resulting carnage.
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:47.700]   They've made a difference.
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:50.020]   And this, by the way, the kind of discussion we're having
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:52.220]   is exactly what a troll won.
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.900]   So here's the definition of troll from alt.troll.
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.260]   It's convenient that the world troll
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.620]   has multiple meanings aside from the fishing example above.
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:01.660]   Troll's also the name, obviously, of a mythical creature,
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.820]   generally thought of as ugly, fat, cantankerous,
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:06.580]   work-covered, smelly, and completely unlikable.
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.820]   That's a troll.
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.260]   Since trolling is thought of as a detestable and unsavory
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.980]   activity performed by loathsome contemptible hooligans,
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.340]   I think that's another good way.
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.540]   I like sociopaths.
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.860]   The name troll fits them quite well.
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:19.820]   They're tool troll species.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.700]   Those with overactive minds constantly seek out
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.980]   new sources of mental stimuli.
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:26.500]   I say they want negative attention.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.900]   I would even go further and say that there are some trolls
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.820]   who don't know that they're trolls.
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.780]   Oh, many trolls do not know that.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.900]   And then there are those who are permanently disgruntled
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.220]   or physically short-changed in some way
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.220]   and seek out ways to compensate for their shortcomings
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.100]   through vicious personal attacks against others
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.220]   in order to achieve a mental erection.
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:47.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:48.420]   Wow.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:49.820]   That was-- I was going to say there was a war.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.540]   It's not because the most distinct I've heard.
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:54.340]   '90s was a crazy time, man.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.020]   Remember--
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:56.540]   This is not new to the internet.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:00.140]   These kinds of flame wars and trolling started with UsNet.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.500]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:04.500]   Well, I remember we talked about a study a couple months ago
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:09.700]   here, and I put up the link on the rundown chat from February.
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:12.060]   In which the most succinct definition of a troll
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.700]   you can possibly find is a sadist.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:15.700]   Right.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.940]   It came down to that.
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:20.620]   That ultimately they were sadists.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:25.460]   Which to which they got pleasure out of causing others pain.
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:28.020]   And if you look at what happened to Zelda Williams,
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.460]   that's precisely what happened.
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.220]   But precisely what happened?
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.700]   It's somebody got pleasure out of knowing
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:36.620]   that they were causing extreme pain.
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:39.180]   Their only interest in her was that she was vulnerable.
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:39.740]   Right.
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.420]   To having pain inflicted upon her.
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:42.380]   Right.
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.700]   Yes.
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.020]   It's a really interesting problem.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:48.660]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:54.780]   Google+, you're answer to everything is Google+, works for me.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.180]   It is.
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:57.820]   And it peaks on me.
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:02.700]   But again, I think Jeff is so prolific on Twitter,
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:04.780]   and yet where is the trolling on Google+,
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.980]   so Jeff has these amazing conversations of Google+.
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:08.420]   There's plenty of trolling on Google+.
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:09.420]   Yeah, but it doesn't.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:10.420]   It's not a factor.
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.420]   But you can get rid of it.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.460]   But the people who he's interacting with
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.020]   are not seeing that trolling.
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:16.020]   That's the difference.
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:18.500]   And Mike's saying another point is that there are platforms
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.420]   where you don't bother.
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:21.940]   That was Mike's real point of the problem.
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:23.100]   I have a different experience.
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.660]   I had a troll on Google+, deleted and blocked.
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:29.820]   The person was able to make new accounts, to repost,
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.660]   to get others to repost.
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:34.700]   It turns out even if you delete and block a post,
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.220]   the link is a permalink.
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.020]   So he was able to recover that.
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:41.660]   If you're persistent, you probably can.
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:43.780]   Now, whether they get any traction is another matter,
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:44.740]   I think you're right.
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:47.020]   It's difficult to get traction on Google+.
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:50.700]   If someone on Google+ writes about you, Leo, not replies,
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.580]   but writes about you, the way that someone might--
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.580]   I can't control that.
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.580]   I'm on Twitter, I might mention you.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:55.860]   You can't control that, right?
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:57.700]   I mean, we're back to the same.
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:00.100]   I mean, the main difference between Google+ and Twitter,
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.260]   and correct me if I'm wrong, is that you can delete comments
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.380]   on your posts.
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:05.820]   That's what Mike's talking about.
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:08.180]   There are three or four differences.
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:11.180]   So one of them is you can delete comments, in which case
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.380]   if they check, they can see that the comment was deleted.
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:16.060]   You can flag comments, in which case the troll thinks
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.620]   that their message is still there, but nobody can see it.
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:19.740]   Oh, I like that.
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:22.460]   And they have blocking, and they have reporting.
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:26.220]   And Google tends to be more responsive to reporting
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:28.540]   than Twitter tends to be if you're not famous,
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.460]   or a celebrity, or if it's not something big in the news.
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.460]   And here's another one that I never
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.460]   hear anybody talking about.
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:37.180]   If I-- let's say, for example, that Jeff Jarvis is not
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:41.300]   following me, and I have a troll who's targeting me on Twitter.
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.420]   And I want to contact Jeff, but he's not following me.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:45.060]   So I send a public Twitter message.
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:47.500]   That's the only way for me to reach Jeff on Twitter.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.460]   The trolls can see that I'm interacting with Jeff,
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:52.660]   and then they can go after Jeff, pretend to be me,
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.540]   do all kinds of trouble like that on Google+.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:55.620]   It just happened today.
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:56.140]   It happened.
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:56.420]   It happened today.
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:59.460]   I got five Mike Delgan trolls coming after me this afternoon.
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.340]   Really?
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:00.980]   Yeah, me too.
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:01.500]   I did.
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:02.300]   Yeah.
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:02.820]   I did.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:03.300]   Wow.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:04.140]   I blocked them all.
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:05.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:05.660]   So--
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:07.260]   By the way, I saw the same person.
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:08.740]   I'll point that out.
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:09.780]   It's one person.
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.940]   But on Google+, you can contact anyone, including a stranger,
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:16.380]   and totally out of the eye of trolls.
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.580]   You simply @ mention them.
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.900]   They get the private message, and it's
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.380]   a great way to contact people.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.460]   It's very-- unless, of course, they've set it up
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:26.940]   so that you can't be contacted.
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.580]   So that's yet another way to do it.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:33.900]   But the sum total of all those things on Google+,
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:39.700]   lends itself to you cultivating a community with zero trolling
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:42.140]   in that community, in your community.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:45.100]   We are creating a society online.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.860]   And we're creating a couple things at once.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.380]   Code is law, says Larry Lessig.
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:54.740]   And the code of Google of Twitter is its law.
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:56.460]   The code of Google+ is its law.
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:58.220]   We're also creating norms.
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:00.740]   And my argument about this stuff is that every time you
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:02.500]   egg on a troll, you are trolling.
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.580]   You are an accessory to the crime.
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:05.620]   You are just as bad.
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:06.780]   You say, fight, fight.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:07.500]   You're just as bad.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:11.140]   It's been our experience that the best thing to do is just
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:12.580]   go give them nothing.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.020]   I know.
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:15.300]   But then in essence, the trolls have won.
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:16.180]   The trolls have won.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:19.860]   Because everybody said, don't go out for this guy.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:20.780]   Don't do anything.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:24.740]   No, in essence, then he keeps going and going and going.
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:27.940]   And you've created a strike stand effect here, though, Jeff.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:30.100]   Well, I understood that.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:30.740]   I understood that.
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:35.340]   But I think that norms argument can only be taken so far.
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:38.220]   I mean, look at the Louis C.K. routine where he talks about
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:41.020]   what a horrible person he is when he's driving compared to
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:42.540]   when he's in an elevator.
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:46.540]   The situation will always, always--
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.980]   he's talking about how he's screaming like horrible things
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:49.820]   that people when he's driving.
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:52.260]   But when you're standing right next to somebody, you'd never do
[01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:52.860]   that.
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.020]   I think that would be a lot of people.
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:55.380]   We've got to go with those responsibilities.
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:56.580]   We both have responsibilities.
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:58.540]   And I don't think it's sufficient.
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:00.820]   So you're right, Mike.
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:04.980]   The code creates an environment that brings certain
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:07.380]   behaviors and discourages others.
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:09.660]   But then we within that environment can choose to
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:11.700]   behave well or badly.
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:15.500]   And so what I'm really asking here, and what you guys are
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:18.540]   trying to answer, and Gina is trying to answer here, is can
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:21.820]   we create a better society that we're building?
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.220]   Or do we give up?
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.700]   Or do we just say, well, the trolls are going to be there,
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:26.540]   and that's that.
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:29.020]   And people are going to be abused, and that's that.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:32.900]   Well, one thing we don't want for sure is internet community
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.180]   where there are no women participating because they
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:36.820]   can't participate safely.
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.380]   And that would be a horrific effect.
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.820]   No vulnerable people are--
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.980]   No vulnerable people of any kind.
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:42.500]   Yeah.
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:46.820]   And that's Zaneb's point about Ferguson and Twitter is the
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.500]   fact that it was open, the fact that it couldn't be
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.500]   controlled by an algorithm, or the fact that it couldn't be
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:54.140]   controlled by other people, is what let Ferguson trend up
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.620]   to the point they've got on media.
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:58.860]   So I'm fully recognizing the value of Twitter being open.
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:01.740]   And it's a question I'm not answering.
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:04.580]   Does that doom it to be--
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.700]   Is it just that as a social network?
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:08.260]   Is it doomed to be anti-social?
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:09.340]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:12.420]   By the way, from the definitions we've heard here,
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:15.140]   Upworthy could be considered a troll.
[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:19.060]   Most radio talk show hosts could be considered a troll.
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:21.660]   I mean, I would disagree with that.
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:23.660]   Is linkbaiting a form of trolling?
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:24.860]   No, I don't think it is.
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:27.780]   I don't think it is because the idea is to disrupt somebody
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:29.340]   else's conversation, not start--
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:30.820]   So it's more targeted and vicious.
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:32.780]   If you want to start your own annoying conversation--
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:34.340]   Look at me, look at me, look at me.
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:35.340]   Right.
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.860]   It's disruption.
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:39.700]   If you set up an entire radio station that's all about
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:42.260]   screaming political--
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.100]   Negative.
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.740]   Then you're not disrupting anything.
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.740]   You're creating your own cesspool.
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:50.220]   But if you go into somebody else's constructive
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:52.180]   conversation, you wreck it deliberately.
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.780]   That's trolling.
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:54.260]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:57.700]   Internet trolls really are horrible people.
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:01.860]   OK.
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:06.340]   Science says, new research conducted
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:09.180]   by Aaron Buckles of the University of Manitoba
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:12.020]   and two colleagues sought to investigate
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:14.180]   whether people who engage in internet trolling
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.420]   are characterized by personality traits that
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:20.660]   fall in the so-called dark tetrad.
[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:26.620]   Machiavellianism, psychopathy, sadism, and narcissism.
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:30.820]   Turns out, not so narcissistic, but really sadistic.
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:32.500]   What they did is they polled.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.100]   They surveyed these people and asked
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:39.300]   if they enjoyed what they enjoyed most when
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:44.780]   online comment sites, when on online comment sites,
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.420]   debating issues that are important to you,
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.140]   chatting with others, making new friends,
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.860]   trolling others, and other.
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:54.340]   And among the people who said they enjoyed trolling,
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:57.180]   it was a small number, only 5.6%.
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:06.780]   They really had personality traits for sadism, particularly.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:11.020]   And you can read the study.
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.260]   That's why you don't feed the trolls.
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:13.700]   You don't feed the trolls.
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:16.780]   Both trolls and sadists, they wrote,
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:20.180]   feel sadistic glee at the distress of others.
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:22.220]   Sadists just want to have fun.
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.220]   And the internet is their playground.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:29.020]   So--
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:33.260]   I'm working on some curricula, which I'll not talk about today,
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.380]   but talk about it another time, involved
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.020]   with engagement and journalism.
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:41.100]   And I had the great delight of including in the required reading,
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:45.820]   I may use this word, assholes a theory.
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:47.980]   That's a scholarly paper.
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:48.900]   That's book.
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.580]   It's a very good book.
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:51.540]   Yeah, that's a book.
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:54.060]   And what is the theory of assholes?
[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:55.420]   Just kind of why they do what they do.
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.180]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:58.260]   Well, this fits right in, I'm sure.
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:10:58.820]   It does.
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.340]   If you're going to deal with the public,
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:02.220]   you have to know this stuff now.
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:04.100]   Because the behaviors are--
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:07.700]   this is the conclusion of the conclusion of the study.
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.420]   Because these behaviors are intrinsically motivating
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:11.940]   for sadists.
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:15.100]   Comment moderators will likely have a difficult time
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:18.140]   curbing trolling with punishments.
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:19.740]   For example, banning users.
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:22.020]   Ultimately, the allure of trolling
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:25.020]   may be too strong for sadists who presumably
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:28.780]   have limited opportunities to express their sadistic interests
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:32.380]   in a socially desirable manner.
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:35.140]   I mean, a state isn't ever socially desirable.
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.500]   No, but you couldn't do it before.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:37.700]   It's more like socially acceptable.
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:40.740]   But you couldn't do in real life what you can do online.
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.180]   Now you can do it.
[01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:45.300]   And it's drawing them in.
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.700]   Machiavellianism, a little bit.
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.820]   Machiavellianism is the willingness
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:51.420]   to manipulate and deceive others.
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:54.620]   Narcissism, not so much egotism and self-obsession.
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:57.180]   Psychopathy, the lack of remorse and empathy.
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:59.300]   But the big one was the pleasure and the suffering of others.
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.500]   That's really the--
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.860]   That's why if you are suffering at the hand of a troll,
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.700]   you do not let the troll know that that's a--
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:06.200]   Right.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.780]   That's what they dig.
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:08.280]   Exactly.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.460]   That's what they're going for.
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.540]   It also says that if you--
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:18.040]   And I was the big defender of comments early on in newspapers.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.240]   And I've said this on the show before,
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.120]   where the first problem with comments is it's inherently
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.240]   insulting the public to say, we will allow you to comment
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.380]   afterward on with our work.
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:27.440]   We should be more collaborative.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.680]   But the other problem with comments
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.540]   is that it is just an open space.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:31.880]   It was true of forums before.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.880]   It was true of news net before.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:38.040]   An open space, trolls will go and find it
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.400]   and find the opportunity to have this behavior there.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.600]   And if it doesn't have a purpose,
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.000]   you're going to have this trouble.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.680]   See, and we've talked about this before as why I bring this up.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:49.960]   And I was of the opinion that these
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.000]   are people who are seeking negative attention
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.120]   because they'd receive this as children.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.400]   And they misinterpreted his love.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.920]   I was giving them a lot of benefit of that.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.640]   Now it turns out they're just cruel sons of bitches.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:07.640]   They're really-- no, no, they're nasty people.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:11.000]   In their study, they found that only about 41%
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.760]   of internet users--
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:15.160]   actually, 41% of internet users don't comment,
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.400]   don't engage online at all.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.600]   Of the remaining-- what is that?
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:24.120]   59%, only 5.6% are trolls.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.720]   So it's a small-- really, it's a few percentage points.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:27.800]   It's maybe 100.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:29.000]   It's all you need.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:29.520]   That's all you need.
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.080]   And we know this.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:30.960]   We know that part.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:34.880]   But boy, those 1% or 2% are really effective
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.560]   because they just push those buttons.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.040]   They have a test they call GATE, the Global Assessment
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.560]   of Internet Trolling.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:50.520]   And then they ask things on a scale of 1 to 5.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.080]   Do you agree or disagree with this statement?
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:55.800]   I have sent people to shock well websites for the lulls.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.920]   Anybody ever-- anybody in the chat room?
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.320]   Have you ever sent people to shock websites for the lulls?
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.080]   I'm not talking Rick rolling.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.920]   I'm talking Goatsy, that kind of thing.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.960]   I like to troll people--
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:07.600]   Well, somebody we know and respect
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.400]   once famously did that.
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.600]   Who's that?
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.640]   Aneel.
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:12.680]   Aneel?
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:13.920]   Aneel d'age?
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.400]   He wore a Goatsy t-shirt that appeared, I believe,
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.080]   in the New York Times.
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.760]   In the New York Times, yes, well--
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:20.760]   Right.
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:23.400]   And boy, that-- and typical for a Neil,
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.920]   anything he does, even that, turned
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.640]   into an intellectual discussion.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.400]   Oh, of course, of course.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.320]   Yes, but the New York Times photographed him with the t-shirt
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:35.120]   on not knowing what it was and published the photo.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.080]   I mean, that was the prank.
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:40.400]   It was a stylized-- it was not clear.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:40.920]   It was.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.120]   It was not the actual photo.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.000]   It was all there.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:43.480]   So then there was a--
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:46.960]   Well, some people typed in the URL.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:47.480]   Right?
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.120]   Boy, that caused a discussion at the time.
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:50.440]   Oh, my lord.
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:53.920]   First time I did a live tweet, we did it at the Apple Store.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.000]   And somebody sat down in the audience
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.240]   and hijacked the Wi-Fi router so that all web searches went
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:01.800]   to Goatsy.
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:02.280]   Oh, geez.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.000]   And it was really interesting.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.320]   And if you don't know what Goatsy is, just ask your mom.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:09.760]   But it was really interesting because you
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:13.440]   could see the waves of horror and disgust
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.640]   propagate through the audience as people--
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.320]   I should laugh.
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:18.800]   And then-- but we found him because he's
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.680]   sitting there chortling.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.160]   It was very easy to figure out who it was.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.960]   Well, I mean, aren't there whole blogs dedicated
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:29.120]   to taking a photograph of the moment of person's views?
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:29.480]   Right?
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:31.600]   I mean--
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.040]   I like to-- true or false.
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.080]   I like to troll people in forums or the comment sections
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:36.720]   of websites.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.280]   Trolls, it turns out, are pretty forth.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:38.280]   Right?
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:39.960]   They say, yeah, I'm a troll.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.040]   Yeah, I like to do that.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.720]   I enjoy griefing other players in multiplayer games.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:45.800]   Here's one.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:46.880]   This one.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.680]   This one.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.320]   The more beautiful and pure a thing is, the more satisfying
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.880]   it is to corrupt.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.240]   Think about weave.
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.520]   Or weave.
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.720]   Now, he's self-declared troll, right?
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:01.200]   He's off.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.800]   He got off but on a technicality.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.560]   But he was the guy who was downloading email addresses
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:11.480]   of iPad users by discovering a flaw in the AT&T database
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.680]   website.
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.880]   He's also the guy that troll Kathy Sierra.
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.320]   Oh, he is.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.160]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:19.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.000]   And he was horrible.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:21.960]   He was horrible to her.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:22.400]   Yeah, horrible.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.240]   Horrible.
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.120]   And that's what that last sentence made me think of.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.920]   The more beautiful and pure a thing is.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.600]   So no wonder there's such mixed feelings about him getting off.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.480]   Now I understand.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.840]   He's self-proclaimed troll.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.600]   And I guess he really, really is.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:42.440]   Let me show you this picture, because we were talking last week
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:45.520]   about Inbox, which is the Google email program.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:48.040]   Gina very kindly did pull some strings
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.360]   to get both me and Jeff.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.560]   Inbox.
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:53.560]   And I love it.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.120]   I don't want to ask you how you love it.
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.520]   But as soon as we talked about it, look at the tweet.
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:01.680]   Because we were speculating-- I bet these guys are watching.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:03.160]   As we talk about it, yep.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.080]   Oh, nice.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.600]   There is the Inbox team.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.560]   That's the greatest thing.
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:10.640]   Watching us talk about Inbox with beer.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.760]   That is amazing.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.080]   I get treated that--
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:15.080]   All right, I guess I'm going to show you.
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.280]   When Leo was trying to find something, then he finally did
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.560]   find it, I said I imagined there were Googlers saying,
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.160]   yeah, no, no, no, no, no, Leo.
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.160]   Oh, yeah, Leo.
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.080]   That's what they were--
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:26.080]   This is the greatest.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.880]   I give credit for the picture there.
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.720]   Jason Cornwell.
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.240]   Thank you.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.040]   And then--
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:32.560]   Brilliant.
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.200]   Jason, I presume, is on the Inbox team,
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:39.040]   because his Twitter icon has a giant Inbox icon in his hand.
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.040]   And there it is.
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.120]   Do you read the little name tags there?
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.520]   I think I think that's him.
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.480]   It's his desk, too.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:47.720]   Yeah, the bearded guy.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.360]   So pretty sweet.
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:54.000]   I'd be really impressed if they do a picture of this on the screen.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.360]   Yeah, but let's do Inception.
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.360]   Yes, take a picture of this.
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:56.840]   Keep going.
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.360]   Keep going.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:57.840]   Keep going.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.360]   Keep going.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:17:59.360]   Keep going.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:02.120]   You looking at us.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:05.280]   Dustin, David Pogue, the Jerry Lewis of Technology Report.
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:09.000]   And welcome to What Is That Thing?
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.360]   This show where we ask you, What Is That Thing?
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:13.680]   How do I go full screen?
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:15.600]   What is this?
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.480]   What is that thing?
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.480]   What is that thing?
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:30.960]   A, B, C, or D?
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.920]   The answer is E, none of the above.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:40.280]   It's the new Apple Mac Pro, available now, starting at the high high price of $3,000 and
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.680]   going up to $9,500.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.120]   This computer is crazy fast.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:47.120]   Look at this.
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:51.200]   In Final Cut Pro, it can munch this 4K video like butter.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:54.520]   That's four times the resolution of high-def TV.
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:58.680]   And it's made in the USA.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.200]   It's portable, one-handable.
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.320]   Expanding the memory is super easy.
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.680]   The shell pops right off.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:07.160]   Oh, the music is going to make me shoot myself.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.560]   The gas light up will move it.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.840]   It's like Benny Hill.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:10.840]   It's super quiet.
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:11.840]   It's super quiet.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.560]   No one who's watching this is going to buy it.
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.160]   But it's not like the old Mac.
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.160]   Oh, that's all right.
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.160]   These still have to.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.160]   It's put drives and cards inside.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.160]   I don't know.
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.960]   I'm glad it looks like this.
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:22.960]   This is good.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.920]   If there's a market for all the better, it's not our market.
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:26.920]   It's not our market.
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:27.920]   On your market at all.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:28.920]   Thank goodness.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:29.920]   The cord is popping the bar.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:30.920]   I'd be.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:31.920]   The light wind-up surrounded by a mismatch of butter and candy.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:32.920]   Apple, first, and this one.
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:33.920]   Real pros would still make it on you.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:34.920]   Apple.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:35.920]   Real pros would still make it on you.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:36.920]   I'm not supporting you.
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:37.920]   You're going to drop it.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.920]   You're going to drop it.
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:39.920]   You're going to drop it.
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:46.920]   You're going to drop it.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:52.920]   We're going to see you cry.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.920]   I love how we had to unplug.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:05.440]   This is why I'll never be David Polk.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.640]   I just don't have the damn energy.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.640]   That guy.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:11.800]   He had a lot of jump cuts working on the forum, Mary Leo.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:13.240]   How does he do it?
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.480]   Change log is coming up next.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:18.080]   Gina Trappani, put your change log hat on.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.080]   We'll do.
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.080]   Get your umber.
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.080]   What do you call it?
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:23.080]   When it was the lips, the unbresher.
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:24.080]   The unbresher?
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.080]   No.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.080]   What do you want to do with Trump?
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:28.080]   What's that called?
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.080]   Chatroom.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:30.080]   What's that called?
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.080]   Umberture.
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.080]   Umberture is that what it is?
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.080]   Get your umbertures ready, people.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.080]   Well, no, that's your.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.080]   That's your.
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.480]   Yeah, because it's trumpets.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.480]   Sorry.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:51.560]   You know, really, I'm sorry, but when I hear a tuba, I just see a guy going into a big
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:59.640]   tube, but at least that catches the spin.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:00.640]   Is that in Twitter?
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.840]   It's in the chatroom.
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:04.840]   So this is, that's kind of interesting.
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:05.960]   Ben, Ben did this.
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:12.280]   I think Ben, Ben did a little illustration of what this show is reminding him of.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:17.280]   Ben, can you put glass on the old man on the left?
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.720]   Yes, we are.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:21.680]   Oh, yes.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:22.680]   Here it is.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:25.320]   Thank you, Ben, for an updated image.
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.320]   Thank you, Ben.
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:29.640]   Oh, we got complete with glass.
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.640]   Very good.
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:34.920]   Now that's Photoshop wizardry.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.800]   I like it.
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.960]   We make, we used to make the joke the paper.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.200]   Yeah, the paperless office.
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.600]   That'll be here as soon as you get the paperless bathroom.
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:43.600]   That's right.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:46.200]   I have now a paperless bathroom.
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.200]   Do I want to know this?
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.840]   I have really want to know this.
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.560]   The Japanese toilet.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.080]   Get out of here.
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.480]   It works.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.480]   So maybe it is time for the paperless.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.480]   Oh, visuals.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.480]   Oh, I know.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.480]   I shouldn't bring it up.
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.480]   Okay.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.000]   Changing the subject, changing the subject.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.480]   Changing the chat room said, "Next thing, Google buys if this than that."
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.480]   We can see that.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.080]   Totally, right?
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.080]   And then--
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.080]   It's the right connecting thing.
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:15.560]   --heal lights.
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:16.560]   And then--
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.600]   --heal lights, I don't get it all.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.120]   Oh, I love the hue lights.
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:21.120]   Better than my nest.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.120]   These are pretty cool.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.360]   Okay, so here's an application, Jeff.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:30.240]   There's an application on the iPad and iPhone called Exoplanet that notifies you whenever
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:33.280]   another planet outside our solar system is discovered.
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.280]   You set it up.
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:38.680]   It has a little button that the hue light then changes to the color that it looks like on
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:41.560]   the surface of that planet, depending on the sun that the planet's in.
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.560]   The solar system.
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:43.560]   Oh, man.
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:44.560]   That's off the nerdometer.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:45.560]   That's off the nerdometer.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.560]   That's off the nerdometer.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.560]   I don't know how any of the ever-assisted robots.
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:48.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:49.560]   Sorry, Matthew.
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.560]   Yeah, I know that's--
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:55.040]   That's the geekiest thing I've ever heard.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.040]   Off the nerdometer.
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.040]   Off the nerdometer.
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.040]   Off the nerdometer.
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.040]   I like that a lot.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.200]   The nerdometer needle is like spiking in the redness.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.640]   Hue lights are very nerdometer.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:06.640]   Very, very big on the nerdometer.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.360]   I don't think I've heard of these.
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:09.840]   These are just smart lights.
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:10.840]   Phillips makes them.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:11.840]   Phillips makes them.
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:12.840]   They're not that expensive.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.840]   Not a huge amount of money out of you.
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:17.080]   That one's a big smart about them is that they rip you off for how much money?
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.080]   60 bucks and a bulb.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.080]   60 bucks and a bulb.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.080]   Well, wait.
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.080]   No, wait.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.080]   They're LED lights.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.520]   Now, admittedly, LEDs have gone down.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:25.200]   You can get them for 10 bucks now.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:27.720]   But-- and I'm sure these will go down at the same time.
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:30.040]   Phillips is rapidly reducing the price of LEDs.
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.960]   But LEDs are expensive, but they're 10,000 hour bulbs.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:39.480]   These are RGB LEDs, which means they can make any color at all from this light.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:44.680]   So much so that you could take a picture with your smartphone, put it in the Hue app,
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:49.320]   click a part of that picture and say, "Light bulb, you go to that color."
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.320]   It can literally--
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:51.320]   Wait a second.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:52.320]   Wait a second.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.320]   What do you say?
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.320]   Maybe you'll see me for one thing.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.320]   Can it stop me from looking pink?
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:56.320]   Yes.
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:58.320]   I'm going to turn to you.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.320]   Now we're talking about the sparkle spark right there.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.520]   For instance, I have a picture of a moonlit night.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:06.720]   I put it in my Hue thing and I said, "Okay, bulbs, I want to be a moonlit night."
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:10.520]   And you feel like you're literally in the moonlit night.
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.680]   You can also use if this and that with it.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.680]   You can set alarms.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.480]   You can say, "For instance, I want to slowly wake up.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:21.960]   I want the bulbs to ramp up starting at 6 a.m. to give me a sunset or a sunrise in my
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:24.040]   bedroom."
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:25.200]   You can have daylight.
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.680]   You can have night light.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:30.040]   Now admittedly, this isn't that practical.
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.120]   And there are some strong negatives.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:36.480]   For instance, as I discovered, if the power goes out and then comes back on, the hue lights
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:40.200]   turn on full bright.
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.800]   And so in the middle of the night, I'm lying in bed and suddenly--
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:43.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:44.800]   --good morning!
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:45.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.800]   --because I have a lot of them.
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:48.800]   Take me to the lights.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:51.480]   How many do you have?
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:52.920]   Nine.
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:57.440]   And then I reach for my phone because I know what's happened.
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.440]   Oh, god damn it.
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:24:59.880]   The hue lights came on.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.880]   And I'm starting to open the app.
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.600]   At least it just reaches over and flips the switch, which was actually the right thing
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.600]   to do.
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:11.720]   I feel like you live in the kingdom of modern morals between your toilet and the lights.
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:12.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.720]   --and the future.
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:14.720]   OK, so OK, the toilet.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:15.720]   Now, don't listen.
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:16.720]   Cover your ears, Jeff.
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:17.720]   You got to do it.
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:18.720]   Cover your ears.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:19.720]   So you get up.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:20.720]   You go in the bathroom.
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:21.720]   The toilet goes--
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:24.120]   The toilet goes-- to welcome you.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.120]   Does it play a song or--
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.120]   No, no.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.120]   This one does not--
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:30.120]   Now, there's the creepy line.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.120]   There you go.
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.640]   We have found the creepy line.
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:35.760]   And then it's-- the seed is warm.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:36.760]   It's heated.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:37.760]   Warm.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.760]   Very nice.
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.560]   Never sit on a cold toilet seat again.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:41.560]   And there are also the waters heated.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.240]   I-- wait, stop there.
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:45.040]   What I said on the warm toilet seat is because somebody--
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.040]   No, I know.
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.040]   This is clean warm.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.040]   This is a clean warm.
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.040]   Like a clean warm.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.040]   I've read for the warm.
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.040]   So we sanitized--
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.520]   Like the 59 years of visceral response.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.880]   You sit down.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:03.360]   The fan goes on because it has a carbon filtered exhaust fan in the bowl so that everything
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.560]   is exhausted out.
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:10.960]   And then when you're done, there's front and back washers.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.280]   They oscillate or pulse or any combination thereof.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.280]   It's warm.
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:15.280]   You set the temperature.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.280]   It baits you.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.280]   It's a wiper blade of any kind.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.280]   No.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:19.280]   There's no--
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.280]   It's a bidet.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.280]   No touch.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:23.840]   And then it has a nice little blow dryer.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.960]   So after you're done washing, you press the blow dryer because--
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:26.960]   [SOUND]
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:28.320]   --and it dries you off.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:29.560]   And then you stand up.
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.920]   And then you walk out because the seat automatically-- the toilet automatically flushes.
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.440]   The seat automatically goes down.
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.640]   It sanitizes and it's ready for the next person.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.640]   All right.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:38.640]   All right.
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.640]   We're going to have a Howard Stern moment here.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:41.640]   No.
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.640]   Uh-oh.
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:43.640]   No.
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:44.640]   It's OK.
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:45.640]   It's OK.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.640]   Does it deal with dingleberries?
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:47.640]   Yes.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:48.640]   Oh.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:51.640]   There it's a very powerful thruster.
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:52.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.640]   Oh.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:54.640]   Oh.
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:55.640]   It's like--
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:56.640]   I don't want to go too far.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:57.640]   Show title.
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:58.640]   All right.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:26:59.640]   It's very pleasant.
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:00.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:01.640]   So on the Howard Stern show.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:02.640]   That's nice.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:03.640]   I've got to go.
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:04.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:07.640]   There's no brushes though, right?
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.640]   No.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.640]   There's no physical.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:10.720]   So I realized what it is.
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.920]   I realized I suddenly understood this after doing this.
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:13.920]   See, you have to use the nest.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:16.560]   You have to use these things to get it, right?
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.840]   And to get the pros and the cons.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.840]   And one of the things-- and you can't just-- and this is why
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:22.160]   reviewers sometimes miss the boat.
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.440]   They try it for a week.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.440]   OK, I get it.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.480]   And they go, you've got to live with it.
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:31.000]   So what I realized is the Japanese don't care so much about butt cleanliness as they
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.080]   do about not touching anything.
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.080]   Mm-hmm.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.520]   So what this really is, is a toilet where you could walk in like this and not touch anything.
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:39.520]   Right.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:40.520]   That's the point of it.
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:44.200]   Well, because we've gotten the point you don't touch in public restrooms, you no longer
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.200]   touch the water floss.
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.200]   Right.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.200]   You no longer touch the paper towels.
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.200]   That's what this is.
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:50.680]   But of course, you use your hand on the damn door.
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:51.680]   Right.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:54.440]   So the idea-- and I think that they're probably right-- is it doesn't really matter how clean
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:55.440]   your butt is.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.320]   It matters how clean your hands are.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:01.240]   Is the blower like the ones in the airport where it's like 8,000, you know?
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:02.240]   No, no, it's not a dyson.
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.240]   Yeah, the dyson, yeah.
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.440]   But you know what I want?
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:07.960]   I want a dyson in my shower.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:30.080]   I just want to go jeee to run me dry.
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:31.080]   Yes, it's acceptable.
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:34.400]   You don't go, God, I wish I'd-- and of course--
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.320]   Well, we're on technology.
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.420]   It's two from the "Hurtstern Show."
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:39.760]   One is poo-pory.
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.680]   Which you-- I have poo-pory.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.680]   It's-- oh, really?
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:44.680]   Not by poo-pory.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:47.960]   There's a whole side of you that I didn't know about.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:50.040]   OK, how about the squatty pot?
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:53.320]   This is sounding like I am so anally fixated.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:55.680]   I am not.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:56.680]   What about the squatty potty?
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:59.440]   Oh no, no, no, in Japan, you're just describing a normal type-- I am normal-- I'm not using
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:00.440]   this-- in Japan.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:01.440]   --the new-- the Japanese toilet, yeah.
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:02.440]   The squatty potty.
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.440]   Yeah, I've heard about that.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:04.440]   The squatty potty potty.
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:05.440]   No, poo-pory doesn't work.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.300]   The
[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:11.280]   --the theory is that it creates a barrier in the surface of the wall.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:14.960]   It's just fragrance, very, very, very strong fragrance.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:17.640]   And it does not have any magical properties.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.560]   I've been quibber as soon as she carries it with her.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.440]   Yeah, because she smells like flowers everywhere she goes.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:25.080]   All right, so that's that one from that?
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.760]   The theory of it sealing out the--
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:28.760]   The order.
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:29.760]   That's me.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:34.440]   But it does-- it's a very strong deodorant because it smells like whatever flavor you
[01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:35.440]   got.
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:37.280]   And it's very, very strong.
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:40.560]   So there's the squatty potty, which Howard now swears by.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:43.360]   Oh, I-- so this is an image I don't want.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.280]   I reviewed it on gizwiz.
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:48.560]   I reviewed the squatty potty on gizwiz.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:54.240]   Is that the one that were your-- so it's not a-- it's not a hole in the ground that
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.240]   you squat over?
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:56.240]   No, no, no, no.
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:58.520]   And that raises your legs up so your angle is better.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:01.040]   It's a step stool for the can.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.040]   Which is supposed to be better.
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:03.040]   It's significantly better.
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:09.240]   Which is ridiculous because all it's doing is bringing your knees to your chest to make
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:11.040]   your organs all fit together.
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:16.960]   All you have to do instead of spinning 30 bucks on a plastic stand on the toilet seat.
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:18.960]   No, lean forward.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:22.440]   If you put your chest towards your knees, it works.
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:23.440]   Just lean forward.
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:25.880]   Don't buy a squatty potty.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:26.880]   What have we done to wig?
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:27.880]   There you go.
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:28.880]   What have we done?
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.480]   I really got it in this episode.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:33.000]   I did say at the beginning of the show, it's that we talk about Google.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000]   And whatever other hell else we want to talk about.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000]   That's a work cover.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.440]   We're talking about a cloud of poop odor.
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:41.440]   Oh, god.
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:42.440]   This is--
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:43.440]   Smart homes.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:44.440]   Smart homes got to smell good.
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.440]   Yeah.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.440]   Anyway.
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:49.880]   Nest, thank you very much.
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:50.880]   How is ThinkUp going?
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.280]   ThinkUp is going great.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:56.120]   We demoed it last week at New York Tech Meetup, which is a--
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.120]   How'd that go?
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:59.120]   Uturization.
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.120]   It went really, really well.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.120]   I was worried.
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.120]   I heard it was a really tough crowd.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.120]   It was.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:04.720]   And they were really good to us.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:05.720]   The demo went well.
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:07.680]   The video was up?
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:08.680]   The video, yeah.
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:13.240]   I'm not sure if they chopped it up into individual demos, but the video of the entire meetup is
[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:14.240]   up.
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:16.240]   And we were up against a sex tech section.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:17.240]   A what?
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:18.240]   It was like smart vibrators.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.240]   I was there.
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.240]   You're there.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.240]   You were there?
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.240]   I was there.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:23.240]   I didn't realize that was you.
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:24.240]   Yeah, that was me.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:25.240]   No way.
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:26.240]   There you go.
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:27.240]   Yeah, no, it was really fun.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:29.400]   What do you mean up against smart vibrators?
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:30.400]   What do you mean--
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.400]   What do you mean--
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:32.400]   What is that?
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.560]   It's a really complicated concept.
[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.360]   Is it a competition?
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:42.960]   Well, so the tech meetup is a series of demos from various tech companies in New York.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:46.800]   And there happened to be-- and it was actually the first ever-- it was a sex tech section
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.800]   at the end of the night where they--
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:48.800]   Wow.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.800]   It was an honor of Valentine's Day.
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:50.800]   It was a--
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:51.800]   It was a--
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:53.520]   Yeah, sort of a February event.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:57.400]   So basically, you go up and you demo in groups of two or three.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:01.240]   And we actually-- the other company that we demoed with was Lendo, which is a micro--
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.680]   a micro payment loans company.
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:05.760]   And they actually got a ton of questions as well.
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.240]   But it's really-- it's really fun.
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.680]   It's a huge event.
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.040]   It was really intimidating, but it went really well.
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:12.640]   So I was happy with it.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:13.640]   And--
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:14.640]   So thank you.
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:15.640]   Thank you.
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:16.640]   Yeah, think up--
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:17.640]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:18.640]   We still got to hear more about the sex tech, Gina.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:19.640]   Oh.
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:20.640]   You got-- you got male geeks out here.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:21.640]   You're not satisfying their needs.
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:24.640]   Let's hear one stupid sex tech on it.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:25.640]   I am so biting my lip, right?
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:26.640]   There was.
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:29.840]   There was a demo of a smart vibrator.
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:32.760]   And I forget what the name of it was.
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.960]   Maybe, Sarah, you remember.
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:35.960]   And I'm not going to--
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:36.960]   She's trying not to.
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:38.840]   I'm going to tell you that I don't remember.
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:39.840]   It's a--
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:42.840]   Chatham, what would you name a smart vibrator?
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:45.000]   Tell us Tostorone says the chatham.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.600]   Let's just say it's remote controlled wearable tech.
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:48.800]   And that's all I'll say.
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:49.320]   OK.
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:53.400]   It was designed by someone who was living in Boston, I think.
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.280]   And his wife was back in Singapore.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:56.720]   Which means over the internet?
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:59.920]   And so she can help to--
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:07.000]   he can help her achieve an orgasm with the remote vibrator.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000]   He was an internet.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.800]   It was a riveting demonstration.
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:10.800]   It was--
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.600]   It was just a meaning to the word "relatancy."
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:13.560]   I got to tell you that.
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:16.960]   I have to say, the demo-- like, the guy who demoed came off.
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.320]   He was so earnest.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:19.840]   He was in like really--
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:23.240]   It was a devoted husband trying to help his long distance.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:23.760]   Why?
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:24.760]   What are you going to not like?
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:25.760]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.480]   Is this Vibies?
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:28.920]   Yes, that's it.
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.000]   That's it.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:30.960]   Check it out.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:31.960]   Whoa.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:34.000]   All you girls out there.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.880]   I know there's two or three of you.
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:36.920]   There was a video chat.
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:37.200]   I don't know.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:37.720]   Do we dare?
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:38.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.520]   So there's-- no, don't show that.
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:44.040]   My favorite moment of the demo was a point at which he said,
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:47.040]   and we even talked to women about--
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:48.920]   Oh, well, it's a bad time.
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:50.000]   And I thought, oh--
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:50.800]   I was--
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:51.760]   It was a little--
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.200]   there was sort of a bit of an anticlimactic moment,
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:57.840]   if I may use that term, because they announced at the beginning,
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:01.080]   at the beginning, they said, OK, anyone with young people,
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:03.360]   children under the age of x, you really
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.320]   need to leave the room now, because we're
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:07.040]   going to have this special sex--
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:09.600]   Imagine listening to 50 Shades of Grey
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.440]   with a hands-free vibrator.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:14.040]   That vibrates in perfect sync with the audio fantasy.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.080]   So there's an audio fantasy?
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:16.160]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:17.400]   So you don't need the husband?
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:18.080]   No, that's what I'm saying.
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:20.040]   You can be 3,000 miles away.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.520]   But you don't need the husband at all.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:22.480]   Well, he's talking.
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:24.360]   He's talking over his iPhone.
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.240]   No, but there's a video.
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.240]   There's a fantasy.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:27.400]   There's an audio fantasy.
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:28.400]   That's the fantasy.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:28.400]   That's the fun.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.080]   You don't need the husband.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.080]   Yeah, there were a few different options.
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:32.640]   Yeah, you could--
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:35.680]   You've been replaced by a podcast, honey.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:37.160]   You could choose different paths.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.840]   Aren't you the one who's interested in paths?
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:39.360]   There's paths.
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:42.040]   There's more than one way to do it.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:45.000]   Not to it, anyway, overshadowed think up.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:45.440]   Well--
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:46.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.280]   You see what she meant when she said it.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:49.560]   Even with this, you did well.
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:51.240]   Yeah, this is a great competition.
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.440]   This is what I meant by being up again, some tough.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:54.440]   It wasn't really--
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.840]   It wasn't really--
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:57.320]   I did it, Mo, honestly.
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.320]   No.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:00.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:00.840]   Well, that's important.
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:01.840]   No, it's really--
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:02.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:03.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.840]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:05.360]   Oh, no.
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:05.840]   Oh, no.
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:06.840]   Oh, no.
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:07.840]   Oh, no.
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:07.840]   No, no.
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.440]   That seemed too much.
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:10.520]   So it's wearable.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:12.840]   It's 100% hands-free experience.
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.800]   It is indeed wearable.
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:15.640]   It's wearable tech.
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:17.400]   I think I'm just going to get fired for having
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:21.160]   in a-- I wasn't working environment.
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:21.920]   The dean is here.
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:22.440]   It's OK.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:22.960]   It's OK.
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:23.960]   Jesus.
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:24.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.760]   I didn't mean for this to go.
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:29.120]   So it was the topic of my ex-faculty meeting.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:30.400]   Now you've blown it for me.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:33.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:34.080]   There's an app for it.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:35.720]   That's what I think kind of interesting.
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:39.200]   It has an app, Android or iOS.
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.680]   I'm surprised Apple approved that, to be honest.
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:43.680]   It seems like that's something Apple wouldn't approve.
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:44.840]   They don't believe in people having sex.
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:47.000]   I think they had some problems with it, actually.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.240]   And then, yeah.
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:49.520]   Well, that was part of the discussion,
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:52.520]   was how to legitimate consumer products that are related
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:55.560]   to sex deal with things like app store policies.
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:59.480]   And even just getting payment processors
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:01.520]   and different web services, a lot of the companies
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.440]   just won't work with that.
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.320]   I bet they only have problems in the US, though.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:04.800]   I think it'll--
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:05.600]   No, no.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:06.440]   She said globally.
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.120]   They have a problem.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:07.600]   Really?
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.120]   Not Germany.
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:09.760]   Not in Germany.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.920]   I think she was saying-- I mean, there was a woman who--
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:13.560]   I forget her name, who came up afterwards
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:17.200]   and was quite passionately annoyed about how
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.200]   the financial world would be sort of shutting down.
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:20.240]   We're anti-sex.
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:20.760]   Correct.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:21.760]   It's in Gallup.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:22.400]   That's right.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.840]   A lot of negativity about sex.
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:25.880]   Especially by bankers.
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:28.280]   So it's all the more impressive that you did so well, Gina.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.400]   That's a tough act to be on stage.
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:31.760]   So let me ask you, how's ThinkUp doing?
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:36.160]   Think up going really well, Leo.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:36.640]   Thank you.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.240]   We've never last weekend went awesome.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.040]   We're going to open up and sign up to the public.
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:41.600]   In the next couple of weeks, it's going really well.
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:42.800]   Thank you for asking.
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:43.300]   Thank you.
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:43.800]   Thank you.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:45.400]   And damn you, Jarvis.
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.880]   You couldn't let-- you couldn't let it slide, could you?
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.400]   Well, this is-- no one does it slide?
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:51.920]   Well, no, I don't know.
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:56.200]   Just today, Google released a new Android app called Devicesist.
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:58.800]   It offers live tech support, troubleshooting, tips,
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:36:59.840]   and more.
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:03.200]   The catch is it's only for Nexus, Google Play edition,
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:05.280]   and Android One devices.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:05.760]   Sorry about that.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.680]   I have it installed.
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.480]   I can show it while you talk about it.
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:09.960]   Oh, that would be-- yeah, that would be great.
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:10.480]   That'd be great.
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:15.720]   So in addition to offering quick access to Google support,
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:17.760]   you have to text issues with the devices set up,
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:20.760]   make suggestions on things like GPS connectivity,
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:25.080]   and batteries settings to improve overall performance.
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:27.720]   It gives you proactive troubleshooting
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:30.200]   to help you get the most out of your device.
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:31.240]   This is like tips.
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.240]   It has to look at you.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.600]   It has to look into you, Jason.
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.880]   Do you get a live Googler on the line?
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:36.880]   Is it like--
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:37.400]   Actually, look--
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:38.080]   --the Amazon?
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:40.520]   Well, so looking for help, send device information
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:42.440]   to Google for improved technical support.
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.080]   See Google's-- OK, sure.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:44.640]   OK.
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:46.200]   I don't know what I'm about to do here.
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:47.800]   Oh, you're about to launch a help app.
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:48.600]   OK, so you can--
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:49.760]   You have to call back.
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:51.800]   You can request a call back.
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:53.240]   Provide a backup number if you can.
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:55.560]   Phone issues will be easier to solve if we can call you
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.800]   on a different phone.
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:58.200]   I should-- wait, wait, wait.
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:01.040]   Is it illegal to call them right now and see what they do?
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.640]   Yeah, of course it is.
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:05.400]   So you're telling me to do it then?
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:05.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:06.600]   Call you back.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:07.560]   See how long it takes.
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:08.400]   Oh, that's-- yeah.
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:10.160]   Oh, so-- yeah.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.840]   Yeah, really, I have to enter in for me.
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:12.960]   Your phone number?
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:15.520]   Google, don't you know this about me already?
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:17.040]   It's an app on your phone.
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:19.240]   But it's an ask for access to your number.
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:19.720]   Oh.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:20.400]   Cover it.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:21.400]   That's really weird.
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:22.560]   It's really weird.
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:25.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:26.080]   Probably guess.
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.960]   I feel like we're putting you on this body of Jason.
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:29.000]   Describe your issue.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.120]   It's only optional, so I don't have to actually describe
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:32.000]   my issue, so I won't.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.080]   I'm live on a Google related podcast.
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:35.760]   I'd like to eat a comment on devices.
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:37.680]   That's just my issue.
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:40.520]   Right now, someone's calling someone at Google saying,
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:43.200]   got a red ear coming to Jason.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.680]   Yes, exactly.
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:46.200]   We want to call really, really fast, right?
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:49.200]   We want everyone to know if this works right away.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.920]   So I guess I would just wait and see then.
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:52.560]   And I'm sure at some point I'll get a phone call.
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:54.120]   And it'll buzz on my wrist, by the way.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.400]   So I'll really know when it comes to you.
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.200]   Detective issues.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:59.080]   I don't have any issues on this Nexus 6,
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:38:59.920]   so apparently I'm good.
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.040]   But it also has this tips column for--
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:04.280]   and I think this is actually a really good idea,
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:07.640]   because so many times things inside Android
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:08.560]   are just kind of buried.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:10.520]   You just kind of have to discover them
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:13.280]   or know that they're there or long press something randomly.
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.880]   And oh, hey, I didn't know we did that.
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:15.640]   So this is good.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:16.280]   This is really good.
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:17.960]   Like I have in our little genie of Tapani there
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:18.440]   telling us what we could--
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:19.320]   Totally.
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:19.800]   Yeah.
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:21.600]   It should be called the Trapani Tip.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:23.800]   You know, I went to--
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:26.240]   one of the things we do in the academia
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.680]   is we observe our colleagues--
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:29.120]   Yeah, they call.
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:30.080]   By the way.
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:31.080]   Oh, go.
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:32.080]   Go.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:33.080]   Go.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:34.080]   OK.
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:36.080]   This is Jason.
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:36.880]   Oh, here, hold on.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:43.360]   Oh, it's--
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:45.200]   Thank you for contacting Google.
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.480]   My name is Tom.
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:48.040]   Am I speaking with Jason?
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:49.080]   Wow, yes you are.
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:51.000]   How's it going, Tom?
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.240]   Hey, Jason, I'm doing well.
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:53.160]   Thanks.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.960]   Looks like you set up a call with our new devices
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:56.480]   this day.
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:57.960]   That's pretty awesome.
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:00.280]   What can I help you out with today, Jason?
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:02.440]   I have to be completely honest.
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:05.480]   I called A to see how fast you would call,
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:07.920]   because I'm very curious.
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.880]   I think this is a great, great feature.
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:12.520]   B, I'm doing a show called This Week in Google,
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:14.440]   where we talk all about Google things.
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.120]   And you're on the air right now.
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.160]   So you're famous.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.160]   Hi, Tom.
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:20.160]   Hi, Tom.
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:22.400]   I'm really appreciate that, man.
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:23.520]   I'm very in the house.
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:25.560]   And you know, that callback only took--
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:26.360]   man, what?
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:27.120]   30 seconds?
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:27.600]   45 seconds?
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:28.120]   Yeah, it's nice.
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:29.120]   So it's super impressive.
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:30.120]   It's really cool.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:31.120]   Great service you guys have.
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:33.480]   So call and see how it goes and appreciate your time.
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:34.000]   Sorry, Bob.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.240]   What are some of the first questions he's getting?
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:36.320]   Is he all the questions you've got?
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:36.840]   Yeah.
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:37.480]   Hey, hey, hey.
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:39.720]   So before I let you go, what are some of the kind
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:40.640]   of first questions you're getting?
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:43.080]   Are you getting a lot of these kinds of questions?
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:47.000]   Or are you also getting actual service support questions?
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.480]   Well, my shift just started about 10 minutes ago.
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:51.760]   So I haven't really gotten many calls yet.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:53.360]   You're actually my first call the day.
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:56.320]   So I guess if you had to be determined,
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:59.680]   what kind of questions we're going to be doing.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:04.760]   So your first call ever doing this is live before thousands
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:05.760]   of people.
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:07.680]   How much training did you have?
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:08.840]   This was four guys.
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:09.880]   How many weeks?
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:10.680]   Excellent.
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:11.200]   OK.
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:11.720]   All right.
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:14.400]   Are you in a nice warm place or in a cold place?
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:16.440]   Are you in a warm place or a cold place?
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:19.640]   That's Jeff Jarvis, one of the hosts on the show.
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:21.880]   I'm in a cold place right now.
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:24.800]   It's real windy and rainy today.
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:25.800]   Well, that's not fair.
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:27.920]   They should be moving you to California.
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:28.880]   My brother.
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:31.400]   You are in California, correct?
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:32.720]   Yeah, Northern California.
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:33.220]   All right.
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:34.640]   So then we're experiencing the same weather.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.400]   We're up in Petaluma.
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:38.480]   So we have it right out the window as well.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:41.360]   Hey, don't want to bother you, but I really appreciate your time.
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:42.840]   And check out this.
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:43.280]   We can Google.
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:44.520]   You're on it.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:45.280]   All right.
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:48.000]   Well, Jason, I'm real glad I was able to help you out
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.080]   with those questions today.
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:51.400]   I just want to let you know at the end of the call here,
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:54.080]   there is going to be a real brief customer support survey
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.640]   asking for any feedback you might have on the support you
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:57.440]   received.
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:59.840]   I understand if you've got the time
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:01.080]   that you need to take for the show.
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:03.520]   So go ahead and get your transfer over there.
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:06.280]   And I want to thank you again for contacting Google
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:07.520]   and enjoy the rest of your day.
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:08.040]   Right on.
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:09.640]   Thank you so much.
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:11.960]   We got to give you a good grades.
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:12.520]   Bye bye.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:14.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:15.240]   All right.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.480]   I guess I'll give a good grade while you continue on
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:19.000]   with the change lock.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000]   Sure.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000]   Yeah, let's do that.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:21.520]   OK.
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:22.000]   All right.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:22.600]   That was bad.
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:23.880]   That was fun.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:25.040]   I want to call it the her.
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:25.640]   I don't want to--
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:26.360]   I do too.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:26.720]   I'm going to say--
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.720]   I'm going to say--
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:28.720]   I'm going to just call up on her.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:29.720]   I'm going to say hello, Scarlet.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:30.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:32.240]   What was her name?
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:33.240]   I forget now.
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:34.240]   It was Samantha.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:35.240]   Samantha.
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:36.240]   Samantha.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.240]   Yes.
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:39.240]   If--
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:40.240]   No, I don't know.
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:41.880]   I'm a little creepy if you call the phone Samantha.
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:45.040]   I would like it because actually if it had Scarlet's voice,
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:48.200]   because I don't know how you feel Siri's voice I've gotten
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:53.560]   used to, but the Moto X Google Voice is strident.
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:56.440]   Let me-- I'll give you an example.
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.000]   Let's get out of this.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:58.520]   Let me think.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:00.200]   What am I going to do here?
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:01.960]   Hello, Moto X.
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:03.240]   What's the weather in Petaluma?
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:08.320]   Unlock your phone to continue.
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:10.200]   It's just a little-- I don't know-- a little strident.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:17.440]   It's 78 degrees and overcast in Petaluma.
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.880]   Siri just seems nicer.
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:20.800]   You disagree?
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:21.400]   You agree?
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:23.880]   No, no, no, the voice is--
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:25.600]   it's still a little robotic.
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:28.200]   I think it's difficult to get it softer.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:31.080]   But I haven't used Siri in a really long time.
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:32.960]   Well, you want to hear Siri these days?
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:37.120]   I think she's sounding a little bit better.
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:39.040]   I forgot what I do to start saying.
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:40.120]   Oh, I have to press the button.
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:43.680]   By the way, I have to be careful on the shows now
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:46.680]   because if people have their iPhone look to the power
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:50.680]   and you say, hey, Siri, it will actually wake her up
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.560]   and she'll start doing stuff.
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:56.560]   How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:59.000]   [DING]
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.080]   Golden Gate Bridge is 8,981 feet.
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:03.240]   Long.
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:03.760]   Long?
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:04.760]   Long.
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:05.760]   Long.
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:06.760]   Long.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:07.760]   Long.
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:10.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:11.760]   She seems friendlier.
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.160]   Yeah, yeah, she does.
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:14.160]   It's just a thing.
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:15.480]   And her voice is a little lower.
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:17.520]   Now we've got to get Cortana into the mix, but I--
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:19.120]   I actually like Cortana's voice.
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:21.560]   So my window's phone is in the other room, so I can't.
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:24.240]   But I actually like-- you have it there.
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:24.880]   There goes Danny.
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:25.880]   He's going to go ahead and share it.
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:26.400]   There goes Danny.
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:27.480]   He's a big board.
[01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:29.760]   Can I-- I can upgrade the voice on this, right?
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:32.080]   I can download better sound.
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.080]   So you need to have celebrity voices, right?
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:35.080]   Like you need to have--
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:35.440]   That's a Tom Tom.
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:36.560]   I used to have--
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:37.060]   Yeah.
[01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:39.360]   I used to have great celebrity voices on my Tom Tom.
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:39.960]   I had--
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:41.720]   Or my Tom Tom-- my Tom Tom won versions.
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:43.680]   I had one great because you could have all the--
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:44.720]   you could put your own voice.
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:46.440]   And I had my kids do all the turns.
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:49.440]   So they'd be like, go forward, mate.
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:50.600]   Oh, you turn.
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:51.400]   Daddy?
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:53.200]   Go forward, Daddy.
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.680]   Actually, whatever it was-- when I would have to do the U-turn,
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:57.800]   because that was usually a sign that I was lost,
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:00.920]   it would say, my wife would go instead of saying,
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:02.120]   do you make a U-turn, it would say,
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:04.000]   why don't you pull over and ask directions?
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:08.440]   That's good.
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:09.080]   I like it.
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:10.040]   So let's hear Cortana.
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:10.480]   You got Cortana?
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:11.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:11.480]   OK.
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:14.400]   What do you want her to say?
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:14.920]   Oh, I just--
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:16.120]   Oh, I don't know if you'll be able to hear it.
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:17.520]   If you'll be able to hear it.
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:19.440]   Oh, it doesn't have a speaker?
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:21.720]   Yeah, but I don't know if you can hear it through my headset.
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:22.320]   Oh, hold it.
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:23.880]   Just put it right up there.
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:25.000]   Hang on, hang on.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:25.440]   There we go.
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:30.640]   How big-- how long is the Golden Gate Bridge?
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:39.760]   How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:45.360]   I like the musical tone.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:47.640]   It'll take six hours and 51 minutes
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:49.840]   to drive to Golden Gate Bridge.
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.400]   Could you hear that?
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:52.400]   Yes.
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:55.680]   I'll say it'll be six hours to drive there.
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:56.360]   It's not too long.
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.360]   Let's go.
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:00.880]   It doesn't sound like all of Cortana in the game.
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:01.880]   No.
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:02.760]   Put it in yourself.
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:03.880]   No.
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:06.720]   They should have gotten Cortana from Halo to voice--
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:10.320]   I'm so disappointed because I love Cortana in Halo.
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:12.040]   And I know this is a different Cortana,
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:13.800]   but I wanted the voice to be the same.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:15.560]   Ask Cortana what she thinks of Siri.
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:16.840]   Does she say anything about that?
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:19.840]   Oh, she's got a whole series of things that she does.
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:22.680]   That's one thing that both iPhone and Apple and Microsoft
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:24.320]   do is there's some personality.
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:25.680]   What do you think about Siri?
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:29.680]   Hard to say.
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:32.800]   So far, our conversations have been kind of one-sided.
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:33.520]   She's great.
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.320]   I mean, there's inflection.
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:36.720]   Of course, that was prerecorded.
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:38.680]   So that's another thing that Microsoft's doing,
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:39.920]   which is intelligent.
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:43.280]   These canned speeches-- and this is obviously one--
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:47.480]   are treated differently than synthesized speeches.
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.240]   So that sounded great.
[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:53.400]   That sounded great.
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:55.520]   Morgan Freeman would be good.
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:56.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:57.520]   Yeah.
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:58.760]   Oh, well, someday.
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:02.360]   Ask who Bill Gates is married to.
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:03.440]   Oh.
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:04.920]   Who is Bill Gates married to?
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:13.240]   Bill Gates is currently married to Melinda Gates.
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:14.600]   I like that currently.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:15.880]   I like that currently.
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:18.160]   Like, you know, right now, this is the answer.
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:19.360]   No, I fix that.
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:20.960]   I fix Olivia's.
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:23.960]   I would fix that.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.960]   Liketto.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:29.520]   She made a Christmas.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:31.600]   Well, we don't know what's going to happen in the future,
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:33.760]   but right now--
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:35.640]   Right now, things are good with Bill and Melinda.
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:37.160]   She's just a star of the years.
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:38.160]   Who is your father?
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.080]   Technically speaking, that would be Bill Gates.
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:47.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:49.120]   Oh, I love Danny Sullivan.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.320]   He does such a great job.
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:55.160]   And it's so much fun to be on this show with Jeff and Gina
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:57.160]   and the many guests that we've had on,
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:00.520]   including Kevin Marks, Matt Cuts, Danny Sullivan, Matthew
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.360]   Ingram.
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:04.400]   I think one of the best shows we do on the network,
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.640]   and I hope you watch each and every week.
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:07.920]   You can watch live.
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:09.440]   We do it every Wednesday, 1 p.m.
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:11.960]   Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time, 2,100
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:14.200]   UTC on live.twit.tv.
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:15.840]   But if you can't watch live, you can always
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:23.360]   get on-demand versions at twit.tv/twig.
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:24.200]   Cool, huh?
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:28.760]   If you can't download it there, you can always subscribe.
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:30.280]   In fact, that might even be the best way to get it.
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.960]   There are lots of ways to subscribe.
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:35.600]   Use your favorite podcatcher, iTunes, Xbox, music,
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:41.280]   Stitcher, TuneIn Radio, or one of the great Twit apps.
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:42.240]   We thank our developers.
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:45.200]   One of the things we're really grateful for in 2014
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:47.600]   is those great independent developers who've made
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:51.760]   Twit apps for us on iOS, Android, Windows, phone, Roku.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:52.920]   You guys are the greatest.
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:53.800]   Thank you.
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:56.160]   And I invite everybody to pick one and download it,
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:57.280]   install it on your smartphone.
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:00.120]   Put us on the front page so you never miss another episode.
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:01.440]   Thanks for being here.
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:04.600]   I wish you and yours the happiest 2015.
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:06.520]   Don't forget our New Year's Eve party.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:09.920]   3 a.m. New Year's Eve to 3 a.m. New Year's Day.
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:11.680]   I'll be up 24 hours.
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:15.240]   We'll be saying Happy New Year to every time zone in the world.
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:17.840]   We've got lots of acts and fun and bands
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:24.080]   and they'll be a electronic bowl and a bouncy bounce.
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:24.720]   And I don't know.
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:25.960]   It's going to be crazy.
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:31.080]   Please tune in 3 a.m. New Year's Eve to 3 a.m. New Year's Day.
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:34.360]   And if I don't see you then, I'll see you in 2015.
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:37.280]   Happy New Year from all of us at this week in Google.
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:39.080]   Bye-bye.
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:42.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:45.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:47.860]   you
