[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500]   It's time for Twig this week at Google. What a wild show.
[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.500]   We had this week. Jeff and Gina are here.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500]   We're going to talk about the thing I can't talk about.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.500]   Maybe the Pope will tweet and give me an indulgence.
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.500]   We'll talk about that too.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.500]   And why German tourists should never be allowed in Paris.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500]   Yes, it is. On Twig.
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.500]   Netcast, you love.

[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, I give you your This Week in Googlers.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   On the left, Ms. Gina Trapani of SmarterWare.org,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   lifehacker.com, founding editor,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   and I keep forgetting a columnist for Fast Company.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   No more, well, occasionally, but not as much.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I just read a column from you about eating frogs in the morning for breakfast.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Oh, you know, somehow that came up again.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I'd written that lecture a really long time ago.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   No kidding.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   It got some steam online, yeah, on Twitter.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Yeah, that was a while ago.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   That's so weird.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Evergreen, I like it.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I've gotten that a lot with the social news sources, like I use Prismatic, which I love.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   But I'm getting sometimes two or three year old articles.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Yeah, I've gotten a few people mentioning saying, "Okay, thanks for this article."
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And I was like, "Wow, I wrote that a while ago."
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   That's annoying.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Sure.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Also here, Jeff Jarvis, who is birthday-ized with his Google Peacock.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Peacock! I can't.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   You know, forever after, I'm going to think Peacock when people tilt their head with Google Peacock.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Well, no, the great thing is we now know it could have been Peacock.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   It totally could have been.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   No, it couldn't.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Because you can't say your Wi-Fi password.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Right?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Right.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   How do you like your glass?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Still liking it?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I'm enjoying the laughs when I demonstrate it.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   How about you, Gina?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I don't see you wearing it.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I don't wear it when I'm sitting on my computer, but I do wear it when I go out on the weekends.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   In fact, I was just at San Diego Pride this past weekend, and I had them on.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Actually, LaToya Jackson was there, random.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.400]   She was one of the parade leaders, and I snapped a quick picture of her, and she had a little
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   entourage.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   She was in a golf cart, and there were all these cameras and stuff.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.600]   But I generally, like, I take it out.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   We went to the county fair.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.000]   You know, if I go for a walk, if we go down to the beach, I'll take pictures.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.400]   But if I'm sitting in front of my computer, I don't have it on because I don't have the
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.000]   nerve to wear it in New York City.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Oh, you'd get punched in the face, wouldn't you?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I think so.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   It's a camera, though, right?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.800]   Gina, I mean, that sounds like the way you just described sound like a camera.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.600]   Yeah, I'm using it as a camera.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.100]   And, you know, here in San Diego, it's really sunny, so I always have the -- I often wear
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.600]   it with the sunglass piece, which makes the camera a little less conspicuous.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.400]   Like, people don't really notice it as much.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.700]   I use it mostly as a camera.
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.100]   I use it for navigation, and I do enjoy getting text messages just kind of, you know, popped
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.400]   up in my face without having to check my phone.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   But that's basically what I use it for.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.600]   And I obviously take tons of pictures of the baby and little short videos of the baby
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   that grandma and grandma love.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   I don't know if I said this last one, but I think it's three things.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.800]   Three, three, three minutes in one.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   It's a camera.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.800]   You can record your life.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   Number one, number two, it gives you alerts.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.600]   And number three, it gives you instructions, including directions.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   Yeah, somebody was walking --
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.600]   The video of my year.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.280]   I think it was a baritone day or somebody walking around New York and said this is a
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.600]   perfect use as a pedestrian.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.600]   Yeah, navigation as a pedestrian, definitely.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   And even driving, I mean, I don't recommend that you have the navigation on while you're
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.300]   driving, but there are times when I'll be in the passenger seat and have it on or I'll
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.200]   look up something beforehand to get places.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   So the nav is great.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.500]   And the walking nav is particularly good because it knows which way you're facing,
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.400]   which is very, very useful, especially in a dense place like New York.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.100]   I found another fringe benefit to having it, which is up on the rundown.
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.300]   On the bottom thing, I'm in a glass, is that what I'm now dubbing glass selfies.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.000]   Because I demonstrate them to other people and of course they want to put them on them.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   What do they do?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   They take pictures.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Of you.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.400]   So I have a whole, a huge, that's kind of cool actually.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   28 pictures there of me.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   I kind of like that.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.600]   What a handsome fellow you are.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   All right.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.600]   I kind of like that.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.800]   Again, me, me, me, me.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.800]   Glass selfies.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   That's pretty funny, actually.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.880]   So I've heard of at least two or three publications who have asked me and directly
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.160]   are through friends, how do we get ahold of a pair, you know, some glass so we can send
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.960]   a writer out to do kind of stunt, like see, you know, record people's reactions to it
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.040]   or, you know, see how, how weird they look.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.600]   Kind of like doing the, excuse me, but the, the, the, the, look, look at this glass whole
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.360]   piece basically, which is.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.800]   Which means it's jumped the shark.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.800]   It's over.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800]   Time to move on.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.800]   I'm seriously.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   I love that.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800]   It's a little sad.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.520]   It says local news is doing glass stories.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   It's over.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.960]   Although I saw, oh, I wish I probably run out.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.960]   I don't think I did.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.960]   Did I, where I did?
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.960]   I did.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.960]   I did.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.960]   I did.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.960]   I did.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.960]   I did.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.960]   The NFL team.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.960]   No, no, well that not an onion headline.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.960]   This is a real headline.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.440]   Area woman exploring use of Google Glass.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:29.400]   And how it'll affect your weekend after this.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.240]   Well, ESPN took it down to practice one of the NFL teams.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.240]   I don't remember what.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.240]   That's actually needs to watch.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.240]   You never catch a ball is pretty cool.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.960]   Yeah, actually catch a ball is pretty cool.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.960]   Sounds bad.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.960]   It's a tribute.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.800]   Area woman has glass.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.400]   We have a whole glass section on our rundown here.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.600]   We have a huge section.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.080]   We have the NFL players with glass.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.680]   We have Larry Page worrying into the wedding.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.120]   Oh, don't let somebody is it his wedding?
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.480]   No, no, he was a groom's man.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.480]   Okay.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.480]   Yes.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.080]   So what's the story?
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.040]   Do we are we going to see a bunch of pictures on his Google Plus of his brother's wedding?
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.160]   We should you see him doing the more subtle.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.840]   We don't see Larry Page going, okay, glass.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.040]   We see him doing that.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.040]   Always wearing a click.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.640]   Now, apparently Google has patented glass a way of making melding glass with prescription
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.080]   lenses, which is good news for people like me.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.320]   Most of these are pictures of Larry's attractive wife.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.320]   It seems.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.320]   Yeah, she is a track.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.320]   Where is the story?
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   Where are the pictures?
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.320]   Sorry, the pictures that he took.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.120]   I don't know if he actually shared them.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.120]   God, I don't know.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.360]   I guess I would well, if it were my wedding, I would welcome somebody wearing glass because
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.840]   he's documenting the wedding, right?
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.340]   We gave when I got married 20 years ago, we gave instant, you know, this is how long
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.400]   ago it was in disposable instamatics to everybody.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.160]   They were at every tables and take pictures and then leave them on the table and we'll
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.160]   get them developed.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.800]   This is kind of like that.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.520]   It was in Croatia.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.720]   Nice playside here.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.720]   Yes.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.720]   Nice beaches and things.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.720]   Yes.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.720]   Okay.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.720]   So NFL glass.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.400]   That was pretty cool.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.760]   So are these people who lent their glass to players or?
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.560]   Yeah, or a UESP and a reporter put them on the players.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.560]   Oh, he had it.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.560]   Okay.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.560]   She put them on.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.560]   She.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.560]   Yes.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.560]   They had them on the platform.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.560]   That's kind of cool.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.360]   Now, I bet I'm thinking she had to start the recording for him.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.640]   No, she's about to throw the ball.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.640]   Wow.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.640]   That's cool.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.640]   I guess.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.640]   The catching is even better.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.080]   Well, you know, you see this stuff.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:57.440]   You see this stuff on NFL coverage anyway because they have helmet cams and stuff.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.760]   In fact, the coach was saying, you know, you really could see the helmet, every helmet
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.960]   being equipped with this kind of thing.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.360]   And for viewers to be able to watch the game from any players, give them perspective.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.360]   Right.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.680]   I don't know if I'd want that though.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.040]   It's a little like little player witch.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.600]   Well, you know, because when the network's used it, it's a little, it's a special thing.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.080]   You see it all the time in race cars.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.600]   They'll have special, you know, cameras in their race cars.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.080]   The first person is nothing.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.800]   Yeah, there's nothing turning left.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   I'm turning left now.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   I'm going to turn left some more.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.240]   There's nothing new to the idea of first person.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.240]   No, no, no.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.520]   That's just maybe makes it easier.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.360]   Easy enough for an NFL player to use.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.240]   Almost.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.600]   So Jeff demoed a glass at the Guardian activate.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.880]   That's where some of those pictures came from.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.920]   You have that was where you interviewed Vince surf.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.280]   Vint, the wonderful that they just put the video up this morning.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.440]   Yay.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.840]   I want to watch it.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.640]   Vint is amazing.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.480]   Yeah, we talked about the fact that you did it.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.480]   Last week.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.680]   But yeah, so actually, you should just not do the show and play the interview.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.680]   20 minutes.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.320]   Yeah, that's the demo one.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.000]   Okay, highlights.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.240]   Anything?
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.840]   You're not wearing glass during the interview.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.840]   No.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.840]   I have audio from.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.840]   Where is that?
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.840]   Oh, that's you.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.840]   Okay.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.840]   I'll see you using the screen cast.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.840]   Nice.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:31.160]   And you said they very kindly edited out the.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:36.240]   It took me like 20 times the way the waiter for the screen cast on is you've got a photograph.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.600]   The barcode on the phone with the glass.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.440]   Oh, God.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.360]   And trying to get it in the right spot is nearly impossible because you can't preview
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.360]   the photo.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.800]   And so I was on stage.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:57.160]   So the good first impression when they put a GoPro quality camera on this thing, then
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   maybe I'll be impressed.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.560]   But then I then I then in my feed it takes a while for the photos to come up.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:08.280]   So then three days later, I'll see 20 pictures of half a key one code.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.280]   That's pretty funny.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:17.280]   Here's here's something Mr. Robert scoble shot with glass about about a week ago.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.160]   Look, that smiling face.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.440]   And I think I know who that is in the background here.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.960]   That Apple gentleman.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:29.240]   This is Darya Musk, the wonderful performer who made her name on Google plus by doing
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.920]   a 24 hour broadcast and singing.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.800]   She was saying a couple of songs for us at a mystery event.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.560]   And then there's a mystery guy holding a mystery device.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.360]   Not that you would say it's a phone or confirmed.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.360]   I can't confirm.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:51.560]   I can I think I can tell you that that is in fact Rick Rick Osterlo, who's senior vice
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.760]   president for product management at Motorola.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.440]   In fact, Rick's a great guy.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.200]   I had a great time talking to him.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.240]   He's the guy who created Moto Blur.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.480]   He created the first Motorola Android phone, which is the click.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.120]   It was kind of a social media phone.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.080]   I don't know if you remember that.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.080]   He left Motorola and then came back.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.520]   Don't know why he was there.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.520]   Don't know what that is.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.520]   He's holding.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.960]   By the way, there's Mike Elgin, Ben Parr.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.000]   Really small cable box Leo.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.200]   That's what it was.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.720]   We were looking at the new Motorola desktop.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.960]   You figured it out.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.440]   Laura Fitt and a lot of bloggers at the event.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.840]   And if I scroll a little farther, there's a guy Kawasaki.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.080]   How's the food?
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.320]   Food was very nice.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.320]   The event was very fun.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.240]   Was it just like a barbecue?
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.240]   You guys look like a job.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.480]   This was the-- there were several portions to the event.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.560]   I think I could say that.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.440]   I should explain for those who don't know.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.800]   I foolishly signed a non-disclosure agreement.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.960]   So while I was at this event-- and I can't deny it
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.480]   because Robert Scobel took video and posted it of me there--
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.520]   I can't talk about what the event was--
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.240]   what I saw at the event.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.960]   But I can do this.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.280]   I realized they didn't NDA the gift bag that we're all--
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.200]   you could see in the video.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.560]   We've all got these blue bags.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.040]   I'm swag.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.520]   That got me real excited until I saw what was in it.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:22.920]   A copy of Guy Kawasaki's book, "Ape--
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.520]   How to Publish a Book."
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.600]   A copy of this book, which is interesting by--
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.720]   maybe you know this book, Jeff--
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.160]   "Influence-- The Psychology of Persuasion" by Robert B. C.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.360]   L. Deeney.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.960]   I'm seeing it on the stands.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.360]   As far as my--
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:39.880]   I'll read it.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.240]   It looks really interesting.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.560]   It's called "A Classic Book on Persuasion--
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.720]   The Psychology of Why People Say Yes to NDA's."
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.000]   Oh, well, that's why they--
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.440]   that's why they gave it out.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.000]   Oh, this is interesting.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.640]   Oh, no.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.000]   This is a Motorola battery pack.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.680]   I think this was the product we were there to see, actually.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.040]   And a pair of headphones.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.080]   That's it.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:03.600]   That's it.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.680]   Oh, I want to grill you.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.680]   But I want to--
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.680]   Oh, I want to grill you.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.880]   So I want to ask every question that I want to--
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.400]   Yes.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:17.720]   You know what?
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.840]   I won't do that to you.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.040]   Can you imagine that as much as you want to ask,
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:22.880]   I want to answer?
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.880]   You want to tell.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.200]   That's what you do.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.800]   There's been so many leaks, though.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.320]   There's photos of Eric Schmidt using the phone.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.000]   There's galleries--
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.680]   It's kind of the worst kept secret.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.880]   And in fact, I think that at this point, there's really not
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.960]   much that I could add.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.960]   And Jeanie, right, Cleo.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.480]   OK.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.600]   All right.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.200]   Let's get Leo suede.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.360]   What can we do to get Leo suede?
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.600]   No, thanks.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.840]   I'm not going to say anything.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.720]   They were very specific.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.920]   They said, you may see leaks.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:54.200]   You cannot confirm anything you see until the embargo is lifted.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.800]   And I think even if I were to tell you the date of the embargo
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.320]   being lifted, it would be a giveaway of some information
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.440]   as well.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.760]   However, I think that Jeff said I could say this.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.920]   I was actually very excited about what I did see.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.640]   And I think for reasons that will become clear,
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.920]   it's a significant thing.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.840]   OK.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.480]   A very significant thing.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.840]   Wow.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.840]   So I'm going to regret my one, aren't I?
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.160]   That's what you're saying.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.160]   I'm going to regret this.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.240]   That's what he said before?
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.240]   Well, given your preferences and phones and so forth--
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:36.000]   I'm not saying it's a phone, but given what I know about you,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.760]   yes.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.680]   It's a non-trivial thing.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.640]   OK.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:41.840]   All right.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.840]   So can we talk about the leaks, or do you not want to talk about this?
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.920]   No, we can talk about the leaks.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.480]   All I can't do is say yes or no.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.360]   But there were quite a few leaks, and most of them
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.560]   were fairly credible.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.000]   I have to say, especially that Rogers video.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.880]   Yeah, that Rogers video was pretty.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.560]   So it sounds like sensors are always on listening.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.920]   And it sounds like battery life, although you would think
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.680]   that those two things would go again.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.680]   I mean, the phone always listening for the hot word,
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.560]   the OK Google now.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.560]   It seems like the kind of thing that we're killing a battery.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.520]   Are you doing that?
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.560]   One of the leaks said there were two different processors doing
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.480]   that, and that's how the--
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.000]   limited.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.360]   One was just assigned to listen.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.440]   And we certainly know the notion of listening.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.680]   We can certainly see patterns of that in number one,
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.120]   obviously, OK glass.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.760]   And number two, we saw stuff at I/O that was pretty amazing,
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.720]   that you're going to be able to say to your laptop machine, OK
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.560]   Google, search for a junior in Japan.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.200]   And we know that they've worked on that,
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.680]   and they had demos of that with phones.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.200]   So we know that's the pipeline.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.840]   Right, and that's how glass works as well.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.240]   I think that this is really interesting,
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.840]   because we talked a little bit about this on Twitch.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.320]   If you live in a world where your devices are listening all
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:56.600]   the time, does that feel intrusive?
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.080]   You know?
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.760]   I feel a little weird, but weirded out by that.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.360]   People talked about with the Xbox One,
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.240]   the fact that that connects camera is always listening
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.320]   and is always on, as this very Orwellian device in your hands.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.040]   Yeah, but Leo, I already saw--
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.560]   I already put up some post on Google+,
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.040]   and the fifth comment down was exactly that.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.680]   It's predictable.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.080]   We're going to see news stories about this.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.720]   But when we asked about that, and we asked about that
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:28.080]   on somebody else on the floor at I/O, it only listens locally.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.840]   It only turns it all, it only wakes it up.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.560]   That's all it does, and it's local.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.680]   It is not something that goes over the network.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.720]   Right, it's listening for a particular word when it hears
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.800]   that-- and by the way, I don't know
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.440]   how whatever this thing is will work,
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.200]   but this is the Rogers video.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.720]   But that's what I think people are saying,
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.040]   is that certainly how the Google Chrome was working,
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.160]   it's not sending everything-- well,
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.920]   you have to trust Google when they say this.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.120]   It's not sending everything back.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.880]   That would be a lot of data, though.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.080]   It would be.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.720]   It's just listening for a word, and the phone has enough--
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.520]   or the computer has enough capability to say,
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.320]   hey, I'm not going to do anything until I hear that word.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.520]   But when I hear that word, I'm going to say hello.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.440]   Now, on the other hand, we hear post-NSA
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.280]   that they can listen to you even with your phone turned off.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.680]   They can listen to you all the time.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.200]   And these days, I don't know what the thing is paranoid.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.080]   I don't know.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.760]   I've seen phones-- I think they were more intended for husbands
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:33.360]   to plant on their wayward wives or vice versa.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.760]   But the phones that had microphones you could turn on,
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.000]   cameras you could turn on without anybody's knowledge.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.640]   So now that's a specific piece of hardware
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.520]   that's designed to do that.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.960]   If the phrase is OK Google now, that's a little obnoxious.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.760]   Yeah, and I would hope that you could customize it.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.000]   But I don't know.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.800]   That would be nice.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.320]   My Jersey version, of course, is yo, yo, Google.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.280]   Yeah, that'd be great.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.760]   Can you do that with the glass?
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.760]   You can't do that, right?
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.280]   No, you can't.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.680]   No, you have to say OK, Google Glass.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.200]   OK, Glass.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:05.880]   OK, Glass.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.920]   We had the story on the rundown about how the word was raised
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.720]   and the woman who did it.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.680]   It's very funny because it's so Google.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.200]   She said that at Google, you've got to present
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.040]   like 10 options.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.880]   But there probably was the first idea I had,
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.840]   was the best idea I had.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.360]   Yeah, I think of any other options.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.400]   What about bacon?
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.600]   What about go-go gadget somebody said in the chair?
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.840]   Go-go glass.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.960]   Glassicous.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.360]   Pew, pew, pew.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.720]   That's good.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.840]   No, it's not.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.480]   I think it'd be nice if you could customize this.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.760]   One thing that is an issue with glass--
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.520]   I'll say this cryptically.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.120]   There is one thing that's an issue with glass
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.120]   that is not an issue with this device.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.880]   That doesn't help at all, does it?
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.160]   Oh, let me guess.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.000]   I'm going to say it in the process.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.240]   I'm going to guess that it can record--
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.000]   the problem with glass is that even if I'm standing five feet
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.200]   away and someone else is worried,
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.440]   if I say the phrase OK, Glass, Glass, listen,
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.160]   then I'm going to guess they found a way to fix that.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.040]   That Rogers video, there was a bit about it,
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.600]   learns your voice.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.480]   Big's pickup.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.040]   Boy, that would be great if they could do that.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.280]   attorneys, Leo said nothing.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.960]   They definitely said that.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.240]   So that to me meant--
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.240]   But actually, Leo--
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:21.840]   Yes, it goes my voice.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.120]   Actually, I'm afraid you might have signed that NDA
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.920]   on behalf of the entire Twit Network.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.160]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:29.640]   OK.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.600]   You guys could do anything you want.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.000]   OK, good.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.600]   That was based on the Rogers video.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.320]   That was--
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.040]   You know.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.200]   That would be a nice thing.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.040]   Because I actually have seen that happen.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.440]   Oh, what happens all the time?
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.480]   Yeah, I could-- you know, if you say OK, Glass,
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.720]   I could say take a picture.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.320]   It takes a picture.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.680]   Well, I'm trying to tell people how to do it.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.000]   And so I have to whisper to them.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.400]   So now, what does it say there?
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:53.400]   Right.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.400]   Save that.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400]   Right.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.000]   That's so frustrating.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.080]   And if it does know your voice, there's other things
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.640]   you can do, like unlock when you hear my voice
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.440]   tech, that kind of thing.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.600]   I mean, not the best security in the world, of course.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.080]   And we know the issues face unlock.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.200]   But it seems like that knowing your voice
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.640]   is useful in a few different ways.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.160]   Well, yeah, you're going to be able to do it.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.840]   I heard today something some reference
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.760]   to be able to go to stores and buy things with your face.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.480]   I could say this.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.480]   There are features of this phone that no one has revealed yet.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.080]   Oh.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.720]   That's exciting.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.680]   Oh, Leo, you're killing me.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.840]   Because there's obviously--
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.360]   there's obviously a big thing here.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.440]   And I'm not really not sure if we've hit it in the leaks.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.960]   And oh, god.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.160]   OK.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.720]   This is killing me a little bit.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.120]   So the voice activation we know about, what else do we know?
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.280]   It's supposed to be customizable.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.080]   The back plate.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.840]   The front plate.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.840]   The Rogers said only black or white.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.360]   You're right.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:53.920]   Black plate.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.440]   And August.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.720]   That's the leaks at August.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.720]   So we don't have to wait that long.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.480]   That's the Rogers.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.760]   I'm hoping to hear your full--
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.320]   Camera looks good, shutter.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.320]   How long do you have to return the HTC One?
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.240]   That's a good question.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.080]   I should look that up.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.720]   I may look that up right now.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.560]   I'm looking at my Play Store email.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.960]   We do know that there is a Motorola event,
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.600]   but I think it's a droid event on the 24th.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.240]   Right.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.080]   Yeah, I think it's good.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.360]   That's next week.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.880]   I have my old Galaxy Nexus.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.360]   I can send to you until you get another phone.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.800]   Oh.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.240]   Oh, I love my one.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.440]   I love my one, too.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:36.960]   You know, it's funny.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.680]   I go back and forth with the Galaxy S4 and the one.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.120]   Here's my fear, my big fear.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.640]   And after I say this little, I'm going
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.360]   to count down from 10.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.600]   And if you leave your chair before I say--
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.600]   No, no, I can't do anything.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.240]   They're watching me like hawks.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.200]   I got to tell you.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:54.880]   Here's my fear.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.600]   My fear is that this time they're
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.880]   going to suck up to the carriers and not release
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:06.040]   a pure Google experience phone and unlocked, et cetera,
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:06.720]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.560]   And you're going to have to buy them through the carrier.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.200]   Because when Rogers said it was exclusive in Canada to Rogers,
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.240]   then we've heard reports that could be more than one carrier
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.240]   in the US.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.240]   I hope to heck I can just buy it on the Play Store.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.600]   Well, all I would say is--
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.640]   and I would say this whether I knew something or not--
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.400]   all I could say is this is the--
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.520]   I'm pretty sure is the--
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.240]   everything up to now for Motorola
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.880]   has been in the pipeline before Google's acquisition.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.280]   This is the first phone after Google
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.080]   that they've released after Google really got in there
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.080]   and said this is what we're going to do.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.280]   And I would expect to see--
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.720]   and from what you've seen in the leaks,
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.080]   I think, kind of confirmed this, I
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.080]   would expect to see a lot of influence from Google
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.280]   on what Motorola does here.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.720]   I agree with all of that.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.840]   My fear is the business model.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.400]   And we have seen Google misstep--
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.440]   Google's misstep twice, as far as I've been serving--
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.680]   big ways, right?
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.200]   The devil's deal with Verizon and going into China.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.440]   And why does Google do that?
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.440]   Google does that because they want
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.200]   to make nice with some partner, whether that's
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.960]   the Chinese government or Verizon.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.560]   And that's what always gets them in trouble.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.720]   When Google does what Google wants to do,
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.400]   it does the right thing, so far, as a rule.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.640]   Or maybe the third possibility, of course, is the NSA.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.760]   We'll know more about that later.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.200]   So if there are moments to come along
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.160]   when Google makes nice with phone companies, for example--
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.240]   I think only because they've had to--
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.640]   Apple was the first one to really have the clout
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.680]   to say to a phone company, no, we're going to do it this way.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.560]   For instance, the iPhone-- one of the reasons
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.760]   I think people love the iPhone is there's little or no
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.920]   crap wear on it.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.960]   It is a pure phone no matter who you get it from.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.240]   And it's one of the reasons I was just reading an article
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.320]   today about you cannot legitimately buy an iPhone in Russia
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.880]   because the major Russia, the four major Russian carriers who
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:25:00.000]   dominate the market are just don't like Apple's
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.120]   egregious requirements.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.680]   Yeah, and so they just said, we're not going to sell it.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.960]   And there's a big black or gray market in iPhones,
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.040]   apparently, but nobody's selling it directly in Russia.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.360]   And I think that if they could have--
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.640]   if the iPhone hadn't been as successful as it was,
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.880]   I think you would have seen a very different experience.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.160]   But Apple really put the screws to these guys.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.840]   The question is, why hasn't Google-- does Google
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.520]   have something-- is it possible Google has something that
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.400]   gives them enough clout that they could do that?
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.480]   I think at this point, Android-- it's very clear Android
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.160]   is a platform at least half of your customers want,
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.160]   if not more.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.160]   Right.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.040]   And the T-Mobile model we talked about last week, and since
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.600]   then the AT&T model, which lets you upgrade sooner than two
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.960]   years, though I think the Verge said stay away from the AT&T
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.280]   model, but whatever.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.800]   I wonder whether those are maybe perhaps in response to
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.480]   what they expect from Google.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.520]   I also think it's interesting that Google's done these two
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.440]   Google experience phones.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.960]   I think to some degree that this HTC One and Galaxy
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.800]   has four ways of saying to their partners, look, yeah, we
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.040]   own a phone company, and we're about to come out with a phone.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.440]   But really, we love you guys, too.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.480]   See, you're in our store, too, which tells me-- you don't do
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.560]   that, I would guess.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.160]   What you're about to come out with something big.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.520]   And you plan to sell it as well.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.120]   Well, but then the next problem is--
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.160]   So that seems to me--
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.880]   My strategic thinking would be, OK, if you're Google, well,
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.040]   we want to sell this store in our store.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:40.080]   If we do that, though, if we make it, let's say, in Nexus,
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.600]   now this is our company.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:46.600]   The previous Nexus is what LG and HTC--
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.120]   HTC.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:47.960]   Samsung.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.760]   And Samsung.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.920]   So if we now suddenly say what Google doesn't want to do is
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.160]   tell those guys who are very successfully selling Android
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.920]   phones, we'll take it from here.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.280]   So to me, that would explain why all of a sudden you saw
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.760]   the HTC One and Galaxy S4.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.560]   Oh, it's not your scenario.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.120]   Is they put it up there next to those two phones.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.960]   And those two phones are selling for $600.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:14.160]   And meanwhile, the Nexus 4 sold for $200.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.720]   Hmm.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:16.880]   I was distracted.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.120]   Did you say something?
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.960]   OK.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.640]   OK.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.960]   God, I hate this.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.520]   Leo has news to patience.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.400]   I would really not be--
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.400]   I'd be a terrible corporate executive.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.920]   I am a terrible corporate executive.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.920]   Come and take it.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.800]   That's why you have Lisa.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.080]   She is great at secrecy.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.200]   But the problem is I know it, and so I say it.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.040]   She signed the end of the day.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:51.920]   She's got no problem.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.600]   She was with me.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.800]   She saw the whole thing.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.400]   She saw the whole thing.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.840]   And I have to say, she did a great job
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.120]   of negotiating some stuff.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.400]   Really?
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.160]   We'll say what that is, either.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.320]   Catch up?
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.680]   Yeah, we got great deal on catch up.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.560]   What a waxes for everybody.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.840]   I'm a terrible poker player, too.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.240]   Oh, here she comes.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.480]   Lisa's got the goods.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.840]   I'm starting to sweat now.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.240]   You're doing a Bernie.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.040]   Starting to sweat.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.680]   She says, I just want to make sure you're not saying anything.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.040]   He shouldn't say, well, I went through the bag already.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.280]   No, he's been good.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.080]   Tell me what I said that you've been good.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.440]   Jeff is a journalism professor.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.200]   I'm using him as my guide as to what I can and cannot do.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.200]   Did you save that thing we signed?
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.160]   Did you get a copy of it?
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.000]   I didn't.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.920]   No, it's not just to you.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.800]   No, no, I mean, I think we should have a copy of it,
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.200]   so we know what we signed.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.840]   I forgot to ask for one.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.440]   Anyway.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.400]   Well, I don't need a copy.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.640]   It was an NDA, so we wouldn't do it.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.120]   Yeah, we won't talk about it.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.040]   That's what we said.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.200]   She's going back into her office.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.520]   Something tells me we're changing the subject.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.800]   Yeah, let's change this up, because this is killing me too.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.840]   I want to just start yelling out things, but let's just--
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.360]   So the rumors are-- and this is another interesting one.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.760]   And by the way, I do not know anything germane on this one.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.720]   The Google is going to spend half a billion dollars
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.040]   on marketing of the Moto X phone.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.880]   And I have no idea about that.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.480]   But what's interesting is that's more than Apple spends
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.680]   marketing the iPhone, half a billion dollars.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.760]   You want something that's going to make the other manufacturers
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.960]   nervous, that's going to make them--
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.600]   That's going to make them crazy.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.960]   On the other hand, that may be for Verizon Sprint AT&T
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.080]   and the carriers, right?
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:43.960]   Co-op deals.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.760]   Co-op, that's basically--
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.160]   if you said I'm going to give $100 million to each of them,
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.280]   and then I'll have $100 million for ads, that might make sense.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:53.880]   Because--
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.120]   It's worldwide too.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.440]   It's worldwide.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.320]   Yeah, actually, that half a billion is not just in the US.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.280]   It includes Europe.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.520]   It's been announced that they're going
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.960]   to manufacture this phone in the US.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.360]   That's not even a leak.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.720]   They have said that, yes.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.640]   Is it not loud?
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.280]   And the thesis on that is that will allow them to customize it.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.040]   And this is something Apple isn't really able to do.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.080]   Apple, in order to make the vast number of phones,
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.640]   they have to make has to make it in China.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.040]   And--
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.080]   But here's my concern there.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.280]   I'm just being more worried today.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.880]   The concern there is we're going to be hitting the button.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.320]   Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.080]   We're going to have to wait for months before we
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.120]   can order that our phone.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.600]   Are they going to have sufficient stock and capacity?
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.000]   And I'm sure you didn't discuss that at the launch that
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.600]   didn't happen.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.120]   I might have.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.400]   That worries me.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.480]   I might have talked about that.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:51.720]   This is like how to torture leave.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:55.680]   For me, you want to torture me, drop me on a bridge, right?
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.440]   For other people, you want to torture them,
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.360]   have them with rats.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.480]   Leo, tell them something he can't repeat.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:00.980]   Yeah.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.000]   Torture.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:03.840]   I wish I could.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.800]   I mean, there's been a lot said.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.040]   And I think the most important thing
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.320]   is there is more to say.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.520]   That's the one thing I think I'd spare to say.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.280]   There is more to say.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.360]   For all that's been leaked, and there's been a lot leaked.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.800]   So Gina, what's the return policy?
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.960]   Yeah, I'm going to have to send those back.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.480]   I mean, Leo, I'm going to have to send this thing back, aren't I?
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.320]   Not yet.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:29.840]   Not yet.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.080]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.560]   It could be 14 days or 30 days.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.000]   It's either 14 days or 30 days.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.800]   Yeah, that's what I got.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.520]   I got to find out.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.600]   Does the chat room and say, may I
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.760]   know what the return policy is on the Google 30 days in the place?
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:41.920]   Nobody's waiting.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.000]   How 75 said 30 days.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.560]   You got plenty of time.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.680]   I don't trust the wait how.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.160]   Plenty of time.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:47.760]   OK.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.360]   OK.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:48.960]   OK.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.280]   All right.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.480]   So August, early August, we're going to know.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.640]   I'm just saying.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.160]   Just saying.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:53.800]   Don't worry.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.200]   You got time to return your phone.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.360]   The people said 14 days.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:56.880]   Oh, no.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.880]   Wait, I'm looking.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.600]   15% restocking fee says Web 96.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.360]   15 days would be problematic.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.600]   OK.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.520]   Now we're really check order status.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:16.840]   Hey, by the way, did you see that--
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.440]   so T-Mobile had this plan that every six months new phone.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.800]   We talked about it last week.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.200]   AT&T and Sprinter doing the same thing.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.440]   Although some have said that it's a really crappy deal
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.920]   if you do the AT&T deal.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.680]   The verge has a rundown on the 80s.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.720]   It's not a-- it's financially a bad idea,
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.400]   but I bet you people do it just because they want some excuse
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.560]   to get a new phone every six months.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.200]   This is the jump.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.800]   I fight it better just to buy the darn phone open and then
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.640]   add it.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.040]   So now Google is having an event in one week.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.680]   On July 24 in the morning Sundar Pachai will be there.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.240]   Now, unfortunately, it used to be if it were Sundar,
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.920]   you'd say, oh, it's Chrome.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.200]   It would not have known it for.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.200]   Now he's Android and Chrome.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:56.800]   So you don't know it?
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.000]   Damn it.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.520]   So we don't know what that will be about.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.280]   4.3 sounds like it might be.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.120]   Because we haven't heard much about that.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.680]   Well, I'm getting the feeling at this point that there's--
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.480]   even 4.3 Android is not going to be a big change.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.600]   Do you get that feeling?
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.360]   Now it isn't.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:19.800]   It isn't.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.720]   All we know about it is that there's
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.200]   going to be some camera UI changes.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.040]   But the fact that it's a minor release,
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.720]   I don't think it'll be.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.560]   Well, let me ask a couple questions about that.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:34.920]   So if always on listening is just part of the OS,
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:35.880]   is that potential?
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.280]   Or do you think that that has to be built in to the hardware?
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.320]   I mean, we know the impact on batteries
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:41.720]   is going to be.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.560]   But who knows what was built into this hardware
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.060]   before?
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.120]   That's one question.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.160]   Second is you have the phone stuff.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.880]   The Rogers video showed some really neat camera stuff,
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.040]   where you didn't have to hit a button.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:51.800]   You could hit the screen.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:52.880]   You could do other things.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.520]   That, I presume, is just OS changes.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.720]   So we could see some of the things that were shown in that video
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.560]   that Leo can't confirm.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.060]   Yeah.
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.200]   Of those things could be in the next version of the OS.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.000]   And one of those things couldn't be because they're
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.480]   hardware dependent.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.120]   We should also say that might not be.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.440]   The other thing he could be announcing is new tablets.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.360]   They're overdue for an XS7 replacement, right?
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.320]   They sure are.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.840]   That's true.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.720]   The other thing he could be announcing is--
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.680]   I don't know what.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.400]   This is the 24--
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:22.760]   Chromebooks?
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.400]   New Chromebooks?
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.520]   Could there be an update to Chrome OS?
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.160]   Well, they constantly update it.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.200]   Yeah, it's constantly updated.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.000]   But I mean, like some big thing.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.040]   Oh, like they're releasing a new--
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.640]   We did a deal with Dell or something.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.160]   I don't know.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:40.120]   Well, they could be doing the OK Google voice thing for machines.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:44.880]   I'd love to see a $400 Chromebook that was like--
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.120]   Well, the HP one is out.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.840]   The HP has 14 inch screen.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.840]   All right.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.960]   And 16 gigs--
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.640]   four gigs memory was supposed to two, which is really good.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.600]   16 gigs solid-state drive.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.520]   I went to Best Buy and looked at it.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.440]   It's still--
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.920]   pardon me, it's still HP.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:05.520]   I wouldn't--
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.320]   Trappad is that weird bumpy thing.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:13.600]   I mentioned on Twitter that my Chromebook pixel is my breakfast
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.320]   computer.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.200]   It's on the table.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.840]   And I-- it's the only time I use it is breakfast, sometimes
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.600]   a little bit of watching TV.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.520]   Because it doesn't really have full computer.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.520]   It's a browser.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.600]   It's a browsing computer.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.320]   But I do think for students that it's not a bad idea.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:33.880]   And this is a breakfast event, apparently.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.760]   You're going to be breakfasting with a frinar.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.400]   So I'm thinking maybe Sundar heard me.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.960]   I'll bring my-- I'll bring my pixel.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.000]   Are you going to recover?
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:43.440]   How are we--
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.440]   Wasn't invited.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.840]   Just because I know Guy Kawasaki apparently does not
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.000]   get me into other events.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.400]   Oh, and there will be a live stream.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.040]   It looks like--
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.540]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.560]   So we probably should cover that.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.880]   You know, the 24th is the second anniversary
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.360]   of our moving into our new studio.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.360]   So we're going to be having a party.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:02.860]   Wow.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:03.800]   Time flies.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.280]   I know.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.280]   I never did find my grip.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.280]   This is a good timing.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.720]   This is right before the show.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.720]   So I guess we probably will.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.800]   I hadn't really-- this invitation went out this morning.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.960]   But I think that that's probably what we'll do.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.040]   I'm just checking to see if I have any email from Sundar.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.000]   But I don't see anything.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Jason, did you get an invitation to the Google event
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.120]   on Wednesday?
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.480]   Did anybody here get an invitation to the Google
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.040]   event on Wednesday?
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.360]   No.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.760]   So is that before that it's breakfast?
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.560]   So we'll know what it is by the time our show's on.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:42.540]   That's perfect.
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.280]   It's good timing.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.120]   Because we'll be able to discuss.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:46.880]   So any bets?
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.120]   I'm going to bet a Nexus 7 or something like that.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.280]   Somebody said in the chat room, there's a rumor that it'll
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.160]   be a 299 versus 199.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:58.280]   I keep on picking up the Note 8.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.080]   Because I would like to have the pen.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.600]   But it's just that extra inches just.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.520]   So you know what?
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.640]   Also, what we found with our reviewers
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:12.240]   is that in order to get it to work with a stylus,
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.800]   you have to put this whack-um layer on top of it that--
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.240]   Really?
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.920]   --reduces the quality of the screen.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.400]   That's what you said, Jason, right?
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.600]   You didn't like the Note says screen as much.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.960]   And we think it's because it had to do with a stylus.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.720]   Whack-um or wake-um?
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.720]   I don't care.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:32.600]   I like whack-um.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.320]   You said that.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.480]   I was like, oh, what now?
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.240]   You know, wake-um, whack-um, whatever.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.960]   I like whack-um.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:42.520]   Whack-um.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.240]   I just say because I like to say whack-um.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.760]   So if we think Moto X is August, then we
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.000]   think that this event next week is--
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.520]   I wouldn't be surprised if it was a new Nexus 7 or a new Chromebook.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.040]   Or maybe both.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.320]   This seems like a pretty low key.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.920]   Join us for breakfast with Sundar.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.920]   It seems kind of maybe like just a little--
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.920]   Could just be breakfast.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.480]   Yeah, it could be an update to--
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.720]   I don't know.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.320]   He does what?
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.720]   He does Android and Chrome.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.080]   That's it.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:07.800]   Android and Chrome.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.320]   It could be Android 4, 2, 3.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.000]   Yeah, it could be the new Nexus 7.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.640]   It could really could be either or both.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.360]   Although I don't see them announcing anything about Chrome
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.800]   that isn't a new Chromebook, right?
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.200]   Because Chrome constantly updates.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.160]   And we've just seen a bunch of Chrome stuff in preview at I/O,
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.400]   right?
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.080]   Right.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.040]   So to get back to the jump plan, Eric Raven's craft writing
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:38.920]   on Lifehacker did a breakdown of the T-Mobile, the AT&T
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.920]   frequent up-grader plan.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.560]   It's so hard to figure this out.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:50.080]   Across the board, he says, you will pay more, both over the short
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.400]   term and the long term.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.320]   Of course, you don't get to keep a device you don't finish paying off.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.120]   These are trade-ins.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.360]   And it doesn't mean-- and it wouldn't think it does mean
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:04.080]   is if you owe anything on the phone, you're stuck with the carrier
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.920]   unless you pay off the phone.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:11.360]   The other thing he says is that AT&T next is a huge ripoff.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.360]   So they did an infographic.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:19.560]   So with the AT&T two-year contract, based on $90 a month for service
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:23.120]   and $200 upfront for the phone, your cost of your phone
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:27.040]   is $2,360.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:32.440]   With next, it goes up to $2,800.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:38.560]   And you don't-- I guess you get the same ability to keep it.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:43.840]   That's with no upgrade.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.840]   That's so in other words, if you do the same thing,
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.320]   you keep the phone for two years, it still costs you $440 more, $540 more,
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.240]   $40 more, over the two years.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:58.320]   If you do one upgrade, it goes up to $2928.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.360]   And your monthly cost goes up to $122.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.120]   So really, don't do it.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.960]   You better off--
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.760]   Just to buy it.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.160]   Just to buy it.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:14.920]   If you do the AT&T next two years, you do one upgrade with a buyout.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.960]   Your monthly cost goes up to $122 from $90.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:23.000]   Your total cost is $3,184.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   And you get to keep one one-year-old phone.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.160]   Does it have comparables for the T-Mobile?
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.000]   I think the T-Mobile is not as bad.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.080]   But it says T-Mobile's jump plans are better,
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:39.160]   but frequent upgrades are still costly.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:42.240]   So yeah, you're really better off buying this phone.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:46.080]   You're better off to buy a phone and then sell it either on eBay
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.720]   or through--
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.640]   Because L--
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.160]   Because L makes it pretty straightforward.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:52.660]   Yeah.
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.040]   And that's going to be going to be better off.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.080]   And you're more controlled.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.320]   So see what your HTC One is worth.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:40:59.840]   Wow.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.360]   No, no.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:00.760]   You know what?
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.880]   I love the one.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.680]   And I am-- I have not--
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.120]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.640]   I'm not saying I'm going to do it.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.760]   Well, you're going to buy everything.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.120]   You buy everything so you can--
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.520]   There's never an ore for you.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.360]   It's always an end for you.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.960]   See, they don't have the Google edition as an option,
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.360]   but I'll choose factory unlocked.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:20.860]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:23.160]   32 gigs?
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.160]   Uh--
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.080]   Yeah, you got the 32.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.600]   There is no 16.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.080]   32 or 64.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.320]   Two hundred and 44 bucks.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.160]   That's not real great.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.640]   It's just like half what you paid.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.120]   I'm great.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:38.620]   Yeah.
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.880]   OK.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.560]   Never mind.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.000]   I can always give this to one of my developers.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   But I do love this phone.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:45.760]   No, you're going to love it.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.800]   What do you like best to best?
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.360]   So you're not getting the thing I like best,
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.980]   because there's always in the highlights.
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.620]   You know, it's such a big upgrade from the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.660]   It's really fast.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.940]   The screen is longer, even though the handset is the same size.
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.260]   Like in my app, you can see a whole other to-do item
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.500]   at the bottom of the screen.
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.260]   I love that the speakers are on the front.
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.100]   I listen to podcasts.
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:04.940]   I want you to use a lot.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:05.620]   Isn't that brilliant?
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:06.340]   Yes.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.340]   I like that I could put the phone down on its back
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.900]   on the table, see the screen, and hear the speakers
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:11.700]   at the same time.
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.860]   That's a very simple thing, but it's a very nice thing.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:14.980]   I agree.
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:15.900]   Yeah, and it's just--
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.740]   I mean, the screen looks amazing next to the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.240]   It was just a big upgrade for me.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.200]   I know Leo, you have all the best phones.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.360]   You have the GS4 there.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.160]   I go back and forth with the GS4 in the one.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:27.160]   I like the one-- the non-rooval battery.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.560]   What has your battery life been?
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.400]   It's been really quite good so far.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.720]   It hasn't crapped out on me the day, which is basically
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.360]   my requirement, just making it with the day with me.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.520]   And it hasn't been an issue.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.840]   As long as I plug it in at night, it's fine.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.080]   Well, then that's fine.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.520]   Yeah, hopefully it'll stay that way.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:47.320]   I don't know enough about what the Moto X
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.420]   is to know whether that's going to be a good upgrade.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:55.420]   No, no, no, no equivicates.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:01.140]   You'll find out, Sunila.
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.620]   I'll admit, though, the always listening thing I know,
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.220]   Jeff, is going to yell at me.
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:06.300]   I don't love that idea.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.180]   And I get that it's local.
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.340]   I just-- you do have to trust Google about that,
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.940]   and also, which I kind of do.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.060]   But also, I think do consumers really conceptually
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:18.060]   differentiate between what happens locally on the phone
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.460]   and what gets sent back or what the wire?
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:20.860]   Well, this is why people like you who
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.260]   are very smart about technology need to explain this to them.
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.660]   Right, right.
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:30.060]   I think-- well, remember how 9,000 and 2001 is space
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.860]   honesty?
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.180]   The goal of a computer that responds and interacts with you,
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:40.820]   it would have to listen, just like your friend listens.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.900]   So to have a truly interactive computer that
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.700]   does what you want it to do, it has
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.420]   to do a lot of the things Google's building in,
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.300]   like know ahead of time what you want.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.780]   I mean, the perfect servants, one that
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:54.300]   knows you want a cup of tea before you even ask for it,
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.780]   and has it ready the minute you want it.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.180]   I think that's what Google's trying to do.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.580]   And I think that's what people-- truthfully,
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.620]   I think that people don't care as much about privacy
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.860]   as we say they do, as we do.
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.940]   And I think that if it's super convenient and super cool,
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.620]   they're not even going to think twice.
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:14.060]   Basically, never say anything out loud to your phone
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:16.700]   that you wouldn't want the NSA to know.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.140]   Oh, god.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.700]   I just-- I don't think that's wiping my finger up
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.540]   on my phone to have it start listening.
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.100]   Is that--
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:26.940]   is that--
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.060]   Yeah, that's what I try to get.
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:30.540]   She is trying to convince herself she doesn't want that feature.
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:31.540]   Yeah.
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.860]   No, I mean, we hooked the connector in our living room.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.100]   When we hooked up the Kinect, my wife was like,
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.020]   is this thing going to be taking pictures of us the whole time
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.900]   that we're watching TV and living our lives?
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:44.780]   Can you imagine?
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.660]   Why would it-- what is more boring?
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:48.820]   Right, well, that's true.
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:49.660]   We are pretty boring.
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.980]   What do they want with pictures of you watching TV?
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:53.660]   Right.
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.180]   What?
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:54.660]   Tears.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.660]   Tears.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:56.860]   There is this sense of surveillance,
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.700]   and it is this sense of watching the scene to have
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:03.140]   it on the Kinect hand wave, which that doesn't actually
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:05.580]   look for the hand wave until you go into--
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.100]   Right.
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:08.980]   --have the Kinect on in a Kinect-enabled game.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:09.820]   Yeah, you turn it on.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:10.340]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.340]   Right, you turn it on.
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.540]   Right, and you can see it come on and scan the room.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.060]   And there's something comforting about that.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.300]   OK, now the Kinect is on, and I'm going to play with it.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.820]   I know I'm being super paranoid just because of the Kinect.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:19.740]   No, the new one doesn't do that, though.
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.140]   The new one's always watching.
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.500]   No, the new one's just always kind of--
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.700]   And always listening, I think.
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.620]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:27.300]   I mean, I probably folks will just get-- people just get kind
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.580]   of used to this, and you're right,
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.060]   sending that to all that data over the line.
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:34.700]   I know, I know logically that that would make no sense.
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:35.620]   And then it is the most boring thing.
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.020]   Nobody cares that much.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.340]   No one cares that much.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:39.180]   But you know, one--
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.180]   No, but if--
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.180]   And today, once the-- you know, Microsoft,
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.900]   to broadcast all the streams from the Kinect devices
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.340]   in everybody's living room, like what they can say--
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:46.980]   They wouldn't do that.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.460]   What they would do is they would say, OK, we think
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:52.100]   Geno Trippani has been doing something illegal.
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.260]   Let's turn that one off.
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.340]   Let's tap that.
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.260]   Let's tap that one.
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.380]   Then they would be interested in what you're doing.
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:00.820]   And some poor schmuck would have to sit and watch TV.
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:05.020]   And reports have it that they can do that anywhere.
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.300]   They can do that anyway.
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:06.820]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:07.780]   I'm helping them.
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:10.180]   I'm like, I'm equipping my home with surveillance devices.
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:10.780]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:11.380]   You know, the name is--
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:12.380]   Notice.
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:12.780]   Like I'm--
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.420]   How easy that is.
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:14.980]   Yeah.
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.180]   Yeah.
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.460]   And so if I buy tea from a suspected terrorist,
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:21.180]   because they're doing two, three hops now, you know--
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.180]   You actually don't have to buy tea from a suspected terrorist.
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.780]   You have to buy tea from somebody who bought tea
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:27.860]   from somebody who bought tea from a suspected terrorist.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:28.380]   Yeah.
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:29.980]   So that's pretty much all of us.
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:31.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.660]   But you know, I think it's safe to assume that you're--
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:38.780]   you know, I use encryption, so my stuff's being collected.
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:40.660]   It's just safe to assume your stuff's being collected,
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:42.540]   whether they're looking at it or--
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:44.020]   I mean, it's the same rule.
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.380]   You'd never say anything in email that you wouldn't want
[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.660]   to appear on the front page of the New York Times.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:50.860]   You know, hello or--
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:53.340]   Well, now you can't say anything around your phone
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.540]   or your connect.
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.860]   That gets a little bit restrictive.
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:58.260]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.380]   I mean--
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.660]   Do we have to get a cone of silence in the house?
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.540]   Yeah, that's a thing.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.460]   I mean, this is my home.
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.660]   I'm having conversations with my family.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:06.060]   Look at--
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:07.060]   Oh, wow.
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:07.660]   It's a little different.
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.860]   I'm typing email to friends and colleagues.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.060]   And yes, I've typed personal things in emails to friends
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.660]   and to my spouse.
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:16.780]   But there's something about doing that data entry
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.700]   and feeling like, oh, this is a document
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.340]   that I am now sending off to the internet.
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.460]   Glass.
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.260]   Glass is listening to you.
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:26.460]   It is.
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.260]   Well, no, right?
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.140]   Because you have to tap it to wake it up.
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:29.660]   Oh.
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.060]   Oh.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:30.860]   Right.
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:31.860]   Oh.
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:32.860]   Oh.
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:35.660]   Maybe that tap is just for your convenience.
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:36.660]   I think that's just--
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:37.260]   Yeah.
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.660]   Look at that.
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.660]   Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.460]   Gina and I were having a conversation before we got on the air.
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.060]   I have a reason to encrypt email.
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.460]   And so I never done it.
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.860]   Don't know.
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.260]   And she was great.
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:55.660]   She gave me a wonderful plugin for Chrome called MailVilope.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:56.860]   Easy enough for Jarvis.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.660]   That's the standard here, right?
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:47:59.460]   So I put it in.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:03.060]   But it still presumes essential knowledge about how to encrypt.
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:06.180]   And I still didn't get the basic what do you do then and then.
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:07.660]   So I wrote up this post.
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:10.100]   Well, I should also point out that MailVilope has been hacked
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.180]   better than that.
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.620]   Oh.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:13.660]   I didn't know that.
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:14.980]   Sorry, Jeff.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:15.940]   How has it been hacked?
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.140]   It's still--
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.580]   When was MailVilope hacked?
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.460]   Yeah.
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:26.260]   I don't know if they've patched it.
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.740]   It uses strong encryption.
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:28.780]   It uses OpenPGP.
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:29.780]   So that's good.
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:30.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:30.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.700]   And as long as you do it outside of the client.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.020]   I think it's hard to do--
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.940]   oh, yeah, if you do it outside the client, you're fine.
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:36.700]   Yeah, that's what you're doing.
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.060]   That encourages you to write the email and encrypt it outside.
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:40.500]   Yeah.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.620]   Then it's not hacked.
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:42.100]   And then it's not.
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:42.740]   Cut pasted it.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:43.220]   OK.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:43.700]   I don't think.
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.140]   I still couldn't figure out what's on.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:45.900]   So I wrote up this post.
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:46.580]   I was all wrong.
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.100]   I was completely wrong.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.420]   But nobody just said simply-- oh, no, Jarvis.
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.420]   It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:51.900]   No.
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.140]   This huge debate about his PGP good enough.
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.020]   What are you doing this?
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:56.500]   What are you doing?
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:01.220]   This religion of the encryption church is obnoxious.
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.060]   It is obnoxious.
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:07.020]   And it turns everybody off to try to use this stuff,
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.780]   because it's overcomplicated.
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.140]   It's over argued about.
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.460]   It just drove me baddie.
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:16.140]   And finally, finally, you'll be glad to know Leo.
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:17.940]   Somebody put in a link to-- what's
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:19.820]   the name of the how-to show you did?
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:21.140]   Yeah, know-how, yeah.
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:21.700]   Know-how.
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.180]   We talked about OpenPGP.
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.980]   It's a little bit of an "11" in the encryption show on Know-how.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:26.780]   Boom.
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:27.580]   Made it easy.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.220]   He figured it out.
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.620]   But my god, I had to go through three days
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:33.580]   of torture, of encryption people yelling at each other
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:34.460]   around me.
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:38.300]   Twit.tv/kh50, if you want to--
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.060]   It's very good.
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:39.900]   --watch that episode.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.780]   --midid11, if you now trust, using Mailfulope,
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.140]   is exactly where you learn how to use Mailope.
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.860]   They use-- the title is a little deceptive,
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.940]   because there is PGP, which is a commercial product.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:56.820]   They actually use OpenPGP via a GNU privacy guard, which
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:58.300]   is what I recommend.
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.940]   And it's a very good way to do it.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.820]   But, geez, you're right, Leo, when you've said before.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:03.980]   And they demonstrated Mailfulope.
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:04.480]   Right.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:04.980]   Right.
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.820]   The problem with Mailfulope is somebody
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.060]   would have to have access to your computer, which
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:12.180]   we're presuming that you haven't given physical access
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.700]   to your computer to somebody.
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:15.740]   It's open source, and it was just updated five days ago.
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:16.740]   I'm happy to just get it patched.
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:17.220]   No, it's fine.
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:17.740]   Pretty awesome.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:18.700]   Yeah, it's very easy.
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:19.540]   I think it's good.
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.540]   But man-- because I thought--
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:24.620]   here's how screwy I was, trying to understand just
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:27.460]   the concept of how OpenPGP works.
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:29.860]   I've always just let it wash over my head.
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:32.780]   So I thought I had to somehow get the password I was using
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.460]   to the person I was sending the email to.
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:37.420]   No.
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:40.180]   No, that's a reasonable thing.
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:40.660]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:41.660]   That's a reasonable thing.
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:42.460]   But that's what--
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:42.980]   I couldn't figure out concept.
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:43.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:45.900]   I thought that I was encrypting it with my key,
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.020]   and then they were going to do that.
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.020]   No, instead I'm encrypting something
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:50.020]   to them with their key, right?
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.900]   Well, the point of public key cryptography, which is once
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.900]   you get it is brilliant, is in the old days,
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.940]   in order-- like secret decoder ring days,
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.340]   in order for somebody to decode it,
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:03.340]   you would have to have a shared secret.
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:08.620]   And the problem is, how do I get the shared secret to you?
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:10.700]   But public cryptography eliminates that.
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:11.580]   There are two keys.
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.340]   There's a public key, which I can give out.
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.380]   You can give out.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:15.780]   Anybody can have.
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.100]   All that does is encrypt.
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:17.900]   It doesn't decrypt.
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.620]   It only encrypts.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:21.820]   And then there's a private key, which you keep to yourself,
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:24.780]   and you use a strong pass phrase to protect.
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:28.940]   And that's your private key, and that is the decryption key.
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.860]   So you can give out the public key,
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:35.460]   and then that solves that whole issue of shared secret.
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:39.180]   That's such a brilliant and wonderful thing
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:40.780]   that it just solves all of these problems.
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:41.420]   And you really--
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.580]   I'll be making sure I got it the straight now.
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:42.940]   I just got it.
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.700]   You send me your public key.
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:45.660]   I don't have to send it to you.
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:46.860]   Your public key.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:47.420]   Right.
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:49.020]   Well, yeah, you send it to me, or I get it.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:49.900]   I have your public key.
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.540]   I use that to encrypt something.
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:53.940]   I send it to you, and you can decrypt it because--
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:54.700]   Right.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:55.620]   Because you have the key.
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.340]   Because I have the private key.
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.100]   Because I have the private key.
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:01.860]   My key to encrypt my stuff to you.
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:02.540]   No, no, no.
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:05.500]   I use your key to write something to encrypt it to you.
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:06.020]   Right?
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:06.620]   Right.
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:10.380]   That simple thing took me three days of yelling,
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.940]   but people find out.
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:13.060]   That's pretty funny.
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:14.500]   Hold me baddy.
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:15.860]   Absolutely baddy.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:19.380]   I did these encryption geeks.
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:20.820]   And the great thing is somebody said--
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:24.380]   they pointed me to the nicest encryption security
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:25.940]   person there is, of course, is Steve.
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:29.100]   And somebody sends me to one of his wonderful transcripts.
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:31.060]   But I got 100 pages.
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:31.780]   No, that's hard.
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:32.700]   You can't do it that way.
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:33.180]   Right.
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:34.660]   And he does it too much.
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:35.940]   That was way over your head.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:36.460]   That was not--
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.380]   He doesn't come right now.
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:41.500]   That was definitely not the right direction to send you.
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.660]   So I went absolutely baddy to get this figured out.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:45.500]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:45.940]   It was amazing.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:47.700]   If I had known, I probably could have--
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:48.180]   You solved it.
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:50.180]   You solved it because of your show.
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.740]   Well, I actually wasn't on that show.
[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:54.940]   But I as in snubs solved it.
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:56.180]   Yeah, I mean, it's too hard.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:56.860]   It's too hard.
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.060]   I mean, even when you ask me--
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:52:59.580]   Jeff, I was like, oh, this male envelope.
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:02.340]   I mean, for someone just using regular kind of Gmail,
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:03.340]   I went with male velopes.
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:05.780]   I was like, this is web based and it works in Gmail.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:06.500]   And it's just too hard.
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:10.260]   I mean, not a lot of people are using Thunderbird.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:10.540]   Right now.
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:11.380]   That's the thing.
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.100]   It's a lot more straightforward in a client.
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:16.340]   To do it on the web is both more--
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:17.460]   Tacky and--
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.860]   It's more so more difficult.
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.020]   Well, this is why it should become risky.
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.660]   So when I talked about this with Vint Cerf,
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:24.980]   he agrees that--
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:28.060]   number one, of course, they use SSL.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:29.220]   Let's start off with--
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:31.860]   and he agrees that we should make it easier to do this.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:33.180]   But when I talked to him about what
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:34.580]   we talked about in the show before,
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:38.140]   about the problem of my Google now boarding pass,
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:40.820]   in his view is you encrypt up to their box.
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:43.380]   The things inside their box are not encrypted because you
[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:47.460]   trust them to hold on to it unless, of course, there's a warrant.
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:50.540]   But it's not a snooping problem then.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:54.860]   And into the box and out of the box should be encrypted.
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.460]   But in the box shouldn't be so that Google can then
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:59.540]   act on it to your benefit.
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:01.260]   And I agree with that architectural--
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.660]   Well, that's in Google's interest.
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:04.180]   I don't.
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.940]   But also my interest is user.
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:07.660]   Because I want to be able to get my boarding pass.
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:09.260]   I want Google now to be smarter.
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:11.020]   I'm upset Google now doesn't know enough about me.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:12.260]   Right.
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.740]   Yeah, that's the interesting balance.
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:18.980]   Because true privacy, obviously, encryption doesn't work
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.420]   with Google now because you're hiding stuff from Google.
[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:21.660]   Right.
[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:24.540]   Because what would actually be stored on Google servers
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:26.740]   would just be a jumble of letters, numbers.
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.940]   So they wouldn't be able to advertise or do any
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:30.100]   personal things or any third party.
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.860]   I think what you've got to do, if you really want to do this,
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:35.860]   is you use Gmail day to day.
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:37.060]   And when you want something private,
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:39.100]   you do something else.
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:40.140]   Or you use Mailville Open.
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:42.460]   You don't encrypt it until it's--
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:43.660]   I'll tell you one thing.
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.500]   The airlines never going to send you your boarding pass
[00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:46.980]   encrypted.
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:47.460]   Right.
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:48.740]   That ain't going to happen.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.580]   So you're safe there.
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:50.740]   Right.
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:52.460]   So personal one-to-one communications
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:53.540]   about sensitive topics.
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:57.180]   You don't want Google now to know about that anyway.
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:00.700]   Now didn't Snowden go to the Guardian blogger and say,
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.140]   hey, I need to send you something encrypted?
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:03.700]   And he was like, I don't know what.
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.300]   Snowden wanted to use OpenPGP.
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:06.820]   Right.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:09.380]   And Glenn Greenwald didn't figure it out.
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:10.900]   I think they did later.
[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:11.420]   But--
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:12.380]   Well, this is important.
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:14.020]   Part of the reason I'm doing all this,
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:16.020]   I have a very specific reason to do this.
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:20.180]   But as a journalism instructor,
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.020]   I had this discussion with somebody interviewing me
[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:24.140]   the other day.
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:25.700]   What's a journalist to do now trying
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:26.620]   to deal with the source?
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:29.020]   How do we know that we can communicate with the source?
[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:33.100]   We can't just the metadata alone.
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:36.260]   The fact that, oh, this person talked to somebody
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:39.500]   at that exchange and that exchange is the New York Times,
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.100]   we're going to watch it.
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:44.140]   So metadata alone means that journalists cannot,
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:50.500]   in any way, open way, even contact confidential sources.
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:53.260]   So then how do you do it?
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:55.460]   The way spies have done it for a million years,
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:56.940]   you use a dead drop.
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.140]   Yep.
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.860]   But that becomes ridiculous.
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:02.180]   And the other thing that I've long
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:04.780]   argued that ever since the original New York Times story
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:10.260]   on the warrantless wiretaps, part of my argument,
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:12.900]   along since, has been that what the NSA actually wants
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:18.500]   to register is baseline data so they can see anomalies.
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:21.820]   And we're the baseline, or in the words of Alexander,
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:23.900]   we're the haystack.
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:27.020]   And once we have the haystack, then they can see, aha,
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:28.740]   that's a very strange pattern there.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.940]   That doesn't fit the pattern of so-and-so coins,
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:33.940]   but that's things like throw away phones.
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:37.340]   Gia, a phone that was always used only once in a month.
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:38.580]   Hm.
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:40.500]   That's a giveaway, huh?
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.700]   Now we can go back and look at all the phones that were used
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.660]   only once in a month.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.660]   Now I'm worried about all my development phones.
[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:48.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:49.140]   So why are--
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.500]   You mean your burners?
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.220]   My burners.
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:52.780]   Right.
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:54.780]   So the wire--
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.580]   The wire taught me everything I need to know.
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.660]   It's anomalous, but no, the wire wouldn't work.
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:01.380]   It's anomalous behavior.
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.380]   And you don't want to be anomalous.
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:04.140]   No.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:08.060]   In a world where they, in the words of General Alexander,
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:09.140]   collect it all.
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:14.860]   You need to develop your spycraft.
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:15.380]   That's all.
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:16.500]   It's like the beginnings.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:17.660]   This is your new sponsor?
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:19.580]   Yeah, we should actually--
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:23.660]   we should take a break and talk.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:24.580]   This would be great.
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:27.980]   Just teach everybody dead drops.
[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:30.580]   Come on, we've all watched those movies
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.580]   where you take a piece of chalk and you're
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:35.940]   going to mark on a rock, and then you stick the secret code
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:37.220]   in there, and then--
[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.020]   That'd be interesting to get Steve going-- because I know
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:41.980]   you just did the episode about how much tin foiled you
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:43.500]   put your hat on.
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:45.420]   Which is, by the way, a great idea.
[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:45.940]   It is.
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:46.500]   It is great.
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:47.900]   But it would be nice to challenge
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:52.220]   Steve outside of technology.
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:52.580]   Right?
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:54.700]   If you take his security brain and then
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:55.900]   put it to those kinds of things like that.
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:56.740]   Oh, he does that all the time.
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:01.620]   He's building a device to get dogs to stop barking.
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:04.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:06.220]   You don't know Steve.
[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:07.420]   This guy's insane.
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:08.300]   No, he's not waving me.
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:08.820]   He's not waving me.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.620]   He's insane.
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.700]   We're going to take a break, and we will come back with more.
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:16.100]   We are talking, my friends, about everything
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:18.460]   having to do with Cloud and Google and all of that stuff.
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:22.660]   And our show today brought to you
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:26.180]   by our grid friends at legalzoom.com.
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:29.540]   If you are in a business, if you are in a family,
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.060]   if you live life, you need legal documents.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:34.580]   But you don't need to get-- and this is the cool thing--
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:36.860]   a lawyer to make them up for you.
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:38.700]   Legalzoom is not a law firm, but it
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:42.260]   does help you create those important legal documents.
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:45.180]   It turns out you can do it yourself with a little help
[00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:45.860]   from Legalzoom.
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:48.820]   Just follow their simple step-by-step questionnaires online.
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:51.500]   And you can incorporate S or C corp.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:52.740]   You can make an LLC.
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:54.220]   That's actually how I did it.
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:56.620]   And we're still using those legal papers.
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:59:00.020]   $99 to do an LLC or an incorporation.
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:00.860]   You've got a trademark.
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.340]   You've got a brand you want to preserve.
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:07.380]   Buzzmachine.com, smarterware.org.
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:09.260]   I would suggest a trademark.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:10.740]   Easy to do.
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:13.460]   $169 plus the government filing fields.
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:15.900]   Now, if you have a family or you have assets,
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:17.380]   you really want to protect them.
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:20.220]   Without a will, the courts decide where your kids go,
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:21.540]   where your assets go.
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:25.820]   And it's $69 to create a last will on legalzoom.com.
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:29.260]   Legalzoom makes it very easy, very effective.
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:31.700]   And I think this is the ultimate democratization.
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:32.220]   I love this.
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:34.820]   What's interesting is they predate the internet,
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:36.700]   or at least the widespread use of the internet.
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:39.260]   Legalzoom's helped 2 million Americans over the last 12
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:43.500]   years do all of these and many more legal documents
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:44.740]   for affordable price.
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:45.980]   They now have something that didn't
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:48.260]   have when I used Legalzoom back in 2005.
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.140]   They have attorneys.
[00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:52.860]   They've negotiated fixed price attorneys.
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:55.300]   The Legalzoom legal plan allows you
[00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:58.020]   to speak to an attorney in your state.
[00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.780]   They have profiles and unedited reviews online.
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:03.220]   So you can pick the attorney right for you
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:05.340]   at a flat rate fixed rate.
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.700]   So you can get advice.
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.940]   It's a perfect complement to the Legalzoom document
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.420]   generation stuff.
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.700]   It's really-- I think this is just wonderful.
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:18.460]   This is empowering for all of us.
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:21.260]   Because a lot of-- you want to start a little startup.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.780]   You don't have necessarily the money.
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:26.660]   I didn't for legal fees to start that LLC.
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:28.620]   But Legalzoom made it possible.
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:30.580]   Why don't you start making your dreams come true
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.500]   and protect your family while you're at it.
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.940]   Legalzoom.com, if you use our offer code TWIG,
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:39.180]   you could take 10 bucks off at purchase.
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:40.980]   That means that last rule is only $59.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.220]   That's a good deal.
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:43.980]   Legalzoom.com, please, when you buy,
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:48.100]   use the offer code TWIG.
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.540]   It is time, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:54.540]   for the Google Change Log.
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:57.900]   The Google Change Log.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.100]   Digititoom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:04.340]   And now, Gina Trapani with the Google Change Log.
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:07.740]   Google's new maps redesign, which we covered back at Google
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.700]   I/O during the show, is now open to everyone.
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.420]   No invite required.
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:15.020]   You do have to opt in, though, to see it.
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:19.060]   So I think you go to google.com/maps/preview.
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.860]   You'll be able to get the new maps.
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.540]   I think we've talked about all the new features
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:24.820]   of the new maps extensively.
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:27.700]   It's a much more full screen experience with cards,
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:30.220]   for local information, and results right in map.
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.140]   Looks really good.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:33.500]   And we've seen a bunch of maps updates, actually.
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.540]   Google Maps for iOS.
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:38.940]   Got a new interface, better navigation.
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:41.500]   Looks really great on the iPad.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.860]   And Google Maps for Android updated as well
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.260]   to match the desktop version.
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.300]   And that is rolling out slowly.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:51.180]   I did get it on my Android devices.
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:52.900]   And we talked about this a little bit as well.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.940]   A latitude is no longer in.
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.860]   But really, really nice interface changes
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:01.860]   on maps across iOS and the desktop on the web and Android.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:05.180]   The Play Store got a huge redesign this week.
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.580]   Have you seen this, Leo?
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:08.580]   It looks completely different.
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:09.660]   This is on the web.
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:10.980]   Play.google.com.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:12.900]   Basically, the web-based version now
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.700]   looks like the mobile version.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:17.380]   It's got that sort of card-based, like Google Now,
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:20.100]   kind of card layout-based design.
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.660]   Huge app icons.
[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:24.900]   Really kind of nice layouts.
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.180]   Review functionality is a little different
[01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:28.740]   on individual pages.
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.500]   You can view a list of your apps, which
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.780]   are installed across your devices.
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:34.140]   When you go to install an app, you'll
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.340]   see all your devices listed.
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:39.380]   And interestingly, I saw Google Glass listed as one of those apps.
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:42.220]   Kind of hints that maybe Glass will get installations
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.940]   from the Play Store.
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:45.540]   They've had those devices before.
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.060]   I mean, that's been around for a while.
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.660]   Yeah, they've had the list of compatible devices.
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:51.020]   I really-- I think that that is a real selling point
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:51.940]   on Android.
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:52.440]   It is.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.460]   You can install it in the web.
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.340]   I use the-- what I'm traveling,
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.980]   which I've been doing a lot, I'm lately.
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:01.700]   I use the Nexus 7 to watch huge amounts of stuff.
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:04.180]   And so I'm watching Breaking Bad and all those kinds
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.540]   of great things on it.
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:07.820]   They've changed it a little bit,
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.740]   so it's harder to see as many shows at once and what you buy.
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:13.580]   And it's also harder to see what shows you own.
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.300]   It's all there and everything.
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:17.660]   They kind of mocked it up a little bit, just a little bit,
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.620]   a little bit.
[01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:20.620]   It's otherwise very pretty.
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:21.260]   It's very nice.
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.140]   I like it all.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:25.900]   But I like what they have-- if anybody here from Google
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:29.660]   happens to be listening, my management of shows
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:30.740]   before was better.
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:35.020]   You know what is working well, though, is the recommendations.
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.620]   Is this new, the recommendation engine?
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.140]   I like this.
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:40.100]   And this is doing a good job.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.180]   Yes, it does a nice job.
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:42.540]   My recommendations are also--
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:44.900]   Mine is a mine used to, but it recommended to me.
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.860]   It used to recommend things to me that I already
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.380]   had installed with this smart smart smart smart smart.
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:49.900]   Amazon does that too.
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:52.540]   You bought this, so maybe you'd like to buy it again.
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:53.700]   Then we do buy it again.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:54.580]   It says, hey, you fool.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:55.580]   You already bought this.
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:56.100]   I know.
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:57.700]   It's so stupid.
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.540]   That's interesting.
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.780]   I'm getting up for an app that I tried, the trial.
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.460]   It's pushing the premium version.
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.180]   So I'm getting loaded notifications.
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:05.180]   I mean, that makes sense.
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.220]   I might likely.
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:06.940]   But I looked at that.
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:08.900]   I glanced at it and thought, I haven't installed already
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.300]   and then realized that I haven't
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:13.300]   installed the premium version.
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.780]   Yeah, it looks really nice.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.100]   One of the nice things that it does is it's
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:20.820]   got that Add to Wishlist button front and center now on the web.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:22.780]   That was previously only showing up devices.
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:24.900]   I didn't realize that the Play Store had a wish list.
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:25.420]   I didn't either.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:28.100]   You can say, hey, I want this app.
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:28.900]   Oh, I want that.
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:29.860]   OK.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:30.900]   Yeah.
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:33.500]   And yeah, I wonder-- I'm not sure if you can share your wish
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.580]   list or-- I would love to be like, oh, you know,
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.340]   I'm-- Jeff did a nice thing for me today.
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.060]   I'd like to maybe buy him an app from the Play Store.
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.580]   But nice being kind of just easily.
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.780]   Look at somebody's wish list and get them an app.
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:45.500]   And it seems like they're moving that direction.
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:46.380]   What else do we have?
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:49.300]   Oh, we have got some Chrome for Android updates.
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:52.740]   The stable version updated with built-in Google Translate
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.340]   and full-screen support on tablets.
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:57.660]   So if you go to a page that's in a language that is not
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.340]   your native language, Google Translate
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:02.980]   will prompt you to automatically translate that content.
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.860]   And just like it works on the phones now on tablets,
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:08.260]   it'll go full-screen.
[01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.900]   So your-- your-- your-- or your address bar will kind of--
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:14.900]   will go back up into the top of the Chrome, like as you scroll.
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.260]   So-- so you get more room to read just content.
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:20.220]   And that's Chrome-- stable for Android.
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:23.380]   Chrome beta for Android updated to version 29.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.500]   And it's got WebRTC.
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.000]   Yay.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:26.740]   Yay.
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:27.980]   Faster page loads.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:28.740]   Yeah.
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.300]   We'll soon be doing the show, I predict.
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.660]   Yes, we will soon be doing the show via WebRTC
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:34.580]   on our Android devices.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.060]   That'd be very exciting.
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.020]   We're actually looking at some hardware that might help us.
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.860]   We can't do it right now because of limitations
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:41.260]   with our hardware.
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:42.900]   The Blackmagic hardware, right?
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:46.940]   Chad, the video in card is a little--
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:49.540]   little finicky, but we're looking at new hardware that
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.100]   might work with WebRTC better.
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:54.220]   So that would--
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:57.740]   And there's a Chrome 29 beta for Windows Mac and Linux also,
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:59.940]   also released.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:02.220]   And that's-- it seems like that they're just kind of--
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.020]   Not for the Chrome OS.
[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:04.540]   --speeding with the Chrome OS.
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:07.980]   Not for Chrome OS didn't get--
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:10.020]   Chrome 29 didn't come to you, Jeff.
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:11.020]   Nope.
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:12.020]   Hmm.
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.220]   And you won't get it unless you're on the beta channel, right?
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.140]   I know what it is.
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:16.140]   This is the beta channel.
[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:17.820]   And you are on the beta channel, it didn't come down.
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:18.820]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:19.300]   We're here.
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:19.740]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.660]   We're actually behind in that sense.
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:27.420]   29.0.1547.22 beta.
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:28.420]   The version numbers are nuts.
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:29.820]   We need a one-prow.
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:30.340]   Yeah.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.020]   They're totally nuts.
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:31.460]   It's crazy.
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.260]   They're putting the build number into the version number,
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:34.660]   I suspect.
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.620]   Yeah, yeah, that must be it.
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:39.900]   And then the quick item that I missed last week,
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:41.340]   the one-today charity app--
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:43.500]   I think we talked about it a while ago.
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.940]   Google releases Android app called One Today.
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.780]   It's basically like social charity.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.020]   That used to be invite-only.
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:52.420]   It's now open to everyone.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:53.660]   So I love One Today.
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:54.500]   I use it a lot.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:58.260]   In fact, I just posted-- I just donated to today's project.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.780]   And I said, make it a match.
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.380]   So if you look at my Google Press profile,
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:05.020]   you'll see I gave $1 to the nonprofit project, Raspberry Pi
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:05.860]   materials.
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:10.180]   It gives Raspberry Pi to girls and tech courses.
[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:11.700]   And I'll match your donation.
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:12.860]   And it works really well.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:15.060]   You can either just give $1, or you can say,
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:17.580]   I'll match my friend's donations up to a certain amount.
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:19.980]   So I think in this case, I could match up to $60.
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.140]   And I said, I'll match up to $10.
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:23.180]   So it's a really cool way to--
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:24.900]   You've already maxed it out, by the way.
[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:26.380]   I maxed it out.
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.380]   Yay.
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:27.880]   Yay.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.300]   You should still donate.
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:31.100]   But you can only do it once a day.
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.420]   You can't do it more than once a day.
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:36.180]   And I find that I just give more money to charity, which
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:38.380]   is kind of something I want to do, and more causes
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.540]   that I care about.
[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:40.620]   And it's really simple.
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:41.620]   It's just your Google Wallet.
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:43.860]   And sometimes, most of the days, I just say, OK, yeah, $1.
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:44.420]   Sure.
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:45.420]   I'm spending more than that.
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:45.980]   Is that how it works?
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.580]   Is just a dollar, or can you give more?
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:49.460]   It's just a dollar.
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.900]   If you want to give more, you can say, I'll match up
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.820]   to an amount, a certain amount.
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:54.620]   And they cap it.
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:57.700]   So it's usually-- I've never seen an amount over $60.
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:59.540]   If your friends donate.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.420]   So it's a little challenge to your friends to do that.
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:02.420]   It's great.
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:06.020]   Or I can go in and say, hey, Leo donated.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:07.220]   Will you match his donation?
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:09.100]   And you'll be like, yeah, I'll give a dollar in Leo's.
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:10.420]   And that will count toward your match.
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.380]   I'm signing up right now.
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:12.700]   That's social pressure.
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:13.860]   One today.
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:15.660]   One today at google.com.
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:18.100]   If you know some projects I'm not so interested in, others
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.860]   I'm like, yeah, I really believe in this cause.
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:22.300]   So I think it's encouraged to behave.
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:23.660]   I think I'm on my part.
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:26.420]   I want to give more to charity from different causes.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:27.420]   And I definitely have.
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:29.460]   Just to be clear, you don't have to have a device
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.140]   that's Google Wallet works on it.
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.580]   It uses your Google Wallet to pay.
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.620]   But you don't have to have-- because none of my devices--
[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:37.140]   I don't know what Google Wallet works on an XS4, I guess,
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:38.060]   right?
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:39.060]   Does it work on your mind?
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:42.060]   Yeah, if you have a Google Wallet account.
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.540]   And I think you get to $10 or $15.
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:46.660]   And it says, hey, will you pay your balance?
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:47.340]   You've got to balance.
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:48.140]   Oh, I see.
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.260]   They aggregate it up.
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:49.660]   That's good.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.740]   And they aggregate it up.
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:53.780]   So you're not going to do the whole payment process every time.
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:55.540]   And then you just say, yeah, sure, pay.
[01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:56.300]   Deb it my account.
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.020]   And they do so.
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:00.340]   And it's nice that it's a good app.
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.300]   Cool.
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:01.820]   And that's it.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:03.100]   That's all I got.
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:05.660]   Learn about a new project from a nonprofit every day.
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:09.100]   Show your support by giving us a little "as a dollar."
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.300]   Which is how little I'm going to give.
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:15.300]   That's the change log.
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:17.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:23.820]   Yeah, baby.
[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:26.260]   That was a memory X moment.
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:27.980]   Or something.
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:31.380]   I don't know what that was.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:32.380]   Let's see.
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:35.260]   Do you even know what I mean when I say memory X moment?
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:38.020]   Oh, should I-- is that--
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:38.420]   I don't know.
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:39.460]   Is that like a commercial record?
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.060]   You're just too young.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:42.060]   What?
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:43.300]   You're too young.
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:45.140]   I think you guys think I'm a lot younger than I am.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.580]   Is that-- was that a commercial thing?
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:47.820]   I'm Googling.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:50.060]   Oh, come now.
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:53.100]   I don't think she's from the era of recording tape, Jeff.
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.060]   No, that's it.
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:55.700]   It was a better record of memory.
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.220]   I said, the guy's sitting in front of a speaker,
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:58.180]   and he's blown back.
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:09:58.820]   Yeah, I love that.
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:09:59.580]   Memory X tape.
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:03.100]   And then they had Ella Fitzgerald, is it live,
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.220]   or is it memory X?
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:06.020]   That goes even farther back, right?
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.020]   OK.
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:07.780]   OK.
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:10.820]   I recall the dudes sitting in the chair getting blown back
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:11.220]   from a spare--
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:12.780]   Yeah, you saw that one.
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:13.460]   Yeah, I've seen that one.
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:18.300]   But you didn't see Ella break in the glass in the memory X ad.
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:19.180]   I don't think so.
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:19.980]   Yeah, there's the guy.
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:21.380]   Everybody's seen that.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:21.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.460]   Yeah.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:27.220]   Yeah, see, I'm not as young as you think.
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:28.980]   I do not think, by the way--
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:31.940]   Gee, I am as old as you think.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:33.060]   Now, that commercial-- you know what?
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:34.500]   It was from 1979.
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:35.500]   So that was--
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:36.740]   Oh, one, two.
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.900]   That wasn't so much.
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.220]   They made a brand new tape, as you can see.
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:43.740]   New MRX3 Oxide from Number X.
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:44.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:48.380]   You're my dear, my dear, my dear, dear, dear.
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:49.740]   What is that she's holding?
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:52.140]   She's inside makes the difference.
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:54.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.140]   And even lower lows.
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:57.140]   Is it three?
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:58.140]   Oh, me.
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:59.140]   And she's amazing.
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:03.940]   Now, more than ever, we can ask, is it live or is it memory X?
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:04.900]   Wow.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:09.660]   Even the name memory X sounds like something from science fiction.
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:10.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.500]   It's a memory X device.
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.900]   We're up in the '80s making mixtapes.
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:14.420]   So--
[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:16.300]   Yeah, you know what a cassette is.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:17.540]   You're not that young.
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:18.540]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:21.140]   You're early '90s even making mixtapes.
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:22.980]   They're the mixties.
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:23.980]   But yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:24.860]   No, the CDR.
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:26.060]   That doesn't count.
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:27.060]   That doesn't count.
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:27.580]   Oh.
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:29.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:30.940]   I shouldn't be asking, all right, you're right.
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:31.940]   You're right, Gina.
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:32.940]   I should be asking Chad these questions.
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:33.780]   Yeah, Chad's too young.
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:36.060]   Remember anything.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:36.620]   Yeah.
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.660]   He says it's a red hair.
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:40.660]   He remembers being born.
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.940]   That's how young he is.
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:42.380]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:44.220]   It's funny when you said memory X, because I
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:47.940]   believe that the Borat DVD came in a memory X.
[01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:51.420]   Like, it was made to look bootleg.
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:51.780]   Right.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:53.980]   So yeah, it came in a memory X, CD.
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:55.620]   Why don't-- wait, I don't know what this Borat is.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:59.860]   But anyway, I'm too old.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:02.820]   US government can no longer be trusted to protect
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.700]   the internet from international power grabs,
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:10.780]   says Jeff Jarvis at CrunchGov guest blog post.
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:11.700]   This is interesting.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:14.780]   Yeah, so tell us what you're saying here.
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:16.340]   Oh, it's pretty straightforward.
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:20.180]   Just there have been attempts to take over governance
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:23.740]   of the internet, Russia, Saudi Arabia, UAE,
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.420]   other wonderful bastions of free speech.
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.780]   At the last ITU tried to put in a plan
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.700]   that demand equal governance.
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:32.780]   The United States gathered together Russian countries
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:34.180]   and walked out.
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:35.780]   Well, problem now is--
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:38.100]   We don't have the moral high ground, do we?
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:38.940]   Do not.
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:39.140]   No.
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:40.700]   We certainly do not.
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:43.100]   And that's going to lead John Nott
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.460]   in a wonderful post.
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:47.860]   He's an observer columnist saying just that,
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:50.180]   that we're going to end up with something far worse.
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.700]   And thank you very much, NSA.
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:56.020]   It's another impact to the NSA story.
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.500]   Yeah, well, I think the more important impact
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:03.180]   is our relationship with our allies all over the world.
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:11.300]   It's always the problem when you act immorally or wrongly.
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.060]   Is it hurts your reputation?
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:13.660]   Yeah.
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:16.060]   Of course, we also just people look at us as stupid.
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:19.260]   When I was in Europe, I would apologize for being--
[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:21.460]   I made it a joke, but I'd get a high from America.
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:22.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:23.860]   I guess the point--
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:24.940]   I haven't had this problem lately,
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:28.700]   but there were years when I would say I was Canadian.
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:29.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:30.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:31.780]   Haven't had the problem lately.
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:32.660]   I might now again.
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:34.500]   I'm just going to see your byline on TechCrunch.
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.940]   Yeah, it's kind of cool.
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:37.460]   It is kind of cool.
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:38.660]   But also a little weird.
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:39.660]   I know.
[01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:42.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:44.420]   I faked you as a medium guy.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:44.940]   OK.
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:45.820]   I'm a medium.
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:46.780]   Yeah, I'm into the Guardian.
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:47.260]   I'm going to lie.
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:48.060]   It does it all, man.
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:48.900]   It does it all.
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.060]   That's what I like about John.
[01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:50.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:53.260]   I'm going to learn your secrets for being prolific.
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:55.260]   Writers are the original whores.
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:56.500]   Yes, we are.
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.500]   Yes.
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:01.060]   Jeff, how do you feel about that?
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:04.260]   That's a terrible thing to say, and I take it back.
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:05.180]   I take it all back.
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:06.220]   As opposed to TV people.
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:06.700]   Yeah, no.
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:11.460]   There's nothing worse than TV people or radio people.
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:14.900]   Unless it's internet TV people, those are the worst.
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:18.820]   Or as Aaron Sorkin would call us, the pajama people.
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:20.100]   Yeah, that was--
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:24.700]   He continues on with his vendetta against the internet.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:27.820]   The list of-- there was a whole list of tweets
[01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:31.380]   on the wrap of why we all hate the internet,
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:32.940]   why we all hate the newsroom.
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:35.100]   I could not finish it this time.
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.460]   I fell asleep.
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:39.900]   The Guardian has asked me to write a piece about why I hate
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:40.940]   the newsroom.
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:43.180]   So I said, oh crap, now you're going to be
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:44.300]   watch the whole damn thing.
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:45.340]   Oh, yeah, this is good.
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:49.060]   You're back to your old calling as a TV reviewer.
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:51.020]   Yeah, so I was started writing that now.
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:54.180]   I love Aaron Sorkin, and I love the West Wing.
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:56.300]   And actually, was the only person in the world
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:59.100]   love Studio 60?
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.660]   I know.
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:02.140]   Well, here's the-- I wonder the Leo.
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:04.540]   I wonder if we watched the West Wing today.
[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:05.420]   Would we think it's as well?
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:07.340]   Oh, I have watched it again recently.
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:09.180]   Only the first four years is ironically,
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.380]   they are in Sorkin years.
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:12.780]   So as he left, the thing went downhill.
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:14.540]   Actually, I like the newsroom.
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:16.380]   I think I have enough distance from how TV is made.
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.300]   I mean, I take it with a grain of salt,
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:20.020]   but I turn on closed captioning just
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:21.180]   so I can catch every line.
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:24.580]   Yeah, they're really talking fast this new season.
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:26.020]   This new season, it's bad.
[01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:26.620]   It's really bad.
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:29.220]   But they treat women hair well, I know.
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:30.060]   That is true.
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.540]   Hair well, yeah.
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:33.500]   Yes, you're either a dithering fool,
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.020]   or you don't know how to send an email.
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.300]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:36.940]   That is true.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:37.500]   That is true.
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.780]   Olivia Munn cannot act to save her life.
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:41.700]   Aww, it's unfortunate.
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:42.620]   It is unfortunate.
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:43.100]   That is unfortunate.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:47.340]   She's a nice person, but she's not an actor.
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:50.140]   And I think Aaron Sorkin's writing parodies of himself now.
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:51.140]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:52.140]   Absolutely.
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:54.020]   But the reason I can't stand it is it
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:16:00.380]   tries to put a holier thou than thou patina on TV news,
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:03.020]   which is the absolute worst.
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.620]   I know.
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:05.060]   I know.
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:05.980]   We call new.
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:07.620]   I know.
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:09.740]   There is no-- yeah, no.
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:11.380]   Those conversations, those aren't happening.
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.780]   No, no network newsmen.
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:13.140]   No.
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:15.300]   Ever called the Tea Party of the American Taliban.
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:17.460]   It's not even credible.
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:18.060]   No, no, no.
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:19.660]   They come into work and say, what?
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:20.620]   No trial?
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:21.580]   What the hell we got to do today?
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.060]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:23.380]   Right.
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:24.460]   The Zimmerman trial's over.
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:27.740]   We got to do news.
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:30.780]   Anyway, I don't know how we got into that.
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:32.660]   I was going to say our condolences--
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:35.660]   Neverx to Ella Fitzgerald to Aaron Sorkin.
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:36.900]   I don't know how we got to do that.
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:39.380]   But I was going to say condolences, of course,
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:41.700]   to Glee fans and Gleaks.
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:42.860]   I know that you were Gina--
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:43.580]   That was awful.
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:44.820]   Yeah, very sad to hear.
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:45.380]   That was awful.
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:47.740]   Just heartbreaking.
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:48.700]   Yeah, that was terrible.
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:49.260]   That was terrible.
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.900]   That guy-- I mean, look, I'm going to be honest.
[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:54.700]   He wasn't one of the strongest voices in the cast.
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:56.700]   But he was the hunkiest guy on the cast.
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:57.820]   He was-- yeah, he was--
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:59.460]   I mean, they managed to find a guy who
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:02.900]   was like, read pretty straight to be the straight guy lead.
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:02.900]   Yeah.
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:04.660]   Which was really good.
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:06.460]   And he was a talented guy.
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:07.820]   And he had the world of his feet.
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:08.320]   But he--
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:09.020]   It's very sad.
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:13.420]   Corey Monty is, of course, who played Finn Hudson on Glee.
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:15.620]   Founded Saturday in Vancouver.
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:16.020]   I didn't know that he was--
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:17.540]   He was only 31 years old.
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:18.180]   31 years old.
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:19.020]   They're now saying it was--
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:22.140]   How was childhood earlier addiction problems?
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.700]   I didn't know that he was dating in the Amichele.
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:25.700]   Yeah.
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:26.220]   Yeah.
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:28.260]   He is dating-- yeah.
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:29.260]   Who played Rachel?
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:32.220]   So their on-screen romance was going on.
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:33.700]   And they were supposed to move in together.
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:35.220]   It was very, very sad.
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:40.940]   The apparently lethal combination of heroin and alcohol.
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:43.780]   But he'd been having problems with drugs pretty much
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.340]   his whole adult life.
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:46.220]   It's very sad.
[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:49.540]   He did-- his inside the actor studio interview
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:50.060]   was very--
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:50.860]   He mentioned that on your tweet.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:51.420]   Yeah.
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.700]   He talked about his struggles with addiction.
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:56.420]   And you know, you're always in recovery.
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:58.940]   Yeah.
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.220]   Yeah, he was very open.
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:02.260]   And you're always in recovery as anyone who does
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:02.860]   dealt with addiction.
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:03.940]   You know, it doesn't go away.
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:07.420]   It's not a problem that you solve and then put behind you.
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:08.340]   So very sad.
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:10.420]   You're rightly-- yeah, this show of all shows
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:12.860]   needs to pay tribute to the actor in recovery.
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:13.380]   Yeah.
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:15.980]   If the guy who invented Chipotle died,
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:17.900]   we'd say something.
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.820]   It's just-- it's only right.
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:21.340]   I wondered how are you going to get
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:23.260]   a greater transition now at this moment.
[01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:24.340]   There you go.
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:26.220]   That's why you're the--
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:30.940]   Was it exactly elegant or--
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.180]   But that's all right.
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.180]   It doesn't have to be.
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.900]   It just has to get us on.
[01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:37.340]   Eric Schmidt says Google's relationship with Apple
[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:39.780]   has improved.
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:40.900]   I don't know what he means by--
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:42.780]   He's tied to what?
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:48.420]   He says, these are two proud, well-run, different companies.
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:49.980]   He's talking at the billionaire conference.
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:52.220]   I would guess if you go to the Allenan company,
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:53.260]   you must have been there, Jeff.
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:54.140]   You seem like the kind of--
[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:54.540]   Oh, no.
[01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:55.740]   Billionaire Hobnabber.
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:56.740]   No?
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:57.340]   No, no, no.
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:59.100]   I think once you get to that level,
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.620]   it's all very collegial, right?
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:02.100]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:02.620]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:03.540]   All the rich guys.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.460]   Larry wasn't there because he was at the wedding,
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:06.100]   digging pictures.
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:07.100]   Right.
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:09.780]   Right.
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:13.260]   And this is the conference that he was seen with the Moto X,
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:14.180]   right?
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:15.460]   That's right.
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:18.060]   Very blatantly carrying it around using it.
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.780]   Yeah, very-- lots of clear photos.
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:21.100]   Yeah.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:22.660]   Just to dry, he said, you know what?
[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:24.540]   I'm going to drive Leo crazy.
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:29.380]   Well, he had a phone.
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:30.820]   I don't know what it was.
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:32.060]   It's very attractive.
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.420]   Not the phone.
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:34.740]   You know, secret phone.
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:37.060]   It looks-- it's a beautiful looking.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:37.500]   It is.
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.740]   It looks like-- who says, on "L" of an Android last night,
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.100]   we're saying it looks a little bit like an Apple,
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.220]   like a mouse, like the back of it.
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:43.860]   Looks like the mighty is the mighty mouse.
[01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:46.540]   I wonder what it feels like.
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:47.540]   Hmm.
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:48.540]   Hmm.
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:51.100]   Hmm.
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:53.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:56.500]   What are we going to send all these answers?
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:58.260]   I wonder what kind of battery technology makes it--
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:01.340]   makes it go an entire week without ever dying.
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:03.180]   I wonder how it's going to dress me in the morning
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.700]   and make my breakfast.
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:06.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:08.860]   I wonder how attractive the screen is.
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:09.860]   Hmm.
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:10.860]   Hmm.
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:13.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.260]   I wonder how cheap it's going to be,
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:17.260]   what the marketing campaign is going to be like.
[01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:20.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:24.740]   That's a great place.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:25.860]   Oh, he's going to blow.
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:27.060]   He's going to blow.
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:29.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:33.060]   So here's some good news.
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.580]   The Pope is going to forgive sins via Twitter.
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:36.580]   OK.
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:37.580]   How's that?
[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:39.940]   It's about that from modern, huh?
[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:40.900]   Indulgences.
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:42.660]   It's not the onion.
[01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:46.060]   I didn't even know you could still get plenary indulgences.
[01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:47.180]   I didn't either.
[01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:50.340]   I was probably still imprinted by Gutenberg.
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:51.860]   Yeah.
[01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:55.500]   So, god, I'm stunned.
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.500]   I--
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:58.500]   You're a Catholic, Gina.
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.660]   Explain this.
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:01.300]   I was raised Catholic.
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:04.220]   I went through 12 years of--
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:06.060]   yeah, 12 years of Catholic school.
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:08.900]   Nuns, pleated skirts, the whole nine.
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:10.220]   And, you know, I saw this story.
[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:13.060]   Oh, I thought it's so cute to see you in the pleated skirts.
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:14.300]   It was not cute.
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:15.300]   It was not--
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:17.300]   There was nothing--
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:17.700]   Oh, come on.
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:19.300]   It's kind of hot, actually, right?
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:20.900]   Yeah, it was a saddle shoes.
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:21.900]   Oh.
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:22.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:23.700]   It's not--
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:26.660]   Listen, I wasn't all girls Catholic school.
[01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:28.500]   I can-- not hot, OK?
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:29.500]   OK, you're right.
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:33.780]   It was lots of girls who were not around boys.
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:37.180]   Yeah, anyway, I saw the story.
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:39.740]   And there was a half of me that was not at all surprised.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:43.340]   And the other half of me that was like, what are they thinking?
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:45.420]   People indulge in-- oh, it's so ridiculous.
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:47.020]   OK, I'm not going to go on my anti-cannon rant.
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.340]   This is the best quote ever.
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:53.580]   And this is from a man-senior Claudio Marilla Chely.
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:55.660]   The president of the Pontifical Council
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:22:01.180]   for Social Communication, he told a journal that's actually
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:06.740]   called "The Sacred Apostolic Penitentiary."
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:08.780]   You don't obtain an indulgence.
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:11.900]   Like you get a coffee from a vending machine.
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:14.820]   It is not enough just to watch a mess online
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:19.300]   or follow the Pope via live streaming on your iPad
[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:24.260]   or by connecting to Pope to you.net.
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:25.820]   This is a quote.
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:28.060]   These are just devices.
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:33.500]   What really counts is the tweet that the Pope will send you
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.060]   from Brazil.
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:37.300]   That's what counts.
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:40.220]   That it will produce genuine spiritual fruit
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:41.980]   in the heart of the person.
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:43.780]   That's got to be a translation problem.
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:47.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:50.500]   The Pope's tweets haven't grown any spiritual in my heart.
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:54.420]   The tweet from the Pope has produced a spiritual fruit
[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:55.260]   in my heart.
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:58.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:01.340]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:02.340]   Oh, how are you?
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:03.180]   That was a roll.
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:04.540]   You're a tiny accent, really.
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:05.020]   Yes.
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:06.020]   It's brilliant.
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:07.180]   It's really good.
[01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:09.020]   Gina knows it in her soul.
[01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:11.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:13.700]   I'm not laughing.
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:20.380]   Every religion is as deep, powerful, spiritual meaning,
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:28.060]   as well as often it's strange to the outsider traditions.
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:30.100]   I don't know, though, that tweeting really--
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:36.300]   Never mind.
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:38.140]   Well, God tweets.
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:38.620]   God?
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:39.820]   Yeah, I love God's tweets.
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:41.940]   I read Jesus' tweets, too.
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:45.140]   Jesus' H Christ, he's the best tweeter.
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:48.740]   Or no, he's on Google+.
[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:49.940]   Jesus' H Christ.
[01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:51.940]   There's one on Twitter that I follow.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:52.940]   There is one on Twitter.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:53.860]   There is one on Twitter.
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.220]   I do follow Jesus on Twitter.
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:56.580]   We're going to hell.
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:58.460]   Or maybe it's Almighty God.
[01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:00.420]   Almighty God is on Twitter.
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:01.940]   No, Almighty God is on Twitter.
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:05.180]   But I think Jesus' H Christ--
[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:09.220]   I think I circled him.
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:11.260]   I have him in the prophet's circle.
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.260]   Let me see.
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:15.180]   Yeah, Jesus-- actually, there's several Jesus' H Christ.
[01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:16.900]   There's two.
[01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:19.900]   I'm not sure which one I follow.
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:22.940]   He works at the Big Man, lived in Rome, attended
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:25.180]   Jew school, it says.
[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:27.060]   I don't think that's the one I'm looking for.
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:29.220]   Let's see if I can--
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:30.380]   Almighty God on Twitter.
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:32.620]   I'm into creating universes, smiting people,
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:34.620]   writing holy books, and listening to prayers.
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:37.740]   Yeah, there you go, baby.
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:38.900]   I'm sorry about all of this.
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:39.660]   There's quite a few.
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:40.500]   There's several--
[01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:44.860]   Jesus, exclusively on Fiverr, you might recognize me
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:45.820]   from the Bible.
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.340]   That's not him.
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:49.580]   That's not him.
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:51.300]   Well, you'll see.
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:52.460]   Come on, Chad.
[01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:55.140]   You're going to send us all the downstairs.
[01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:57.700]   Oh, well, oh, good news.
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:00.820]   Just tweet the pope and you can get a plenary indulgence
[01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:03.260]   and spend less time in purgatory.
[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:05.140]   By the way, that's what that's for, by the way.
[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:06.980]   Right, it's for spending less time in purgatory.
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:09.980]   So you don't-- I mean, you're going to hell anyway.
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:11.660]   But, well, wait a minute.
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:12.540]   No, no, no, I thought it was--
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.380]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:14.220]   I thought it was temporary.
[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:15.060]   Not hell.
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:15.900]   It's temporary stop to heaven.
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:18.020]   Purgatory is hell-like.
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:19.820]   Oh, I thought it was--
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:21.900]   I thought it was just sort of a pit stop.
[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:22.660]   No, that's limbo.
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:24.700]   You're thinking of limbo where the babies go.
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.740]   So it's the New Jersey turnpike.
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:29.500]   Babies go to limbo because they--
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:33.340]   because original sin, you can't let them off the hook.
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:35.860]   Right, but it's not really their fault.
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:36.700]   But--
[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:39.620]   The migratory is being stuck between stations on the R line.
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:41.500]   I think purgatory is hell-like.
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:42.500]   Oh.
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:45.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:45.620]   Well, you're right.
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:47.980]   Where's Father Robert Balliscer when we need him?
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:52.020]   We have an actual priest in our panel on our stable.
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:54.780]   I think he might be putting pins in a voodoo to all of you
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:55.380]   right now, though.
[01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:56.220]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:56.620]   Robert--
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:57.380]   He's on the way.
[01:25:57.380 --> 01:25:58.900]   --of the way he's going.
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:00.700]   That's one of the great things about Robert.
[01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:01.220]   He's right.
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:02.260]   He's relaxed.
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:02.820]   He's cool.
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:03.300]   He's calm.
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:06.340]   He's probably tweeting right now.
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:07.900]   Only the one who dies in a state of grace
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:08.620]   can be in purgatory.
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:11.340]   And therefore, no one who is in purgatory will remain there
[01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:12.900]   forever or go to hell.
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:14.940]   So if you die in a state of grace,
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.380]   you're going to go to purgatory because you
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:17.780]   get a little bit of punishment.
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:19.220]   Yeah, yeah, you got to serve a little time.
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:20.140]   You got to serve a little time.
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:21.180]   But you're going to go to heaven.
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:22.340]   You're not going to hell.
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:23.020]   It's just a stop.
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:25.380]   And so the pope can-- in this case
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.620]   can say, no, you don't have to go so long.
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:29.220]   I'm going to give you a plenary indulgence.
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:31.620]   Just a little less-- only a million years in purgatory
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:34.820]   instead of 2 million or something.
[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:37.660]   So who is the Martin Luther of the Twitter age, yes?
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:41.100]   I can't-- the whole thing, the mixture
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:46.220]   of medieval superstition with Twitter is so bizarre.
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:48.180]   It's unique.
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:53.900]   It's so bizarre because indulgences, that is a medieval.
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:57.740]   I believe that is a later edition to the canon.
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.340]   I was honored to see--
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:01.460]   and Gutenberg was even mine.
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:04.660]   The indulgences that were first printed on Gutenberg's
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:08.820]   presses, and then Martin Luther's tracks against them--
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:09.740]   Right.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.140]   --also printed on his presses.
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:15.140]   Yes, it was one of the extremes of the Catholic church
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:18.100]   that Luther was invading against.
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:21.380]   But again, I am not dissing anybody's spirituality or religion.
[01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:23.740]   I highly respect that.
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:25.220]   But you got to admit some of these things
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:26.660]   are a little strange.
[01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:27.660]   A lot.
[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:30.220]   When I was in Rome at the Google event,
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:32.580]   there was a priest who was there who
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:36.460]   had some major Catholic art culture magazine.
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:38.940]   I don't know if it-- very, very nice guy.
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:41.140]   And so Vint surfers on stage, and he's talking about how
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:42.740]   we have to get more people on the internet.
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:45.540]   And he says, I want to convert 4 billion people.
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:48.220]   And the priest says, me too.
[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:48.980]   That's great.
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:50.180]   Love it.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.540]   Love it.
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:52.540]   Love it.
[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:59.900]   Microsoft is suing US Customs, saying, you guys,
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:03.940]   you talked to Google, but you didn't talk to us.
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:08.860]   Apparently, Microsoft has a ban against phones
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:11.180]   made by Motorola.
[01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:14.620]   And the ITC, the International Trade Commission in Washington,
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:18.740]   issued the import ban may of last year.
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:21.540]   They decided that Motorola devices infringed a Microsoft
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:25.100]   patent for the way mobile phones synchronize calendar events
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:27.980]   without the computers.
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:30.300]   But they haven't been blocking the Motorola phones.
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:31.940]   The droids are still coming.
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:33.460]   By the way, I wonder if this has something
[01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:37.220]   to do with why Google's making the new phones in the US.
[01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:38.020]   Oh, interesting.
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:38.540]   Oh.
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:39.180]   Possibly.
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:40.380]   Interesting, huh?
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:42.420]   US Customs and Border Protection,
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:47.380]   according to Microsoft, had secret meetings with Google.
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:49.940]   I think the word secret is a judgment call.
[01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:51.460]   But they did talk to Google, and they
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.700]   decided to let the Motorola phones enter the country,
[01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:59.300]   even though Google has not removed the offending technology
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:00.220]   Microsoft said.
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:06.980]   And Customs is ignoring its obligation
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.500]   based on secret discussions.
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:12.020]   This is in the Microsoft pleading.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:15.580]   Google's response is, US Customs appropriately rejected
[01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:17.620]   Microsoft's effort to broaden its patent
[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:20.500]   claims to block Americans from using a wide range
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.060]   of legitimate calendar functions,
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:25.500]   like scheduling meetings on their mobile phones.
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.340]   We're confident the court will agree.
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:29.980]   And that's because there's now a lawsuit.
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:36.460]   The ITC order is in effect until Microsoft's patent expires
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:37.620]   in 2018.
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:40.140]   I think that could very well be why Google said,
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:42.060]   we don't know how this is going to shake out.
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:43.980]   Let's just start making these phones in the US.
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:45.620]   We get goody points anyway.
[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:46.340]   Right.
[01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:46.700]   Right.
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:47.180]   Yeah.
[01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:52.020]   And it's a way to differentiate with the issues of Apple.
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:54.860]   Manufacturing overseas, they say, that made the USA.
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:55.260]   Right.
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:56.780]   No, I think it's a great thing.
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:58.620]   I think they put the American flag on the back
[01:29:58.620 --> 01:29:59.780]   of whatever that is.
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:02.140]   That's approved by the NSA, too.
[01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:03.900]   Yeah.
[01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:06.460]   Microsoft said that they had no idea
[01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:10.020]   that Google and Customs were meeting back in April
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:12.260]   until Customs in June 24th announced
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:16.300]   that they were going to allow the phones in the country.
[01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:19.620]   You know what, if I were Microsoft, I would be pissed.
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:23.820]   So I think you got some explaining to do.
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:26.460]   On the other hand, I'm not thrilled that Microsoft claims
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:29.860]   that we have to license synchronizing calendars.
[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:31.260]   Synchronizing calendars now.
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:31.940]   For Microsoft.
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:34.060]   Well, that's how this stuff works.
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:34.420]   All right.
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:35.220]   We're going to take a break.
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:38.620]   We're going to get your picks, your tips, your numbers.
[01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:40.940]   Coming up, but first a word from 99 Designs,
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:42.980]   this is where you get your designs.
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:46.260]   If you're a company looking for great looking assets,
[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:48.020]   whether it's a menu for your business,
[01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:50.420]   a Facebook home page for your business,
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:53.180]   maybe a new website, maybe a t-shirt.
[01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:56.100]   That's what we use 99 Designs for.
[01:30:56.100 --> 01:31:00.060]   Digital marketing collateral, print marketing collateral.
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:03.500]   Logos, mobile apps, 99 designs can do it all.
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.820]   The way it works, you go to 99designs.com.
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:07.140]   They'll give you great consultation
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:09.820]   with their San Francisco based design team.
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:11.980]   And then you start a contest.
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:16.420]   There currently are 1,992 open contests.
[01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:21.940]   By the way, there are 238,183 designers on 99 designs
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:25.340]   who are ready and willing to give you a design,
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:27.540]   to send you a spec to say, this is what I think.
[01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:30.740]   You can work back and forth with them, pick the designer,
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:33.980]   pay them, and get a great design for people
[01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:35.540]   who really know what they're doing.
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:40.700]   Last month, 99 designs paid out $1.7 million to designers.
[01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:43.340]   $1.7 million, this is such a great idea.
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:46.540]   It's a marketplace for designers to get together
[01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:49.540]   with people who need good looking art.
[01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:52.940]   Whether it's a coaster, a book.
[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:53.580]   Here's the deal.
[01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:56.260]   If you want to try this, we want to invite you to do so.
[01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:58.980]   Visit 99designs.com/twig
[01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:03.980]   and get a $99 power pack of services absolutely free.
[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:06.180]   You get more designer time with the power pack.
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:09.180]   99 designs will bold, highlight, and feature your design.
[01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:11.380]   In their marketplace, that means you're going to get
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:13.020]   about twice as many designs, which is nice.
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:15.780]   We also have a toll free number you can use if you prefer.
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:23.340]   800-513-1678.
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:24.420]   That's just for Twit listeners.
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:27.900]   800-5-13-1678.
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:30.460]   99designs.com/twig.

[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:36.860]   Making the world look better, one design at a time.
[01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:38.940]   All right, Gina Trapani, it's time for you
[01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:40.340]   and your tip of the week.
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:42.780]   By the way, mail-velope, great tip.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.260]   I just installed it.
[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:45.460]   You didn't install it?
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:46.980]   Even though it had been hacked, but it didn't--
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:48.260]   It is very nice.
[01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:50.700]   The hack, you have to give them physical access
[01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:51.300]   to your computer.
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:52.300]   I'm not worried about it.
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:53.020]   OK, so that's a count.
[01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:54.900]   OK, good, good, good.
[01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:57.740]   Well, my tip this week is if you didn't make it to Paris
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:00.180]   this summer, or you're not going to,
[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:03.540]   you can travel up to the top of the Eiffel Tower
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:04.980]   in Google Street View.
[01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:06.140]   Even if you didn't make it to Paris,
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:07.780]   it's hard to get to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:09.340]   It is, and it's crowded in a top.
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:10.980]   Do you know if I'm going to be scared of this?
[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:11.980]   Yes.
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:15.700]   Oh, yeah, Jeff, sorry, don't look.
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:19.500]   Google has added Street View imagery of the two main floors,
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.540]   the Eiffel Tower, to Google Maps.
[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:25.380]   And they also set up this whole site
[01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:27.260]   about the history of the Eiffel Tower
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:30.620]   with archival photos and some recordings
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:32.500]   and all the information about the Eiffel Tower
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:33.980]   that you could ever want.
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:36.340]   And that's actually-- let me see.
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:36.980]   Don't go down.
[01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:38.300]   That addresses--
[01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:41.180]   Yeah, there's some imagery that's on the top of the tower.
[01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:43.220]   Oh, come on.
[01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:44.900]   Really, Jeff?
[01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:47.380]   No.
[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:48.380]   The Google Cultural--
[01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:52.300]   That's the beam.
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:54.860]   If you go to google.com/culturalinstitute/home,
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:57.060]   you'll see there's a featured Eiffel Tower collection.
[01:33:57.060 --> 01:33:57.620]   I love the Eiffel Tower.
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:33:59.380]   They can see all kinds of information about the--
[01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:00.500]   Who doesn't love the Eiffel Tower?
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:00.940]   --the Eiffel Tower.
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.820]   And then there's the plans and the inauguration
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:03.900]   and it's for its visitors.
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:06.380]   But if you just want to go to the top and see the view,
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:07.500]   you can do so in Maps.
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:10.220]   It's a little bit of a cloudy day, so not a lot of sun,
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:11.460]   but some really good imagery.
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:12.980]   And you don't have to stand in the line
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:17.780]   or worry about your fear of heights unless you're Jeff.
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:20.220]   That is a long line in the summer anyway.
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:21.220]   It is.
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:23.540]   I've been up there and it was wonderful,
[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:25.220]   but it's a process.
[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:27.540]   And there's restaurants up there, too.
[01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:30.980]   You can get reservations to go to the restaurants up there.
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:34.700]   I love-- well, I'm going to Paris in December for Lueb.
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:35.860]   Oh, nice.
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:37.740]   Yeah, I'm excited about that.
[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:38.540]   One of my favorite--
[01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:40.180]   --or the broadcast or both.
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:41.420]   Speak.
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:41.900]   Oh, good.
[01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:42.940]   Good for you.
[01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:44.380]   Yeah, Lueb, just some invitation.
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:46.220]   Oh, we always wanted to go to Lueb.
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:47.540]   The timing just doesn't work out for me.
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:47.940]   It was heated.
[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:49.220]   It's kind of a rotten time.
[01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:52.500]   It's December in Paris is not ideal.
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:55.860]   Have I showed you my picture from the Eiffel Tower?
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:56.580]   No, let's see it.
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:59.180]   There's something a little odd about it.
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:00.580]   Chad picked up right away on it.
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:01.940]   Oh, yeah, I did too.
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:05.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:06.100]   That's real.
[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:06.620]   Good genius.
[01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:07.700]   Stay innocent, Jean-up, please.
[01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:08.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:10.140]   She's looking--
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:12.140]   I just got it.
[01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:12.900]   Oh, you saw it?
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:14.780]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:15.860]   That's-- wow.
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:18.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:19.460]   It's not a problem.
[01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:21.780]   It's not on Google Maps, though.
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:22.780]   Don't worry.
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:23.620]   OK.
[01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:27.100]   But that's why you don't want to go in the snow.
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:29.260]   OK, good to know.
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:31.060]   Oh, that was French.
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:33.540]   There are just-- it's probably Germans that did that, though.
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:34.180]   You realize.
[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:34.700]   No French.
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:35.020]   Absolutely.
[01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:36.020]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:37.020]   German tourists.
[01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:39.740]   It's always the German tourists.
[01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:41.740]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:44.140]   Well, I have two, because the first one I have to deliver
[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:45.100]   to Gina, I looked it up.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:47.540]   It is a 15-day return policy.
[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:48.540]   Oh.
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:49.380]   That's a bummer.
[01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:50.100]   You mailed it to you.
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:51.140]   You have to be--
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:52.940]   No, no, no, the one is a great phone.
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:55.420]   There's nothing wrong with the one.
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:58.540]   No, now when he's holding his new, whatever it is,
[01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:00.340]   he's going to be rubbing it on you, Gina.
[01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:01.620]   No, no, I won't do that.
[01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:02.820]   I will not do that.
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:05.580]   Because a set-top box is not a good replacement
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:06.580]   for a smartphone.
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:09.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:09.780]   I'm just saying.
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:10.300]   I just want to say--
[01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:11.700]   I really love the one so much.
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:13.020]   I think I'm going to hold on to it.
[01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:17.060]   And if I love the Moto X, I will find it in my development
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:18.580]   budget to purchase one.
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:24.140]   There are things that the one does that you really will not
[01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:25.900]   want to give up, I think.
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:26.900]   Yeah.
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:27.900]   I really like to speak with the front.
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:28.380]   I love it.
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:28.900]   I love it.
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:29.900]   That's a great phone.
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:31.620]   As long as you're getting good battery life,
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:34.020]   and that's probably the Google experience talking.
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:34.620]   Yeah.
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:35.100]   Yeah.
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:37.100]   So what is your number then?
[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:41.340]   So Google, according to a story in ZDnet,
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:44.340]   based on a panel of HR people tech companies,
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:48.380]   Google gets 2 million applications for 5 to 7,000 openings
[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:48.940]   a year.
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:50.860]   Oh.
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:52.860]   I'd like to go to work for Google.
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:53.380]   Wow.
[01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:55.780]   Depresses me.
[01:36:55.780 --> 01:36:59.300]   Would you take a job if Google offered you a job?
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:01.060]   Certain jobs, yes.
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:03.020]   Like if we were prestigious enough?
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:04.260]   Well, no, no, no.
[01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:30.620]   Here's the thing about Google with Fast
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:31.620]   Apps.
[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:32.620]   That would be interesting.
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:33.620]   Yeah.
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:37.980]   So, but anyway, I'm not applying yet.
[01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:42.180]   We're searching for a new dean for my school so we can see.
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:43.180]   Oh.
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:44.940]   Are you up for the job?
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:46.900]   No, no, no, I didn't want to.
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:54.180]   Again, here's because if I were dean, I could no longer use the F word in Twitter.
[01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:55.900]   Really?
[01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:57.700]   That seems so unfair.
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:02.180]   I'm pope, I understand, but dean?
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:03.180]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:05.180]   Can you give plenary indulgences?
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:08.380]   Only do you, Leo.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:09.900]   You indulge a lot.
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:11.620]   You are indulging me right now.
[01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:12.620]   I know you are.
[01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:14.500]   So some other numbers from this story.
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:17.820]   Half of Twitter's staff has been there less than a year.
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:20.540]   The median age of Twitter's staff is 30.
[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:26.500]   Cisco held a training session for Generation X managers of Generation Y employees, which
[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:27.780]   I found amusing.
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:29.260]   And finally, I love this.
[01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:34.220]   Google held a bring your parents to work day and 5,000 showed up.
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:35.220]   Wow.
[01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:36.220]   That's really funny.
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:37.220]   Isn't that funny?
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:38.220]   You can see it.
[01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:41.220]   Can't you see all the Google Googlers sort of like guiding their parents around campus?
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:44.380]   And you know their parents are like, I want to see this free gourmet food in these like
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:47.380]   massage areas and these nap pods.
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:48.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:49.620]   That's so great.
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:51.380]   That is really cool, actually.
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:52.380]   Isn't that great?
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:53.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:55.180]   Bring your parents to work day.
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:56.180]   Good God.
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:01.340]   Maybe one of my kids will get a job at Google and show me around show me around the problem
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:05.020]   is Leo, all the parents who went are younger than us.
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:07.020]   Oh, that's depressing.
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:12.100]   I brought Edna from my glass fitting and I was like, it's your first visit to Google.
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:13.700]   You might work here someday.
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:16.740]   Here's a here's a fun little one.
[01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:19.540]   Ed bot gave us this is my tool of the week.
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:24.660]   Ed bot gave us this when we were talking about privacy and so forth on Twitter this week.
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:31.380]   It's privacy fix.com and if nothing else is kind of interesting to learn how much you're
[01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:34.180]   worth to Google.
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:35.180]   So you install this.
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:38.580]   It's a Chrome extension privacy fix.com.
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:40.580]   You can log into your Google account.
[01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:43.580]   You can see what websites are sharing data about you.
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:46.300]   You can see what tracking cookies you have.
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:49.380]   But the fun one I think and by the way, it gives me different results.
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:51.900]   Oh, that's because I'm not logged into my Google search here.
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:52.900]   Let's log in.
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:59.540]   If I log into my Google search real quickly here, it tells you how much based on what
[01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:03.540]   your information you give to Google, how much you're worth to Google.
[01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:08.060]   And in my case, it was like $54 a year.
[01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:11.820]   I don't know how accurate it is, but I think it's a very it's a fun thing anyway.
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:15.260]   Well, there's anything about that is I've been arguing that media companies should follow
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:16.420]   the example of Google.
[01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:19.820]   And the problem for media companies is they don't know anything about you.
[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:22.260]   So you're all kind of worth the same and that's not very much.
[01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:23.260]   Right.
[01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:26.900]   So the fact that you can be worth more to them because they can target the advertising better
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:30.740]   and be more relevant and have more performance for those ads as a result, that's exactly what
[01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:32.780]   media companies should be doing.
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:35.060]   And you can turn on various things.
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:39.100]   You know, it depends on how you feel about all this stuff, but they've got a health bar
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:43.460]   which you can enable that'll tell you as you go to a site what that site's doing, what
[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:49.940]   it knows about you, if you know how it treats government requests and things like that.
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:56.260]   So it still thinks I'm only worth $16.37 a year, but I damn it, I know I'm worth more
[01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:57.260]   than that.
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:59.580]   I'm 63 bucks and 24 cents.
[01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:00.580]   There you go.
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:04.020]   Google makes about this much per year from ads at your level of activity.
[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:05.020]   Interesting.
[01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:07.660]   That's interesting, huh?
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:10.900]   And then from there, you can turn off things if you wish.
[01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:15.420]   It gives you access to the inside to the Google dashboard where you can turn features on
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:16.420]   and off.
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:18.140]   Yeah, interesting.
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:23.780]   These, these, uh, pre-search revenue estimates, cover my site called Trefist, T-R-E-F-I.
[01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:27.820]   What should happen is somebody in the chat room raises the third party cookies issue.
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:31.460]   What should happen is that A, media should learn to follow an example and B, they should
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:34.420]   say that if you turn on ad blocking, here's how low your worth to us.
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:35.420]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:38.220]   Bring up a conversation from last week.
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:39.220]   Here's how much you're talking about.
[01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:40.220]   That's an interesting idea.
[01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:42.460]   And here's how low your supporting journalism, if you use that stuff.
[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:43.460]   Yeah.
[01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:46.060]   I like it.
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:48.820]   This is fix.com is the website we mentioned.
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:50.460]   It's free to install and play with.
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:51.660]   And it's interesting.
[01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:55.420]   Gina Trapani is a smarter where.org.
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:56.420]   That's her blog.
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:42:01.980]   She also works on a lot of very interesting projects like to do texts.com.
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:05.300]   Brand new versions came out a couple of weeks ago.
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:09.420]   Think up, which is a great Twitter analytic tool.
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:14.060]   And she's building a Raspberry Pi that will automatically diaper her baby.
[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:15.060]   Oh my God.
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:16.060]   That'd be so great.
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:19.940]   I got to talk to Steve about that.
[01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:22.740]   And there are some diapers and no problem.
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:23.740]   Most diapers are no big deal.
[01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:26.100]   But man, once in a while you get that really bad one.
[01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:29.380]   When it comes to babies, it's more pumpkin pie than Raspberry Pi.
[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:31.380]   Oh, man.
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:33.020]   You just really want a robot.
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:34.500]   They're scared of that.
[01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:37.580]   I try to make myself scarce when I suspect one of those is coming up.
[01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:39.580]   I see you, baby.
[01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:40.580]   Bye.
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:44.940]   The greatest thing is the look of oomph and then satisfaction when the
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:45.940]   kids done it.
[01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:46.940]   I know.
[01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:47.940]   It's so cute.
[01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:48.940]   It is.
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:49.940]   Abby used to go behind furniture.
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:50.940]   Yeah.
[01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:52.740]   I mean, she had a diaper on.
[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:53.740]   She wasn't.
[01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:54.740]   Yeah.
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:55.740]   Yeah.
[01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:56.740]   It's instinct, right?
[01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:57.740]   Yeah.
[01:42:57.740 --> 01:42:58.740]   The high.
[01:42:58.740 --> 01:42:59.740]   The privacy.
[01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:01.740]   The privacy, please.
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:04.260]   It's cute.
[01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:05.580]   Babies are cute.
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:07.580]   Not as cute as cats.
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:09.580]   Oh, no, no, kittens.
[01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:10.580]   Kittens and babies.
[01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:11.580]   Kittens and babies.
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:13.580]   They go together, don't they?
[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:14.580]   Yeah, they do.
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:15.580]   They do.
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:17.460]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:18.460]   That's where he blogs.

[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:46.060]   And he is offering plenary indulgences on his Twitter account as we speak.
