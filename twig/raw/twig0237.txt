[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.600]   A big deal for Facebook, $16 billion to buy what's app, what's that all about?
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.000]   We'll talk about it next on Twig.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Netcast, you love.

[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   It's time for Twig, this week in Google, and today it's just the three of us.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   The core group, Gina Trapani, in Mom's house in Brooklyn, wearing a Jets blanket.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Hi Gina.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Hi, good to be here.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Nice to see you.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   As always, just getting the internet set up at the new house, you know, takes a while.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Good to see you too.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I love my Twig.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Are you going with Xfinity Comcast or what are you going to use for your internet service over there?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   We didn't have very many choices.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   It's basically Time Warner.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Oh, well that's smooth.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   You need to own a Comcast.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   That's Jeff Jarvis over there.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   He's at the City University of New York, CUNY.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   She's a designer blanket.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I'm in my warm fleece.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Yeah, we're not on warm California anymore.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Did you have a good trip?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   You were at a spectacular trip.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   But thank you for your magnificent hospitality and generosity.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Well, I didn't do much.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Having us in, my boss in.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   She had a great time.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   She now knows what the fork means.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I like this.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I like the education.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   It was.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   His whole discussion was going by about Forky and Android.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   She admitted it after the show.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I didn't know what that was about, but she figured it out.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   She obviously was not.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   We had an incredible, the next day.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I spoke to the content team at LinkedIn and we saw a flip board.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And then the next day, Friday, I saw Vic and Bradley and Richard
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Jingeris at Google.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And then I met with the head to product for Google class.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And then met with the strategy team at Google, which is an amazing thing.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And then it spent two and a half hours with Reed Hoffman, which was just plain
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and honor.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Neat.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   So it was phenomenal the rest of the week.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Neat.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Good to have you.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   It was good to have you out here.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Please come out anytime.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Great to be there.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And it was really fun having her.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Sarah was great.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Sarah Bartlett, the dean of the school of journalism at the city of
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   University of New York.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And we had a good time.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   So your pixel.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   End of life.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   April 2017.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   They better have a new one by then.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I can't promise you a new one.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Is this new?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   The Chrome OS end of life policy?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   This is something I can't do.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I can't do this.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I wouldn't you wish they'd do this for phones too.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   They're committing to a date until which they will support Chrome.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Right.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I guess that's one way to look at it.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Instead of saying end of life, they should say, here's how long we're
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   going to support this.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Yeah, that would have been a better way to put it.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Because it's a commitment that goes beyond the life of most Android phones, frankly.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Right.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   So Microsoft does this.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   In fact, you know, it's in the news right now because April 8th will be
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   the end of life for Windows XP.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   No more updates.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I had not seen this before.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   No, I'd rather.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   With Google.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   These are Chrome OS devices, right?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Yes.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Chrome OS.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   So my pixel is until April 2017.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Which I think that's okay.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Now it says these are unofficial end of life dates.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Official EOL for these models will be at this date or later.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And the only exception there is the Samsung series 5, which that's the
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   officially announced end of life, which is January 2016.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   But I guess the difference here would be that after the end of life, you could
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   keep on using your Microsoft device forever on your old OS and it's fine.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Right.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   This thing, it may say, sorry, you're Chrome.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   We update Chrome and we can't update you.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   So bye.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Will it?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   When a device is what Google says, reaches EOL, it means the product model is
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   considered obsolete and will no longer receive full support.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Support.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   From Google's enterprise team, additionally enterprise customers using
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   devices, enterprise is not us.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   It's business.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   No.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   That have passed their EOL update may find they cannot manage their devices
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   as expected using the administrator control panel or leverage new
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   management features.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Automatic software updates are not guaranteed.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Doesn't say it won't work anymore.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   This is what happens with Microsoft too.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   They're just not going to fix it.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   So if there's exploits, that's bad.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Chrome books, I would worry less about exploits.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Is it possible having an old version of Chrome will keep you from
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   visiting some sites?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Well, the thing is, I can't ever have an old version of Chrome.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Whenever you restart the machine after a new version has come out, you get it.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Right.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   But you won't after April 2017.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   That's the point.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Not necessarily it sounds.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Not even that.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Not yet.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Won't is not even right.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   May not.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   May not.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   I have kind of mixed feelings about this disposable computer thing.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Me too.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It doesn't Microsoft support Windows versions for like 10 years.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   There was an uproar with XP that they extended it.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   So, I mean, obviously we both agree that you're a developer.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   You know you can't support software forever and ever and ever.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Comes a time you got to move on.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Particularly software that is so closely tied to the hardware.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I mean, you know, with Microsoft, Microsoft has to support so many
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   different hardware configurations anyway by design, you know, over the years.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And part of the reason my Windows is so kind of crafty and heavy, right?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Is that it's got different drivers for different things.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And Android kind of has the same thing.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   But the Chromebooks, it's like, you know, it's a hardware software that the package is tied
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   together.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I kind of feel like they could do better than four years.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I'd like them to do better than four years.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   But then again, their whole take on the Chromebook is that it's this disposable computer that you can throw in the river and get it.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   You know, when it's 200 bucks, I mean, my 1500 buck machine, you know, probably pixel owners should be a little more upset.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   But, but, but what have I ever kept a computer longer than three years?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Well, right.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   That's true.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   That's true.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   But, you know, if they're targeting developing countries or education.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   That's a really good point.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   You don't don't have, you know, the kind of resources that we have or the kind of, you know, computing demands that we have.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I mean, look, it's a lot better than Android.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Right.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Android was, you know, purportedly supposed to be every 18 months.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   They were going to upgrade and that's not shorter than even a two year contract.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   We talked about this a little bit last night on all about Android.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   So four years is okay, but it's just interesting to see, you know, that change, that commitment to backwards compatibility, which was very much a hallmark of Microsoft's approach to software for better or for worse.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   You know, you know, kind of flipped on its head.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And that's, I think because in its DNA, Google is a, is a web company.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And when you deploy web software, you deploy it and it's updated, right?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So like here's a web company trying to distribute devices running desktop software and they're like, we're not going to, you know, Jean, I was talking to somebody when I was at Google.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I won't say who, but I was just talking to somebody at Google and I talked about web stuff and they kind of just poo pooed web.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   What?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   They're a mobile company.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Hmm.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   I wouldn't poo poo web.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I don't think desktop's going away.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I wouldn't either. I think it was done for effect, but wow, you know, where they're putting the resources is mobile.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Yeah, but they're putting the resources into GMS, right, which is that layer on top of Android that that interacts with the cloud.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   So I equate web with cloud services and there's a different consumer.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   I do, Jim.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   But browser web browser.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I was, I was complaining about something I wanted on a web browser and I was kind of told.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Grandpa.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Jeez.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   That's absurd.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   I'm sorry. That's just, that's absurd.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   People are going to use desktops for a long time to come.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Yeah, of course.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   But in terms of where their resource, I think it was illustrative of where their resources are going, where they see the importance of development.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And, you know, given choices of priorities, they're, you know, we see all these numbers now about these huge proportions of traffic are mobile.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   I think I think that's a misnomer in great measure.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   We've talked about this in the show before because I think that bundles in things that are not mobile like tablets.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   And we need to redefine what mobile means.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Mobile means a phone to me and you're gone somewhere else.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   But even then you're still using a browser.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   You're still using the web.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   But I pointed to my beloved pixel and it was kind of.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Wow.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   So maybe by 2017 you won't.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   You'll be using what is it?
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I mean, I'll be using my Google glass, of course.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   It makes sense if your Facebook or Google or Yahoo to think that what you want to do is transition your revenue to mobile because that's how more and more and more than half now of all computing is done on mobile.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   But it doesn't mean the end of the world for a desktop by any means.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   I can't.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I don't anticipate that ever happening.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I mean, I think I'm not asking you to reveal who you talked to, but I think this depends a lot on who.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   You know, what.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   I mean, I'm not going to send out a chai well.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Okay.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   But it was it made me well, I mean, because we were out there looking at what we should do as a journalism school and we keep on talking how we have to do more mobile and we know we have to do more mobile and a remediate company.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I know says that.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   But when I heard that, I thought, even more than I thought, yikes.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   That's interesting.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   That's interesting.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   I had a very pleasant lunch with Steve Lee, who's the head of Google Glass product.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   I just asked as a condition that he'd not punched me out when we sat down.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And he didn't.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   He was very, very nice.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   I have one on the record.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   I have ordered my lenses.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Oh, he turned you around on it.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Well, yeah, I kind of felt like a schmuck.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And, you know, I need to know how this thing operates in optimal conditions, and I've never had it in optimal conditions.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   So my wife's not happy, but I ordered my lenses.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I talked to somebody.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   So we had two people from Google in the audience, unbeknownst to me on Sunday during Twit, one of them marked as marketing for Google Glass.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   And she was sitting on her hands because I was saying things like every time I see somebody with glass on, I feel like I just want to punch them in the nose.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   And, but one of another person came up who was wearing it with prescription lenses and said, you know, you really haven't experienced it.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   And I wear glasses like you, Jeff.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   You really haven't experienced it.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   And that's, I think what you're saying, unless you've tried it with your prescription glasses on.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I guess what I have to do.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Or I should have gotten contacts, but I'm too squeamish.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Well, that's, then you really weren't, you couldn't see it.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Couldn't see it.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   No, no, I couldn't.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Well, I was, so what was over my chest?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Jeff, it was over my glasses.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Oh, you were wearing it over your glasses?
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Oh, that's really silly.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Better with these glasses than, than Hormerins or something.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   People who have black frame glasses can't use it at all.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Here, but you had, you had to adjust it constantly to try to get right in there.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   How many geeks don't wear glasses?
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   It seems like, it seems like if you're a geek, the glasses go with the territory.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   I think so.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Gina, you wear glasses, I'm sure.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I don't.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Oh, stop it.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   You're not a geek.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   It's perfect.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   I got lucky with your eyes.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   You have perfect eyes, really?
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.080]   Gina is perfect in all ways.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.000]   I guess that confirms what we've always suspected, but it's got to all.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Oh, hey.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Gina is in it.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   It's not about Android.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Gina is an Android.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Oh, I wish.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   I'd be much more efficient.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Gina is an Android.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Gina is an Android.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Wow.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I feel solely by Diet Pepsi.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Ooh.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   That's a good kind of hand.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   There's, you have reached singularity, Gina.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   A world fueled by Diet Pepsi.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Like it.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.920]   I don't know if we want to belabor this.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   I think all hardware has to come to an end.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.040]   It does seem a little swift.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:05.120]   The Acer AC700, which is only a couple of years old ends July 2015, next summer.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.600]   Three years seems quick.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.600]   Is there, okay, oh, yeah.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   So what's the number?
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.600]   Is five years good?
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.600]   I'd say 10.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.560]   I mean, this problem with computer hardware is the hardware itself, especially with solid
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.880]   state drives, never wears out.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.360]   Right.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.240]   And it doesn't, I don't understand why you can't support it.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.160]   Maybe it's going to get slower.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.160]   It's going to get slower.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.760]   But what features?
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.760]   I don't know.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.600]   When you make Chrome OS, see, that's, this is the question.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.080]   What is Google thinking they're going to do that would make this happen?
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.080]   Absolutely.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.880]   I mean, it just, it seems like graceful degradation.
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.080]   You know, even if they get slower big deal.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.680]   And it's a new hardware, you know, get it to work without that feature.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.680]   It's low hardware.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.120]   I mean, that slows down the development process and it adds, you know, it can add some complexity
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.120]   to your code base.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.320]   But isn't, Gina, isn't the whole notion of Chrome that every device is automatically
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.400]   upgraded to the same Chrome level?
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.160]   And that's why, and that's, and that's what makes it secure because it's verifying.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.160]   You always know it has the fixed up latest version of Chrome.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.680]   You have no choice about that.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.560]   You have a choice of, of which track you're on, but you have a blessed version of Chrome
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.040]   when you throw this machine on.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.160]   If it's not blessed, it will not work.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.560]   And that's what it's Chrome.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.920]   It's security and it's, and it's consistency, right?
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.080]   Isn't that architecturally that's just different from Windows where I bought the, the OS.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:34.280]   I mean, my favorite sort of little fun fact about Chrome is that the first thing that
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.480]   the developers built before they built any browser functionality was the auto update
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.480]   functionality.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.480]   Huh?
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.480]   Like the first thing that they built, people ran just a little executive, like executive
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.360]   ball on their desktop that would auto update.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.640]   Like that was the first thing they did because it was, you know, Chrome was from the beginning,
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:56.280]   supposed to do graceful, silent, instantaneous updates that didn't require you to restart.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.440]   I don't know if you remember Firefox was a bear.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.440]   You always had to restart.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.520]   You knew they made a big, you know, Mozilla would do these giant big parties about new
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.520]   Firefox releases.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.520]   We all knew the version.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.520]   That's right.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.520]   That's right.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.520]   Remember?
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.520]   And Chrome does it.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.360]   I mean, Chrome's version numbers are insanely long.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.720]   They're constantly pushing out updates.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.720]   It happened silently.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.720]   You don't even know.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.000]   Well, you do have to restart though.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   You do have to restart.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Occasionally you do.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Occasionally you do.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.840]   Or the little hamburger turns orange and says, Hey, please update Chrome.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.760]   I mean, at this point, I really don't shut down my computer or shut down Chrome very often.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.440]   So I'll catch that once in a while.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.080]   But it's a completely different paradigm than what it used to be.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:36.880]   So we came from a world of Windows updates that would be like multiple restarts and packs,
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.880]   service packs.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:43.920]   And then we had Firefox, which was like, you know, also sort of very old school version,
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.480]   big version drop releases to Chrome, which was the silent update.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:52.600]   So yeah, I mean, silent updates that happen without you having to deal with them automatically.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.280]   That's like, that's like one of the basis, you know, it's that and speed were the two
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.280]   things that Chrome really promised.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.360]   So actually, the life thing seems strange to me.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.400]   From a hardware perspective, we talked with the show about the potential of the modular
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.000]   phone and Google's working on that and others working on that, where you take an old ship
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.960]   out and put a new chip in.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.800]   Shouldn't a laptop be like them?
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.760]   The screen is pretty much good for a long time.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.800]   The camera is good for a long time.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.360]   The keyboard is buttery and beautiful.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.360]   The crack pad is buttery and beautiful.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.200]   You know, what I need in Chromebooks is more RAM and there's a new chip that offers something.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.000]   You're missing the point here.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Chrome cannot ever get to the point where it won't work on the mass of PC hardware.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   And that's out there.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.520]   Forget the Chrome browser.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:43.800]   The Chrome browser, they're never going to say, oh, you can no longer run the Chrome browser
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.280]   on your Intel Core 2.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.320]   It just will run slower.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.040]   There's no way they're making Chrome incompatible with the vast majority of PCs out there,
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.040]   right?
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.040]   That's not a OS.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.040]   That's the browser.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.040]   But Chrome OS is just a browser.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.960]   Well, but no, it doesn't work with the machine.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:05.720]   It's the browser on top of some sort of layer that that's the computer, right?
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.720]   I mean, there.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.800]   It doesn't require fingerprint reading or scanning.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.600]   No, maybe it's something.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.600]   Wow.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.600]   I think this is awesome.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.600]   Maybe you might be poking at something there.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.600]   I mean, right?
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.600]   Yeah, security.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:22.440]   Clearly, what's wrong with security in this world is that we should get to the point where
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.720]   knowing your name and your social security number and one of the passwords you use for
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.880]   a service shouldn't matter.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.440]   It shouldn't matter at all because there's better security mechanisms.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.200]   So, yeah, it could be something like that, Leo.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   No.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.960]   I'm going to make people buy new computers.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.280]   Well, they just bought a company.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.120]   They bought a company with the new voice security thing.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.120]   That's bogus, by the way.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.840]   Oh, wait, is it it's voice or I thought that sound sound?
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:52.200]   So you go to the website, it plays an inaudible tone that your phone picks up and authenticates
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   you.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.200]   Oh, is that it?
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.080]   Oh, I think we were talking to Steve Gibson about this because he's doing something similar
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.520]   that's an open source project to do a similar thing, not with sound.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.520]   And it's his opinion.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.520]   He's right.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.520]   This was an acquire.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.320]   This was hiring the engineers, but it's clearly shows a direction.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.920]   That's a lot better than entering a freaking code from Google Authenticator, right?
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.960]   I mean, well, it is if you have speaker and it's too hard.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.520]   We're dependent.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.120]   It's called slick walking password dependence.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.120]   No good either.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.120]   They want the engineers.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.200]   I don't think they care about well, there are better ways to do this that don't require
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:33.160]   you holding your smartphone up to the speaker that may or may not exist on your hardware.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.160]   What if you have a computer?
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.480]   Yeah, that's silly.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.080]   I don't think that's the actual reason they acquired this.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.240]   I think they got they wanted the engineers.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.240]   But we'll see.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.400]   Maybe Google will announce an audio authentication system.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.640]   I mean, if, you know, what I go through is we're two step authentication at this point.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.520]   Like that experience can be improved so much more.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.520]   This is not two step.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.560]   This is something separate.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.520]   This is password free authentication.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.520]   Right.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.520]   Right.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.920]   That's what Steve is also doing with his squirrel project.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:11.600]   The idea being that just as you I'll give you an example that will ring with you, Gina,
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.480]   where you use SSH, you have the keys stored on the server that you're logging into.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.000]   You don't use it password.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.840]   It's more secure using public key crypto.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.680]   And this is something similar to that is thieves doing.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.840]   The sound would just be like a QR code.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.480]   I think this is not something Google is particularly interested in.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.480]   That'll be my guess.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.720]   But I'm just guessing I haven't spoken to anybody at Google.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.800]   Can we talk about Google I/O and I'm skipping ahead.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.200]   Hey, Google I/O.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.320]   It's in June this year.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.520]   Sundar for Chai just just posted his Google+ page less than an hour ago.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.480]   The new the dates June 25th June 26th.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.440]   And they're making changes to registration.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.000]   You won't need to scramble the second registration open.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.560]   Sundar says are successful.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.320]   They'll be implementing a new system where you could submit your interest to attend Google
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.320]   I/O.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.080]   Oh, no, you have to apply.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:14.000]   Yeah, as accessible applicants will then be randomly selected and notified shortly thereafter.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   We'll be fine.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.440]   It's like how is turns birthday party?
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.840]   It's like Burning Man.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:24.360]   If it's anything like Google developer interviews, I'm probably in big trouble.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:28.440]   You guys saw the scene in the internship when it was like, yeah, the tiny man was shrunk
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.440]   down and stuck into a blender.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.440]   How would they get out?
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.440]   Get out.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.440]   By the way, I never did understand how they got out, but okay.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.560]   It's something to visit.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.000]   Let me let us go on the record right now.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.400]   Anyone watching from Google, please, please.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:50.760]   I'm pretty sure that press is different than developers.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:54.600]   Gina, Gina knock on that paneling behind you.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.920]   But you know, it's a measure of how popular this is.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:02.120]   And I'm glad that they did this because in the past, the whole thing has been what all
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.120]   gone in 30 seconds.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.600]   It's like that Nick Cage movie gone in 30 seconds.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.040]   So this is not who can click fastest.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.040]   Right.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.480]   Although it would be a kind of a good test.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.640]   Who can write the best script to auto register for Google I/O?
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.880]   Then you'd have to be a good coder.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.880]   Right.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.880]   And then you'd have to get in.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.880]   Just for your efforts.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.280]   Matt, Matt cuts, comes and kills them.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.280]   Right.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.280]   So this makes sense.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.680]   Although it shows how popular they are that they have far more people wanting to go than
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.920]   they can fit in.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.000]   So they have to do a random drawing of all entries.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Wow.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.920]   I think people want to go to Google I/O, not for the developer resources.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.360]   They're not necessarily to be there when they make big announcements.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.840]   They want to go for the swag.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.840]   Well, okay.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.840]   Can I make a suggestion?
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.160]   And then they stop, you know, no more Santa Pichai.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.240]   They start just to stop giving away crap.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.000]   Well, they start to pull back.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.280]   I mean, they start to reel that in a little bit last year, right?
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.120]   Remember that moment where he wears, I think it was a dar who said, oh, this new phone,
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.120]   you're not getting one.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:10.280]   Like it's 179 in the play store and everyone in the room was sort of like, oh, that whole
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.400]   Oprah thing kind of freaks me out about I/O.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.200]   I think if he took away that element, there would be less competition for people to get
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.200]   in there.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.200]   Right.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.400]   And that's as a developer that must cheese you off.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.840]   Well, I mean, listen, I like my toys too.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.560]   But, you know, I was in line at Google I/O one point and I was chatting with the folks in
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.960]   front of me and they were like, oh, you know, we're students.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.040]   So with the student discount, we got in for this much.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.240]   And but the value of these goodies that we got is way more than that.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.960]   So when we eBay them, you know, we're really going to make money back.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.320]   I was like, that's why you're here?
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.400]   I mean, I'm not saying that these these kids and they were cute and they were smart.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.400]   It's terrible.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.400]   I don't think that they were necessarily representative, but it was a weird, I thought
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.240]   it was a weird reason to want to go.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.240]   Those people, you know what?
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.440]   There was a word for it in Yiddish.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.440]   They're Schnorrrs.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.000]   That's a new one on there.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.840]   I'm a bunch of Gentiles around here.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.440]   I'm an honorary Jew.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:12.600]   Schnorrrs are chislers, sponges, spongers.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.440]   They are just a Schnorrr, according to the Jewish dictionary, is distinguished from an
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:21.680]   ordinary beggar by Dintov, his boundless hutzpah.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.800]   A Schnorr is far worse than a cheaper miserly person.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.600]   He's often unethical to the point of stealing.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.600]   Is the stealing always illegal?
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.600]   No.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.040]   In fact, more often than stealing is quite subtle and perfectly legal.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.360]   Legal but not ethical.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.840]   You're a Schnorrrs.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.480]   Knock it off.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.200]   What I think is going to be interesting is how, what kind of system could Google possibly
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.080]   implement to make this?
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.280]   I mean, it sounds like it's basically going to be a lottery.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:55.080]   Andy Beyo does XOXO, and he had an application process for the conference, right?
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.960]   Because he had a similar thing where he just had so many people wanted to come and only
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.960]   so much space.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.040]   He wanted to maintain a level of intimacy that Google I/O certainly does not have.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.640]   But he had people answer a set of questions, three or four questions.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.640]   He wanted makers.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.520]   He wanted people who were creatives.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:14.280]   And his co-conference chair went through them and chose people kind of by hand.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.160]   I mean, I think as much as a group to me.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.160]   I mean, there's a lot of controversy about that.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.600]   You should be there, Gina, because you are going to build stuff that's what the truth
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.600]   is.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.600]   The truth is I shouldn't be, but shh.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.600]   No, you should be there as a journalist.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.600]   As journalists.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.600]   I thought this absolutely face the facts.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.960]   But they should look at their self-interest in I/O and they want people, they want developers
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.000]   who build things, who build this future.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.840]   And they should be, they should be like a university admission.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.840]   Exactly.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.720]   How do I, how do they know that I'm someone who's going to make stuff?
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.480]   Like, do they say only a developer has had?
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.480]   Because you've made it.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.480]   You look at, you know what?
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.080]   Do it on GitHub.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.080]   You get in by your GitHub.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.080]   That's true.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.720]   You get in by your GitHub account or do you have to have, you know, an application listed
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.280]   in the Play Store or in the Chrome Web Store?
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.280]   Maybe.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.280]   You know, do you have to show your GitHub profile?
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.440]   For all we know, for all we know, they're doing that because it sounds like there's this
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.840]   pre-qualification a little bit, right?
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.840]   Random.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.080]   But for all we know, they're going to take everybody who asks, they're going to look
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.560]   at their GitHub account.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:16.040]   I bet you they've got a Python script that then sorts them and then randomly picks them.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.040]   Actually, they already know who they want there and they're going to put it in your
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.040]   brain.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.720]   Those want to come and they're going to make you apply.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.040]   Yes, it's more presumptive than that.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.160]   But you know, they're also trying to get new developers in, right?
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.160]   That's true.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.000]   You don't want, you don't want devs who are already sold, you know, who are already going
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   to do the work anyway.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.720]   You don't want people who, if you're, let's run it this way.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.600]   If you're not putting stuff on GitHub, should they want you there?
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.200]   I mean, is that a minimum requirement?
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.960]   A lot of developers work for companies who don't open source their stuff and they're
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.960]   works in the dark.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.240]   Does that mean that doesn't necessarily mean that they're less worthy and a lot of developers
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.400]   work for companies and build the Android app, but their company's Android app is listed
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.000]   as the company's Android app, right?
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Because they're employed.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   So this is tough.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   This is hard.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.680]   I bet you there's an algorithm.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.120]   Google's an algorithmic company.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.520]   I bet you they figured it out.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.200]   I'm sure that there's some sort of algorithm.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.520]   I'm sure there's also major selection bias.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.520]   Yes.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.000]   And I look forward to critiquing the algorithm.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Yes.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   All right.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Let's do it.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Let's critique the algorithm.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.040]   In any case, Google, please.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:24.120]   Don't be a snorer.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.560]   I thought about that.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.640]   I bought my Chromebook.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.640]   That's right.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.640]   You did.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.640]   You did.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.640]   I bought a Chromebook.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.640]   I bought my glass.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.640]   I bought my frames.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.640]   I bought my lenses.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.240]   Actually, yeah, you're no snorer.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.120]   Well, I've got no, I've gotten a story and things.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.000]   I've got my original Nexus phone came from Davos.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.400]   They gave him a lot.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.400]   That's right.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.120]   You know, I've taken my Google swag.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.600]   I should have worn my Google Plus hat today that I bought.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.840]   Oh, did you buy a Google Plus hat?
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.760]   I bought a Google Plus hat, yes.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.360]   And the commercial break all over together.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.840]   I want to see a Google Plus hat.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.400]   I didn't even-- where'd you buy it?
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.640]   At the Google Swag Store, which is my--
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.840]   Oh, you went in.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.840]   You have to go in.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.840]   I get it.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.840]   And they have to escort you in.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:08.840]   What?
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.840]   It's not open to the unwashed masses.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.680]   Oh, God, no, say I take you in.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.120]   And so luckily, I beat a big tour group.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.280]   You've been in the store, haven't you?
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.240]   No, I barely don't have the--
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.760]   Oh, he's there at the summer.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.680]   They escorted us as well.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.520]   I was there for the Google Summer Code, like the Mentor Summit.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.760]   And there were scheduled times.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.840]   And we were escorted by Google.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.960]   We had free run of the store.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.720]   It was a Sunday.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.160]   They clearly opened it up for us.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.280]   I mean, it definitely seems like a guest thing.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.920]   It's kind of over the river in through the woods.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.480]   Like, to get there.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.480]   Oh, really?
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.160]   It's over in 1950.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.080]   It's--
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.680]   Yeah, no, you have to cross that little bridge.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.680]   It's like a--
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.680]   Cross the bridge, yeah.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:49.680]   Wow.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.680]   That's where Google+ is.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.880]   So I was in that neighborhood.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.360]   Wow.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.920]   I've never been there.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.720]   Speaking of plus, this New York Times story--
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.440]   Did you call this laughable?
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.200]   I feel like we've got a--
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.240]   Yeah, I'm the one who's laughable.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.440]   I was screaming about it.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.800]   Because it's going to set Leo off to it.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.920]   I didn't see it, so tell me and I can get mad at it.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.720]   It just starts off on the old ghost town's deck.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.480]   How can-- well, you know, and I'm the one of the people who
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.000]   says Google+ is a great place to talk with people
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.080]   who work at Google.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:17.600]   It is.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.680]   And I was with Vic and Bradley and Richard J. Graz.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.720]   And I'm sure he won't mind me quoting into this effect,
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.440]   because it's positive to Google+.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.200]   But Vic's saying, we've really grown a hell of a lot
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.960]   in a hell of a short time.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.600]   And he likens it to the growth of an android or something
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.440]   like that.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.160]   It's still on a spike.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.040]   I still think, you know, very clearly, the quality of what
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.640]   I do on Google+ versus what I do on Facebook versus what
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.800]   I do on Twitter versus what I do on Medium,
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.440]   they all have their roles.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.200]   And it's not room for one--
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.920]   it's not a zero-sum game in my life.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.400]   And so I use Google+, I like Google+,
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.120]   there are a lot of people here who use Google+,
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.480]   and just because you don't use it, New York--
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.280]   I mean, Claire Kay Miller is a tech writer,
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.400]   and it was just--
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.240]   Was that her thing is I don't use it?
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:04.920]   And so--
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:05.960]   Well, I guess that must be what it is,
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.080]   because it's a ghost town.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.080]   But the real problem then was it comes around and says,
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.320]   oh, it's not there for you to be social.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.920]   No, they have a secret agenda.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.440]   They want to target ads.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.840]   No, bullpucky.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.960]   Of course they do.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.960]   That's their whole business model.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.840]   You just discovered this?
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.920]   It was just stupid.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.880]   It was page one stupidity.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.080]   So there was-- and I can see what's going to happen.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.520]   Bradley Horowitz goes for an interview,
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.400]   and then gets burned.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.240]   And so this--
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.080]   Was he interviewed in this article?
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.720]   Well, he's quoted a lot.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.840]   Just be on.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.400]   I really turn the corner with Google+, I have to say.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.600]   If you go to my Google+ profile,
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.640]   it looks as if I don't use it at all, right?
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.320]   Because I haven't posted anything publicly in a while.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:52.360]   But Google Hangouts has become a part of my daily life.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.000]   The video conferencing with my daughter
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.440]   is amazing.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.200]   The little hats and the must--
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.120]   the little effects cracks her up,
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.000]   so we use that way.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.640]   Oh, I want to see that.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.840]   Yeah, I mean, really.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.680]   The other day, I had forgotten to push some stuff
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.480]   to GitHub from my home computer.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.800]   So I hang out in my wife and said, hey, can you just
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.760]   allow remote desktop access?
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.840]   And I wound up remoting into my home computer using Hangouts.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.160]   I turned on auto backup for my photos and videos.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.280]   The auto awesome videos that Google+ makes are amazing.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.200]   Like, if you've got a little kid or a pet,
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.600]   and you just--
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.040]   I'm never going to edit video.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.880]   But I still take-- I take video now only because of Google
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.800]   Plus because the auto awesome videos are great.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.640]   The auto backup of my photos is amazing.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:40.080]   So I use Google+, a lot, which is in the dark.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.800]   I use the private features.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.000]   So I'm not using the social tool, really.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.480]   But yeah, I mean, for a while, we actually
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.720]   wound up switching to Slack.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.480]   But my company was using Google Hangouts
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.480]   as our internal chat.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.240]   Speaking of Slack is really, really good.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.120]   It's in preview.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:57.800]   But you--
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.720]   But you're doing Slack.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.240]   That's--
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.240]   Stewart Butterfield.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.240]   Stewart Butterfield, OK.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   And he wrote it.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   Flickr founder.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.240]   Flickr founder.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.320]   Flickr co-founder.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.480]   And Stewart, just as a side here,
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.720]   wrote a fantastic resignation letter from Yahoo years ago
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.400]   about how he was in the 10 business, what happened to the 10 business.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.160]   And now he has a letter to his staff about being in the saddle business.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.880]   Stewart, I love him, Stewart.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.240]   He's just great.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.640]   But yeah, so--
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.280]   It's a fine piece of software at Slack.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.680]   I've got to say.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.800]   Is it a project management tool?
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.280]   It's enterprise-focused.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.120]   It's communications.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:34.760]   It's chat.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:40.480]   So it's a really beautifully designed web-based, similar to IRC.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.960]   I hate to say IRC, because IRC--
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.600]   and even the nice clients, like I'm using Textual,
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.120]   it's so much better experience than that.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.480]   You can attach files, and you can have different channels or whatever.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.000]   But it's been really great for my team.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.400]   And the mobile apps are just gorgeous.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.520]   Is it invite only right now, or is it open?
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.920]   Yeah, I think it is invite only.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.760]   And I'm not sure actually how we got in, but I think it nailed it.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.600]   It's a fax machine problem, right?
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.600]   You've got to know somebody to make it useful to you.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.760]   Slack.com.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.120]   Can you send me an invite, Gina?
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.400]   Yeah, I'll see what I can do.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.720]   I'll see what I can do.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.440]   No, no, no, no.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.000]   Seems like we'd like to use this here.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.480]   We've tried a lot of these things.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.160]   I mean, there's a million of them.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.160]   Yeah, there's a million of them.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.440]   There's Yammer is similar--
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.320]   Yammer is campfire for a while, and then we're using Hangouts.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:31.400]   And yeah, it's really nice.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.880]   Let's see what I can do to hurry along your empty--
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.400]   anyway, back to Google+, I use Google+, all the time.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.560]   It is not obvious from my page on Google+
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.880]   because I don't use it to post public updates.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.360]   I could.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.200]   I should.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.000]   I have guilt about it.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.680]   Just like I have guilt about not blogging.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.240]   That's another thing.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.400]   But I think that people just have to stop equating Google+
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.920]   with the social product.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.280]   Actually, I just signed up.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.200]   It said I'll get an invitation by February 28th,
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:58.960]   so I can wait.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.440]   That's not it.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.480]   Oh, OK, cool.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.040]   That's soon.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.040]   Oh, they're going to go live.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:02.520]   That's great.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.360]   That's really good of them to say give you a date.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.200]   I like this.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.920]   That is really nice.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:12.360]   So Facebook just bought what's app for $16 billion.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.320]   Oh, that just happened.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:13.800]   Just happened.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.160]   $16 billion?
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.760]   What's app had said for a long time, we are not--
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.600]   geez.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.440]   We're sale.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.440]   $16 billion?
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.120]   That's what they're saying in the chat room.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:25.920]   Do we have a link?
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.000]   Because I'm looking for it right now.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.200]   $16 billion is--
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.560]   that's a lot.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.680]   What's app is extremely popular?
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.400]   Give me a link, somebody, because maybe that's just bogus.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.840]   Here it is, businessinsider.com.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.400]   That would be--
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.920]   I used WhatsApp a little bit at Davos.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.720]   I still don't understand WhatsApp.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.920]   Oh, I use it all the time.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.760]   It's where it fits in.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.240]   It's internet-based messaging.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.000]   It's a very crowded space.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.520]   People use Facebook, Apple's Messenger,
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.800]   and other programs for it.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:03.840]   It allows you to send media as well as text.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.800]   Facebook--
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.640]   for $12 billion in stock and $4 billion in cash,
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.720]   according to businessinsider.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.040]   That is a stunning amount of money.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.520]   I mean, given that YouTube was just a billion-some--
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.360]   Wow.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.840]   You know what's going to happen?
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.120]   Facebook stock is going to go higher than it'll
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.040]   make it up with no time flat.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.440]   They got the cash.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.440]   That's crazy money.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.440]   Of course--
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.800]   Remember, Facebook started this all by paying--
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.680]   geez, it seems so long ago-- a billion dollars for Instagram.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.680]   Right, and we all went nuts about that.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:41.400]   What's app, which is a mobile app for iOS, Android?
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.840]   I think they have it for Windows Phone.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.760]   I'm not sure off the check.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:45.840]   It's cross-platform.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:50.520]   It's internet-based text, and audio, and video messaging.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.560]   It is probably the number one of these programs.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.440]   Remember, they bought Beluga not too many years ago as well,
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.240]   which was a very similar program.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.800]   So it strikes me that the technology they probably already
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.120]   have.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.800]   This must be--
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:13.120]   they're buying this for the users, which is a big user base.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:19.080]   Facebook bought Beluga in March of 2011, three years ago.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   Let me see if I can find the price.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:25.080]   Boy, the press release is just numbing.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.240]   Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, merger sub
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.880]   will merge with an into WhatsApp, the first merger.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.520]   And upon consummation of the first merger,
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.920]   merger sub will cease to exist, and WhatsApp
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.560]   will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the acquirer.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.360]   The surviving corporation of the first merger
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.080]   will then merge with an into acquirer,
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.360]   which will continue to exist as a wholly owned,
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.720]   in part, directly and in part, indirectly,
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.520]   subsidiary of parent.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.880]   Upon consummation, the stooping, the closing of the transactions
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.240]   kind of put in Jesus Christ.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.200]   I don't know why they would release the business deal memo
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.600]   as a press release.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.000]   That's pretty stupid.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.920]   But it might be-- you could tell some stuff from that.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.400]   Yeah, you can.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.160]   It's not unusual that--
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.520]   yeah, that's basically what we're seeing as the SEC
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.320]   formula K. It's not unusual for you to do something like this
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:16.360]   when you acquire a new company, because what you're doing
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.920]   is you're acquiring the assets of the company
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.120]   without the employees.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.680]   Right, exactly.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.560]   There's reasons that they would structure it that way.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.520]   I don't think we need to--
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.720]   They would make that the press release.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.080]   We don't really need to worry about it.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.560]   16 billion.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.720]   Most of that stock, though, 12 million stocks.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.160]   Oh, it smokes.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.080]   4 billion shares.
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:37.960]   183 million shares of parents class A common value
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:42.040]   to 12 billion based on the closing price, six day proceeding.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.680]   So now when Mark Zuckerberg gives a record billion dollars
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:48.480]   to charity, you can just say, well, that's nothing.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.480]   Mark, come on.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.240]   Mark, hey Mark, hey Mark.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.720]   Same journalism, will you?
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.640]   I got a few ideas.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.880]   I got some ideas.
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.720]   I'll do it for 500 million.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.560]   Honest, you know.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:02.800]   When Jeff, wouldn't you and I get together
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.600]   to save journalism for half a billion?
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.280]   Oh, yeah, easy, easy.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.520]   I mean, PR Omidar only is paying a quarter of a billion
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.640]   to Glenn Greenwald.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.480]   Jeff Bezos, a quarter of a billion.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.200]   Yeah, and all the objectives and pure magazines
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.640]   will save all journalism.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.800]   We'll save all of journalism.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.640]   All of it, all of it.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.520]   So Motorola sold for 12 billion and WhatsApp sold for 16.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.120]   Think about that.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.640]   Wow.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.160]   You're buying the users.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.120]   You're buying the users.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:28.800]   That's what you're buying.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.840]   How many users does it have?
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.400]   Tons.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.360]   It's the easily the most--
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.040]   So replaceable.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.440]   I went into it.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.760]   I had a serious addictive WhatsApp period.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.960]   I have since graduated.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.280]   But now it's a good app.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.200]   It's for people who don't want to pay for text messaging
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.920]   or don't want to use regular text messaging.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.920]   It's chatting on the phone.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.720]   I mean, I get it.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.280]   I mean, it's Facebook Messenger.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:48.720]   Basically--
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.720]   In December of--
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.480]   It is.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.920]   Facebook has the technology.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:56.800]   In December of 2013, WhatsApp passed 400 million monthly
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.000]   users, regular users, 400 million.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.840]   That's all.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.480]   That's double what they had in April, though.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.880]   So they were growing quite fast.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.040]   In fact, you might assume that it is considerably over 400 million
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.400]   if they're doubling at that point.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.200]   Well, and Facebook clearly sees its future as mobile.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.920]   And that also illuminates that line from Google.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.360]   Here's a critical note.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.880]   There's a survey that came out in December
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:29.400]   that said, at 44% of all smartphone users polled--
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.200]   what's-- I'm sorry.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.160]   They poll-- OK.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.400]   WhatsApp overtook Facebook as the leading mobile messaging
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.760]   service back in December.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.080]   They have 44% of all mobile messaging.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.360]   We can't beat them by them.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.240]   Yep.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.880]   35% Facebook Messenger.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:52.960]   44% of-- now, this was a survey of 4,000 world--
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:56.200]   in five countries, 4,000 users in five countries.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.720]   44% use WhatsApp at least once a week.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.120]   Wow.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:07.160]   That's a huge amount of money.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.560]   If you're just tuning in, this is breaking news.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.560]   Facebook's just announced the acquisition
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:16.000]   of mobile messaging app WhatsApp for $16 billion, $12 billion
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   in stock, $4 billion in cash.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.800]   That is huge, huge.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.880]   We're going to take a break.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:25.840]   We'll come back with more.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.920]   You guys, if you want, can do a little thinking
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.520]   about what this means.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.600]   And we'll return-- and we'll show you what's app.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.160]   I have it on a number of my devices, if you want it.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.120]   If you've not used it, I can't imagine anybody's not used it.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.360]   At the growth rate, somebody in the chat room said,
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.120]   at the current growth rate of WhatsApp,
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.040]   it would have been able to buy Facebook in six months.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.120]   So this was almost necessary.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.680]   This was a defensive move.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.920]   No, they didn't have Facebook's cash.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:55.680]   Our show today brought to you by Personal Capital.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.000]   My friend Bill Harris joined us on triangulation
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.240]   more than a year ago.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:03.560]   He's a former CEO of PayPal and Intuit,
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.520]   knows a little bit about money.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.000]   And he was telling me about this startup, Personal Capital.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.640]   He said, the problem people have right now
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.680]   is just every one of their financial accounts
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.280]   is a different website with a different password.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.280]   There's no easy way to look at it.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.160]   And we're not just talking all your checking accounts.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.840]   We're talking your mortgage, your loans, your credit cards,
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.040]   and your investments.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.720]   They're all spread out everywhere.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:34.640]   Personal capital makes it easy to see where you stand
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:39.400]   by combining all of those accounts into a single page
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.600]   with beautiful real-time graphs.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:47.600]   And then once you do that, you can make sense of it,
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.320]   make the right investments.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.240]   In fact, one of the things people do often is overpay
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.560]   for management of these assets.
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.680]   You can do it yourself with personalcapital.com.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.480]   It'll show you how much you're overpaying in fees
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.800]   and how to reduce those fees.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.720]   You'll get tailored advice on how to optimize
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.200]   your investment strategy, and it's free.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.040]   So why wait?
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   Signing up just takes a minute.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.200]   It's secure.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.360]   I know sometimes people, Gina, you and I had this issue
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.080]   with another financial service.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.280]   Do I want to give them all my stuff?
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.440]   They're using the same back end that all the banks do.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.800]   It's completely secure.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.160]   You're not giving them information
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.520]   that service doesn't already have.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.480]   In other words, and boy pays big dividends.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.600]   Total clarity and transparency
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.480]   make better investment decisions instantly.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.440]   They're really are great.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:40.000]   Personalcapital.com/twig.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.080]   That's the page to go to
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.200]   so they know you saw it on this week in Google.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.240]   Personalcapital.com/twig, it's free,
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:49.120]   and it's a smart way to grow your money.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.480]   Personalcapital.com/twig, we thank them for their support.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.200]   And if you grow your money right, maybe someday,
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:00.200]   you too can buy a messaging app for $16 billion.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.760]   A billion dollars.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.720]   Jesus.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.400]   Doesn't it seem possible?
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:11.480]   I'm just watching my tweets go by about this.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.160]   That's a queen dollar or employee.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.600]   Half a billion per employee.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.080]   Half a billion capital is it.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.840]   Total funding, $8 million, $8 million from Sequoia.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.920]   You're kidding.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.960]   I think so.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.720]   Go to Crunchbase and see if I got that wrong.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.120]   That's amazing.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:30.160]   If that's all, it's an Israeli company, I believe,
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.000]   is that right?
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.680]   Oh, it says Santa Clara.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.520]   Oh.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:38.200]   I thought it was in Israel for some reason.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.560]   Google had offered them $4 billion earlier,
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.400]   according to Dubai.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.360]   I think that's correct.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.480]   WhatsApp has consistently said,
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.280]   "No, we're not gonna sell."
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.160]   If you're Sequoia, you say take that.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.200]   $8 million funding.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:01.200]   Now, the revenue model for WhatsApp is probably sufficient,
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.480]   but it's a buck a year.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.320]   It's not an expensive app, and the first year's free.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.800]   Do they have a cost structure of having to fit into SMS?
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:12.880]   No, they're not SMS.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:13.960]   It's all internet.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.800]   It's all bad.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.320]   Oh, so when I send to somebody,
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.680]   I'm not sending into their SMS.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.520]   No.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.520]   No, okay.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.640]   Although on Android, you can determine
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.320]   what your default SMS app is.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:28.280]   I've never tried using WhatsApp as my default SMS.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.920]   Here's my dumb question,
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.600]   because obviously I'm not a big user of it.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:36.320]   How do I get a tribe on WhatsApp
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.520]   as opposed to my tribes and in the other messaging app?
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.880]   I have to rebuild it from scratch.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.600]   You know, I logged into WhatsApp.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:44.800]   If I remember correctly,
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.920]   like I logged into WhatsApp and I had a message
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.760]   that was like 16 of your friends are all using WhatsApp.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.600]   It looked at your content first.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.440]   They were there.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.280]   Yeah, they were there already.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.560]   Yeah, it's very widely used.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:59.440]   Nobody wants to send me any messages.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.040]   I'm a ghost.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.320]   No, it's just that we know you're an old man,
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.960]   so you're not gonna use WhatsApp.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.360]   Actually, a lot of people use WhatsApp.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.320]   It's very, I took it off
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.960]   'cause nobody I really want a message with uses it.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.640]   So that's the issue I have.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.960]   Yeah, I mean, I believe it.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.440]   Here's my obnoxious moment.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.600]   Not that I have obnoxious moments every show.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.800]   Here's labeled.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.880]   Another one.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:27.880]   It was used as the party roundup for Davos.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.280]   What's app was?
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:30.960]   Well, there you go.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.480]   I got into the WhatsApp app,
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.840]   so I knew where the parties were.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.680]   That's all you needed to say.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.680]   I was too old to go, so.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.160]   Looks like they had a single round of venture funding
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.760]   at in 2011, April 2011 for $8 million.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.600]   $8 million.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.400]   They had for 16 billion.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:51.160]   Brian Acton, Jim Coom, and are the co-founders,
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.720]   and they had a big payday today.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:57.000]   Wow, shit, he is so awesome.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.840]   Let's see if the blog at WhatsApp is.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:03.680]   Yeah, here it is.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.000]   Facebook, almost five years ago,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.720]   we started WhatsApp with a simple mission.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.440]   Building a cool product used globally by everybody.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.680]   Nothing else mattered to us.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.840]   You see the platforms they're on, by the way.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:20.680]   iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Nokia, and Windows phones.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.320]   They're very universal.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.520]   Today we're announcing a partnership with Facebook
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.120]   that will allow us to continue on that simple mission.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.080]   Doing this will give WhatsApp the flexibility
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.720]   to grow and expand while giving me, Brian,
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.160]   and the rest of the team more time to focus
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.960]   on building a communication service
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.680]   that's as fast affordable and personal as possible.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:37.960]   It sounds like they're gonna maintain,
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.560]   see with Beluga, it went out of business.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.400]   They just incorporated the Beluga engineering team
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.560]   and presumably some of the code into Facebook Messenger,
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.560]   and that was it, it was gone.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.480]   We liked Beluga, it was great group messaging.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.000]   That's another thing people use this for is group messaging,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.080]   as at Davos.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.760]   - So is that Jan Komer, Jan Komer, however you say his name?
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.400]   - Yeah, who's writing this?
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.960]   - Yeah, he dropped out of San Jose State.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.760]   - Great. - Where he was studying.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.600]   - The gurus.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.080]   (laughs)
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.960]   - Another college dropout billionaire.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.120]   - It's, so, Neil just tweeted a link to a blog post
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.720]   that Jan or Jan posted in 2012.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.000]   Why we don't sell ads?
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.080]   - Yeah.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.800]   - They don't sell ads, in fact they didn't wanna sell the app.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.340]   They were very focused.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.800]   And I guess this paid off.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.000]   On a personal note, he writes, Brian and I couldn't be more
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.160]   proud to be part of a small team of people who,
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.280]   in just under five years, built a communication service
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:34.040]   that now supports over 450 million monthly active users
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:38.960]   worldwide, 320 million daily active users.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.880]   - Brian appears to be the grown up,
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.760]   he was VP engineering at Yahoo in '96.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.600]   - Wow. - Wow, he's an old guy.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.440]   - Yeah.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:51.200]   - He's looking pretty sprightly to me right now.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:58.800]   So he's got a stand for BS computer science in '94.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:04.160]   - They also support asynchronous messaging with voice,
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.360]   so you can leave a voice message for somebody.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.720]   It's a, you know what?
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.360]   - Well, it's nothing Facebook messenger couldn't do.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:13.200]   - Nothing.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.720]   - Skype does that video message thing.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.120]   - Yep.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.440]   - And Facebook has a relationship with--
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:21.560]   - All my Facebook users will now be visible to what's happened,
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.520]   now what's happened will be useful to me.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.920]   - That's part of it.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:30.360]   - So the question is, and I get the feeling from this blog post,
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.480]   I know the answer, the question is,
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.400]   does it get folded into Facebook messenger,
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.160]   or does it stand alone as a separate app?
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.320]   It sounds like they expect to stand alone as a separate app,
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:40.520]   which really then makes you wonder what is the gain
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.320]   on from Facebook that's worth $16 billion.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.280]   - Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.840]   Seems to be the refrain from acquired companies from Nest
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.440]   and Motorola, we heard this from, and now what's app,
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.440]   you know, the we're not changing, we're gonna operate.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.600]   This is kind of like, the way they worded it was,
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.400]   we're announcing a partnership with Facebook.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.560]   - Yeah, weird.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.840]   It's literally 10 times the purchase price
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.320]   if I remember correctly of YouTube.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.880]   - Yes, that's exactly right.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.640]   - I don't see it.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.680]   - Well, YouTube was a bargain.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.680]   - It was a bargain.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.440]   (laughing)
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.760]   - We didn't know it at the time, in fact, it's kind of amazing,
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.160]   but it really was a bargain.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.120]   - I can't think this is a bargain in any respect.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.160]   - No.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.800]   - It is definitely eliminating competition.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.000]   - Also, are you seeing it,
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.560]   like who could have gotten this in a way
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.720]   that would have hurt Facebook horribly?
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.400]   - Google, would Google have bought this?
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.680]   - They tried you for $4 billion.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.360]   - Yeah, conceivably, Apple.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.200]   - Yeah, LinkedIn.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.960]   - Microsoft?
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:48.400]   - Microsoft might be the most credible.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.480]   - Because of Skype.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.480]   - Yeah.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.000]   - But they already have two products
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.720]   that are very similar, Group Me and Yammer.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.640]   - So.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.080]   - Well, as you said, there's nothing here
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.560]   that Facebook Messenger couldn't do,
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.680]   so it's not the product.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.600]   - You know, Gina and I could write this app
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.600]   in about a week.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.760]   - Right?
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.120]   - Gina, why didn't you?
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.200]   - Geez.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.240]   - 'Cause you know what, it's not about the technology.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.000]   It's not about the code, right?
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   It's about users.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.040]   - It's about users, right.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.280]   And it's about being in the right place in the right time
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.000]   and having the right branding in the right copy
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.320]   and getting in the right hands
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.840]   and having that one lucky moment
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:21.800]   where somebody mentions it.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.400]   I mean, right, you know, this is something,
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.280]   this is really a humbling realization for me,
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:29.040]   different parts of my career, I have to keep rehabbing it.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.440]   The code does not matter as much as I,
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.520]   as a developer, would like to think.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.520]   - Is it design?
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:35.360]   Is it UI?
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.120]   Is it, what is it?
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.280]   - I mean, I think it's what I think it's on.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.400]   - It's whatever brought the people in.
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.760]   It's the people who matter.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.280]   That's why I keep on trying to say the media.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.160]   It's everybody, it's the people who matter.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.720]   - Yeah, it's acquisition.
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.920]   - Yeah, it's acquisition and it's, you know,
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:50.600]   it's good user experience that makes that flow.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.240]   It's compelling people.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.280]   You know, I started using that 'cause a good friend of mine
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.280]   was on what's happened.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.800]   I wanted to talk to her and I felt like that was the only way
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.840]   that I could, you know,
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:01.280]   every other chat server she was invisible on, right?
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.880]   So like, it's, yeah, and I think a lot of it
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:07.320]   is right place, right time, right branding, you know.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.360]   - It's virality.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.160]   - It's the same thing as a viral video
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.960]   and it's very hard to bottle.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:19.040]   - Yeah, to me it's like, it's like Mark Pickis's company, right?
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.600]   It seemed to own the world and then nothing like that.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.240]   - That's the problem with virality.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:25.080]   What goes up?
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.120]   Let's come down.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.600]   - Exactly. Well, let's go back to what's your call it?
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:32.960]   What was the original Israeli chat company bought by AOL?
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:33.800]   Thank you very much.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:34.880]   - Buh, buh, buh, buh.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.040]   - I see you. - You're too hard.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.120]   - I see Q.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:37.960]   - I see Q.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.600]   - So I see you. - So I see you
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:40.960]   with them. - I see you first do like this.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:44.880]   I, you, you got, you got, I see Q, it still exists.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:49.240]   Last time I looked, it still has that nice little pretty
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.080]   flower.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.160]   - In a case of something like what's up,
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.080]   it's the network effect.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.680]   It's what made Facebook a success.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:56.680]   It's that your friends start using it so you use it.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.000]   So it's a snowball that gets bigger and bigger.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.400]   - Yep. - And there's just,
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.000]   it's like lightning in a bottle.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.760]   I don't know if you can codify rules for virality.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.800]   - I see Q.com, just for the historical purposes.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:13.160]   I see Q folks was bought by AOL early on.
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.280]   It was kind of, in a way, it was the first big networky
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:17.840]   webby internet-y.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.680]   - It was a daisy icon, right?
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.520]   - It's a daisy icon. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.920]   - If you go to I see Q.com, it's still up, right?
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.120]   Free calls for everywhere.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:24.960]   I see Q for map.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.800]   It was a chat app, it's all it was.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:31.960]   - It's not, by the way, it's not AOL anymore.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:32.960]   - Well, it's right, they sold it, didn't they?
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.800]   - Yeah, it's a Russian company.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.640]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.640]   - It's one of the things that Armsline got rid of.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.480]   - Yeah.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.360]   - But, you know, I see Q was gonna take over the world,
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.880]   was the whole world, was everything, in its day.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:48.400]   - By the way, breaking news, just coming in
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.640]   from the New York Times, Nick Bilton writing about it,
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.720]   Facebook acquiring WhatsApp for 16 days.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.000]   - Is he saying he knew?
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.240]   - Wall Street Journal.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.400]   So this is interesting, 'cause you know,
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.640]   I have breaking news on my Android.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.520]   The journal got it at 212.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:05.160]   We got it about, at the same time, Bloomberg,
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:08.760]   or Business Week published it, which is about 215, 210,
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.640]   something like that.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.600]   Breaking news, no, it's the same.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.200]   223 for Nick Bilton.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.080]   I love that.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:22.240]   - Ben Evans tweeted that Facebook paid about $35 per active user
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.720]   for WhatsApp. - She is.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:29.720]   - And its own valuation is about $180 per monthly active user.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.640]   - Facebook. - So if you look at that book,
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.200]   right, Facebook, so if you look at it that way,
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.800]   they got a deal. - It's a deal.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.560]   - But there was, how was the-- - It's the only laptop.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.360]   - And then they're double paying for most of the,
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:39.360]   every one of those users.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:40.440]   - Yeah, how much overlap is there?
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:41.280]   - I don't know. - I don't know.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.120]   - I don't know.
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.920]   - Google WhatsApp is not on Facebook, I'm sorry.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:44.760]   They're all there.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.480]   - It's gotta be-- - Not in the US,
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.920]   but maybe in other nations.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.480]   - Yeah, I mean, as someone else was tweeted,
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.880]   Matthew Ingram retweeted, you know,
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.840]   WhatsApp is a de facto SMS in many countries, right?
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:59.160]   So, you know, this is about spreading beyond the US.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.400]   - I think that's a lot of it.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.880]   I think it has to be a lot of it.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.200]   - So what do you say to this if you're Verizon
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.680]   or a phone company?
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.120]   - Maybe that's who the threat was from.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:13.920]   Yeah, 'cause SMS is very profitable for them,
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.080]   but it's dying anyway, I think.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.480]   - But they have to cannibalize that.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.600]   - They know it's dying.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:23.200]   Hey, if you are in a market where you don't have gigabit
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:27.400]   internet access, good news, Google's,
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:31.400]   this is, to me, a huge surprise, going to add new cities,
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:35.960]   or at least investigate adding new cities to Google Fiber.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.280]   I had really thought that this was just a kind of--
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.040]   - It's like the Mason Dixon line.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:40.880]   - A demo.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.040]   Well, I thought they were just kind of saying,
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.560]   "Oh, let's show what's possible."
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:48.200]   They launched in Kansas City, then in Provo and Austin.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.920]   But now they're investigating Portland, San Jose,
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:53.600]   Salt Lake City, Phoenix, San Antonio,
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.600]   Nashville, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Raleigh Durham.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.760]   You're right. - Well, the around Atlanta there,
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.160]   there's lots of dots around Atlanta.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.200]   - Yeah, Atlanta, Metro, Raleigh, Durham,
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.440]   makes sense too for the same reason.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:05.440]   These are the actual areas of the web page.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.320]   - I would love to see, hey folks, chat room,
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:11.200]   look at those markets and tell me who the cable companies
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.400]   are who were major in those markets.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.920]   - Where they going after them?
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.520]   - Do you think-- - Huh, they come cast markets,
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.640]   are they secondary markets that Google can win in?
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.440]   - San Jose is a Comcast market.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.960]   That would include Santa Clara Mountain View, of course.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:28.520]   - Atlanta is probably-- - Sunnyvale and Charlotte.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.960]   - I'm sure it's better than it's Fox or not.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:32.520]   - I don't know. - Portland, weird.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.080]   - San Antonio's Time Warner Cable in AT&T,
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:38.760]   according to our chat room, Nashville is Comcast,
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.960]   Phoenix is Cox. - Cox.
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:43.320]   - Portland is Comcast and Charter.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.160]   - 'Cause what's always said,
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.240]   I used to work on the side of the cable business.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.800]   And what was always, all the deal making there
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.200]   is to get clusters that work together efficiently.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.320]   And so there's trading of systems that go on.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:56.800]   So the more you can cluster, the better off you are economically.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:01.440]   - So, yeah, that's exactly what they did in the Bay Area.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:05.680]   They have Comcast has a fiber loop around the Bay Area
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:08.040]   and they bought all of the regional cables
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.840]   that were there to make it 100%.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.440]   And that regionality is what makes it economical.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.280]   - Right. - So it would make sense.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.440]   I mean, if you look at Atlanta,
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:16.840]   there's a whole bunch of suburbs,
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:19.680]   Avondale, State's, - Google, so what Google's not doing that?
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.440]   Google's going scatter shot across the country.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.160]   - Are they trying to go into every cable company's backyard
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.520]   to say, "Nya, nya, nya."
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.960]   - No, I don't think so.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:30.800]   - I don't know.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.000]   - This seems like it's a business.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.600]   You're right, Mason-Dixon line heavy,
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.000]   south of the Mason-Dixon line heavy.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.920]   Although there's Portland Salt Lake City and San Jose,
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.760]   but the rest of it is in the south.
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:44.760]   And these are, by the way, not guaranteed.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.600]   These are potential.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.080]   So what they're doing, as they did with Kansas City,
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.520]   is they're asking these communities to step forward
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:56.440]   and, and, and, you know, ask, you know, get involved,
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.000]   be nice. - Be nice.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.840]   - Boy, I'd love to be on that list of cities.
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:05.520]   - Oh, so what I, well, then there's another story in there
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.920]   that even as they do, this is, this is Gigabyte, right?
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.240]   - Yeah, Gigabit, yeah.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:13.640]   - Gigabit, I mean, Google is developing and testing
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.360]   10 gigabit gigabytes. - Right.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:19.960]   - So does this mean that this is more than just a,
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.480]   here's what it should be cable companies shape up?
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.840]   - This sounds like they're going into this is a business now.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:29.200]   - A, it's a business B, it's a serious threat
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.160]   to an industry that needs a threat.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:33.440]   I only wish they would have to do the same thing
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.040]   with telephone carriers, but they're not gonna do that.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:39.280]   Why not?
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:42.160]   They had a chance and they didn't.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.320]   - Hey, and they just got out of the phone business.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.160]   - Yeah.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.840]   - But you could be a carrier without making phones.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:52.600]   - Yeah, but it's the other carriers they depend upon
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:53.680]   for sales and distribution.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.400]   - So what they say is we'll be working closely
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.840]   with the mayors and staff from each of these 34 cities.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.040]   We'll walk through details about the Google study
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.680]   and about the fiber ready checklist.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.280]   And we'll answer any questions they have after that.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.080]   We'll be working closely with the cities
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.920]   over in the next few months as we work on a study
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.680]   and they work on their checklist.
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.840]   Then the competed checklist items will be due to us May 1st.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:18.960]   It's not clear if they'll all be selected or not.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:22.120]   It's, Google does say the process will take some time,
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.120]   but we hope to know by the end of 2014
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:25.800]   which cities are going to get it.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:29.120]   These cities are led by people who have been working hard
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.480]   to bring faster internet speeds
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.280]   and the latest technologies to their residents.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:34.820]   I wonder if, remember when we were all campaigning
[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:36.720]   for Google fiber?
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.720]   If these are the next best cities, I don't know.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.320]   We believe these are communities
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:44.040]   who will do amazing things with a gig
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.920]   and they're diverse, not just geographically,
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.480]   but in the ways they'll give us opportunities
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.400]   to learn about the wide range of challenges
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.600]   and obstacles that communities might face
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:55.200]   in trying to build a new fiber network.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.320]   So how far would 16 billion dollars
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.720]   take you in building this fiber?
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.080]   Oh, I don't know, that's a good question.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:01.280]   That is a good question.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:06.480]   Google has more than 60 billion in cash.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.660]   What did Verizon invest in files?
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:14.120]   I was told 5,000 per subscriber.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:16.480]   So many hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:18.240]   Let me see if we can find a number.
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:20.800]   23 billion.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.720]   Oh, hello.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.200]   Well, so you're in the spittin' range.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:30.680]   Remember that Google makes money in a lot of ways from this.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:33.440]   And, you know, lately there's been a great push
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:37.320]   and I've been kind of run over the calls
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:40.840]   for defending Google, both on Twitch this week,
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.200]   on security now.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:45.040]   There is this growing anti-Google,
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.320]   Google is evil movement.
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:50.520]   And I think these people are gonna say,
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.600]   yeah, Google just wants to become your ISP
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.520]   so they can know more and more and more.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:56.640]   Mr. Laser.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.200]   Right, they get your end-to-end internet experience, right?
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.280]   Yes, New York Times story.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.960]   New York Times story about Google Plus, right?
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.960]   They're presuming venal motives.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:05.120]   Right.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:08.840]   I worry, I really fear that this is becoming a drumbeat
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:09.680]   that's going to be--
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.520]   I do too.
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:11.840]   Very strong.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.720]   Yeah, it feels like that's one of Google's biggest challenges
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.560]   going forward.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:16.880]   It's not the technology.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:17.960]   It's the people.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:18.800]   I think you're right, Gina,
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.240]   and I don't think they know it fully.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.680]   No, unfortunately they don't.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:24.680]   They're really good at a lot of things.
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:29.600]   But yeah, I mean, I don't know what they do
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.280]   to fix the problem, the creepy problem.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:36.880]   The feeling of being watched.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:41.040]   But every new product it feels like, that's the--
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.320]   In the book about Amazon,
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.200]   Brad Stone running about Jeff Bezos talks about,
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.720]   at the very end of the book he talks about a list,
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:51.720]   Jeff Bezos made, he sailed out a memo called Amazon.love.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:55.480]   And the list he made is of attributes of companies
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:57.680]   that are loved versus attributes of companies
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:59.040]   that are hated or feared.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.720]   He actually included Google at the time of the writing
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.120]   in these companies that are loved
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.280]   and Microsoft and the companies that are hated and feared.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:11.320]   I think that's generally still accurate for--
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.280]   But it's shifting.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.520]   But media has certainly shifted to hostility here
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.680]   and in Europe.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:20.880]   And he was really, it's really interesting to read this
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.080]   because here's a guy who's very analytical
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.360]   and very thoughtful about this stuff,
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.280]   trying to figure out, it's just like trying to figure out
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.560]   what makes something go viral,
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.560]   what makes a company loved
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.600]   versus a company that's not loved?
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.440]   Is it that--
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.280]   - I'm gonna tell you.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.720]   Yeah, no, go ahead, Leo, sorry.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.080]   - No, no, please.
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.080]   - I was gonna say, Microsoft,
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.640]   I don't think people care enough about Microsoft to fear them.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.240]   I mean, in order to fear anything,
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.560]   you have to not be indifferent.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.800]   I think there's an indifference.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.640]   - I don't know, amongst the particular--
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.360]   - Well, that's what, in the memo, Bezos said,
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:52.080]   he said, "Why don't Microsoft's hundreds of millions of users
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.480]   support Microsoft against attacks?
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.560]   They don't.
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.720]   They don't have any,
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.520]   there's a few, and I know this
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.120]   'cause we hear from the all-time Microsoft fanboys,
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.760]   but in general, Microsoft's user base
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.840]   is indifferent to Microsoft.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.560]   - And that hasn't always been the case.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.720]   I mean, people used to line up for the new version of Windows.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.200]   I mean, the Microsoft discussion was heated.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.680]   I mean, it was a much bigger thing.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:22.000]   And I think that Google is moving toward,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.960]   moving shifting from the company that you love
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.600]   toward a company, maybe you fear.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.560]   I mean, Amazon is a company you love
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.240]   because they bring you the things that you need to your door.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.320]   I mean, that's pretty straightforward.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.720]   And Google's products are amazing,
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.680]   and I'm to the point where I couldn't live without them,
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.440]   but there is a creeping, even for me,
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.680]   who is very informed,
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.200]   and talks about this every week,
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:46.040]   I think like, hmm, you know, could I imagine,
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.240]   you know, could I go Google free?
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:51.120]   I don't know that I could at this point.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.480]   - Well, and as I said recently,
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.560]   I am completely Apple-free except for Skyfue.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.600]   The only reason I'm still on a Microsoft product
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.560]   or an Apple product is you.
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.960]   - Don't look at me.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.800]   'Cause those products work.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.680]   If you're learning about Hangouts.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.760]   - Well, there's work.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:10.480]   - So here is from the book.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.920]   Here's what Bezos wrote.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.360]   "Rudeness," so he talked about cool and not cool.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.720]   That some things are cool,
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.760]   customers consider cool Apple, Whole Foods,
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.640]   Costco, Nike, and Google.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.640]   Others get piled on rather than defended
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:24.480]   if things go badly.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.400]   Think Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, ExxonMobil, and Walmart.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.560]   He says, "The things that are cool,
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:35.000]   young risk-taking, winning, polite,
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.680]   defeating bigger, unsympathetic guys,
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:39.320]   inventing, explorers,
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:42.280]   these things are all what Google is right now, right?
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:46.120]   Empowering others, leadership,
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:49.280]   conviction, straightforwardness.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.440]   That's something Google could do.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.560]   I think they do very well but continue to do.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.920]   He says, "Pandering to the crowd is not cool.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.560]   Hippocrates is not cool.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.440]   Authenticity is cool, thinking big is cool.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.440]   Unexpected is cool."
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.640]   - Trust is cool.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.360]   - Trust is really gonna be the big one for Google.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.960]   There is no trust on this list, which there ought to be.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.600]   - Yeah, there's, humanity is the word that comes to mind for me.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.120]   And I guess that does tell us authenticity.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.760]   There's some products in glass comes to mind particularly.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.400]   Like there's a little bit of a sense
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.240]   that Google's a cold bot who's very efficient
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.280]   and very good at what it does, right?
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:31.280]   But there's, I think, humanity is, I think, is the attitude.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:34.080]   - And if you break down humanity,
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:34.920]   I think you're right, Gina.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.400]   I think you break down humanity.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.040]   In a sense, the problem for Google
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.200]   is that they've given you all this great free stuff
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.160]   and then we say, "Okay, now what are you doing for us?"
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.000]   - Right.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.080]   And then they wanna drive your car for you.
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.480]   - Incredible, incredible, free services, maps and mail
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.840]   and all this stuff is unbelievable for free.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.160]   And it's, what have you done for me lately?
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:56.760]   And so you need some human connection there, I think.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.200]   - Yeah, why are you giving this for free?
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.000]   Yeah, I am from Brooklyn.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.080]   You want something for me.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.720]   I, you're giving me something.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.000]   I'm thinking that you need something for my turn.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:06.840]   - What's the catch?
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.680]   - Hey, what's the catch?
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.520]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.360]   - That's awesome.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.440]   - So you know, they wanna drive your cars
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.200]   and they wanna get everybody online.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.320]   They want everybody online.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.680]   They want to put, you know, a screen in front of your face.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.360]   You know, there's, and I think the perception
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.480]   about those things, even though they're highly efficient,
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.760]   I'm totally sold on the benefits of a self-driving car,
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:27.360]   but it feels, I think, to people like, you know,
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.720]   which taking away the, taking the humans out of life.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.960]   - That's what Google needs to do more than anything else,
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:37.320]   I think, is communicate why they want,
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.160]   you know, what's the deal?
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.840]   Why do you want this?
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.840]   What are you doing with it?
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:45.280]   Communicate, be honest, tell me what it is,
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.120]   so I can make it.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.240]   - But let's remember back to conversation
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.480]   as we had on the show about a year ago,
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.480]   where we all said, we trust Google,
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.440]   we kind of don't trust Facebook.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:55.880]   Now right now Facebook just spent $16 billion
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.720]   to buy users, and I haven't heard yet of,
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.480]   oh, oh, what's Facebook up to?
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.000]   Right, I'm not hearing that.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.840]   - No, I don't know, I think we've got that a lot.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.360]   - Right, I know, I do, but not right today
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.200]   with this announcement.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.360]   By the way, Zucks, I just put it up
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.760]   in the rundown, Zucks announcement is up.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.800]   - Okay. - All right, here's.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.480]   - Let me find that. - You can opt out
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.760]   of Facebook, and I know that's not true
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.600]   for everybody but for us.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.760]   - No, the argument on your ago, Gina, was you couldn't.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.320]   The argument a year ago, and Schmidt made,
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.440]   was that you could opt out of every single Google service
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.040]   you could use Bing, you could use Hotmail,
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.120]   you could use all these other services,
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.720]   but if your friends were on Facebook,
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.240]   you couldn't opt out of Facebook.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.280]   What's changed, I think, is that your friends
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.120]   are all on Facebook anymore.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.680]   They're everywhere. - Yeah, that's true.
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:42.440]   I guess for me, I can dip into Facebook once a week,
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.400]   once every couple of weeks, and catch up
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.960]   with who I want to, and then come out of it.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.760]   - You don't depend upon it, right?
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:51.120]   - Google is a part of the fabric of every single interaction
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.400]   I have on the web, on every webpage of Google Analytics,
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.640]   or every Google product, Gmail, I mean,
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:59.880]   what I've opted into, I realize that I can run my own
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.600]   iMac server, email server, sure.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:06.200]   But I went for the convenience over,
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.400]   you know, kind of rolling on my sleeves.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:12.040]   - What I hear you say is you depend upon Google.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.000]   - Yes, very much like a utility.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.200]   - So there's a vulnerability there
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.640]   that you need to understand and deal with.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:23.040]   They need to reassure you, they need to go over the top,
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.480]   reassuring you, because you are so dependent upon them.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.960]   As am I. - Yeah, yeah,
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:31.160]   'cause that whole thing, you could use Bing,
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:35.240]   you could just incognito window, you could, you know,
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:38.640]   I don't know, it kind of rings hollow for me at this point.
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.640]   I mean, I guess I could use Bing.
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.840]   I've been using DuckDuckGo for quite some time.
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:45.040]   I often switch over to Google.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.840]   - I couldn't use, I have to use Gmail.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.880]   I have to use Google Maps in ways.
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:54.320]   I couldn't use alternatives to those things.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.840]   - Right, yeah, no, a map--
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.240]   - I'm on Drive. - I'll sort of,
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.480]   yeah, Drive, I've become really--
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.800]   - I'm on Android, I'd rather be on Android than iOS.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.800]   I'm certainly gonna go to Blackberry.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:08.880]   - I could run pure Android AOSP, you know, right?
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.320]   Like I could run just Android without the Play Store
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.560]   and everything else, right?
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.720]   But it would be a completely different thing.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:15.560]   - Yeah.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:20.040]   - I, for one, welcome my new master.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.800]   (laughing)
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.960]   - I feel like in a way, I just wanna relax.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:24.800]   - You can bite me to IO.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.560]   - I just wanna relax and let it--
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.400]   - Let it--
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.920]   - Let go, let Google.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.160]   - Let it, let go, I'd like to Google.
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.960]   We got a show sign on right there.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.800]   (laughing)
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.000]   - I just take me, Google.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.800]   - Be me to your island.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:44.360]   - Because I just, you know, and I think a lot of people,
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:48.320]   probably rightly, especially in the last week,
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.400]   have accused me of not paying attention
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.120]   to the threat posed by Google.
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:57.360]   What Omalaq talked about on Sunday, on Twitch was,
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.520]   well, you know, maybe now they're harmless,
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.560]   but at what point does this switch where they just,
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.720]   and then there's nothing you can do?
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.040]   - Well, but you could say that about,
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.440]   he says they're too big.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.520]   No company should be allowed to be this big.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.520]   - I hate that argument.
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.240]   I just despise that argument.
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:17.000]   Then fine, show me the statute that says big enough, too big.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.520]   - No, no, it's, it maybe is not statutory,
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:23.280]   but I think that his, he says with power,
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.880]   you know, absolute power corrupts,
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.920]   power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.000]   The bigger a company gets, the more powerful it gets.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.400]   Inevitably, it will get corrupted.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.600]   And there just is a natural size
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.880]   that companies should not go beyond.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.280]   There's no statutory.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:38.080]   - There's not a law. - There's not a law.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.920]   - There might be a law of nature.
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:43.000]   - It has to do with other factors, but not size alone.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.840]   - Can a company not be too big?
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.280]   - What are we going to tell Google not to do?
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.320]   I'm sorry, you can't do maps anymore.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.920]   Well, if it can't do maps, then it can't do,
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.880]   that's, that's-- - No, no, no, no.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.280]   You can't, I'm not saying the government now has to come in
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.600]   and say Google's too big,
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.600]   but users could very reasonably say,
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.160]   I am not sure I want to really continue to support
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:03.440]   this company because they have gotten to be a behemoth
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.040]   and they have too much of my information.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.080]   - The answer to it, even for users sake,
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.720]   I don't think is, is size.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.960]   So they stop doing some functions?
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.040]   That means it doesn't work as well.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.960]   I mean, I want maps to tie to my nest,
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.680]   to tie to my mail, to tie to my Google announcements.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.840]   - The nest is the one that really,
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.720]   I think the nest is the one that actually put people
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.880]   over the top oddly enough.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.400]   - Maybe, but I think it goes--
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.080]   - People say, "Then now Google knows when I'm home."
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.480]   Like, yes, so?
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:24.680]   Yeah, I want that.
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.680]   But I think it goes what you--
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.360]   - Well, they know anyways, because if your Android phone
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.880]   has your location anyway.
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.200]   - Anyway.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.080]   I think that Google's, you know,
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.280]   and I was there on Friday and every time I'm there,
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.520]   I come away only more enthusiastic about the company
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.800]   because they're so frickin' smart.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.760]   And someone say, "Ah, it's the problem, they're too smart."
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.800]   They're too big, they're too smart.
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.520]   - Yeah, too big, too smart.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:47.080]   - No, it's, but what, the company's--
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.640]   - You're starting to sound like a, in Rand.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.960]   And this is objectivism, you know?
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.480]   Hey, they're successful, they're big.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:58.520]   Let 'em run the world because they are good at it.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.840]   - Well, the same thing would be said about Americans.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.360]   - That's true.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.760]   You'd be blown that, have a way.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:04.600]   - That's true.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.080]   (laughing)
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.600]   All right, let me read Mark Zuckerberg's statement.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:09.440]   We're gonna take a break.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.120]   We've got a lot more, including the Google change log
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:12.120]   coming up.
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.840]   But boy, as always on this show,
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.360]   we just gettin' these great conversations.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.520]   This has become the philosophic heart of the Twitnet.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.360]   (laughing)
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.840]   And I like it. - Oh, wow.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:21.880]   - Oh, it really is.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.200]   - The Thumbsucker, what's, what, this week in Thumbs.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.880]   - No, I think we talk about big stories here.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.960]   Mark Zuckerberg, by the way, I would love
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.240]   to be able to write a post on Facebook
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.720]   and 30 minutes later have 98,000 likes.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.800]   (laughing)
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.440]   No, I'm sorry, 95.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.680]   Well, maybe not. - I don't know.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.520]   - He does have 20-- - Every single one
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:47.480]   of his words is a parsed and analyzed.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.040]   - He does have 25 million followers.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.840]   I'm excited to announce we've agreed to acquire
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.480]   WhatsApp and their entire team will be joining us at Facebook.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.720]   He says they will stay the team.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.640]   Product roadmap will remain unchanged.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.080]   This team will stay in Mountain View.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.760]   WhatsApp will continue to operate independently
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.800]   within Facebook.
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:10.440]   Facebook Messenger will continue.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.640]   Facebook Messenger, he says, is widely used for chatting
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.280]   with your Facebook friends.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.600]   WhatsApp, for communicating with all your contacts
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.040]   and small groups of people.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.280]   Since WhatsApp and Messenger serve such different
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.080]   and important uses, we will continue investing in both
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:26.500]   and making them each great products for everyone.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:30.080]   Incredible?
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:34.120]   That makes less sense to me then.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.200]   If you're not gonna integrate the two, what do you get?
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.280]   You just spent-- - They did that
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:39.840]   with Instagram. - It's been that much money
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.400]   you can do with it whatever you want.
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.960]   It's your-- - Yeah.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.440]   - They did that with Instagram.
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:45.920]   But what you're saying is we're not gonna,
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.000]   we're not gonna play on the synergy.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.240]   We're just gonna run it.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.360]   - Eventually, they're gonna integrate it.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.760]   - Eventually. - Eventually.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.560]   - Eventually when everyone's memory
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.080]   and everyone's memory is short,
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.200]   and a few years down the road, it's hard to integrate it.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.760]   - He says more than one million people currently sign up
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:02.760]   for WhatsApp every day.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.320]   I bet today two million might sign up.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.640]   I just downloaded it again.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.040]   I had removed it.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.960]   Unfortunately, there's no Davos party,
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.160]   so I'm not getting any new on it.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.000]   (laughing)
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.440]   The process, by the way, is signing out.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.440]   Let's run through it real quickly.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.240]   Signing up for WhatsApp is actually very simple.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.760]   You download it.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.400]   You'll give it your phone number,
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:24.000]   which I will do off the air.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.320]   Not that it really matters.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:30.200]   All the people who hate me already have my phone number.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.520]   And then, I don't even remember my phone number,
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.800]   so I think that's right.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.880]   And then it will send you a text message
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.040]   to verify.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:44.520]   Apparently, WhatsApp gets permission to read your text messages,
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.160]   much like Facebook does,
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.920]   and will automatically detect the SMS coming in,
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.320]   read it and say, "Okay, got it."
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.880]   - I had not approved that update, by the way, Leo.
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:54.880]   - Did you, really?
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.720]   - I had not. - Did you not?
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:56.560]   - Yeah, I had not.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.720]   After the show, I went and saw that it was one of the ones
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:12:59.680]   that needed permission.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.520]   Anyway, carry on.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.960]   - Carry on.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:09.920]   - By the way, Mike mentioned that this is poor timing.
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:13.360]   There are four, according to Panda Labs,
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:16.720]   four Android apps that are malware.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:21.720]   And what they do is they sign you up for paid SMS services.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:25.240]   One of them, for instance, is how to lose weight
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.680]   on your belly or something.
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.680]   It's in Spanish, so I couldn't read it exactly.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.760]   And then it signs you up for an SMS service,
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.360]   gives you a quick, "Okay," and you say, "Okay."
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:37.200]   These are very expensive paid SMS services.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.600]   And the reason it can instantly validate you
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.200]   is it goes and it looks in the WhatsApp listing.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.480]   The public WhatsApp listing,
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.400]   which has your phone number in there,
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.200]   and it can do that apparently by looking
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:53.000]   at your WhatsApp information.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.480]   So WhatsApp is actually a security hole.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.640]   - I don't find Leo Laport on my WhatsApp
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.160]   being abused. - Oh, I'm signing up right now.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.240]   - Oh, is that it?
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.560]   I don't find you're Japan-y on here either.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.600]   - I've been there.
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:04.760]   - You don't? - I've been there.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.000]   - Oh, you know, it depends what phone number of mine you have.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.040]   That's probably-- - Oh, right.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.680]   I just phone, that's why I always several phones ago.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.120]   - Oh, why do I never call you?
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:13.800]   - Let me do a different phone number.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:14.960]   I wanna, can I use-- - I don't find the match.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.800]   - Now here's a question, can I-- - I'm not using
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.800]   the match, can I use my Google Voice number,
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.120]   which would be the best number to use.
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:20.960]   - All right, so if I wanna talk to Gina--
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.840]   - Why don't you think it has to be your native number?
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.000]   - I think so.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.360]   So, Gina, if I wanna talk to you,
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.760]   I just search for you and I don't find you my name.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.800]   I have to know your phone number?
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.440]   - Here's Chad, he's a young person.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.680]   - Right, let's find out what he does.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.520]   - Thanks.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.920]   - So you can use your Google Voice number.
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:37.760]   - Okay.
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.680]   - Oh, it did it, it worked.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:39.760]   - Yeah, it'll send you a text,
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.120]   but sometimes it does not automatically notice the text.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.240]   If that happens, it'll give you a call
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.520]   and you'll write down six characters.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.200]   - So that worked, so I gave it my Google Voice
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.000]   and it now says, "Please provide your name
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:49.960]   "in an optional photo."
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.320]   It knows my name, of course.
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.640]   - No, you're already on here, Leo,
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:54.920]   under some other number.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:57.400]   It says that at the moment, you're sleeping.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.280]   - I know, 'cause you can also do a status update,
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.700]   so let me just do a quick WhatsApp picture.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:06.840]   There we go, there's, oops, oh, I went the wrong way.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.760]   - Can you hit home?
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.560]   - I'm a moron.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.240]   - A moron and a half.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.340]   Let's do that again.
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:15.240]   How do I take a picture?
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.080]   Oh yeah.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.320]   All right, there's my WhatsApp.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.720]   You always want it to be clever and creative.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.560]   And...
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.720]   - Really show off your best app.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.160]   - Really show off your best side.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.280]   There you go.
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:29.640]   And that's it next and now it's gonna go,
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:30.960]   you get a free year of service
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.360]   and after that it's 99 cents a year.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.040]   And you know what, it doesn't really ask you for anything.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.320]   It just kinda goes out there
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.680]   and gets everything out of your phone book and fires away.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.280]   So, it's very easy.
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.240]   I think that's one of the reasons
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.520]   a million people you're signing up for this thing.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.840]   Hey, let's take a break and we come back
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.440]   the Google Change Logger show today
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.720]   brought to you by Shutterstock Images.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.160]   Lisa just started a new blog
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.600]   and she was saying it the other night.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.640]   She said, I love Shutterstock.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.840]   Whenever we wanna do a blog post,
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:05.000]   we like to have images as part of our blog post.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   Shutterstock is a source of great royalty free images,
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.160]   illustrations, vectors, video clips.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:18.160]   Over 30 million of them right now, very affordable.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.240]   You can try it for free by the way.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:24.240]   And they have a great app, Android and iPad app,
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.080]   which is just almost like one of those
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:28.200]   just great gorgeous photo apps,
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.760]   but they have the fantastic search engine,
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.240]   which lets you search not only for nouns,
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.840]   but for adjectives and nouns.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:39.440]   So you can search for happy hippos, cranky hippos,
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.440]   blue hippos.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:44.120]   It is just a fantastic system.
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:45.480]   You can sign up for free.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.640]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.400]   And that means you'll be able to search for images
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:51.560]   and save images into a light box
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:52.720]   so you can share them with others.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:55.280]   But you can also buy packages of images or do what we do.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:58.720]   We have the subscription 25 images a day,
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.320]   which is great for a company.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.200]   They add 20,000 images every day.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.680]   So there's always something new.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.920]   Each reviewed individually for content and quality.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:09.480]   I just love Shutter stock.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.360]   And multilingual is truly international
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.840]   with service and support in more than a dozen countries
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.240]   full-time throughout the week.
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:19.120]   Don't forget to click the footage tab.
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.520]   We also have a footage subscription,
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.720]   'cause we use it, in fact, this is fun.
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.160]   We use it a lot during our shows
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:28.560]   to do kind of matte images and so forth.
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.720]   There's always a free-featured clip.
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.720]   I am a big fan.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:32.800]   I want you to try Shutter stock.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:35.000]   We actually have a good deal for you.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:35.840]   Start the account.
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:36.920]   You don't need a credit card to do that,
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.480]   but if you decide to purchase images,
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.320]   use the offer code TWIG 214.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.120]   That's for February 2014, obviously.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:46.680]   TWIG 214, and you'll get 25% off any package,
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:47.960]   including the subscription package,
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.560]   which makes it a very good deal.
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:54.400]   TWIG 214 at Shutter stock.com.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.240]   And now, break out the drums.
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:00.120]   It's time for the Google Change Log.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.000]   The Google Change Log of the Trumpets-thened drums.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.600]   Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.600]   (groans)
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.480]   Here's Gina Trapani.
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.600]   - You're a big Google Sheets user,
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.800]   not as in like bedsheets, but spreadsheets.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:15.800]   (laughs)
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.880]   - Those are 600 thread count sheets.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.480]   - They know how you're sleeping.
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:21.120]   - Egyptian cotton sheets.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.600]   - They know how you're sleeping.
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.240]   - They know when you're awake.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.600]   - You'll notice a link on the bottom right
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.280]   of your current spreadsheets,
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.920]   Google spreadsheets and Google Drive.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:32.200]   That says try the new Google Sheets.
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.440]   An update to the app,
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.880]   which you have to opt into in your settings,
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.840]   lets you edit spreadsheets while offline,
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.880]   which is very nice,
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.400]   scrolls and loads faster
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:42.200]   and has other new features for spreadsheet users,
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.680]   like new filter views,
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.000]   easier to use formulas,
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.920]   advanced conditional formatting.
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:49.760]   You can't convert existing spreadsheets to the new version,
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:50.600]   which by the way,
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.440]   I tried to do to TWIGs run down today, but failed.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.800]   But you can opt into the new sheets
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:58.320]   for any new spreadsheets that you make going forward.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.320]   Doesn't look very different.
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.160]   Just acts different and just scrolls better
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.680]   as faster and works offline.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.600]   Just kind of nice.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.240]   The new Google Maps,
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.360]   which I'd forgotten was new
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:12.360]   because I've been trying it for a long time now.
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.680]   This is the new Google Maps
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:14.520]   that Google announced
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:16.800]   at the I/O developer conference.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.880]   That has been in preview mode this whole time.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.240]   Well, it's coming out of preview.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.640]   You know, you used to be able to switch back
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.840]   and forth from classic to the new mode.
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.560]   The new mode is now becoming the default.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:31.560]   It'll be the default PC Google Maps experience going forward.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.240]   And finally,
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:35.680]   and I haven't actually gotten this on my phone yet,
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.000]   but Google's added detailed transit schedules
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.480]   to the Google Search app on Android.
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:42.480]   So if you have the update
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.720]   and you tap the microphone on your Google Search app
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.080]   and you say from New York City to Boston by train,
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:50.760]   for example, Google will display detailed information
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:53.320]   for schedules and fares, the requested destination,
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.720]   and a countdown timer
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:57.280]   that I'll show you how long until the next train or bus.
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.120]   That's awesome.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.040]   It's kind of nice.
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.680]   And if the train gets delayed,
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:02.640]   there's a maintenance issue or an accident.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:05.960]   You'll see a status alert in the results,
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:08.040]   much like Google Maps now alerts you
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:12.280]   if there's a faster route while you're on route.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.360]   This feature I think is limited to users in the US.
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.720]   And like I said, I tried it on my phone.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:17.880]   I haven't gotten the update yet.
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:20.000]   I tried from New York City to Boston by train
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.280]   and didn't get it, but just seeing Google Search
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.280]   getting a little smarter,
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.120]   it must be rolling out little by little.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:28.000]   That's all I got. Pretty short change dog today.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.240]   - Now the drums.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.560]   That's it.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.400]   - It's Rachel.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.440]   - Hi Leo, my friend Josh Benton on Twitter.
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:36.360]   I saw there's already a WhatsApp commercial.
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.840]   It's in the rundown.
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.760]   I put it in the chat.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.520]   - Is this real or?
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.240]   - Just don't just, just, just, just, just.
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.120]   - All right, all right.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:44.960]   - Thank you.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.800]   - Uh oh.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.200]   - Hola.
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:49.040]   - Hola.
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:49.880]   - Hola.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:50.720]   - Was that.
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.560]   - Was that.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.400]   - Was that.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.240]   - That was deep.
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.080]   - True.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.000]   - Hello.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:57.840]   - Hola.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.680]   - Hola.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:20:59.520]   - Hola.
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.360]   - Hola.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.680]   - Hola.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.960]   - Yo, it's deep.
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.160]   - It still makes me laugh.
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.480]   - It's still a great commercial.
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:06.800]   - It is.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.640]   - Hola.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.640]   - Hola.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.640]   (buzzer)
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:12.640]   (buzzer)
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.560]   - That's not the original one, but that's,
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:15.560]   I hadn't seen that one.
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:16.400]   That's good.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.240]   - It's like a look.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.400]   - There's also not that we want to keep on going,
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:19.240]   but right above that,
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.880]   and that chat is,
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:25.680]   gets is description of why it's worth as much money.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:28.080]   It's very good post from, from.
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:31.680]   - Bernard gets the Subway Gym Gets from Sequoia.
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:32.520]   - Okay.
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:35.720]   - This company has only 32 engineers.
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.480]   - Yikes.
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:39.040]   - That's 'cause it's really,
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:40.000]   I mean, Gina, am I wrong?
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   This is a trivial application.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.040]   - This is not about, yeah,
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.040]   it's not about the technology.
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:45.880]   - No, it's technology.
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:47.920]   - It is not, yeah, this is not a difficult.
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:50.120]   I mean, look, this application certainly has
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.040]   some serious scaling issues,
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.440]   but it's not not. - That's non-trivial.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:54.280]   You're right.
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:55.120]   - Yes, but nine months ago,
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.560]   it had 200 million active users.
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:57.400]   Now it has,
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.240]   - Yeah, it's double. - My nine months
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.960]   out of 250 million. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.520]   72%.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.280]   - The network engineers are good.
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.000]   I wonder, though, what does it run on?
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.440]   Does it run, maybe it runs on Amazon services?
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.000]   Maybe it's not,
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.360]   maybe they're not. - Oh, it's interesting.
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.600]   - It's Erlang.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.960]   It's built in Erlang.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.840]   - Erlang.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:18.840]   (laughing)
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.200]   - Yes.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.360]   - That's why only 32 engineers,
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.400]   no one understands Erlang.
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.240]   (laughing)
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.560]   - They're all from Erlang. - They're all from Erlang.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.320]   - Everybody that knows Erlang.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.920]   - That is Erlang.
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.640]   Tell us about Erlang.
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.240]   Do you know anything about Erlang?
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.400]   - I know. - It's a functional,
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.760]   I think it's a functional language.
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:40.640]   It's very popular among a certain group of nerds.
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:42.520]   - Yes, yeah, it's got a kind of a cult.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.360]   - Yeah.
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.880]   It's a general purpose concurrent garbage collected
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.760]   programming language and runtime system.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:50.480]   According to Wikipedia.
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:53.320]   Designed originally, I did not know this by Ericsson.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:56.040]   This is one of the reasons it scales
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:00.520]   because it's distributed and supports hot swapping.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:03.920]   So you can, this is actually a probably a perfect language
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.560]   for this particular application.
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:11.480]   Erlang is a reference to a Danish mathematician
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:14.920]   and engineer that no one's ever heard of.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.440]   So there you go.
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:22.440]   - It's, the language doesn't matter either.
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:24.720]   - No, but it helps with scaling.
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.920]   - It helps with scaling. - Sure, sure.
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.000]   - Sure.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.880]   - They have 99.9% uptime.
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:32.520]   And that's another reason users love them.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:33.800]   They just don't go down.
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:39.760]   50 billion with a B messages a day across seven platforms.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.760]   I'm not sure what that means.
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:43.280]   That sounds like they're aggregating perhaps
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:47.640]   rack space and Amazon and Azure and...
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:49.120]   - And it's all seven platforms.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:49.960]   That means that--
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:52.360]   - Oh, seven host platforms, okay.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.840]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.600]   - Like Android. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.160]   - Window, yeah. - Yeah.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.000]   - Android iOS.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.640]   - WhatsApp does not collect personal information.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.520]   That may change. (laughs)
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.400]   Registration is authenticated with a phone number.
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.600]   Once delivered messages are deleted
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.520]   from WhatsApp's servers.
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.240]   Wow.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:17.000]   They had grown to dislike their time at Yahoo.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.520]   So that's why they hate ads so much.
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.160]   They didn't like targeted ads, so they charged a buck.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:26.880]   - It costs more than a buck to run
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.360]   that per user to run that server.
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.200]   Well, not a bad sound. - A year?
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.480]   - A year?
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.840]   - But initially-- - It's like YouTube again.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:33.680]   Do they have a business model?
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.480]   They had to have a business model.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:39.520]   - So Jan grew up in Russia
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:42.480]   under the Soviets.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:45.280]   He arrived in the US as a 16 year old immigrant
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.360]   living on food stamps with the extra instead
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.800]   of wanting to stay in touch with his family
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.520]   in Russia and the Ukraine.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.640]   His mentor was Brian at Yahoo,
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.960]   and that's when he began to build WhatsApp.
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.320]   - Well, that's a good story.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:00.160]   - Yeah.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.240]   I'm really curious what the network platform is.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:07.240]   God, Sequoia's gotta be happy.
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.560]   - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Oh, whoa.
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.600]   - An $8 million investment.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:13.040]   - You guys work for Sequoia?
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.640]   They're nodding.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.480]   - Yeah.
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:19.200]   - Party is Sequoia tonight, baby.
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:22.440]   - One WhatsApp dev supports 14 million active users.
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:26.680]   A ratio unheard of in the industry says Sequoia's tweet.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:27.680]   - Now that's incredible.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:30.680]   - They were so anxious to show in the spotlight
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:32.600]   there isn't even a WhatsApp sign
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.920]   outside their offices in Mountain View.
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.720]   - Like the secret Japanese restaurant that's there.
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:38.560]   - Yeah.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:40.480]   - Wow.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:44.080]   You know, having used WhatsApp for a long time,
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.800]   and I don't really have a compelling use case,
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.040]   that's probably why I don't use it,
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.360]   it is easy, straightforward.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.680]   It just works.
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:51.520]   It's reliable.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.440]   Do you use a chat on a regular basis?
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.040]   - No, not on a regular basis,
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:58.640]   but it's one of those products that every once in a while
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:00.720]   you find that niche for a weekend
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.640]   or a convention or something like that.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:04.240]   - Yeah, like Davos.
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.600]   Every time I'm at Davos, I use WhatsApp.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:07.440]   - Right.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.720]   - I'm gonna quote my, I just emailed my son Jake,
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:11.760]   and I said, do you use it much?
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.320]   I didn't email him.
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.600]   I WhatsApped him.
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.720]   - Ah.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:16.880]   - And I said, do you use it much?
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.480]   He said, not much, just for group messages,
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:20.520]   definitely not worth 16 Instagrams.
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.960]   - Now here's, you'll like this, Gina, on their,
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.720]   WhatsApp.com/opensource page.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:29.400]   They contribute back into the Erlang project,
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.640]   which is open source, free BSD, JQ grid,
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:37.400]   which is an Ajax enabled JavaScript control,
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:40.720]   lib phone number, that's Google's common Java C++
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:44.040]   and JavaScript library for phone numbers.
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.760]   - Yeah, they probably got the most phone numbers.
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:46.600]   - Yeah.
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:47.440]   - Does anybody?
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:49.160]   - Light Open ID, a PHP 5 library
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.760]   for Open ID authentication.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:54.920]   Oh, they use light, I don't know how you would say this,
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:59.520]   light TTPD, that's the web server they use.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:03.040]   That's a very popular lightweight web server.
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.240]   PHP.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.520]   How much cash does Twitter have?
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:07.960]   Could Twitter buzz?
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.240]   - Oh no.
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.080]   - No.
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:10.920]   - No, I doubt it.
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:14.040]   Even with their very successful IPO,
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.400]   I doubt they'd have 16 billion to throw around.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.560]   - It doesn't seem like it would be the right fit for Twitter.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.360]   - No, by the way, if he reads us post,
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.480]   the implication was a lot of people were recording,
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:23.320]   what's that?
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:26.520]   He's, you know, he says, I can't remember the exact words,
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.360]   but they had a lot of choices.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.320]   - WhatsApp had every option in the world
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:32.360]   so I'm thrilled that they chose to work with us.
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:35.200]   - Yeah, he did know, he says, we were friends,
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.520]   John and I were friends.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:37.440]   - Yeah.
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.280]   - Certainly doesn't.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.120]   - Maybe they walked up the mountain.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.720]   - Isn't that famous old story?
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:42.720]   - All this someday will be yours,
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.600]   except for that part there, that's Steve Jobs,
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.800]   and that part over there, that's Eric's.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:51.280]   But everything else is yours, my son.
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.760]   Google Tracker, this was put together by Ron Amadeo
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:54.760]   at ours Technica.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.000]   This is a useful thing.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.920]   All the projects we know Google is working on this year.
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:03.720]   Yeah, a lot of pages, a lot of pages.
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:05.720]   I love Ron and I love ours.
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.120]   I don't love that there's like this article of six pages.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:10.560]   - It could just be a list.
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.440]   - It could just be a list.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.840]   - Well, okay, I'm just gonna tell you,
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:17.040]   if you really love ours, you could subscribe, which I am.
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:17.880]   - Yeah.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.480]   - And then unfortunately it uses Flash
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:20.840]   to show the subscribers link,
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:23.120]   and I don't have flashes out of date on this machine.
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.800]   But then you can get it all in one page,
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.960]   or as a PDF, which I will do.
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:27.800]   - Yeah.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.920]   - Yeah, that's worth, you know, I couldn't figure out
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.560]   why should they give Connie an ask 60 bucks a year,
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.480]   but ours is so good.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.320]   - Yeah, ours is great.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.680]   - It's worth supporting.
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:40.320]   The queue is still in this list, by the way,
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.800]   but that's because the queue might have given way
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:45.040]   to a console set top box.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:48.120]   We've been hearing rumors about that.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.640]   This would be the crib sheet for going to Google I/O.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.840]   Why don't I make a bingo sheet of all of this?
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.240]   And when we go to Google I/O, we can--
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.280]   - Like how we can--
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.120]   - Yeah.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.120]   - Get those stampers with the--
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.680]   - Yeah, all the pixels are, oh no,
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.720]   just all the possible categories that they can hit on.
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:02.800]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:06.120]   God, there's so much stuff.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.800]   Google says how not to be a glass hole.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.360]   Have you read this, Jeff?
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.280]   - Yeah, what, yes, in the night when I was with a--
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:14.240]   it was wonderful woman, honor Richardson,
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.680]   who really charming woman who's, those comms for them,
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:18.480]   who sat at the lunch to make sure
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:21.400]   that we didn't punch each other last week,
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:23.880]   told me about this was coming out,
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:27.640]   and they went to the,
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:30.760]   they went to people, they went to the explorers
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:32.920]   and discussed this, very smart use.
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:34.480]   In fact, I argued to them that they should have done
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.200]   the same thing about the frames,
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:38.960]   but they should be used Google+,
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.080]   as an example of how companies should reach out
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:43.520]   and interact, so they went to Google+,
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:45.160]   they went to the explorers groups there,
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:47.120]   and they discussed, let's start talking
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:48.840]   about the norms here, and this does go
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:50.520]   to this trust question in a way.
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:54.400]   Google should take a lead role in these kinds of trust issues
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:56.000]   and say, hello folks, don't be an idiot,
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.280]   even though I think it's very close to insulting us to say,
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.520]   I know I don't take it into the bathroom,
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:03.680]   and then take a picture of your junk.
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:07.280]   - You might wear it though, a lot of people do,
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.480]   I would say put it up on your head.
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:11.240]   - Well then they're not gonna miss the urinal,
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.800]   'cause I got bad sight, Leo.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.880]   - Oh, it's your glasses, see, we can't do that now.
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:17.240]   - Yeah, that's the point, yes, yes.
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:18.560]   - Oh dear.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.840]   - I'm gonna cross streams, that'd be very bad.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:21.600]   (laughing)
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.600]   - No.
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:24.600]   - No, that's not bad, that's kind of fun.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:26.480]   It's called sword fighting, and--
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:27.480]   - Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.920]   - You know, this unit does not wanna know anything more.
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:34.840]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:37.200]   - You, you, you, you, I'm not pressing the end button,
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:38.040]   but this is not--
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.360]   - Stop, stop, you're just jealous.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:42.040]   (laughing)
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:44.880]   - You have envy, Judah, and did it.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:48.840]   - It's, I have envy of hired salaries, and--
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:51.480]   - Yeah, that's reasonable, you should have--
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:53.840]   - And testosterone, if you would strength, yes,
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.680]   there are somebody else-- - Sorry, sorry.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.280]   - I have polished. - I have polished.
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.360]   - What is the good thing?
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.880]   I apologize, I'm not gonna do it.
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:00.960]   - No, it's fine.
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:01.920]   (laughing)
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:03.000]   - What were we talking about?
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:03.840]   I'm completely--
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:04.680]   - We were talking about--
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:05.760]   - Oh, glass holes. - Oh, glass holes.
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:08.080]   Let's show, there's a video, is this?
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.560]   - There's a glass to be, uh, holes.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:10.960]   - Yeah.
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:11.800]   - So anyway.
[01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:15.280]   - I never thought that I said this on all my Android last night.
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.360]   I never thought I'd see the word glass hole
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.120]   on an official glass.
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:21.920]   - I didn't think they acknowledged the existence of the word.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:24.720]   - Yeah, no, I saw kudos to them for claiming a word.
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:27.240]   - They're saying, don't use this word.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:28.440]   I mean, don't be a glass hole.
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:29.600]   - They're saying you can use the word,
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:31.440]   but then you deserve to be called a glass hole
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:33.080]   if you do these things.
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:35.200]   - Although they did use the word creepy, Jeff.
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.920]   Don't be creepy. - Oh, wow, that's me.
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:38.560]   Well, I think they're trying to say don't be creepy,
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:39.400]   but that's fine.
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:40.240]   - Yeah, they are saying don't be creepy.
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.160]   - You know what, it's okay because they defined creepy.
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.560]   They said this is creepy and don't be it.
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:45.760]   That's an okay use of creepy.
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.600]   - Do you not like the word creepy?
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.600]   - I hate it when it's just used as a generic,
[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:52.680]   oh, that's creepy and people aren't defining what it is.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:53.520]   - Right. - Right.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:57.080]   - It's, oh, Google knows where you go to work every day.
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:57.920]   That's creepy.
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.280]   No, it's not, you told them
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.640]   and you get directions from them.
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.560]   - I can't define creepy, but I know when I see it.
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.240]   - No, I said no, not good enough, but--
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:06.080]   - No?
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:06.920]   - Not letting you get away with that.
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:07.760]   Nope.
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.280]   Because people are starting to try to regulate
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:12.920]   and legislate to this amorphous notion of creepy.
[01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:14.400]   - Right. - It's taking Europe
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.240]   where Google's creepy.
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:17.280]   What the hell does that mean?
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.120]   - Right.
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:22.360]   - Now, speaking of not so, well, maybe you'll find this creepy.
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:26.160]   Also on the list right there is Anna Anna from Glass,
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:30.240]   sent this to me, the marriage proposals via Google Glass.
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:32.640]   - That's not creepy, that's sweet.
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:33.840]   - Well, take a look at it, you might,
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.680]   'cause some people will find it creepy.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:36.680]   - All right, let me-- - I think it's sweet.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:37.520]   It's very sweet.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:38.840]   - Let me pull up the link, here we go.
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.960]   This is on YouTube.
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.640]   And so Glass lets you record video.
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:45.720]   You'd have to say it ahead of time.
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:49.680]   And presumably people would know that you were,
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.000]   well, let's see, let's watch.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.640]   Let's see.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:54.160]   Is there audio?
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:55.400]   - Yes, there should be. - Oh, you know what?
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:59.680]   You're gonna have to do it, Chad, 'cause I have issues.
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:01.240]   Wait a minute, let me see if I can fix that.
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.880]   Here, I think I can, let's try it.
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:04.240]   Let me try it, we'll do it again.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:05.600]   Yeah, you're getting it now, okay.
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.440]   Let me rewind so we see all the--
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:09.280]   ♪ Please don't, please don't ♪
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:10.480]   ♪ All these years ♪
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.320]   - They're both glasses, ears.
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.680]   - All these glasses.
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:14.960]   - Waiting for this time.
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:15.800]   - Oh.
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.640]   - It's in the trail.
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:19.280]   - Oleo's soft side.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:21.080]   - I got you up him.
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:21.920]   (laughs)
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:23.000]   Okay?
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.320]   In a close right.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:26.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:30.640]   - This, oh, wait a minute, I'm gonna pause this.
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:33.520]   This only works, no, I guess he's okay.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.160]   So sometimes it works--
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:36.000]   - He can have glasses.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.040]   - He can have, so in some of these cases,
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.640]   the bride has to be his class.
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:41.960]   - If they both have glass, they should marry,
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:42.880]   'cause they're not gonna fly in the couple
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:43.720]   that we are not--
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:45.400]   - The first couple both had orange glass,
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:46.840]   which really means they belong together.
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.680]   - They have to marry each other, there's a lot.
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:50.480]   - So here's a guy wearing glass.
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:53.920]   This is not creepy, but kind of dorky.
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:56.880]   - We're wearing glass proposing in a restaurant.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:57.800]   - Come here, kitty.
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:58.720]   - This is the best one.
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:33:59.560]   - This is the best one.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:00.400]   (whistles)
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:01.720]   (whistles)
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.400]   - Oh, well, it is an outfit.
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:06.960]   - They're cutting out the best parts, right?
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.120]   - Well, you get the same.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:08.960]   - You're the OIC.
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:11.400]   - You take the tip of your new threads to--
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:12.480]   - This is cute, actually.
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:14.640]   - Pretty painted toes.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.720]   - Let's start our adventure together.
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:19.320]   - I've known that I wanted to spend my life with you
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.680]   since before we started dating.
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:21.520]   - So--
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.360]   - Before we started dating, that's Marie Carroll.
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.200]   - How do you know that?
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.880]   - Marie Mabel.
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:27.200]   - Yes.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.280]   - What do you mean?
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:29.120]   - Yes.
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.880]   (laughs)
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.080]   - We could live properly and free off if you're okay with that.
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.160]   (laughs)
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:40.240]   - Can we go get 'em?
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:41.320]   - Let's go get 'em.
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:42.160]   - Oh.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.840]   - You're married.
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:46.920]   (laughs)
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:50.000]   - I wanna ask you.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.120]   - He's on his knees now.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.440]   - I'm married.
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:54.680]   (cheering)
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:58.160]   - Aw.
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.000]   - Are they in a makerspace?
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:34:59.840]   What is that?
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:00.680]   - That's the glass.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.080]   - Were they like picking up their glass?
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.080]   - Oh, they were getting their glass.
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.080]   - They were getting their glass.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:04.920]   - Oh.
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.440]   - Is it, can I record?
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:07.600]   - Yeah, that's why they both had it.
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:08.680]   I bet they did.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:10.120]   They might not have even owned glass,
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:11.440]   so we're just trying it on.
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:13.000]   - They should now.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:13.840]   - Yeah.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:15.640]   - I literally would go in there free to anybody.
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:17.520]   Those two people should get it for free.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:18.600]   - That's pretty cool.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:19.440]   - That's pretty cool.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:20.280]   - All right.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:22.080]   - We'd be better as a dog, we're wearing glass, but okay.
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:24.400]   (laughing)
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.360]   - Do they have glass for dogs yet?
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.800]   (laughing)
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:29.120]   'Cause I would get that.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:33.280]   - I'm kind of excited to get out of wearing glass.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.120]   - What?
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:35.520]   - Let's see what her perspective is like.
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:36.520]   - Baby glass?
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:37.840]   - I don't know.
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:41.000]   Kind of fun to see the world from like three feet.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.880]   - There is a Kickstarter project right now.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:44.440]   I forget the name of it, somebody even.
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:45.280]   - Ah!
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:46.120]   - It's a dog glass.
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.800]   - Yes, it works.
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:49.600]   - There's a Kickstarter project to use.
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:52.600]   - I go, we don't want to call it.
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:54.880]   (mumbling)
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.960]   - What are the cameras called that are used for?
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.320]   - GoPro. - GoPro.
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.160]   - GoPro.
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.600]   - So a bunch of kids, GoPro,
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.480]   so you get to see the playground and their lives
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:04.320]   from kids' perspective.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.560]   - Oh, that's neat.
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:06.400]   - This is the problem.
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:09.200]   When I did that, I was at the Google strategy group, right?
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.840]   I don't want any job in the world
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:12.360]   is to work at the Google strategy group.
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:13.280]   You really see the future.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.480]   So I'm talking to the whole strategy group at Google
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:17.120]   and I forgot something like that a minute ago.
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.160]   And I said to them all, who are all very young,
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:20.760]   and I said, don't get old.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:23.040]   And one of the guys, we said, the beat said,
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:24.000]   we're working on that.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.720]   - Wow.
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:28.200]   - See, now I'm interested.
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:30.560]   And I would give all of my,
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:33.720]   everything I got to the Google for overlords, if they would--
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:35.360]   - It was a great, it was a great topic.
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.160]   - It was a bad topic timing.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:37.480]   I've seen this.
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:38.480]   - Working on it.
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:39.960]   - That's a good moment.
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:40.800]   - Yikes.
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.440]   Yikes.
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.880]   - There are a lot of GoPro proposals, by the way.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.160]   Steve Perlman, we know the name,
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.000]   creator of Web TV, right?
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.560]   And Moxie, what else?
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.720]   He's done a lot of interesting things.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:57.560]   He's been working on a wireless broadband technology
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:00.120]   called P-Cell.
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:02.960]   He's a guy who did on live, right?
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:05.000]   And then sold it.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:05.840]   - Yep.
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.120]   And what was it?
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:09.360]   And Reason was singing his praises.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.400]   - Yeah, brilliant guy.
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:14.600]   P-Cell will enable, according to Perlman,
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.480]   full speed, wireless broadband
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:17.520]   through every mobile device,
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:19.160]   remark regardless of how many users
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:20.920]   are using the same spectrum.
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:23.760]   The startup is Artemis Networks,
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.600]   they've been working apparently for a long time on this.
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:31.720]   P-Cell will enable mobile data users
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.800]   to enjoy fast internet with no congestion,
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:36.320]   congestion, dead zones, weak signals.
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:38.800]   I wonder if it's a spread spectrum.
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:40.840]   He says, you'll feel like you're on fiber.
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:42.280]   - The-- - It's compatible with Elton.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.320]   - The information from the New York Times today was that
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.680]   companies can't put cells too close together
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:48.600]   'cause they conflict.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:49.440]   - Right.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:52.480]   - And what this technology does is make that an advantage.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.920]   And it passes off in smarter ways.
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:56.640]   And you don't have to change your phone.
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:58.120]   You can still, you will still be able to use it
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:37:58.960]   in your same phone.
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:00.040]   - Yeah, 'cause it's on LTE.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:00.880]   - Right.
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:01.880]   - So, you know--
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:02.720]   - So here's-- - So I'll talk a bit
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:03.560]   about this.
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:04.440]   - Here's Steve in his lab.
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:07.000]   There are six computers,
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.840]   all streaming high-def video at the same time
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:12.440]   in the same space on a single cell site.
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:13.360]   - And we're gonna show you that
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:15.200]   by using actual lab radios
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:18.720]   instead of using a LTE radio, that's a commercial.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.720]   - To about his videos, not streaming that.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:21.560]   - The reason we're gonna do that,
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:22.400]   the allow is to go--
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:23.560]   - See, I need P-cell.
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:24.560]   - The actual signal.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.880]   - It's frozen, it's 1080P videos.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:27.880]   I can't play it back.
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:29.760]   - Turn off certain things built into LTE,
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:31.720]   like for example, error correction.
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:33.280]   So if they're already in perfection,
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:35.880]   you'll see them 'cause we want to show you them.
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:36.720]   All right?
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:39.000]   And you could see that each of these PCs back here--
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:39.840]   - All right, you know what?
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:41.040]   You're gonna have to watch this yourself
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:41.880]   'cause I can't play it.
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:44.160]   - And you said, concerning the source,
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:45.680]   at recent on Twitter called him,
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:48.960]   one of the greatest Silicon Valley tech geniuses of all time.
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:51.040]   - Now this is his bid, if he can do this.
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:55.040]   Apparently in his lab, he's shown iPhones
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:59.200]   playing back 4K ultra HD versions of House of Cards.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:02.360]   They're putting P-cell transmitters
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.800]   on 350 rooftops in San Francisco.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:08.000]   And now of course they'd have to sign up.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.440]   Other folks, I guess if it works,
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:13.160]   it won't have any trouble doing that.
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:14.720]   - You can see them 'cause we want to show you them.
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:15.800]   - Oh, it works on your computer.
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:17.080]   - And you could see that each of these--
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:18.680]   - I get like an 800 year old MacBooks.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:20.320]   - And these are tablet PCs.
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:22.080]   - We're running things lately on it.
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:22.920]   - And then on the back--
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:24.320]   - I'm gonna bring in my picture.
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:27.000]   - That allows us to go and be exactly what--
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.680]   - Dennis Woodside, the CEO of Motorola,
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.800]   has moved on to Dropbox.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:33.920]   He was a Googler for a long time.
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:35.760]   They assigned him to Motorola Mobility
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:36.800]   when they bought the company.
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.920]   And now he's gonna be operating.
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:42.560]   She, first time they've had a CEO at Dropbox.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:45.480]   (buzzing)
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:47.760]   And Peter Magnuson, former engineering director of Google,
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.880]   is now VP engineering at Snapchat,
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:52.640]   probably expecting a big exit anytime now.
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:56.880]   Snapchat turned down three billion, right?
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:59.640]   Maybe they were holding out for 16.
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:02.520]   All right, we're gonna wrap things up
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:04.360]   with tips, tools, numbers of the week.
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:05.600]   And just a bit, I'll show today brought to you
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:06.920]   by LegalZoom.com.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:09.240]   LegalZoom is not a law firm better than that.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:14.240]   They help you get your legal documents worked out
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:18.280]   just online, 'cause in most cases,
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:20.800]   you know what you need to know to do it yourself.
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:22.400]   And there are some things like starting a business
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:26.400]   or protecting your family with a will that have to be done.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:30.440]   So LegalZoom lets you incorporate or form an LLC
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:31.760]   with their simple questionnaire
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.840]   starting at just $99.

[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:48.680]   Let's get Gina's tip of the week.
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:51.840]   - Really cool Google search feature,
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:54.160]   which made a brief appearance last year
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:55.840]   and then went away is back.
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:57.840]   It's the Google timer.
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:58.880]   So, all of a--
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.280]   - I used that the other day.
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:01.120]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:03.440]   I'll admit I'm a bit of a timer crazy person,
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:04.960]   particularly when I need to work on something
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:06.120]   that I'm procrastinating.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:07.680]   I'll set a timer for 30 minutes
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:09.040]   and just make myself work on that thing.
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.160]   - Oh, you're obnoxious.
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:11.720]   I love you, but you're obnoxious.
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.240]   (laughing)
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:14.240]   - Oh, geez.
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:15.200]   - I know, I am.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:16.160]   I mean, and honestly too,
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.440]   I've been trying to estimate how many hours
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:20.720]   particular engineering tasks we're taking at,
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:21.600]   are taking a think up,
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:25.400]   so then I try to time myself to see how close my estimates are.
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:27.560]   I know, I know, I have a whole spreadsheet.
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:28.800]   (laughing)
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.320]   But this timer features back.
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:34.360]   In order to set a timer in the search box,
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.240]   you just say set a timer for 30 seconds
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:38.360]   and you'll see in the one box,
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:39.400]   giant timer come up,
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.600]   you'll watch it kind of live, count down.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:42.440]   Let's try it out.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:44.800]   - This is so cool.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:46.720]   - You can do set a timer for an hour and a half,
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:49.680]   set a timer for 30 seconds,
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:51.040]   timer 30 seconds, yeah, there you go.
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:53.480]   So you got a 30 second timer counting down there.
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:54.800]   You can full screen it.
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.520]   So there's that button on the right, yeah.
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:57.760]   If you go full screen,
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.600]   it's just a giant timer,
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:00.600]   which is actually really useful.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:01.440]   If you're doing presentations.
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.360]   - What, you're doing it for students?
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:03.200]   - Yeah.
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:04.040]   - Yeah.
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:04.880]   - For students.
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:05.720]   - Yeah.
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:06.560]   - The fact Google,
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:09.000]   Google don't they project a timer up on the wall
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.600]   on certain, in certain meetings,
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.280]   certain big meetings where people are getting up
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:13.120]   and doing short presentations.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:15.480]   - They did an IO last year before the start of IO,
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:16.320]   remember?
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:17.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:19.200]   There you go, the timer just went off.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:20.720]   - Files done.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:22.240]   - Yep, and it's a false to five minutes,
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:23.080]   so you just,
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:25.320]   (laughing)
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:29.320]   (phone ringing)
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:30.160]   - Stop, stop.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:32.760]   - I'm gonna wake up now from this whole dream.
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:34.400]   - How do I, oh, you know what?
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:36.240]   The full screen has no okay button.
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:38.160]   Or maybe it did.
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:39.960]   - No, okay, there you go.
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:41.520]   - That was weird, 'cause I couldn't stop it.
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:43.800]   I didn't see it, maybe I just didn't see it.
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:45.920]   - Full screen timer, so it's a false to five minutes.
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:47.640]   So if you do set a timer,
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:49.480]   it'll just be, it'll be five minutes.
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:51.120]   And you don't have to be as obnoxious as me.
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:52.800]   You can use it actually for presentations
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:55.000]   or for your students, Jeff.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.320]   - That's cool.
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.160]   Cool.
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:58.480]   Does it work on mobile too?
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.680]   (laughing)
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:01.520]   - Okay, Google now,
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:03.400]   set a timer for 30 seconds.
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:05.760]   See, I think the promise,
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:07.960]   if I use Google now, it will do it
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:09.880]   with the alarm application, right?
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:11.760]   - It's, yeah, it sends it over to the alarm app, right?
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.120]   - See, that's no good.
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:13.960]   - Yeah.
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:16.360]   - Okay, Google now.
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:17.200]   - Just desktop.
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.920]   - Set a timer for 30 seconds.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:24.600]   - Setting alarm for 38 seconds.
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:26.440]   - Yeah, it just sets an alarm, that's no good.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:29.400]   - Yeah, and it sends it off to the alarm app.
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:31.320]   - Whatever, you can follow the alarm app, yeah.
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:34.680]   Okay, it's gonna go off in a second.
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:37.120]   What else, is that it?
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:37.960]   That's it.
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:38.800]   - That's it.
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:42.600]   Now, ladies and gentlemen, we give you a number.
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:44.160]   - The number this week, well, by the way,
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:46.800]   I just, Jake said to me then in WhatsApp,
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:49.120]   that it's mainly international and Raffa Ali,
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:50.840]   the founder of Skift and paid content,
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:53.320]   said that every one of his relatives in India is on,
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:55.360]   what's happening, that's where this is big.
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:57.120]   But I'll use a different number.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:02.080]   A new study from Ohio's Wright State University finds
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:06.040]   that one of every 13 tweets in English
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:07.520]   includes a curse word.
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:09.080]   Most of them, of course, mine.
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:13.200]   - And the rest of them have Justin Bieber in them.
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:14.280]   - Yes, so.
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:16.360]   - Users swear the most on Mondays,
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:18.160]   Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:20.560]   Men swear more than women,
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:24.040]   though everyone swears more around their own gender,
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:26.040]   and F-bombs are far and away,
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:28.440]   Twitter's curse word choice.
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:29.760]   - That's not a curse word, that's--
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:31.360]   - We have to build this thing up in sight.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:32.200]   - That's an emphatic.
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:33.120]   - You do, you do.
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:37.280]   A chart of naughty language usage exists.
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:39.160]   It's a Washington Post clip that's on their genome,
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:41.440]   so yes, I think you have to--
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:43.360]   - Oh, Pacific or usual cheery.
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:45.480]   - Hey, good for you, you're gonna have to--
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:47.080]   - F, yeah.
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:49.400]   - Wash your laptop out with soap young men.
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:51.000]   - F, yeah.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.560]   - It's so funny that they swear more on Monday, Wednesday.
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:57.720]   - Yes, you can't show the chart.
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:58.560]   - And so.
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:00.040]   - No, 'cause as the words go, I'd show it.
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:00.880]   You could show it.
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:03.440]   If you have children, have, cover their eyes right now.
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:04.280]   - There's no--
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:05.360]   - The last list of block words are like--
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.880]   - No, no, not that chart, there's a link on their chat
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:11.480]   where it says the co-next paragraph down, right there.
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:13.200]   - Okay, everybody close your eyes.
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:15.440]   - F word is more than double the S word,
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:16.920]   which is about equal to the A word,
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:18.360]   which is little over the B word,
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:20.560]   which is little over the N word.
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:23.480]   - They include hell as a bad word, I would not.
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:24.680]   - But hell beats horror.
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.520]   - And I think that Dick Costolo
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:27.800]   would not like the fact that his name
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:28.800]   is considered a curse word.
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:30.520]   - Dick Costolo is in there.
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:32.480]   - Dick Costolo is a curse, yes.
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:33.960]   - You costolo you.
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:34.960]   - You costolo.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:39.320]   What's this, what's this?
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:41.520]   - That's a good list.
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:43.920]   Just give me that list, I don't care about the graph.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:45.760]   - What's P-U-T-A?
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:47.840]   - Who the, that means, you don't know that?
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:49.400]   You don't speak Spanish.
[01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:50.760]   - Oh.
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:51.600]   - Damn.
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.800]   - Prostitute, a woman of the evening,
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:55.040]   or man of the evening.
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:55.880]   - Oh really?
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:56.720]   - A tomato.
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:58.720]   - Tomato you'd say, an Italian.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:46:59.720]   - A tomato.
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:00.560]   - Tomato.
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:04.760]   - They say it in English, or they say the word.
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:05.680]   - Well, yeah.
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:07.280]   - Is it Pomodoro?
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:08.200]   - Yeah, I guess.
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:09.600]   - Hey, Pomodoro.
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:13.600]   Quasi, cosy, Pomodoro.
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.280]   Anyway, that's a good number.
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:17.720]   - That's a good number, that one wins.
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:18.960]   - Excellent number.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:19.800]   - I should impose.
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.160]   - So I just got this in the mail.
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:22.240]   I got a couple of things to show you.
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:23.840]   One is this, a lot of people have been asking me
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:24.920]   about Republic Wireless.
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:27.400]   This is an interesting play.
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:29.080]   They offer Moto X phones.
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:30.120]   It's the only phone they offer,
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:32.560]   but that's actually a pretty good phone, if you ask me.
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:34.280]   And what they've done is they've integrated
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:38.520]   Wi-Fi calling into the phone app
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:41.560]   in such a way that when you're in a Wi-Fi area as I am,
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:43.240]   it'll make a Wi-Fi call,
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:45.240]   and then it'll use cell
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:47.400]   if you're outside of the Wi-Fi area.
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.640]   And by doing so, they have very affordable plans.
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:52.040]   If you don't need the cell coverage at all,
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:53.320]   which they get from Sprint, by the way,
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:54.640]   it's $5 a month.
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.800]   And the phone, I should check.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:58.880]   I mean, the prices go up and down all the time,
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:02.000]   but sometimes it's as little as free.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.840]   They have a $10 monthly plan that includes
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:07.800]   unlimited cell talk and text, but no data.
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:12.360]   For 25 bucks a month, you get unlimited 3G data.
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:14.360]   For 40 bucks a month, unlimited 4G data,
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:16.440]   and you always get unlimited Wi-Fi talk.
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:20.680]   So this is a really interesting idea for affordable plans.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:24.120]   Now, I just got this today, so I haven't had a chance to use it,
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.080]   but it is a stock Moto X.
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:29.320]   They only have black and white alas.
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:32.600]   But I think this is a really interesting idea,
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:37.480]   and I'd sure like to see this take off, this do well.
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.400]   Right now, $200,
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:45.000]   and I think this is unlocked, $2.99 unlocked.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.920]   So, I shall let you know, but an interesting play.
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:50.360]   And I'm also going to be reviewing this.
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:55.240]   This is a new Sony Xperia and Android phone for T-Mobile only.
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:59.320]   That is a 20 megapixel camera with a Sony processing.
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:01.240]   It's the Xperia.
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:03.240]   Is that the one that has the...
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:04.520]   No, they don't have a C1S.
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:05.400]   No, C1S.
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:06.040]   No.
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:07.640]   No, wouldn't that be nice.
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:08.440]   Big one.
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]   But I shall give you a review.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.360]   It does have the Sony interface, which is not a bad.
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:16.840]   You know, it's a pretty straightforward interface.
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:18.440]   And then my app of the week is What's App?
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:19.640]   Have you heard of it?
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:22.280]   (both laugh)
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:26.040]   We thank you everybody for joining us today
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:29.240]   for this week in Google, Gina Trapani, lifehacker.com.
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:30.200]   And also, think up.
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:31.960]   Let me just go to Leo Laport.
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:33.640]   And I love think up.
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:36.840]   Think up when it does a statistical analysis
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:38.200]   on your Twitter and Facebook feed,
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:40.520]   and tells you what you're thinking.
[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:41.800]   I checked mine before the show.
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:44.040]   Next week, it'll tell me how many times I use the F word.
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:44.760]   I'm sure.
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:45.960]   84.
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.000]   Yeah, really.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.880]   I'm only talking about it in Slack with my coworkers.
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:52.280]   94 people retweeted me today.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:53.640]   That's a new seven day record.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:50:00.520]   And then I am apparently on a list called Useful S word.
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:01.160]   That's good.
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:07.800]   You know, where our code is open source,
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:09.960]   but we're also trying to sort of open source
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:11.960]   our business model in the way that the company works.
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:15.560]   So today on our blog, my co-founder and CEO
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:16.920]   posted our investor update.
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:19.560]   We send an update to our investors every month.
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:22.360]   And so we were like, well, our users are investors,
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:25.240]   particularly our crowdfunding backers.
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:27.480]   So we posted the full, I mean, it's everything.
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:28.680]   It actually kind of made me uncomfortable.
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:31.080]   It's, I thought this would make Jeff proud.
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:33.160]   There's really nothing too private here,
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.440]   but just the full Monty of everything that's gone well,
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:38.040]   and everything that hasn't gone so well,
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:38.920]   and what we're working on.
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:43.320]   So, you know, if you're interested in what a tiny little company
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:45.400]   in New York City, it's every day looks like.
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:46.760]   You can check out the posts,
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:49.240]   and we're working on launching signups soon.
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:50.280]   That's really great.
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:52.840]   Think up soon for everyone.
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:54.360]   Thinkup.com.
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:59.480]   And by the way, I am currently 1,065 followers away
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:00.520]   from half a million.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:03.480]   So that'll be a nice round.
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:05.000]   That'll be a nice round.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.040]   Oh, dumb.
[01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:09.080]   I love think up really nice.
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:09.560]   Right.
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:10.920]   I'm so glad to hear that.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:12.520]   That's a rare insight.
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:13.720]   I'm glad that they gave you the,
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:16.120]   "Hey, you got an upcoming milestone."
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:17.560]   You got a big milestone coming.
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:18.200]   Yes, sir.
[01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:18.600]   Three.
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:19.160]   Think up.
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:23.240]   Everybody should take a look at it, and soon you'll be able to get it.
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:25.720]   Thinkup.com.
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:29.800]   Jeff Jarvis' latest book is Public Parts, Life in Public,
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:30.840]   and why it's a good thing.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:34.200]   He's also lives that life in public at buzzmachine.com.
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.600]   He teaches journalism at the City University of New York.
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:38.440]   And he's always a welcome.
[01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:41.160]   Voice here on this week in Google.
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:43.400]   Thanks to both of you for another great show.
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:46.760]   We'll see Gina back again next week on Tuesday
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:48.600]   for all about Android 5.0.
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:49.160]   All about Android.
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:49.800]   It's 8pm Eastern.
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:51.320]   Thanks everybody.
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:54.360]   We'll see you next week on this week in Google.
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:52:03.640]   [Music]
