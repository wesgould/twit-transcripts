[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.580]   will debate the merits of AMP
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.120]   and talk about all the Google News.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.280]   It's next.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.280]   Twig.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.640]   Time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.960]   We're going to have some fun today,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.120]   because we've got an interesting guest from the Google.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.120]   It's just from the Google Plex, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.760]   It's on location, Professor of Journalism
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.400]   at the City University of New York,
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.320]   author, logger at Buzz Machine.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.120]   What are you doing at Google?
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.880]   There's just some news folks who are here
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.160]   having some meetings, and there was a meeting yesterday
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.400]   about AMP, which we'll talk about with Richard Jingeris,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.560]   but I'm a big believer in where that heads.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.880]   And some other stuff.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.960]   So it's been great.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.760]   I'm amazed being on this campus.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   It's always a pleasure.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.760]   Oh, man, I'm jealous.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.640]   Oh, you're a massive deal.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.520]   I thought you were in New York.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.680]   No, I'm not in Mountain View.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.200]   I'm down the road from you.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.960]   He's got a self-driving camera right behind him.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.440]   Yeah, I really wish I'd been picked up
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.840]   by a self-driving car.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.040]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.680]   That's Kevin Marks, the posh accent of Kevin Marks,
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.040]   joining us, former Googler from his desk.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.360]   Well, I'm joining him from a desk at Mozilla today,
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.400]   because the social web working group is meeting here.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.800]   And so I'm here for that.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.480]   And we are in a bull cart there yet?
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.160]   Can't read a bull cart?
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.360]   She's someone you must be.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.360]   She's starting at Mozilla very soon.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.600]   Oh, I haven't met Kevin Elliott, OK?
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.400]   She's wonderful.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.200]   Actually, a couple of Mozilla stories in the lineup.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   But I'll mention those in a second.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   But first, we should also say we are awaiting the appearance
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.960]   of Richard Jingeris, who is--
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.600]   Jingeris.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.680]   --storied Google executive.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.200]   Now currently in charge of their news operation, right?
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.320]   News and social, yep.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.720]   Yep.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   That was a real force behind apps,
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.160]   so let's talk to him about it.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.120]   He also-- he was at Salon.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.880]   He was at the public broadcasting.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.960]   He was at Apple.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.120]   He's been all over part of Eworld at Apple.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.800]   He also set up At Home, which was the first cable modem
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.640]   network in the mid '90s.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.880]   He's vice president of programming and editor in chief.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.960]   He's been doing a lot of things.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.880]   So Richard Jingeris will be our guest
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.560]   as soon as we can figure out how to get the systems working.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.080]   But as long as we're talking--
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.680]   actually, shut up before we get into that.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.400]   Look what I got.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.600]   Google Card Wars was so cool.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.560]   Yeah, so Verizon is given these out for free at the Verizon
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.920]   store to customers, I guess.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.200]   There's Star Wars, Google Cardboard VR viewers.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.400]   And they have four of them.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.520]   We got all four of them thanks to a Jason Klyanthes, who's--
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.480]   he says, "known" at Verizon.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.400]   I don't know if that's good or bad.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.000]   So this is a Stormtrooper.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.840]   This one's R2 unit.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   We got a BB-8.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.440]   And who is this?
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.960]   Kyle Weeks.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.120]   What is this?
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.960]   Kyle Wren.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.600]   Some character that's going to be in the new movie.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.880]   So the drumbeat continues for Star Wars marketing.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.760]   It's insane.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.000]   Everywhere you go, you can't get away from it.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.200]   And Cardboard.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.960]   I got another Cardboard yesterday.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.800]   And saw some really neat 360 stuff on Cardboard.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.640]   Just saw some more demos just now.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.720]   It's phenomenal.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.880]   Did we talk about this?
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.080]   You know, Lowe's Home Improvement has a Cardboard
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.240]   vending machine?
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.520]   Wow.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.800]   Cardboard's cheap if you just get the paper version.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.720]   I mean, The New York Times is not getting it out in its
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.720]   Sunday paper.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.920]   I think-- I don't know.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   What do you think?
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.720]   Is this a gimmick?
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.920]   Or is this the beginning of the immersive video leading into
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.440]   virtual reality movement?
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.400]   Is this all coming on strong?
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.900]   There are people I've heard who are just
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.280]   insistent that this is big.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.040]   This is important.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.640]   It matters.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.160]   It's going to be the future of how we get into the web.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.520]   They've got to solve the puke problem, which is real.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.200]   I find myself disoriented.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.240]   But to be able to be in immersive environments and do
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.120]   things, yeah, they're insisting places like this.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.840]   So that's important.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.520]   You agree, Kevin?
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.400]   Well, I mean, to some extent, I mean, this thing has been
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.080]   the next big thing since the mid '80s.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.520]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.000]   We've been heralding it for a long time.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.440]   It's becoming more practical now.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.840]   And they're a bit too bad.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.720]   But yeah, the puke problem is real.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.600]   And there's a bunch of hard parts to that.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.680]   Part of that is how you actually judge depth.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.600]   Because you don't just judge it with parallax.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.760]   You also judge it by moving your head like that to decide
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.400]   what moves.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.000]   And you can't always do that with these VR things.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.640]   Certainly, you can't do it with most of the steadily shot
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.000]   stuff.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.600]   So I think the 16 camera thing will let you do a little bit
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.360]   of that.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.640]   Yeah, for that--
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.360]   $60,000.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.360]   Yeah, but that's the point.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.680]   If you just shoot with a single lens thing or a grid of six,
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.920]   you don't get enough overlap to let you do that and watch
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.000]   things move in front of each other.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.760]   Whereas if you shoot with 16, so they're basically
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.720]   the spacing of your eyes.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.720]   And as you rotate, you can move between them.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.240]   You can do a bit more of that.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.200]   So I'm optimistic that will help a bit.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.480]   But as you say, it's an expensive thing to shoot with.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.560]   The thing I learned talking to some people here
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.160]   is that the sound sync is an issue.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.920]   When you're hearing the sound from the wrong place,
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.680]   it's part of what throws you off.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.160]   It throws your brain off.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.320]   And one example of a woman named Angela Hildes' really
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.680]   great stuff.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.800]   She was one of the early people to use Skype on TV news.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.400]   And now she's doing immersive videos.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.160]   And she said, for example, if you're in a scene where you're
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.440]   underwater, what you have to have is the sound of the
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.600]   water sloshing has to be above you.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.960]   If it's below you--
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.520]   That's very good.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.480]   --in your sense of where it is, you're very confused.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.960]   You really need 3D sound as well, or else you get all
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.280]   messed up.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.280]   Right.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.920]   You can do that a bit orally.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.600]   But yeah, the other thing is that you've got very tight
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.400]   latency requirements on it.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.840]   And that is going to be a problem for Android, because
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.800]   Android has not got good audio latency.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.240]   So it's--
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.400]   Although I have to say, that's one of the empowering things.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.760]   That means this Google Cardboard can be so cheap is that we
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.960]   all have smartphones.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.680]   We have the $1,000 hardware that empowers.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.240]   It's really amazing what the empowerment of the
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.040]   smartphone from drones to cardboard, having a super
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.400]   computer in your pocket.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.400]   Seems to be a very valuable thing.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.840]   To have that high DPI phone.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.920]   Yes, it does.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.520]   Because when it's here with a lens in front of it, then
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.240]   actually having that many pixels is worth doing.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.040]   Because normally we're wasting pixels with these.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.120]   Because you can't see them.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.040]   I see Mr. Jingress is joining us.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.040]   So we're going to take a little break.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.480]   When we come back, Richard Jingress will be here.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.560]   He is executive at Google.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.200]   There he is, calling from the Google Plex.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.240]   We're going to make sure the sound's working and everything
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.720]   while we take a little commercial break.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.520]   We'll talk about AMP.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.920]   Kevin Marks really was excited about talking about a little
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:49.080]   more about AMP, Google's news and social initiatives as well.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:55.320]   From a guy who has been involved in this since 1979, when
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:01.080]   he helped KCEET begin its teletext initiative.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.880]   Wow.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.640]   There's a memory.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.000]   Our show today brought to you by lynda.com, the online
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.600]   learning platform with over 3,000 on-demand video

[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.720]   And then also learn for work.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.800]   I'm a photographer.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   I love photography.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.040]   You want to get better at it.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.560]   If you're interested in the same, Photoshop CC
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.300]   essential training, one of their courses, Photoshop
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.920]   for photographers is the 2015 Creative Cloud updates,
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.440]   another one, advanced courses on performance tuning your
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:55.640]   Canon digital SLR and Lightroom insider training series
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.520]   like PhotoTubles Weekly, Burt Monroy's amazing pixel
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.040]   playground.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.200]   Boy, if you're going to learn Photoshop,
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.080]   learn it from Burt Monroy.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.920]   The DIY photographer shows you how to take everyday household
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.680]   items and turn them into the tools you need to get better
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.040]   photos.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.920]   It's just great.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.840]   You can stream them on demand.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.160]   You can even download them and watch them on the go.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.440]   Take notes.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.600]   And of course, with written transcripts of every course,
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.320]   it's easy to find exactly the part you want.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.880]   So if you are a dabbler, you can just read, look at a
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.240]   little bit.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.440]   I like if you're a completist, you watch the beginning, and I
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.560]   like to do that, you can do that too.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.080]   lynda.com.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.040]   Here's what we're going to do, 10 days free, just like a
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.360]   real member.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.120]   You can browse around, try the courses.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.640]   That's enough time to take a full course or two, or to
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.720]   take sample a bunch of them.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.600]   All you have to do is visit linda.com/twig.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:49.560]   That's lynda.com/twig, 10 days free at linda.com.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.000]   Jeff, why don't you do the honors and introduce our guest?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.600]   Richard Jigress is my friend and co-conspirator from doing
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.160]   important things.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.960]   He's in charge of Google News and News at Google and all
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.200]   kinds of ways.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.520]   And Richard has been talking for a long time about the idea
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.560]   of containerized news.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.640]   And that led to a discussion with the last two news
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:15.160]   guys around how the relationship of news could change.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.680]   And then Richard came back to Mountain View for one of
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.680]   them and saw Dave Bezbrus, a senior VP
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.880]   engineering here.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.000]   And Kismit occurred because Google, as you know, cares
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.800]   very much about a faster web, a better web, an open web.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.920]   And so out came accelerated mobile pages.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.560]   And Richard's a key driving force behind that.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.920]   I'm very excited about this.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.040]   I think it makes a huge difference in how we are going to
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.160]   interact via links with content and news.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.320]   I also think in markets that are still mobile in 3G, that
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.680]   it's going to be gigantic in terms of not only speeding up
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.920]   their experience, but reducing their data costs immensely.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.200]   Richard quotes a piece that said that the web pages can be
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.960]   2 to 10 megabytes for maybe 80K of actual content.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.920]   And this is going to make a big difference.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.840]   So Richard's the driving force that made this happen.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.000]   I'm delighted about it.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.880]   And I got to see him here.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.880]   That's why he's joining the show.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.120]   So Richard, why don't you do a better job than I can about
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.400]   explaining AMP and what makes it what it is?
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:14.800]   Sure.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.400]   Well, great.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.400]   And very delighted to be here with you guys today.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.400]   So yeah, let's talk about that a bit.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.840]   I mean, I sort of look at it from a few base observations
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.000]   about what's going on on the web today.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.800]   And one, as we know, is unfortunately, over the years
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.120]   with the advance of technology, we've
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.080]   managed to use that technology in ways
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.320]   that, yes, it may be an effort to make content experiences
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.280]   more compelling.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.280]   But for the most part, it's actually made web pages very,
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.920]   very slow.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.200]   And I think we see that every day.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.520]   It's even more pronounced on mobile where bandwidth might
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.480]   be constrained and frankly, where you're
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.880]   paying for that bandwidth.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.320]   So that's an issue.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.840]   We also see on the web today that, frankly, advertising
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.840]   experiences have gotten far more annoying and far less
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.440]   compelling.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.280]   And these factors, too, I think, have led to serious concerns
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.800]   about the state of the web.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.360]   And when you look at those two factors of speed
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.280]   and the whole annoying experience with many ads,
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:30.640]   it has had a number of very, very challenging after effects.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.040]   One, generally, if you look at the use of the mobile web
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.320]   in developing countries where data plans are more constrained,
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.440]   if you ask them their definition of the internet,
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.960]   they won't include the World Wide Web.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.440]   They'll include social networks.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.440]   They'll maybe even include YouTube,
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.040]   but they won't include the World Wide Web.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.800]   And part of that is because it's slow.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.840]   But among the other effects, for instance,
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.840]   with the situation with ads, we're seeing a stark rise
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.120]   in ad blocking and a rise in the use of quick views
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.680]   and reader views, which strip out the business model entirely.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.680]   This is not good for an ecosystem of high quality content
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.560]   that needs to be sustained economically.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.840]   And there's been a further effect here, if you look at it,
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.720]   that given the speed of the web, it's
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.120]   opened up an opportunity for proprietary platforms,
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.440]   social networks, for instance, Facebook with its,
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.840]   you know, instant articles to say,
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.400]   well, yeah, the web is slow.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.080]   We can make that fast.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.360]   Simply take and put your content with us.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.960]   And I understand that approach.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.720]   It makes great sense from their perspective.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.640]   But to me, it simply underlines the core issue
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.080]   that the web is not as fast and furiously compelling
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.560]   as we all hope it would be and should be.
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.040]   And that's really the genesis of AMP.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.760]   Was, could we take, in a sense, rearchitect
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.960]   how the web works while respecting web principles
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.680]   and respecting web technologies such that we could make content
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.680]   instant everywhere?
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.480]   And I mean just that instant everywhere,
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:12.640]   whether that's clicking on a search result in Google search
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.560]   or for that matter, a shared URL that goes into Facebook.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.120]   We think we can do a far better job of eliminating
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.600]   the friction between the content experiences
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.120]   and other platforms which are driving audiences
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.120]   to those experiences.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.720]   And so as I remember--
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.240]   I remember it.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.640]   There are four things fundamentally that AMP does.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.040]   It has a shared library of scripts
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.440]   so that you don't download them every damn time.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:46.040]   It caches and/or pre-fetchs content closer to the user
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.120]   optionally with Google, but other CDNs
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.720]   could cache the content as well.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.080]   Number three, it sets standards, especially
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.440]   for the architecture of advertising.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.920]   So advertising doesn't jump all around the damn page.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.400]   And number four, we'll have a shared mechanism
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.360]   to collect data for analytics so you don't have
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.240]   eight different snoops on you looking at every one of your pixels
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.960]   every millisecond.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.360]   And those four things together are the underpinnings
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.640]   of what speeds up this.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.840]   And that there are things built into that code
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.320]   based that will be constantly be growing
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.200]   because it's open source.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.920]   So for example, the way you insert a tweet,
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.360]   as you said yesterday, now requires
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.800]   you to download all those codes to show the tweet.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.680]   That will already be in this shared library
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.240]   so that displaying a tweet will be one line and there will go.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.240]   That's one thing that really concerns me
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:38.320]   because that really fosters incumbents
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.800]   and really promotes incumbents and gives Google
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.360]   or whoever implements AMP-- and I know it's open source,
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.640]   but it's going to be Google-- gives them some significant power
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:55.720]   and determine you help Twitter, but do you help this.cm?
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.600]   I mean, that worries me a little bit.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.600]   That's one of the things I like about the free and open web
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.320]   is everybody's at parity.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.120]   Well, it is still the free and open web.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.200]   And I think I hear what you're saying.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.080]   But of course, large companies, including Google,
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.880]   have long played a role in how the web evolves in its protocols.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.240]   And frankly, that's what we're doing here.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.440]   And it is very important that it's open source,
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:25.160]   and we are treating it very much in that spirit,
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.840]   such that it can accommodate all the capabilities
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.520]   that people want to take advantage of.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.840]   I actually look at this as a huge boon to the publishing
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.560]   community, particularly to all of those torso and tail
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.440]   publishers who frankly don't have the technical resources
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.520]   or the business development resources
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.760]   to build all the things they have to build or strike
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.920]   deals with proprietary platforms to get their content delivered
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.560]   at speed.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:58.440]   So I actually have, obviously, a very different view on that.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.160]   And what we encourage everyone-- and since we announced
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.680]   this project two months ago, there are now
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.920]   some 4,500 developers on the GitHub project.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.040]   And I strongly encourage anyone with views
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.800]   about how the direction of this effort
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   should go to jump in and express themselves.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.000]   As I keep saying, I think this is so crucial to the future
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.840]   of the worldwide web.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.720]   It would be incorrect to think of this as a Google project
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.760]   or think of it as being a success just because Google
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.880]   is involved with it.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.960]   This is going to take the leadership of many.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.360]   It's going to not just the leadership of one.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.280]   So we want the publishing community in the broadest sense.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.240]   We want the technology community in the broadest sense
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.400]   to engage on this approach.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:47.760]   Because the alternative is just devastating.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.560]   We don't want to see it continue to decline in the viability
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.600]   of the mobile web.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.840]   We don't want to see the mobile web
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.040]   or people's experiences on the internet drift towards
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.560]   balkanized proprietary platforms.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.520]   And I agree with you on that, obviously.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.120]   That could be a big problem.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.120]   Richard, how will the governance of this work in terms of--
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.000]   Yeah, that's what worries me.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.880]   For instance, only JavaScript is allowed.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.160]   Is JavaScript approved by Google?
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.440]   Well, actually--
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.280]   Can others get involved in that?
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.040]   Like any open source project, and the governance--
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.520]   the philosophy of governance is actually
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.520]   stated on the GitHub.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.240]   It's a very much engineering-centric effort.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.280]   Clearly, Google has been the enabler
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.480]   of this and is leading the effort without question.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.560]   But we know that the success of this
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.960]   will depend on us doing the right job in satisfying
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.040]   the larger community of interests without question.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.760]   And that's clearly our core objective here.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:50.040]   Right.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.480]   I mean, there is--
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.680]   Everything you say is true about what's
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.200]   going on with the way large media is using the web,
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.120]   in that they're embedding so much JavaScript and nonsense
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.320]   in there that it's very hard to know what's going on.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.520]   And this is one answer to that.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.040]   And if you can get them to adopt that, that does help.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.040]   But the other part of it is that you can just
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.240]   slim down your web pages and not do this,
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.200]   and not have this JavaScript didn't read aspect to it.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.640]   So is this the point?
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.400]   This is a forcing function to encourage them to do that?
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.040]   Is that the goal here?
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:25.560]   Yes.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.560]   In fact, if you look at this from a technical perspective,
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.240]   it's actually a hugely simplifying function
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.840]   for content developers and publishers.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.240]   We make things simpler.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.000]   But a core approach to the architecture
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.680]   is, frankly, to find optimal efficiencies
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.520]   by eliminating redundant code and turning those
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.400]   into core primitive modules of code
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.920]   that folks can build upon.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.160]   So slimming down the site, it's hard to slim down the site
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.000]   with as much JavaScript as being used today.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.320]   Every site, basically, every web page is its own app.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.240]   It's got its own menuing structures written in JavaScript.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.680]   It's got a slideshow that's written in a lot of JavaScript.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.280]   All this stuff that, frankly, is largely redundant
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.360]   and can be addressed with core runtime modules.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.760]   But we want to do this also in a fashion
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.280]   that doesn't take away creativity.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.920]   So yes, it simplifies the models,
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.880]   expand the capabilities of the runtime as things progress,
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.560]   but also leave in appropriate, as it were,
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.680]   escape hatches for people to do more.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.080]   So we're not saying, for instance, yes, that's true,
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.120]   that there's no JavaScript in an app file itself.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.960]   It's simply tag calls to JavaScript components
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.280]   in the runtime.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.800]   But we do also provide affordances for escape hatches.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.880]   So if, along with that article, someone
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.160]   wants to trigger, say, an interactive data visualization,
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:58.200]   there's an element in the specification to do just that,
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.080]   such that you can click on that module.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.880]   And then from that point on, the publisher
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.440]   is indeed using JavaScript to create whatever they would
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.160]   like to create.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:10.080]   But one of the concerns is that you're
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:14.440]   replacing some of the native HTML elements
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.520]   with custom elements.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.080]   In particular, audio and video and image
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:24.520]   get replaced by AMP-audio AMP-video AMP-image,
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:30.200]   which means that your pages aren't really HTML in that sense.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.800]   Without the JavaScript, they come out--
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.320]   well, that just doesn't come out blank,
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.240]   which was above originally.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.320]   But without the JavaScript library, that doesn't load,
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.720]   you end up-- the full back doesn't work.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.000]   I'm not sure I follow that.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.880]   But there's an inherent fragility in JavaScript
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.080]   as opposed to HTML, because you're
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:58.160]   relying on execution rather than declarative documents.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.480]   So with HTML, if you make a mistake in HTML,
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.280]   the browser can cope with that, whereas you make a typo
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.640]   in JavaScript, everything stops working.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.480]   And so there is a sort of--
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.640]   so the declarative HTML is you say things
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.040]   like angle bracket, video, link to video,
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.520]   and that becomes a video thing.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:24.320]   If with AMP, I have to put an AMP-video in there.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.360]   And if the AMP JavaScript doesn't load because there's
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.280]   a glitch I'm on the train or something,
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.040]   then that page will not render--
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.720]   will not fall back reliably.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.840]   And that's part of the concern with this,
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.360]   is that it's a lot closer to actual HTML
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:49.160]   than what Facebook and Apple have proposed for their compressed
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.120]   solutions for news.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.520]   But it has some-- it's a little more fragile.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.120]   That was part of our concern for it.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.320]   Actually, I'm not sure how it's more fragile,
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:04.480]   because frankly, today, you're right about JavaScript,
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.520]   but there's just all kinds of JavaScript in every page.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.720]   But it's more fragile than pure HTML, is what I mean.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.120]   JavaScript is HTML.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.720]   I mean, to the extent that there is less handcrafted
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.920]   JavaScript in everyone's web pages,
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.080]   then frankly, the opportunities for error should go down.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.280]   But again, I think the core thing here
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.040]   is-- and the objectives are following,
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.240]   and we encourage everyone to engage,
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.760]   is how do we take in smartly re-architect
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:38.160]   how the web works without diminishing any of its capabilities
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.000]   or diminishing the freedom of publishers and content
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.600]   developers out there to create the kind of experiences
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.440]   they want to create?
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.880]   And we think that's all very doable.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.440]   And again, given the alternative,
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.000]   I think it's absolutely crucial that we go down this road.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.520]   Other folks have better ideas to how to tackle the problem
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.920]   than where we're all ears.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.000]   But when we look at the situation in the ecosystem today,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.920]   we think steps need to be taken,
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.760]   because the challenges that we're facing otherwise
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.000]   are, I think, very, very steep and very concerning
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.840]   to all of the publishers that we've worked with
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.360]   in pulling this together.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.520]   And I think that's an important point here.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.400]   This has been a collaboration from the beginning.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.040]   As Jeff mentioned, this started with discussions
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.680]   with publishers and technologists back six or eight
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.400]   months ago.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.440]   Some of us were talking about it far longer than that.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.360]   But it's been a very collaborative effort
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.080]   since then in terms of developing the SPAC in terms
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.800]   of developing the overall approaches that we're taking.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.520]   Let me apologize, because I'm going
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.440]   to be a little provocative here, but mostly
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.600]   for playing devil's advocate.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.760]   But let me see if I can reformulate this in a very--
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.080]   I'm stupid, dumb, simple way, and see if I've got this wrong.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.240]   The premise, of course, is that the web has become a quagmire
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.840]   of crap code, of advertising crap.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.680]   It's too slow.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.920]   It's especially immobile, unusable.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.840]   So the solution is-- and it feels like what Google's
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.640]   proposing is almost a Facebook and Apple in their own way,
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.520]   a unilateral, well, we can create a new standard that
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.920]   will make this better.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.120]   And sure, you're enlisting big publishers.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.560]   But it feels like this--
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.560]   it doesn't feel like the W3C.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.600]   It doesn't feel like the IEEE.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.640]   It doesn't feel like a open process.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.000]   It feels more like these three big incumbents
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.200]   are all three proposing a completely new way
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.160]   of expressing content on the internet,
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.200]   admittedly not deprecating the old way.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.440]   But if the old way is slow and not so functional,
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.120]   and everything else is new and shiny,
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.560]   maybe it's going to hurt the old way.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.040]   I worry about that.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.920]   And maybe I'm misunderstanding it.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.560]   And I understand what you're saying, Richard, is this is.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.080]   But this is going to be an open process.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.480]   But it does feel a little bit unilateral,
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.320]   even if you say, well, we're taking in all the big publishers.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.280]   Well, I'm a little publisher.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.280]   So--
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.920]   And you should get as involved as you would like as well.
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.760]   I mean, I obviously would disagree on the point
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.760]   that the AMP effort is a unilateral effort.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.680]   It has not been a unilateral effort from the beginning.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.920]   Clearly, we're playing a key role in this without question.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.200]   But unilateral is certainly not.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:35.360]   Now, in the end, does the standard evolve from this?
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.840]   Maybe so, and that would be very nice.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:43.520]   But as you know, setting a new standard, it takes years.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.640]   But in a way, that's what you're doing.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.720]   And so--
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.400]   Well, we are obviously-- we have proposed an approach
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.040]   and are going to put in market an approach, which we think
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.440]   can evolve either as a lowercase standard
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.280]   or maybe into an uppercase standard as time goes by.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.120]   But I think the urgency of the situation calls for action.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.880]   And again, if others have alternate approaches,
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.520]   then we're all years.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:08.960]   But--
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.360]   I'll accept it's with the best intentions.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.840]   But this is how standards proliferation happens.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.840]   People say, well, that W3C moves too slowly.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.320]   We've got an idea.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.760]   We would like to create a new standard.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.720]   And now you've got two standards.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.280]   And I don't think that that's an unusual thing.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.000]   So really, it's got to convince--
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.320]   Yeah, go ahead, Jeff.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.440]   No, no, go ahead.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.080]   Well, I just feel like you have to convince everybody--
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.240]   all the stakeholders here.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:37.120]   And why not go through the W3C on this?
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.880]   My primary point on that would simply be time.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.360]   Simply be time.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.760]   We will be talking about it for three years, five years.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.320]   Well, that's-- yeah.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.400]   I mean, I'm actually-- there's standards meeting at the moment.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.080]   There were three C standards meeting at the moment.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.680]   And yeah, it can be a slow process.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.240]   But part of this is there's been an evolution
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.640]   in the way standards work.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.400]   And they used to be effectively-- you
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.920]   would write the standard first, then people would implement it.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.800]   And what we've moved to is implementation first,
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.280]   and then standards as documentation and implementations.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:06.800]   Yes.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.120]   And that's--
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.040]   You can make the case that each browser has been doing this.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:10.760]   That's right.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.760]   But it's a fact, though.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.720]   Well, it would also-- I mean, but also there was--
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.720]   and most standards start out actually as that.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.720]   People will implement things, and then they document
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.040]   how to implement them, and if two of them
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.040]   implement the same thing, then it's on its way
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.680]   to becoming a standard.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.040]   And there is this sort of mistake.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.880]   But then once the standards exist,
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.200]   people treat them as sort of legislative documents
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.840]   to say, this is how the standard works.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.920]   And so there is this sort of mistaken idea
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.640]   that the standards bodies are legislators,
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.320]   and they tell everyone what to do.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:44.000]   And that would particularly arrive with W3C and XH2M2,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.280]   where there was an assumption that if they were at the standards,
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.320]   then all the browsers of vendors would adopt them.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.920]   And that browser vendors decided that wasn't what they wanted to do,
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.880]   and that's where we got HTML5 from, which was developed outside
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.760]   of W3C, and then brought back in.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.480]   And that sort of pattern repeats itself.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.520]   So there's nothing actually wrong necessarily
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.080]   with saying, OK, we're building this thing.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:05.960]   Can you adopt it?
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.440]   But there's some sort of detailed discussions
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.360]   about the actual format and how it works.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.560]   I wouldn't try to get too much of the weeds there.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:22.160]   But there are concerns about effectively replacing bits of HTML
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:26.080]   with custom versions of those bits of HTML.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.760]   And there's some hope we could get and encourage them
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.280]   to use more standardization or rather
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.920]   the specialized AMP dash variants of them.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.560]   Well, let me ask a question there.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:42.600]   Kevin and Richard, what could break, right?
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.560]   If you go to a browser that doesn't--
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.720]   this is still HTML.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   It's basically a subset of HTML, as I'm told.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.280]   And so if you have that AMP call for a video,
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.720]   as opposed to a regular HTML call for a video,
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.480]   and a different browser or an old browser,
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.440]   is that going to be an issue?
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.680]   Or it'll figure it out.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.920]   Well, old browsers tricky because they won't necessarily
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.240]   support video anyway.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.840]   But what it--
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.840]   Well, you say--
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.120]   everybody supports image.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.640]   So the issue is if the JavaScript doesn't load for some reason,
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:22.160]   then you will not see the parts that have wrapped in the AMP
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:28.640]   stuff because they're declaring it in their own format.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.720]   There's only parts of that.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.600]   So if I use instead of an image tag, I use AMP dash image.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.600]   Oh, my, we have more people joining us.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.960]   Hey, it's Matt Cutts.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.800]   Hey, it's Matt Cutts.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.440]   How are you?
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:40.880]   Good, Matt.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.800]   Good to see you.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.800]   Welcome.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.400]   I think that was going to be in the Google plaques,
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.240]   and I couldn't resist--
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.600]   You got reinforcements, Richard.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.880]   Oh, no.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.880]   So I--
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.640]   First of all, I feel like the image tags, the image tag,
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.040]   why are we messing with it?
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.560]   But I understand why we're in a crisis.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.640]   It says if Vince surf said, you know this IPV4,
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.840]   we're in a crisis, I'm going to unilaterally
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.760]   propose a new system.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.640]   You need to come along.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.280]   But you got an image tag, and I'm
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.520]   going to replace this AMP dash image.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.080]   That's implemented in JavaScript.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.680]   JavaScript that comes from an AMP server,
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:19.240]   currently run by Google, others could run it, that worries me.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.080]   And only Google can approve the JavaScript that is allowed.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:23.920]   But any other--
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.360]   I have a no.js site.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.600]   What happens to me?
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.520]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.520]   Well, does that--
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.400]   I have many questions, like on the image tag.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.760]   I would encourage you guys to have another show with Malta
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.600]   Oodle, who is the technical guru.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.280]   Yeah, we don't have to get too technical, Richard.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.080]   And he can get into exactly why we're doing the images
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:45.880]   the way we are.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:49.440]   A lot of it comes down to how do we simply be smarter
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.560]   and how we handle content in the browser?
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.720]   I mean, you can look at sites out there today that are actually--
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.760]   when you load the page, they're loading four different sizes
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.400]   of the image, even though they're only going to use one.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.960]   It just-- these are not sensible approaches.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.080]   So yes, we stepped out with an approach
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.600]   to attempt to address these issues.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.360]   And when I look at the situation out there,
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.000]   when I look at ad blockers in Germany being up to 35%, 40%,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.200]   being up to 20% in the United States,
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.640]   when I look at the damage of the web ecosystem, given
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.520]   the challenges we face, yeah, I think action is necessary.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.080]   But as I said before, if others have other approaches
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.960]   that we think should be taken, they should jump in.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.720]   If they have questions or challenges to the approaches
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.000]   that we're taking with AMP, please jump in.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.880]   What I'm sensing from folks is that the GitHub discussions
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.480]   and engagements have been very, very fruitful
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.840]   and very, very collaborative.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:56.680]   But I'd say get involved and see for yourself.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:10.760]   I worry that my fear is that this JavaScript that's
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.160]   going to be running on my page is coming from AMPProject.org.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.960]   I mean, admittedly, many pages have--
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:21.040]   JavaScript's coming from all sorts of third parties sources
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.800]   that's insecure in many cases.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.440]   It's crap in other cases.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.520]   But at the same time, it feels like Google's saying, no,
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.560]   no, let us handle this.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.200]   Well, here--
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.360]   You've got a trust issue.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.240]   I'm going to be honest.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.080]   These are going to be a trust issue with this.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.760]   And we understand that.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:40.920]   We go into that with fully understanding of that.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.800]   And again, we feel that something will have to prove every day.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.840]   But as I said, someone's got a different approach.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.960]   Come forward with it.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.800]   But if you look at the way we're tackling things,
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.600]   I think a lot of those concerns going away.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:35:01.200]   Look at-- you raised the issue of Rampant Road JavaScript
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.760]   and redundancy.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.240]   Let's look at how the analytics situation is.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.760]   As I've often pointed out, the road to performance
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.400]   hell on the internet starts with a vendor coming in and saying,
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.600]   add one more line of JavaScript.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.200]   So I can give you some more analytics.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.440]   And what you find is you've just added three seconds
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.680]   to your page load time because of all the stuff that's
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.800]   going on behind the scenes that you
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.960]   don't have much of a window on.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.680]   So fine.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.440]   We said, how do we tackle that?
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:32.640]   We certainly don't want to foreclose third party analysts
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.280]   from providing their knowledge and capabilities
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.040]   and analytics.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.840]   We want to support all that.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.080]   But what we can do and what we are doing--
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.400]   and that's what the specification that we put forth
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.720]   in our writing against right now with regard to analytics--
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.920]   is let's build into the runtime all the core analytics
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.320]   gathering on the page.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:56.760]   We don't need eight elements measuring the scroll point.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.440]   Let's reduce that to one such that all of that data can then
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.240]   be passed back to a publisher endpoint
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.160]   or by the publisher to various analytic providers
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.440]   to do what they will with that information.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.080]   I think it's a sound and reasonable approach
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.440]   to where you have simply too much redundant functionality
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.840]   going on in a page.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.360]   I think we can do better.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.480]   But again, it's an approach we've taken.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.280]   It's open source.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.440]   The spec is there.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.680]   We're engaged with all the providers and participants.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.320]   And we'll do our best to come up with the right solution
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:33.200]   and earn the trust of all the participants.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.880]   And frankly, I don't think we would even
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.760]   gotten as far as we've gotten had we not earned at least
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.200]   the trust of the leading participants.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.600]   Leo?
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.120]   Jeff.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:42.880]   I'm on speaker right there.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.280]   OK?
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.720]   Yeah, it sounds fine.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.160]   Nice beers, by the way, Matt.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:46.960]   Nice beer.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.440]   I'm a little mad.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.880]   But this is the issue that I raised at Newsgeist, which
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.600]   was two weeks ago in Phoenix, where you had some journalists
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.000]   come in as the herd of EORs.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   As I mentioned last week in the piece I wrote in Observer,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.920]   where, oh, what's Google's agenda?
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.800]   You want to Google this?
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.800]   Google that.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.120]   And what I said back to the room was, listen,
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.320]   if Google hadn't stood up and done this,
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.880]   we'd be here a year later still complaining
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.800]   about the slow web and ad blockers.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.080]   The question here is leadership.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.440]   And in fact, one of the Google executives
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.680]   at the original Newsgeist in Helsinki said, we can't build this.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.200]   We build this.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.800]   People are going to say, well, what's Google's agenda?
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.400]   What's Google's this?
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.400]   What's Google's that?
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.280]   So Google did step up, put itself at that risk,
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.280]   did cake position a leadership.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.200]   Nobody else was doing it to solve this problem.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.680]   Now, is Google the right person to do it?
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.160]   Well, who else would do it?
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.320]   Is Google doing it the right way?
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.720]   That's a discussion apparently Google's happy to have.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:37.240]   That's what an open source governance process is about.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.320]   And open source governance is all about stepping up
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.800]   and contributing, not just complaining.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.240]   And so if we have that issue, and we have Twitter here,
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.960]   where we don't have a new Twitter in,
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.160]   how does that get handled?
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.720]   We've got to deal with that.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.840]   And either this will synchronous
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:55.280]   swim based on the adoption of it and what it does for the web.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.760]   It could say, people could decide to abandon it,
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.680]   go back to the way it was, and go back to the slow web.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.480]   But I just think that Richard's right that the problem here
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.440]   was great enough that somebody had to step up and show
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.640]   leadership.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.320]   And in leadership, in this day and age,
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.040]   you make yourself vulnerable to this kind of complaint.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.040]   Absolutely.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.880]   And by the way, that's it.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.200]   Matt, what are you doing at the Googleplex?
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.160]   Yeah, what are you collecting your monthly paycheck or what?
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.680]   I just want the river here.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.960]   Here in Bat Country, and I said, well,
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.960]   I have to come see you in Bat Country.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.960]   I don't know.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.840]   But if you'll come all the way across the country
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.720]   and cross who knows how many bridges,
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.400]   it only seems safe that I should come across the campus.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.000]   That's the paradox of Jeff Jarvis.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.200]   He doesn't mind flying in a plane.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.880]   He doesn't want to drive over a bridge.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.880]   He could take a helicopter over the river.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.880]   But that'd be fine.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.640]   But to your point, I mean, I think a lot of folks
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:55.000]   expected us in response to things like Facebook,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.480]   Instant articles, and Snapchat, and so on.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.400]   I think they expected Google to come forward
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.800]   with another proprietary format.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.840]   And I think that would have been unfortunate and not
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.720]   what the ecosystem deserves or needs.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.040]   So very, very early on, we declared
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.920]   that the smart way to do this was collaboratively
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.680]   through an open source effort that we would yet use
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.840]   our technical expertise to drive.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.560]   Has anybody yet-- how many AMP--
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.040]   other AMP servers are set up?
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.200]   How many other AMP systems have been set up?
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.880]   Well, if they say AMP systems, keep in mind
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.120]   that an AMP page is like any other web page--
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.400]   No, no, no, not the client, but the AMP servers themselves,
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.560]   the providers of the JavaScript, SNPs, and so forth.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.360]   The ability to embed AMP is the thing.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.720]   This is, you know, Jeff's original goal
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.280]   was like I wouldn't put things in other places.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.480]   And I think Nuzzled did it, but I'm not sure
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.440]   who else is actually displaying AMP pages
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.920]   apart from the Google demo.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.760]   Yeah, but I'm not asking about the content.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.760]   I'm asking-- it was my understanding,
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:59.280]   because it's open source, that you don't have to just go
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:04.360]   to cdn.ampproject.org to get your image tag resolved.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.960]   Or is that not the case?
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:10.600]   No, it is-- so first of all, a plan for the runtime
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:15.680]   are to support all modern browsers.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.360]   And that's very clear and obvious.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.040]   I'd also point out that, by the way,
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.040]   you can find AMP files surfacing on LinkedIn today.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.760]   You can find them surfacing on Pinterest today.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.320]   And yes, you can find them surfacing on Nuzzled today as well.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.280]   So they are out there in the wild.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.080]   But the pages are indeed served by the publisher.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.640]   I want to keep that in mind, because one of the key principles--
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.280]   when we built this, I did step back
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:40.120]   and go through all the key principles.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:44.880]   But one key principle was, leave the publisher in control
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.480]   of their content, of their page, of their business model.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.680]   So they're serving these pages.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:54.040]   Now, yes, Google will cache these pages
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.640]   so that we can surface them in our canvases.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.360]   And what we have also stated is that we would make that cache
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.320]   available to any and all comers who
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.240]   wanted to pull the content from the cache, which
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.120]   is a huge boon to many publishers who are now spending.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.280]   I mean, one big publisher told me that their largest cost
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.640]   outside of human resources was CDN.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.840]   And we're basically saying, we're giving you a free CDN.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.920]   They could manage of it if you'd like to.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.040]   Where does the runtime run from, though?
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.640]   I mean, where does--
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.760]   maybe I'm misunderstanding the technology.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.480]   Slap me down, Kevin, if I am.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.440]   Or should I'm loading the library into your browser?
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.560]   From where, though?
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.360]   OK, so--
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.040]   From Google.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:35.800]   But you could cache it.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.440]   It's totally.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:36.840]   I mean--
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.320]   If you cache it.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.000]   But the advantage of Google is that everyone
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.920]   is leaving the same one so that when you go side to side.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:50.200]   So all of the JavaScript that is allowed
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.680]   comes from a Google server.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:57.480]   All of the JavaScript is in the core runtime, yes.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.960]   Because there is the opportunity to do JavaScript outside
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.520]   the runtime in prescribed circumstances.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:06.520]   OK.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.280]   I think that's a problem.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.080]   But--
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:09.680]   This is the one time--
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.280]   Come on, Kevin, you're the open web guy.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.440]   Isn't that a-- that seems to be an issue to me.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.280]   Well, again, I'm going to poke back on this, honestly.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.520]   What's the alternative?
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.080]   What's the alternative to the problem
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.080]   set we're seeing out there in the market?
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.080]   Well--
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.160]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.320]   I'll give you one alternative which some people
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.680]   have pushed back on, which is to encourage people
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:34.000]   to use much less JavaScript and much more HTML.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.800]   And that-- I'd say that is pushing back against a lot of work
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.480]   to that.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.920]   Because that means they're taking away capabilities.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:45.480]   Yeah, but Richard, this is what it sounds like to me.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.800]   It sounds like Google's saying, you guys are
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.200]   crapped up the web.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.640]   Let us handle this.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.080]   Run JavaScript.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.680]   No JavaScript except stuff we provide from our servers is
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:55.320]   allowed.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:59.000]   That is a non-starter with a majority of the world that
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.880]   says Google's an advertising company.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.000]   Look, that's what you said.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.960]   That's not what we said.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:06.480]   OK.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.560]   What we say--
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.280]   Well, how is what you say different?
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.960]   When we look at the architecture of the web,
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.280]   we see an awful lot of redundancy.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.000]   And so we took an engineering approach
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.200]   which says, how do we optimize this?
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.240]   How do we make things faster?
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.920]   And the most obvious point was, let's look
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.400]   where there's redundancy.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.400]   And there was a huge amount of redundancy,
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.960]   and it was almost entirely in JavaScript.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:31.960]   And so fine.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.400]   Let's reduce that to core functions that don't take away
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.400]   creativity.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.240]   So the approach, the slide shows.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.720]   The slideshow module in the runtime is a very basic
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:45.880]   primitive set of functions that the publisher can compose
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.000]   on top of so that they can make the slideshow look and act
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.960]   and feel the way they would like it to look, act, and feel.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:58.320]   But there's no reason to have 150,000 different approaches
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.120]   to the very core guts of a slideshow.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.960]   We can do better than that.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:07.040]   But the right answer would be to then push that into HTML
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:11.880]   itself and have a slideshow element and standardize that
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.560]   in the way the same way that we've standardized audio
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.440]   and video elements.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.680]   And so some of the pushback is that you're backing away
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.040]   from the standardized ones and putting your own ones on top
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:20.600]   of those instead.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:25.040]   So yeah, I agree a slideshow element would be a nice thing
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:25.720]   to add to HTML.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.160]   And maybe this would be a way to move towards that.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.720]   Well, and Leo, I think there's a little bit
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.360]   of a middle ground here, which I was running the other week
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.840]   and listening to this week in Google.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.000]   And hearing you talking about AMP, and you were like, oh, no,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:39.760]   this is horrible.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.120]   And so on the WebSpam team, often we
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.520]   would run across a case where we'd
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.240]   like to solve something 100%.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:49.680]   But maybe you could only solve it 80% for now.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.920]   And so if you can solve the 80% problem of people
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.720]   who have rich content but is relatively static
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.680]   with an open source approach-- because we all
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.560]   love the open web and we all really
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.560]   want to embrace the open web--
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.440]   then that can help with a ton of publishers,
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:06.200]   the Washington posts of the world and the inner times
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.120]   of the world and the nuzzles of the world.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.240]   And I take your point because you're a node.js.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:13.400]   Like, in some sense, by re-architecting your site,
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:16.280]   you've just moved toward an API-based system that's--
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.480]   I'm completely opposite what this is.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.120]   Yeah, it's the most sophisticated.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:22.520]   In some cases, it's the quarter case.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.160]   It's definitely in that 20%.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.400]   Now, there are ways where you could use a headless server
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.240]   to sort of say, well, what do 80% of the people do?
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.520]   They typically hit these 20 pages
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.800]   and you could pre-render those pages
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.480]   and you could birth them into AMP.
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.120]   And I think it's OK if AMP right now
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:41.920]   doesn't handle 100% of the cases because that's probably
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:42.680]   not the intent.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:43.600]   The intent is--
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:47.080]   As it was said yesterday, you couldn't do Gmail and AMP.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:47.360]   Right.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.880]   No, and there'll always be a Ling's Cars.com.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.760]   I understand that.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.680]   But I take your point that you may be chafing a little bit
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.360]   at Google's got to approve the JavaScript.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.200]   I think there is a little bit of a trade-off there
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.200]   because you want the JavaScript to be
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.600]   minified and small and compact and standardized
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.960]   and you don't want bad behavior to creep in.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:10.880]   I do think-- and what I've heard Richard say
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.960]   is that people are open to conversations
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.160]   about how to do better or what other new things to incorporate
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.800]   and all those sorts of things as well.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.080]   Don't mistake me.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.440]   I understand where this is coming from
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.960]   and it's coming from a good place.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.840]   And Google is very Googly.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.160]   It's very engineering-driven.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.760]   Look, there's a problem in the engineer.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.280]   We know the engineering to solve this problem.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.200]   And we're going to propose this.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.760]   But there is this also-- there's this appearance problem
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.120]   that often Google is a little tone-deaf
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.960]   to the appearance problem, I think.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.920]   And there's the appearance problem--
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.360]   by the way, Facebook and Apple have a similar appearance
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.240]   problem to their proposals in this.
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.960]   You're not alone.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.240]   And people are saying, well, no one has to do this.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.480]   But if suddenly you're--
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.720]   all of the fast modern web is amp,
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.000]   all the cool kids are amp, you're
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   at a slight disadvantage if you're not in it.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.360]   But maybe the pressure you're putting on
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.640]   is the standard body.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.160]   But I think--
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.400]   That's why I want to see it at W3C thing.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:12.520]   I feel like this needs to come from an independent standards
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.320]   body.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.800]   But Richard talked about earlier, there's an urgency here.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.120]   I understand that as well.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.800]   And that's the engineer talking.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.160]   The engineer says, we can solve--
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.280]   That's a business side.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.040]   It's a business side to the ab-blockers.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.640]   So rate of growth of ab-blockers.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.760]   And notice, by the way, when you download an app page,
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.360]   if you go to g.co/amptemow, or if you go to NUSL,
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.560]   it'll look like how New York Times were a guardian piece,
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.880]   you'll see that the content loads first,
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.720]   the text loads first, then the photos load,
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.680]   and then the ad will load.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.520]   But what you see oftentimes is a blank spot.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:41.320]   Now, at least the blank spot is now set in a set geography
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.200]   so that-- or architecture so that it doesn't
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.440]   jump bounce around.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:45.880]   But the reason is a blank spot for a while,
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.880]   is that the ad is so huge and slow and still--
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:48.680]   No, I look at the--
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.880]   I think you don't have the expression.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.960]   --of the advertising industry as well,
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.200]   maybe it also puts pressure on the standard's bodies
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.640]   to try to put up better standards.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.320]   And look at the IAB's response to ad blocking.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:03.200]   And the ad networks don't want to deal with this.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:06.040]   Their answers are very weak, to say the least.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.800]   And I understand that we've gotten ourselves into this problem.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.840]   I also understand that.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:11.160]   And I use an ad blocker.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.920]   And probably most of the people, far more than the 40%
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.200]   in Germany, who are watching and listening to the show
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.560]   use ad blockers.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:21.720]   And many of them also use no script to block rogue
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.760]   to block JavaScript.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:26.520]   They're willing to have a very reduced experience of the web
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.880]   because they don't want all that crap.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:33.600]   So to them, this would be, I'm sure, positive.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.640]   But at the same time, I think there is going to be this issue
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:44.320]   that it feels to me like a private company is saying,
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.560]   well, we got a better idea.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.040]   Let's do this.
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.720]   Well, another way to think about that, Leo,
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.200]   is think about all the stuff that Google does with Chrome.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.120]   Chrome launched because Firefox was getting a little slow
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.800]   and it's going to bring--
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.640]   and Google Fiber even.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.120]   Even if Google Fiber doesn't reach every single person
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.880]   in the United States, if it acts as a kick
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.080]   to the back of the pants of some of the broadband providers.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.840]   And even with Chrome, Google has the ability
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:14.480]   to experiment with some things and see how well they work
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.280]   and iterate really fast on that six week release cycle.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.280]   And then afterwards, once you know
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:23.400]   this is the best way to do it, then things like Speedy
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.960]   can be incorporated into HTTP 2.0.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.840]   So I totally get where you're coming from,
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.600]   that you would be worried about any private company,
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.280]   whether it's Facebook or Google, trying to say, hey,
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.200]   here's the new standard.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.680]   Everybody adhered to the standard.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.680]   Well, particularly companies that make their revenue
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.760]   from advertising.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:41.840]   Well, OK, so I think that--
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.840]   Because by the way, this blocks all ads except approved ads.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.400]   This is an ad blocker.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.080]   No, it doesn't.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.520]   Doesn't it?
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.120]   It blocks certain kinds of ads like take over--
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.920]   I hope the ads we hate to take over the pages.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   If blocks ads that use JavaScript, which
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.520]   is, I think, mostly ads now.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.240]   No, it doesn't.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:58.760]   It doesn't?
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.280]   OK.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:00.280]   Yes, it does.
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.280]   But there are paths to that.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.520]   It obviously changes how things are loaded and constructed.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.560]   But again, it's not about taking about capability.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.440]   Now, yes, we did build into the runtime
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.520]   certain restrictions with regard to ads.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.560]   But they're very basic.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.240]   And I don't think anyone would argue with them
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.360]   given the objectives of the project.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.480]   One was, yes, load the content first, the ad second.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.400]   Frankly, it'd be great if they can become
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.840]   close to simultaneous.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.760]   But one of the issues in the ecosystem today
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.760]   is there's no transparency about the performance of the ads.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.080]   You know, none at all.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.520]   I think what you've heard.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:35.200]   We also say that the ads have to communicate
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:39.400]   a predetermined size so that we can eliminate the jankiness.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.680]   And we also say that ads can't reach outside the document,
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.440]   meaning eliminate pop-ups.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.960]   OK, we've eliminated pop-ups.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.880]   Yay!
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.160]   Well, but wait a minute, because most ads also
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:54.040]   have some JavaScript associated with it.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:56.360]   That JavaScript will not be allowed to run.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:56.560]   Right.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:00.240]   Well, the point is that they're trying to box out
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.240]   a class of ads that will be allowed.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:06.400]   So if it's for it to pass the AMP validation,
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.160]   then it has to not have JavaScript in,
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.040]   apart from JavaScript that's been loaded
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.800]   secondary through the core AMP JavaScript.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.160]   Right.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:18.360]   And I'm sure all of Google's ads are compliant.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.360]   Yes, what's the other one?
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.960]   I'm not sure they're not, actually.
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:21.360]   Not, not.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:21.880]   No.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.880]   Literally, you can say.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.360]   Oh, that's good to know.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.480]   But there are two.
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:29.800]   I mean, the idea is there's no restrictions or demands
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.600]   that people use are ad technology or anyone
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.360]   specific ad technology.
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.920]   We're adding more ad networks.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.800]   You're supporting AMP every day.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.320]   All right.
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:43.320]   Clearly, the ad industry has to evolve its own sense
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:47.160]   of how to create and deliver compelling advertising.
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:51.480]   If AMP did nothing else but that, we should celebrate it.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:55.760]   And I think, Leo, the fact that Google's doing this
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.560]   in an open path means they've got to listen to the feedback
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.560]   they get.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:03.400]   And to me, the art of this, in terms of the trust question,
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:04.800]   I see two parts of this.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.720]   There's a need for leadership that simply was not
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.080]   being provided by media, because we're the ones who--
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.800]   we advertise as the ones who messed up the web.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:11.720]   Absolutely.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.840]   And that leadership was necessary.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:13.880]   Google stepped up fine.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:14.400]   OK.
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:15.720]   So the next question is governance.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.120]   And yes, it says that get up right now that it will be open
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:19.560]   and so forth and so forth and so forth.
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:20.400]   So far, yes, you're right.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.400]   It is Google with consultation.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.840]   So the art of this, to me, is how governance is opened up.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:29.720]   Two active participating publishers.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.280]   Now, the next part of this is--
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.320]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.800]   --is just record publishers.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.720]   It's also going to be Africa and South America,
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.400]   and places like that as well.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.600]   Look, that--
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.320]   in the case of governance, that is there today.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.520]   But keep in mind with regard to any project like this,
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:48.240]   the true governance lies in the balance
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:51.240]   between satisfying the needs and desires
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.280]   of the collective group and those who
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.080]   are leading that collective group.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.400]   And so, yes, it's up to us, if we're
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.200]   going to play that leadership role,
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:02.960]   to prove our ability to be trusted every day.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:07.040]   And I think that's what's happening in the project today.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.960]   And obviously, we'll look to continue that.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:13.200]   But to suggest, it is absolutely not
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:18.560]   the case that there has not been, say, heavy participation
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.400]   in terms of the crafting of the spec,
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:24.120]   in terms of contributions of code for that matter.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.680]   So Leo, your site supports it.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.120]   Do you know your personal site?
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.200]   Well, with known site does, because known does.
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:29.700]   Yes.
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:30.880]   It's not as important as yet.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:33.080]   But my Squarespace site does not yet.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.960]   And certainly our own Twitch site,
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.840]   which is really the only site I care about it.
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.800]   At this point, it does not.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.560]   And we'll never, as far as I know,
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:43.040]   support it because of the way we've architected it.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.320]   But you can still build that fast.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.120]   As fast as you can.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:46.840]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:47.480]   It'll be potentially--
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.360]   I just spent a quarter of a million dollars in this site.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.320]   I'm not spending--
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.320]   But what I was saying is, you're not going to wait--
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.680]   I would not have to be with that.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:56.280]   But we're not a tech site either.
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.760]   I mean, we're not about tech.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.520]   So go ahead, Richard.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:01.120]   Well, I was going to say, one thing about the way
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.960]   the approach that we took to this,
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:10.200]   it allows really for gradual adoption and experimentation.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.240]   We didn't go out there and say, here's
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.680]   an entirely new approach for building your websites.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.000]   We build them all now.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   We didn't do that.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.880]   I mean, you could accomplish that with AMP as it evolves.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.320]   But that's not what we said.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.680]   We said is, here's an approach for you
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:31.120]   to offer alternate, very fast, mobile-friendly pages.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.240]   So take your current article pages
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:37.160]   and spawn an AMP version of that page.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.000]   Not particularly hard to do.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.680]   We've seen companies who have very meager technical staffs
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:46.680]   handcraft this into their CMS systems in a matter of days.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:50.000]   WordPress has plug-ins available now.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.640]   It's not hard to go down this path and at least experiment
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.480]   and learn and conclude from there.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.080]   I think it's very important that people
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.760]   have that opportunity to, in a sense,
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.360]   gradually adopt an experiment.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:07.800]   Sounds like-- it sounds like WAP to me.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.720]   But I don't want to go there.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.280]   Let's take a break, as I have to do an ad.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.200]   And you know what?
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.160]   If you want to block it, go right ahead.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:19.240]   We're talking to Richard-- it's really nice to have you.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:19.840]   Thank you, Richard.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:21.240]   And I don't mean to be challenging,
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:23.280]   but I think these are questions that our audience and others
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.640]   listening will want to ask you.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.080]   So I'm going to try to represent them.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.320]   Richard Jingris is here, head of news at Google.
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:32.400]   We're talking about the New Google AMP initiative.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:37.400]   Also nicely snuck in Mr. Matt Cutts from Google.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.880]   We're great to have you, too, Matt.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.480]   It's always nice to see you.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.440]   Jeff Jarvis is sitting next to him.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:44.000]   They're on the love seat together.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:48.160]   Aw.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.800]   Somewhere in the Googleplex and Kevin Marks.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.480]   He's at Mozilla right now.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.920]   So this is-- I feel like we've-- this is a big table.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.880]   It's good to have you all here.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.480]   Our show is brought to you by Zip Recruiter
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:03.560]   if you're in the unenviable position of hiring for your company.
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.480]   You know what?
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.720]   It may not be the fun position, but it may be the most important
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:08.880]   person in that company.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:11.240]   Because what is a company, but its employees,
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.720]   hiring the right employee can make your company
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.080]   hiring the wrong employee.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.440]   Well, we all know what that's like.
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.880]   You don't want to do it.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:22.280]   So let me tell you, Zip Recruiter makes this easy.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.000]   First of all, finding the right person
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.360]   means finding the right site.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:28.080]   Zip Recruiter posts to 100 plus job sites
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:31.600]   and all the social networks with a single click of the mouse.
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:32.960]   So that means you're going to reach out
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:36.600]   to the largest possible set of candidates.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:40.400]   It also has-- they have 6 million current resumes
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:41.560]   on their site.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.360]   So you will immediately-- within 24 hours,
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.080]   you're going to get matches instantly.
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:45.640]   And don't worry.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:46.480]   They're not calling you.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.440]   They're not emailing you.
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.640]   They're all flowing into the Zip Recruiter interface,
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:53.640]   which makes it very easy to screen candidates,
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:56.000]   just eliminate candidates you don't want,
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.160]   rank the candidates, and find the right one fast.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:01.320]   No wonder more than 400,000 businesses
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.560]   have been using Zip Recruiter to do their hiring.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:04.680]   Get the right person fast.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:09.000]   We got an email from Dan, a happy Zip Recruiter client.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.760]   He said, the hardest part is a quote.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.720]   The hardest part about running a business
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.080]   when you need to hire is you need to spend extra time
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.800]   recruiting precisely when you're short staffed.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.320]   But with Zip Recruiter, I have gotten quality candidates
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.480]   within 24 hours of posting a job.
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:26.520]   Zip Recruiter's website makes this process so much faster
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.920]   by letting me manage candidates in one place.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:29.520]   It's fast.
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.080]   It's easy.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.320]   It's effective.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.800]   It's how you hire the right person.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:38.960]   And I want you to try it free right now at zipprecruiter.com/twig.
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:43.400]   Four days free, ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:47.160]   We're very happy to have them as part of our show.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:51.720]   Great sponsors, ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.360]   All right, I take back that WAP comment.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:54.240]   That was just mean.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:57.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:00.440]   I'm not old enough to remember that.
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.680]   Oh, please.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.560]   You were doing teletext, my friend.
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:10.160]   I told Jeff and Kevin, I'm going to sit back
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.480]   and let you guys take this.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:13.920]   And I'm sorry that a guy intruded myself.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.440]   But--
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:16.680]   But you just channeled the public.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:18.800]   I'm channeling the frustrated public,
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.440]   trying to figure out what the hell this means.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:22.360]   What does it mean to somebody--
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.800]   I'll ask this if Kevin, what does something like this mean
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.040]   to somebody like me?
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:28.800]   What we built was a headless website.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.880]   It has Drupal as the CMS, but that's not visible to the public.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:36.200]   That's merely serving an API that is node.js.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:40.280]   The website is node.js that pulls from Drupal using the API.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:43.200]   It's a consumer, just like our apps are going to be consumers.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:48.120]   In fact, there are three now Apple TV apps that consume the data
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.640]   from the Drupal backend.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:53.080]   How-- Kevin, could I make an app site?
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.080]   Or do I have to throw out my node code?
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:59.760]   Oh, you're muted.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:02.440]   I know you're saying pearls of wisdom, but I only see--
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.240]   Sorry, I muted myself because I was typing,
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:07.320]   and I'm using this computer mic.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:10.240]   So what you would do is you would--
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.240]   you've got a templating system on your website somewhere.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.920]   You want templates that are being generated by something--
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:15.880]   By SAS?
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.640]   Yep.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:17.840]   In node, yeah.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:20.240]   So you would generate a parallel template that
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:25.760]   is the AMP version for each of your pages that would have less
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:26.760]   JavaScript in it.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:27.600]   That's easy.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:28.840]   And follow the spec.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:30.880]   I did it with what--
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:33.200]   Because we're allowed to run JavaScript server side.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.760]   I mean, node is a server side solution.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:35.600]   Yeah, yeah, quite.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:38.160]   So we're allowed to run any arbitrary scripting on our side.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.000]   It's really the client that can't.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.880]   Yeah, you're not going to get blocked in any way.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:44.200]   No, I understand.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:45.200]   The only--
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.200]   But there's a kind of blocking.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:52.000]   If some sites are clean and fast and amped and shiny and new,
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.480]   and then some sites are like the old web, there's a--
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.600]   What exists today?
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.480]   I asked-- I asked--
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:57.480]   I asked--
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.200]   Let's go back to a very basic point,
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.880]   because I started this really entirely about how do we
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:06.160]   create a healthy ecosystem for publishers, right?
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.080]   And it wind back from there.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.240]   So when we talk about that, you say,
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.920]   this isn't about shiny new way pages.
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.560]   This isn't like making pages fast.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.060]   Right?
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:16.600]   Yes, you mentioned earlier, I go back
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.760]   to the days of steam-powered modems and broadcast books.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.320]   I remember someone asking me back then,
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.760]   because we could adjust this stuff.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:28.200]   What's the ideal access time for a piece of content?
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.480]   And the answer is quite simple.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.360]   It's instantaneous, because anything less than instantaneous
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.400]   simply degrades engagement.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.400]   Yes.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.200]   So when I look at the ecosystem, and when I look at the need
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.440]   for publishers to drive engagement,
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.120]   to have their content be more readily available on all kinds
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.800]   of platforms such that they can drive and gator
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:51.280]   from their content, I just fail to see the negatives
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.800]   in the approach to that or the benefits to that.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.280]   Here's the moral hazard that does exist.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.200]   And Richard was asked this at the product announcement
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.240]   in New York.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:05.560]   Will Google favor AMP or other content?
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.760]   And the answer was no.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.280]   Good.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.880]   But Google already favors fast overslurp.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.380]   Right.
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:10.880]   Period.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:11.720]   Right.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:17.560]   So the issue there is that works wonderfully until the day
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.080]   when-- let's say the way you game this,
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.880]   because we have the king of understanding games here.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.920]   The way to game this is that suddenly spam becomes
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.640]   the lightest content on the web, the fastest lightest
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:27.480]   content on the web.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:32.320]   Well, if that yields bad search results with fast crap
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:35.440]   preceding slower quality, then search
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.320]   won't work anymore.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.000]   That would be an issue for Google at that point.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:38.520]   Right.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.640]   And in our looking, we tend to use speed
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.160]   as a second order effect, because we
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.920]   want to return the results that people most want.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.600]   And so as you're approaching that hockey puck,
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.680]   you're moving towards the ideal page.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.720]   The ideal page would also be fast.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.560]   And so just being fast alone won't
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.360]   help you rank above other people.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.600]   But if you have every other thing doing really, really well,
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.160]   plus your fast, all of the things being equal,
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.600]   then, yeah, people would be happier to get that content
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:04.960]   faster.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.760]   And so I think it's OK that that would rank a little bit
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:08.520]   higher as well.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.840]   But it seems to be fast.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.240]   I'm going to have to wrap in a few minutes.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:14.080]   OK.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:19.080]   And I thought I'd offer at least a closing comment here.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:25.000]   I take the expression of concerns to heart.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.320]   And I take the expression that Google
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.480]   has to be a trusted player in this regard to heart.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:32.960]   And I believe we'll do so.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.040]   I do think that it's also important
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.240]   to understand that when it comes to the publishing ecosystem
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.760]   in Google, Google is one of the unique companies that actually
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:46.920]   shares a very common objective with these companies today.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.560]   Google's objective and need, frankly,
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.240]   is for an open and rich ecosystem of knowledge.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.760]   If that's not there, then, frankly, products
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.120]   like Google Search aren't terribly relevant when
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.840]   you get right down to it.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.400]   That's why this is an important issue for us,
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.920]   if you want to look at it in terms of our direct self-interest.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.800]   But that's also the same objective of a publisher today.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.960]   Because if they don't have access to an open ecosystem
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.120]   for distribution, if they have to basically go
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.560]   through proprietary platforms to find opportunities
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.920]   to build audiences, then they will have lost.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.920]   So we have that common objective.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.160]   How do we take and make sure the worldwide web remains
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.760]   that vibrant, open ecosystem of knowledge that benefits all?
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.280]   And that's how we're approaching this.
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.120]   And yes, we're a private company.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.440]   We have business interests.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.760]   But I do think that that philosophy and that core
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.520]   similar objective is something that's very important
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.920]   to considering our role in this.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.800]   Well said.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.760]   Thank you, Richard.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:53.760]   Thank you.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:54.360]   I can't admit it.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.320]   It's been a pleasure.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.640]   I wish I could spend more time, but I keep getting
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.000]   pinged on late for something else.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:03:59.720]   OK.
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:00.360]   No, that's great.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.640]   We're really glad we could talk to you.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.840]   Thank you, Richard.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.360]   Thank you.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.040]   Richard Jengris, he's head of news at Google
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.440]   and one of the people behind the AMP initiative, which
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.880]   is exactly what we have been talking about.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:10.880]   Thank you, Richard.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.720]   Yeah, we appreciate it.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.080]   I think I think I can convince--
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.360]   I know Kevin has to go too, but I think we can convince Matt
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.400]   to stick around a little longer.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:16.720]   Good.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:17.280]   Thank God.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.360]   Because you and me would be boring.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.160]   That sounds good.
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.440]   Kevin, you have a little more time or do you want to take off?
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.760]   I'll hang on a couple of minutes, sure.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.000]   All right.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.840]   I think it's a good conversation.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.200]   And I'm really glad you were here, Kevin,
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.000]   because I know that--
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.480]   so he's talking about trust.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.840]   I trust Kevin Marks to represent the best interests
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.480]   of open standards of an open web, a free flowing open web,
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.480]   that were at SQL to all.
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:48.000]   So I look to you, Kevin, for leadership from you
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.920]   on this regard.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.880]   So the thing I was saying about is
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.680]   you would have to create a parallel template
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:58.240]   for your site for this, which means that it's not necessarily
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.400]   much work, but it adds to maintenance for your site.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.840]   And then the other problem is to support the Apple therein
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.320]   of where you've got to create these.
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.320]   And then another one.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.200]   That's another one.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:07.880]   And Facebook.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.800]   And support the Facebook one.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.840]   That's another one.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.360]   And suddenly, it feels like browser wars again.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.840]   It's like, I've got to create a page for each browser.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.080]   Because these things are affected,
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.120]   because they're restricted subsets of HTML,
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.240]   they're effectively browsers with different support
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:21.760]   standards.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.200]   And that's the piece that makes it a bit awkward.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:30.920]   And as usual, there's always an XKCD gloss on this.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:32.520]   How standards proliferate?
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.960]   Situation.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.760]   There are 14 competing standards.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.240]   14, ridiculous.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.000]   We need to develop one universal standard that covers everyone's
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:40.720]   use cases.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.640]   Situation.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:46.640]   There are 15 competing standards.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.160]   And that's another thing that worries me.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.760]   That's why I understand standards bodies move slowly.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.400]   They're highly politicized organizations.
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:58.280]   They probably don't come up with the best engineering solution.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.480]   And Google is all about the best engineering.
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.160]   Sometimes they do.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.720]   I mean, I think that's a little unfair.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.920]   But the thing is, they converge more slowly over time
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.600]   is the issue.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.040]   I'm at a W3C working group at the moment
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.680]   where we're trying to work on social standardization, which
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.120]   is one of those.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.520]   Get back to what, Kevin?
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:17.240]   If you should believe them.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.200]   But do you agree, Kevin, that maybe this
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.160]   would be most appropriate?
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.640]   Wouldn't it be great if Facebook
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:27.200]   Apple and Google would hand this all over to the W3C,
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.440]   which then could say, good.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:33.280]   We were going to look at the best case, best usage scenarios.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.800]   All right, here's the standard.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.480]   Now we've got a standard, one standard
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.440]   that everybody can adhere to.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.080]   Wouldn't that be better?
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.240]   Well, that's what we call it.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.480]   But that's what HTML5 is.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.720]   It's what kind of year.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.560]   And the problem is that people then find a loophole in that,
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.080]   which is they inject terabytes of JavaScript into their pages.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.920]   Well, OK, so there's a lot of bad actors out there,
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.000]   most of them advertising companies.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.680]   Well, like everybody else, when we got back cuts here,
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.160]   it's a system that if it can be game, it will be game.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:03.640]   Right?
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.680]   There's always bad actors.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:09.440]   And so I think trying to find that 80% solution that cuts
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.960]   out most of the bad actors or the bad practices,
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.240]   and then, yes, there will be new problems
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.960]   that result as a result of that.
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.320]   But over time, the web gets faster,
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:22.040]   the web gets better, or the search results get more relevant.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.840]   Whether it's still stop getting them out,
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:24.840]   where it's all on their browser.
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:25.960]   And the market votes, right?
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.960]   This is the chance for the market to say,
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.080]   good, we want fast pages.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:30.680]   Yep.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.840]   Yeah, and also people--
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.480]   I don't want to-- because Kevin's right in their offices,
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.040]   and I love them, and there's a lot of great people there.
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:40.680]   But Firefox got kind of bloated because everybody
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.960]   threw everything in.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.720]   Well, Quill, let's not forget, was a response
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:47.520]   to what was primed and operated as an open standard.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.800]   That didn't work that well.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.720]   But the market voted.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.400]   And Firefox responded.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.400]   And in fact, now it's much, much faster.
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.960]   But that's why it's a good thing.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:59.480]   So I don't know that this is why I think
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:04.040]   that the key to me about AMP is the sooner Google can
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:07.680]   visibly demonstrably open up the governance,
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.000]   the better it is for the adoption.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.640]   But again, I'm going to repeat one more time.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.680]   Right now, listen, this was coincident
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.720]   to be able to do this with news publishers.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.680]   AMP's not about news at all.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.120]   AMP's about a faster web.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.320]   So there's tens of other interests out there
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:24.280]   that publishers are not going to be a good representative for.
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:26.600]   Well, it's not just faster web, particularly for mobile,
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.080]   right?
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:30.240]   But OK, so thank you with known.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:35.880]   Thank you to Aaron and Ben, who made a very nice site,
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.720]   and I use with known as one of my content management systems.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:39.960]   This is my page.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.760]   This is my page unknown.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:45.760]   This is my page on AMP.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.360]   It's aesthetically not quite as nice.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.280]   Now, is that-- I guess that's their fault.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:52.680]   They could have better templates.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.640]   Well, it's just constrained so on what AMP is trying to do.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.880]   So they took out the background image,
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.440]   because you're trying to make it a leaner.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.000]   That's that's part of the point.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.360]   Yeah, OK.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.920]   That's my AMP's fault.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.960]   OK.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.800]   But if you give me the choice between that,
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.760]   my original site and the AMP version of it,
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:12.920]   I'm going to choose this site.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.120]   And I don't think it's that much leaner.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:19.080]   Well, maybe, but if you're on a desktop with a fast--
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.080]   well, I'm probably connected to you.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:20.320]   I've been on mobile.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.000]   It's not, right?
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.680]   But if you're on 2G or 3G, it can be kind of helpful.
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.600]   And it costs people-- here's the other thing.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.800]   It costs people money.
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:34.120]   You're downloading 2 to 10 megs for 8K, but an 8EK will do.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.760]   But not an 8D is pretty lean to be fair.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.400]   But yeah.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.880]   Another part of the country, not whether it's the world,
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:43.600]   in Africa and in Latin America and in parts of Asia,
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.360]   that's a real, real issue.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:50.400]   And it cuts people out of the information
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.880]   and the substance is actually there.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.000]   Well, and Leo, I'll just take a second
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   to talk a little bit of smack about Google, which is--
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.160]   I'll try, which is--
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:00.720]   You can't.
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.640]   You love Google.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.320]   And you know what?
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.520]   It's hard for me to talk smack about Google, too.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:07.200]   No, you do a very good job in the name of the public.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.160]   OK, so let me try.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.880]   I think in internal discussions, there's
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.840]   room to roll out one web-wide standard a year or so.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:18.440]   It's no follow or whatever.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.320]   And there have been complex things
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.880]   in the past, like escape fragment,
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:24.320]   where you want to be able to crawl JavaScript.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.320]   Back before Google could process JavaScript,
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:29.560]   we had these pretty complex ways where people could say,
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.520]   run your headless server and use escape fragment.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.640]   And we finally got rid of most of that,
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.080]   because Google's good enough to be
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.000]   able to process and execute the JavaScript now.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.480]   So it's always tricky.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.640]   I think Google does have the best of intentions.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.760]   And I think you probably saw Richard getting a little earnest
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.360]   because he's like, no, we're trying to help.
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.760]   We're trying to make things better.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.600]   And I take the point that Google doesn't always
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.120]   appear that way from the outside.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.680]   And sometimes people see things that are going on in YouTube
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.640]   or DMCA complaints or stuff.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.960]   And of course, they're worried about Google
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.760]   and whether it's too large or whether it's not
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.320]   executing on things the way it can.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:10.400]   But I think one thing that's a good indicator, a good
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:14.520]   witness test, is how well does Google execute and iterate
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.760]   based on feedback?
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.800]   And so at this point, when we get the feedback on how to
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:22.240]   improve things, I think that will be a critical thing.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.760]   And no matter how well our heart is in the right place, I
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.040]   would love if we could find representative people from
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.800]   across the web who could then say, look, we are going to have
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.120]   the web's best interest in mind.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.320]   And we're going to say, this JavaScript is fine or it's
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.960]   really efficient.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.040]   But here's this practice or here's this set of JavaScript
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.240]   which can do really annoying, really slow things.
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:44.800]   And we're just going to allow that.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.760]   And in my mind, it doesn't have to be Google that makes
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.400]   those decisions.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:51.320]   If you can find more people with the web's best interest at
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.600]   heart, that's even better.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:56.120]   Well, and we've said this a lot before.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:00.080]   Google needs to get better at communicating so that we
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:00.800]   understand it.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.040]   It's good intentions.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.640]   And what doesn't work-- and I don't think Richard was
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.280]   doing this effect.
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.720]   I think Richard is a good person to speak for Google, as
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:11.600]   are you, obviously, Matt-- is what doesn't serve, though, is
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.640]   a hand-waving saying, no, no, no, no, just trust us.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.120]   It's fine.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.040]   What we're doing is in the web's best interest.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.120]   You can't do the hand-waving.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:22.880]   If this is going to work-- and I want it to, I think
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.120]   AMP is a great idea.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.880]   It's going to take a lot of effort.
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.880]   And I think Richard was very much aware of this.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:32.560]   A lot of effort and outreach and communication.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.960]   Well, before that, I saw that Lee on the last two weeks at
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.520]   Newsguys, where there were a lot of publishers there.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.720]   There was a lot of confusion about it.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:42.120]   Number one, number two, somebody I know was off the record.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:46.280]   So somebody I know who was there told me today, I don't
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:49.840]   know if I need to worry about this for a year.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.680]   And then when he heard the full explanation, this time
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.440]   around, he said to me this morning, oh, there
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.640]   are no, I've got to pay attention to this right now.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:58.320]   And I get it.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.840]   And I understand why it's important.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.160]   So that communication is critical.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.040]   The openness is critical.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.160]   The other thing that has to happen is that the valley
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.600]   itself has to get its act together.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.360]   Because the valley is seen as a monolithic enemy in places
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.560]   like Germany.
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:13.360]   And your regulator's there.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:17.160]   And so it does not serve them well for Facebook and Apple
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.240]   and Google to be separate.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.520]   So part of Newsguys is we said we publishers should
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.400]   convene a meeting where we invite the top platforms
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.160]   in, and we raise these issues.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.960]   And we take a role of leadership here.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.240]   Because what's happening is Google stepped into a vacuum.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.240]   And it's a vacuum that we allowed, and we published it
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:37.880]   in fact, pause, because we weren't fixing the web.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.480]   We broke the web.
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:43.560]   And we helped advertisers break the web.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.600]   So we've got to take a leadership role in this.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.480]   And that's very Pollyanna of me I know.
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:51.240]   But I'm going up the road to that other place tomorrow.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.320]   And that's my message is we've got to build bridges not only
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.880]   between East Coast and West Coast, Europe and the US,
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.480]   publishing and technology.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:03.680]   There'd be bridges among the technology companies too.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.480]   Agreed.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.520]   Maybe I'm going to do now.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.360]   Is this Matt?
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.920]   I'm in here and I'm snuck in.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:12.600]   I'm going to go walking around looking over all the cubicles
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.920]   and see if I can see anybody dog food mixes.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:19.040]   Talk funny what?
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.600]   Coming out people.
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:24.200]   So on the other hand, isn't it?
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:24.700]   Great.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:27.880]   The Google says, oh, we found this little manufacturing issue.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.280]   Or I have no idea what.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:30.280]   I don't know what I'm going to say.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.160]   But they want to make sure it's right.
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:33.840]   And they're not going to give you
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.120]   the USBC cables that are--
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.040]   I know.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.360]   I like that guy.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:41.440]   Man, the king of USBC, the Google
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.440]   engineer who's writing reviews on all of the bad cables.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:48.080]   So when do we get the Pixel C, Matt?
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.120]   Well, they said by the end of the year,
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:53.080]   but I would rather have to prioritize the scene right
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.080]   and take it as well.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.080]   It's true.
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.080]   I want it.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.080]   I want it.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.080]   Tell us.
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.320]   Because it's coming close to the holiday.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.360]   I'm budgeted for it.
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:02.360]   OK.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:07.800]   So I'm going to get that in here while I'm inside.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.560]   And thank you, Kevin Marks, for doing the metrics
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.880]   on my known site.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.000]   And the problem I gather is that giant won something megabyte
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.360]   image, background image on this site.
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.840]   The weird thing was the ambushing
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.120]   seemed to be loading more slowly for me.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:21.640]   So--
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:22.640]   Oh, great.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.720]   Well, I should send them a bug report there.
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:29.160]   Well, and thanks to Ben Wordmiller and Aaron Joe Richie,
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.760]   who do a great job at known.
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:34.120]   And the fact-- I didn't even know that known as AMP-enabled
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:35.040]   is pretty impressive.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.200]   I think that's great.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.720]   Here's an example, though, of how the world maybe
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:43.360]   misunderstands Google and why this is a difficult communications
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.120]   issue.
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.840]   The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which I support and believe
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:52.360]   in, but I totally disagree with this,
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:55.960]   says Google is deceptively tracking students' internet
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.600]   browsing.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:01.000]   And not only that, they send it to the FDC, the Federal Trade
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.120]   Commission.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:05.560]   Well, I don't understand what the story part is.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.720]   Because we do it through Google, track is a mere work.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:11.520]   They record what all of us research for.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:14.040]   Well, apparently there's a student privacy pledge,
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:17.240]   which is a legally enforceable document Google agreed to.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.360]   Of course, there's a lot of Google in schools, right?
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:23.360]   Where Google promises to not collect, use, or share
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.120]   students' personal information except when needed
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.400]   for legitimate educational purposes or with parental permission.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:32.880]   But according to the EFF, Google Minds students browsing data
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.360]   and other information and uses it for the company's own purposes.
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:43.800]   And of course, that own purposes is dark intent, right?
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.760]   It sounds bad in the same way that it's bad.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:49.480]   Anytime you read terms of use, the one thing you say is,
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:51.560]   I read that blog post and I have to admit,
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.160]   I didn't quite get what the complaint was.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:57.160]   But if you go and you click on the FTC complaint,
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.240]   it's a little more clear.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.480]   They say, one, two, and three.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.840]   Now, one of them, the middle one, was they didn't
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:06.840]   like that Chrome Sync was turned on on Chromebooks.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.720]   I think maybe by default for education.
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.840]   And I don't know whether that's true or not.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:13.160]   But to me, the whole point of Chromebooks
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.400]   is that they're fungible.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.440]   And so you want Chrome Sync turned on.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.720]   And if the kid spills high C over his keyboard,
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.800]   he needs to be able to pick up another Chromebook
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.120]   and carry on with his project.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.640]   So that's not tracking.
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.280]   That's the feature.
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.400]   That's the value.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.480]   Well, and I love the EFF.
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.280]   And full disclosure, I'm actually doing some fundraising
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.040]   for the EFF.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.560]   Yeah, and I'm a monthly donor.
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.160]   I love the EFF.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.160]   Yeah, they're fantastic.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.040]   So definitely we'll read through the complaint.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.320]   And if there was something inadvertent or something
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:45.680]   that--
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:49.600]   Their issue is that Chrome Sync stores on Google servers
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.560]   the entire browsing history.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.440]   But I agree with you.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:57.440]   That's also a critical feature to using a Chromebook.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.680]   In any is that you can--
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:17:59.720]   I love the EFF, too.
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:00.220]   Yeah.
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:02.480]   To present this as if there was some exception
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.360]   to how they were treating young people,
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.080]   and they were doing this for nefarious ends.
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.240]   But this is what Chrome does.
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.960]   Now, if that's not compatible, and if there's an issue there,
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.760]   then explore where the harm is and what to do about it.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:14.880]   And I just think--
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.280]   I haven't read it all yet.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:16.640]   Almost--
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.720]   Well, they also say part of the problem
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:19.760]   is that it's on by default.
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.920]   But there's even a problem because a school administrator
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:28.120]   could turn it on even if it were off by default.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.920]   And so that would be a problem.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:33.320]   Should school administrators term Chrome Sync on Google
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.760]   could then recommence collecting
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.760]   student personal information?
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.760]   I don't think there's any technology
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.920]   you could put in a school, an iPad or a Chromebook,
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:44.360]   or a Windows or a Mac, that isn't going to, in some form
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.840]   or fashion, do this.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.560]   I'm sure Google can respond to this, and will respond to it.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.120]   This is how Chrome OS operates.
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.040]   But I could see where--
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.960]   yeah, I could see where this is--
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.440]   a little-- maybe a little frustrating for Google,
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:04.000]   because this is kind of part of the Chrome.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.280]   Well, it is the Chromebook philosophy
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:10.000]   to be able to be on any Chromebook you go to.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.920]   And far, for me, to speculate on any kind of legal stuff,
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:17.400]   certainly once you have the interaction of syncing
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:22.120]   and Chrome with Google Apps or Google Apps for Education
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.280]   or something special for kids who are under 18 or something
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.120]   like that, maybe it's just the case
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.240]   that policies like the administrators
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:33.280]   should have the ability to turn on whatever they want,
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:36.080]   do or don't account for whatever this pledge was
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:36.920]   or something like that.
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.200]   So I love the EFF.
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.680]   I'm glad that they brought it up.
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:42.280]   I don't know whether they brought it up with Google
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:44.360]   before they filed with the FTC.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.040]   But they're always fighting for what they think is wrong.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:50.600]   And a lot of times, people feel like, oh, the EFF
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:54.000]   is always pro-internet or pro-Google.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.080]   I don't feel that way.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.120]   I'm glad that they--
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.160]   the occasional hand that--
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.640]   The clear solution of this is have
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.640]   some sort of escrow, third-party escrow
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.320]   to store the sync date instead of Google.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.480]   I think it's a show title.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.920]   The hand that loves them.
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.680]   The hand that loves them.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.720]   Hold stop there.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.360]   We should just go home now.
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.280]   We've got to go on that.
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.160]   We all love you.
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.400]   Matt, have you gotten your Google Fi Lego?
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:19.680]   Or did you turn on Google Fi?
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.920]   Because last time we talked, you were in the--
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.160]   you weren't sure.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.800]   Google Fi, I have the Nexus 5X.
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:28.640]   And I was just looking at Jeff's because he's
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.920]   got the Nexus 6B.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.720]   And I want to know, how does it feel?
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.320]   So I was checking it out.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.840]   I like the 6B.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.520]   It seems awfully nice.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.120]   So it is.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.120]   I don't like it.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:39.640]   It is.
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:42.360]   Battery life's a little bit better too.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.480]   So Google Fi is wonderful.
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:46.200]   I love the Lego--
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.600]   That's what I was going to ask you about.
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.240]   Did you get your Lego kit yet?
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.880]   I didn't.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:51.400]   No.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:52.400]   I'm waiting.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.600]   You might be able to buy it through Google Fi,
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:55.680]   buy the phone through Google Fi.
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.120]   Oh, oh.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.560]   It's confusing.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.400]   It says, if you ordered your sim or a phone
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:05.120]   with a sim on November 9th or later,
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.280]   I think that's a mistake.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.000]   I think-- or you ordered it earlier,
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.080]   but activated by November 19th, you're covered.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:14.320]   So you couldn't use Google Fi unless you either
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:19.160]   got a phone from Google Fi or a sim from Google Fi.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.160]   So I think we're all going to get it,
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:22.800]   is what I'm going to say.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.960]   It is a project-fi Lego kit that you build
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:30.120]   and you get a stand, a charging stand.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.040]   Next I'm going to the swag store.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.360]   I'm hoping they have a few extras in there.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.680]   You didn't turn on the Fi, Jeff.
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:37.920]   Turn on, no.
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:38.920]   I know.
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:42.040]   As of this, the AT&T, AT&T is increasing its cost
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.200]   for the unlimited from $30 to $35.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.480]   And as the story said about it, it's still a good deal.
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:49.080]   I like Fi.
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:52.720]   I've been saving a lot of money on Fi.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.600]   But I want to get--
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:55.480]   I think I have to read the--
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:57.800]   I think Pocket Now, which is the article I'm reading for,
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.080]   got the verbiage wrong.
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:03.240]   It sounds like as long as you activate it by November 19,
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.240]   you're going to get it.
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:07.040]   It's only people who activate it after that point
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:10.200]   was what makes sense to me who won't get it.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.480]   So I think--
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:13.160]   Of course I'm concerned, the Project 5 people
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.480]   should send you all Lego kits.
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.880]   No, no, no.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.080]   But I do--
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.560]   I know more string pulling.
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.080]   You've already done too much for us, Matt.
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.320]   You got us invitations.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:23.120]   And by the way, I want to thank Matt Cutz
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:26.440]   because you also helped us solve our Google Search problem.
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.920]   We did a dumb thing with a wild card
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.440]   that you discovered.
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:35.600]   And the Search team discovered, and we thank you
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:36.440]   because we got that fixed.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:39.360]   And it's nice to have friends in high places.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:42.240]   Well, it's funny because Barry Schwartz was on.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.680]   So everybody was looking at the Webmaster console.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.680]   That's so funny.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.680]   That's so funny.
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.680]   We can make this offline.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.480]   That's OK.
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:48.960]   I love it.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:51.880]   That's awesome.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:52.640]   Google is going to do--
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.800]   I think we probably have about 10, 12 minutes or so.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.040]   Oh, we're wrapping up.
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.040]   We'll do a couple of fast ones.
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.240]   The Santa Tracker is up.
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.200]   Google is doing this again.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.600]   This year, they have a really fun page.
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:07.520]   21 days, 10 hours, 53 minutes and 10 seconds for Santa
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.400]   to arrive.
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.160]   And they did this last year.
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:12.920]   Looks like a lot of new games and fun in here.
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:16.280]   And then, of course, you can track Santa on Christmas Eve.
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.040]   That is Santa Tracker.Google.com.
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:22.040]   This site was redesigned entirely using Polymer.
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.080]   Oh, nice.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.120]   And probably AMP enabled, right?
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.560]   The answer is not AMP ready.
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.920]   No, Polymer-- yeah, I don't know.
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:28.420]   I don't think so.
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:31.360]   I think it's Polymer rather than AMP.
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.040]   Don't do this on mobile, kids.
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.840]   Mom and Dad will get pissed off.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:36.560]   That is true, Santa.
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.080]   No, they didn't.
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:38.840]   Don't start this.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.000]   Did we mention the Verizon?
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:40.240]   We did.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.960]   We mentioned the Verizon.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.000]   Are you leaving, Kevin?
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:43.800]   I'm going to head out now.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:45.760]   But thanks for having me on.
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:46.880]   That was an interesting conversation.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:48.000]   So glad we could get you here.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.600]   Thank you, Kevin Marks.
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:53.200]   And indiewebcamp.com, find out about the next Indie Web Camp.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.480]   Indie Web-- next Indie Web Camp is tomorrow in San Francisco.
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.800]   Good Lord.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.920]   We're having a-- we're combining it
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.200]   with the social working group day,
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.480]   because a bunch of people are coming in for that anyway.
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.880]   And tonight, there's Henry Wedside Club in Portland
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:11.000]   and San Francisco, the Brighton and Swedish ones
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.600]   have already happened.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:13.640]   Thank you, Kevin Marks.
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:16.440]   Kevin Marks.com, indiewebcamp.com.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:16.840]   Bye.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.760]   Great to see you.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:21.280]   By the way, another way that Google is speeding things up.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.760]   Chrome for Android, you can turn on a new feature that
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.720]   will just skip images.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:27.640]   And you know what?
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:31.080]   It saves 70%.
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:32.400]   So-- and I'm not making that enough.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:35.400]   Congratulations to Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:37.440]   As I think everybody knows, by now, certainly anybody
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:40.280]   on Facebook, you couldn't get away from it on Facebook yesterday.
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:44.040]   Had a baby Max on Tuesday?
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:48.960]   And I hope Max learns to read, because Mark wrote her
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:54.480]   an extremely long letter, which he posted on Facebook.
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.880]   And in fact, he buried the lead, which
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:00.840]   is that Priscilla and Mark are going to give away--
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:01.840]   Sorry, Kevin.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:03.640]   --99% of their fortunes.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.680]   Sorry, kid, your inheritance.
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:09.040]   They're going to give away 99% of their Facebook shares,
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.920]   which are currently $45 billion.
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.640]   But of course, we'll probably go up
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:17.480]   to advance their mission, which is personalized learning,
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.480]   curing disease, connecting people,
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.800]   and building strong communities.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:26.320]   They've formed the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.120]   And of course, cynics all around the world,
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.960]   said it's just a tax plot.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:30.960]   You're not just terrible.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.600]   It's really your taste in hell out of me.
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:33.840]   Oh, I was writing about it today.
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.800]   It's just cheese, man.
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.240]   And yeah, I mean, Neil Dash has some decent points
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.960]   about how you can do it well or do it badly.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:40.800]   OK, that's fine.
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:43.960]   Well, that's the biggest contribution forever.
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:46.280]   And we start on even for that.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:46.760]   Yeah.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:47.280]   Cheese.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.400]   When you give away $40 billion, then you can make fun of it.
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.320]   And you know what?
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.520]   If he gets a tax break, fine.
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:58.880]   But who knows if $45 billion is more than 4%
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:25:59.920]   of his adjusted gross income?
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:00.480]   I don't know.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:04.800]   Actually, it's more than 4% now.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.000]   Right?
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.840]   It keeps going up.
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.000]   What's app?
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.080]   Have they turned this off yet?
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:12.680]   It was blocking links to Telegram on Android.
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.400]   I hope that that was a bug.
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.320]   I hope it was to.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.920]   Because Telegram, of course, a competitor to what's app.
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:22.440]   Hopefully, we'll usually these things often are mistakes.
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.040]   So I'm going to hope it's a mistake.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:25.680]   Because that's a pretty-- it looks bad.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:26.800]   The optics on it are bad.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.960]   Well, it was ham-fisted because it was just anything
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:30.640]   that had the word "telegram" in it.
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.720]   I mean, it was more than-- it wasn't a very--
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.760]   if it was a regular expression, it was poorly written.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.680]   Let's put it that way.
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.760]   It made me go to Telegram and be like,
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.440]   I've got my username on Telegram, right?
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.280]   I need to remember to tell them.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:41.320]   I like Telegram.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:43.480]   Yeah, I'm a big telegram fanatic.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.320]   Although I've been using WeCheck because I want to get
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:46.520]   with the kids.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.720]   I mean, I just-- I just-- I do the same thing.
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:50.320]   I just want to do that.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.680]   Again, yesterday.
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:53.840]   It's got great stickers.
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:56.120]   That's all I care about.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.200]   In gadgets, redesign launches tomorrow.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:58.840]   Is it AMP?
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:26:59.920]   I don't know.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:06.080]   But they're doing-- yeah, that is the show title.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:09.280]   They're doing what the Verge also did.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.640]   And it worries me a little bit.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.000]   A lot of these tech sites doing this,
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.840]   instead of just covering gadgets,
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:17.680]   they're going to have a focus beyond gadgets
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:19.480]   and consumer technology.
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.360]   They're going to cover how technology affects music,
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:26.960]   politics, sexuality, privacy.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.960]   So, well, the Verge did this too.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:30.440]   And they slowly-- you know, I think
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:35.600]   the goal of these sites is to become more mainstream.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.480]   And folks, you have my promise.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.840]   We're going to get less mainstream.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:39.840]   I don't--
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:45.920]   More focus on geekery, less focus on that other crap.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:49.600]   Finally-- and this is a huge story which may or may not
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:51.880]   materialize, but we're watching carefully.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.840]   Apparently, according to the Wall Street Journal,
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:57.840]   the Yahoo board is meeting this week.
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:01.680]   In fact, even as we speak, to discuss selling the core
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:03.080]   business.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:06.240]   And I imagine some are saying--
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.280]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.800]   --has no value.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:09.280]   Yeah.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:16.240]   Because their value is mostly an Alibaba and Yahoo Japan.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:18.240]   But there's also some speculation that along
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:22.080]   with the core business, Marissa Meyer is on the block as well.
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:25.280]   So we'll see what happens there.
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.280]   The list of speculated acquirers included what?
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.120]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:37.360]   Verizon, IAC, which is Barry Diller, News Corp, Time Inc.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:37.840]   Yes.
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.400]   And Disney.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:40.880]   Ask Yahoo.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.480]   Disney.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.040]   Time Inc.
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:45.520]   Time Inc.
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:46.280]   That's AOL.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.640]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:50.840]   But AOL-- so Microsoft and AOL both put bids in
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:55.320]   that were failed bids for Yahoo over the last few years, right?
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:58.400]   So here's the question.
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.200]   Marissa's getting a lot of crap.
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:02.880]   And given the performance of the company, I understand that.
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.840]   But I still say that if I were given charge of Yahoo, which he
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.480]   was, I still don't know what I would have done.
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:08.240]   No.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:12.760]   She was given-- but she knew this going in, an almost impossible
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:16.240]   assignment.
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:19.200]   Meanwhile, Jerry Yang is off on his island.
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:23.360]   Oh, god, I got out of there in the nick of time.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:25.000]   Well, there was some article in Recode
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.640]   or something where they quoted a bunch of former Yahoo execs.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.240]   And they were all anonymous, but none of them
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:34.040]   claimed that they had any idea how Yahoo could do better.
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.880]   The one thing I would say is Marissa
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.800]   is incredibly smart, works incredibly hard.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:42.760]   If she can't turn Yahoo around, then maybe it wasn't possible.
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:45.640]   I think that's a good attitude, yeah.
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:48.000]   And probably the case.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000]   And she's going to suffer for it now.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.120]   Sad.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.520]   That's the breaks of business.
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.800]   I get that.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:56.440]   But-- and maybe she shouldn't have taken it unless she
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:57.680]   had the strategy.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:00.280]   But the thing to me was everybody before shicking over
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.120]   says, what's Yahoo?
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.160]   We're still saying what's Yahoo?
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:03.640]   Yeah.
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:06.200]   It's kind of sad because Yahoo is a great name
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.640]   and great brand.
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:13.240]   They have many very successful content sites to this day.
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:16.000]   Well, in AOL, it was pretty much in the same boat.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.680]   But Tim Armstrong found a desert island to land it on.
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:22.560]   And so he comes out smelling fine.
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:24.560]   He sold the Verizon.
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:29.280]   Even though AOL is pretty much like what the hell is AOL?
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:31.680]   Finally, it may be the beginning of the end.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:33.920]   And I'm sure you'll be very happy to hear this Matt
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:34.720]   cuts of flash.
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:36.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:39.000]   Even Adobe says, don't use flash.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.720]   Even Adobe finally renames flash professional to animate
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:45.120]   and says, you know, this HTML5 thing,
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:47.920]   this may-- it might have legs.
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.920]   So do we have thanks Steve Jobs for this?
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:50.320]   Yeah.
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:53.080]   He began this five years ago.
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:56.040]   And I think the success of iOS and the fact
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.520]   that it has never supported flash
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.440]   has to be a big part of this.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:01.720]   And thank goodness.
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:05.320]   Even YouTube doesn't use flash anymore, right?
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:08.560]   It's-- I think there's still a YouTube interface,
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:10.640]   but a large fraction of it goes through HTML5.
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:13.120]   That's a good thing.
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.920]   And everybody's moving in that direction.
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:20.240]   So this is probably, as one tech blog reported,
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.520]   the nail in the coffin.
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:27.040]   Somebody else said, now Java applets are up next.
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.120]   We can, but hope.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.400]   All right, let's take a little break.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:32.920]   And we'll wrap this up.
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:35.200]   If Matt, you have anything you'd like to talk about,
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:37.200]   what you're up to, your 30-day challenge.
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.200]   So nice to see you as a surprise.
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:41.600]   I'll do something during the break.
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.440]   I'm giving you time to think.
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.040]   And Jeff's got a number.
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:46.040]   I'll come up with a pic.
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:49.360]   I've actually got a couple of nice new Android apps I like.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.160]   Although I hate doing Android stuff, Jason Howell,
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:54.400]   because you just nail it with all about Android every Tuesday
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:59.320]   and they've carefully scheduled the show so that yours comes
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.000]   the night before.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.680]   I'm loving this new trend, though, of Google unveiling new news
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:06.360]   on Tuesday instead of Wednesday.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.400]   Then we get the breaking news also.
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:09.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:14.200]   All about Android 5 PM Pacific, 8 PM Eastern, 20--
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:20.720]   actually, 0100 UTC on Twitter TV.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:23.880]   By the way, I guess this is an update from a recode that
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:24.560]   came out today.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.440]   The Yahoo board is backing Meyer.
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.880]   So she may not be out.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:31.680]   The journal said there were some concerns
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:32.480]   that she might be out.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:35.920]   But apparently-- and you know that nobody
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:38.680]   knows more about what's going on inside Yahoo than Cara Swisher.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:41.600]   And she says, despite Wall Street Noise and Sale
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.680]   Rumors, Yahoo board backs Meyer.
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:46.280]   So that's good news.
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:49.080]   I feel like we're all rooting for her.
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:52.320]   And I'm rooting for Yahoo.
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:52.880]   We'll see.
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:54.840]   Whatever it is, we root for it.
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.120]   Dude.
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:56.640]   In versa.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:57.280]   Yeah.
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.680]   Whatever that thing is.
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:32:59.760]   Whatever the heck it is.
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:01.200]   They brought back-- didn't they bring back
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:04.480]   that great billboard on the 101 in San Francisco?
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.480]   Yahoo billboard, I think, is back.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.480]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:10.480]   So that means everything's OK.
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.960]   They're resurging.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:15.560]   Doesn't it?
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.600]   It's their 20th anniversary.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:21.840]   They brought back Yahoo.
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:23.520]   The best billboard in the world.
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:26.520]   It was taken down four years ago.
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:32.640]   It looks like a campy roadside motel sign all lit up
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:33.920]   with a vacancy word.
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:35.560]   That's not maybe the--
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.920]   maybe the-- Marissa, am I going to change that to no vacancy?
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:38.680]   I'm just saying.
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:43.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:46.040]   Our show today brought to you by Braintree.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:47.640]   If you're a mobile app developer,
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:51.000]   you know that the challenge is we've just been talking about.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000]   But one of the big challenges that you don't need
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.960]   to worry about, that you can just let go and let Braintree.
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:59.840]   If you're working about mobile apps,
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:02.360]   worried about that, you know, security is important,
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:04.720]   making your users comfortable is important,
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.320]   that bad statistic that says 70% of mobile carts are abandoned
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:12.320]   before they click buy, that problem,
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.880]   all of that goes away with Braintree.
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:17.600]   And Braintree's V.0STK.
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:18.800]   You know who uses Braintree?
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:20.200]   Uber uses Braintree.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:21.760]   Lift uses Braintree.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:25.200]   Hotels tonight and Airbnb when competitors use the same solution,
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.640]   you know it's the best.
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:28.600]   And what is the secret sauce at Uber?
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:31.360]   It's how easy it is to pay.
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.560]   GitHub uses Braintree.
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:36.160]   Pinterest's those buyable pins on Pinterest?
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:37.400]   That's Braintree.
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:38.760]   One of the reasons they use it, it's
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:40.720]   easy to integrate just a few lines of code.
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:41.320]   It's fast.
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:41.840]   It's easy.
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:44.240]   Your customers will love it because they can use anything.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:48.640]   Apple pay, Android pay, PayPal, Venmo, credit cards, even Bitcoin.
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.640]   And if something new comes along, Braintree will support that too.
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:57.200]   You'll see fewer abandoned carts and more sales with Braintree's best in class mobile checkout
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:58.080]   experience.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:58.800]   Try for yourself.
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:03.160]   The Braintree Sandbox is waiting for you at BraintreePayments.com/twig.
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.800]   Works with every platform.
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:07.720]   It works beautifully, elegantly.
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:08.640]   It's secure.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.680]   Payouts are fast.
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:13.480]   In fact, you're going to get your first $50,000 in transactions.
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.120]   Fee free.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:20.120]   BraintreePayments.com/twig.
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:25.400]   Have you thought of something, Matt Cutts?
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:26.000]   I have.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.320]   So I'm showing off to it using two phones right now.
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:31.600]   I've got my Moto X and my Nexus 5X.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.560]   Double-handing it.
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:36.640]   So search for Webmaster Blog.
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:41.400]   The number one result by organic ranking is our Webmaster Blog.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:44.800]   And the post that I'm having is really good.
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:51.000]   Every few years, we do internal ranking and rating within Google.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.880]   We have a whole set of evaluators who say, this is a good result.
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:54.960]   That's a bad result.
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:55.960]   I prefer the left side.
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:58.000]   I prefer the right side.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.920]   And those don't affect our search rankings.
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:02.800]   But every few years, that Raider Guide will leak.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:06.560]   And people are like, oh my goodness, let's see what's changed since the last Raider Guide.
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:09.440]   And so a little while ago, we had a version leak.
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:10.520]   And finally, we said, you know what?
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.880]   Let's just publish the most recent version.
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:15.760]   And so there's some updated stuff, our search quality rating guides.
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:22.560]   Now, you might not want to read 160 pages about how people are supposed to evaluate stuff
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:24.560]   as high quality or low quality.
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:29.520]   But if that's the sort of thing that appeals to you, now you can get it directly from the
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:30.520]   source.
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:34.200]   You don't have to go and find a bootleg copy on Torin or anything like that.
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:37.360]   And I think the biggest surprise, I remember this quote from a few years ago, the biggest
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:40.200]   surprise is that there really isn't any surprise in there.
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:43.800]   It's just trying to encode the sort of natural intuition that you'd have.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:48.600]   But I like that it's one of the ways that Google tries to be transparent about how it
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:51.000]   evaluates the quality of websites.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000]   Fantastic.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.200]   And you can go there and find out how your website's doing on the Webmaster Tools.
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:01.000]   Yes, on the Webmaster console, give it a shot.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.200]   That's a-- for example, you accidentally removed, you know, a face.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.200]   Oh, geez.
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:08.200]   You could self-diagnose that home.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:10.200]   Oh, we should have, shouldn't we?
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:11.200]   Oh, God.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.200]   I'm so embarrassed.
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:17.200]   Do you want to tell the story about how that happened, Leo, or do you not?
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.800]   No, no, I don't mind telling it.
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:20.920]   I think I may not get the details read.
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:23.600]   I think we didn't-- whoever did it.
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:24.600]   You know what?
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:27.000]   We still don't know who did it.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:34.400]   We wanted to restrict the search index from some area.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.200]   I can't-- maybe you-- do you remember Matt?
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:37.600]   I have the email that you sent us.
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.000]   So basically, you can remove a URL in the Webmaster console.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.600]   And so you could say something like twit.tv/file, for example.
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:48.600]   And that would also match twit.tv/files.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:38:07.520]   It was a pre-
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:11.520]   or they'll accidentally allow the test version of their site or something like that.
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.520]   So in this case, it was something a little silly.
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:17.520]   We wanted to remove twit.tv/show.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:22.520]   But when we submitted that, we didn't know that that not just show, but show--
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:23.520]   That's okay.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.520]   --which is the URL we use.
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:31.520]   And so that's why our-- if we didn't have any search results for our shows.
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:32.520]   Yeah.
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.520]   But Webmaster console is the great interface where you can find out the latency of your
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:37.520]   pages, all sorts of stuff.
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:39.520]   And I'll just put one quick plug.
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:41.520]   We do this thing called Webmaster Hangouts.
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:45.520]   So John Mueller and a bunch of other people do this thing where if you have questions
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:50.520]   several times a month, you know, they're scheduling them now for the month of December.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:51.520]   They do them in English.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.520]   They do them in like German.
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:56.520]   And so you can show up and you can say, "I've got this question.
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:58.520]   Why does Google do it this way or what's wrong with my site?"
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:03.520]   And basically, people will try to interact and give you direct answers to your question.
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:05.520]   I'm so embarrassed.
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.520]   It's so bone-headed.
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.520]   All yourself and expert.
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.520]   Oh, my God.
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:16.520]   And Google should put you in charge of me.
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:17.520]   See?
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:18.520]   You see?
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:19.520]   Richard was right.
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:25.520]   Good thing Google's standing between me and you.
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:28.520]   Once you're picking the week or your number of the week, I should say.
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:32.520]   My number of the week, well, since we have generous tech executives.
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:35.520]   It's very, very good job here.
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:38.520]   Jason's doing a splitting mat in the up from a two-shot.
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:40.520]   I'm really going to win.
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:41.520]   Sorry, Jason.
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:43.520]   You're a bad Jason.
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:44.520]   Oh, man.
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:45.520]   Sorry.
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:59.520]   At Williams sold a lump of his Twitter stock and just gave 46 plus million dollars to his charity organization.
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:00.520]   Wow.
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:02.520]   So, a lot of that's a good thing.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:08.520]   We have technology industry, I think, finally stepping up to its role in philanthropy.
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:17.520]   And during the week, we had Bill Gates and Zuckerberg and many others signing up for the NFT initiative.
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:26.520]   So, I think that the oligarchs of Silicon Valley are, as I say, are the kind of things that are probably stepping up.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:29.520]   And so, a good, generous act from EV as well.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:30.520]   Really good.
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:35.520]   And it shows now that Mark Zuckerberg is an order of magnitude richer than...
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:37.520]   You had a love in it.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:38.520]   The guy has something nice.
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:42.520]   Actually, that's three orders of magnitude.
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:45.520]   Sorry.
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:53.520]   A lot of time, by the way, I'll be giving $37 million to charity as soon as I make it.
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:41:00.520]   A lot of people say that Apple has, you know, iOS has more apps than Android.
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:01.520]   You know, my experience has been there.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:02.520]   It's pretty close to parity.
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:08.520]   But every once in a while, there comes along an app that there is on iOS that there isn't on Android.
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:17.520]   And one of those apps, and I really love it on iOS that I couldn't use on my Nexus 6P, is called Storehouse.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:25.520]   And it is a really great way to make slideshows, to make stories out of images and text and movies.
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.520]   I've got the camera a little funky today.
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:28.520]   Apologies.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:29.520]   We didn't get a chance to stop this.
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:30.520]   No, that's right.
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:31.520]   And I have a few here.
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:35.520]   I made a storehouse of our dinner.
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:36.520]   Where's Michael?
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:37.520]   There it is.
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.520]   You know, you don't need a microphone, right?
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:40.520]   Oh, I do.
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:41.520]   So...
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:44.520]   And the point is you can do...
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.520]   It's a really great way to make a slideshow.
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:47.520]   I really like it.
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:49.520]   It's now available on Android.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:50.520]   It's free.
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:52.520]   It's a great social network there.
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:53.520]   You can share.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:54.520]   You can put...
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:55.520]   You know, I put...
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:57.520]   Here's a recipe I put in there.
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:58.520]   And it's kind of...
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:41:59.520]   Really?
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:03.520]   A little bit like Microsoft's sway, kind of reminiscent of that.
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:04.520]   But I just like this.
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:06.520]   A little slow-mo in there.
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:08.520]   I just really feel like this is a great...
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:09.520]   A little...
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:10.520]   And I like them a lot.
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:13.520]   And I'm actually glad that they're doing well.
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:15.520]   TechCrunch named them the best mobile application this year.
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:17.520]   They got an Apple Design Award last year.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:19.520]   And they're now on Android.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:20.520]   And free.
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:21.520]   Storehouse.
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:23.520]   It's my pick of the week.
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.520]   Hey, Matt, it was so nice to see you.
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:26.520]   It's great to see Matt.
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:27.520]   Thank you for dropping in.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:28.520]   Oh, man.
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:30.520]   Every day is a good day with Matt.
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.520]   Oh.
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:34.520]   Would Google let you just be a regular on this show?
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.520]   That would be a lot of fun.
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:37.520]   Yeah, we'd...
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:38.520]   We'd be the best.
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:39.520]   We'd be the best.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.520]   We'd be the best.
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:41.520]   We'd be the best.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:42.520]   We can do that.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:43.520]   We can do that.
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:44.520]   I'll get you a love seat built for three.
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:46.520]   Well, I have Jeff here.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:47.520]   I'm like, "Oh, I got a crash."
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:49.520]   Well, Matt, can you just give me a job at Google
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:50.520]   that I'll be here all the time?
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:52.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:54.520]   Nice to see you both.
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.520]   Thank you so much, Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.520]   for arranging Richard Jingers to join us.
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:02.520]   That was fascinating.
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:03.520]   And I think...
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:04.520]   Yeah, it was.
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:06.520]   It's a kind of outreach I think Google needs to do
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:09.520]   in a lot of different venues to let people know what's going on.
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:13.520]   And it's good to safe and all that stuff.
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:16.520]   And I think also Kevin Marks for being here.
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:17.520]   Thanks to you too.
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:18.520]   We do this week in Google.
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:22.520]   It's, I think, the most intellectual of the shows we do.
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:24.520]   Thanks to people like Professor Jarvis.
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:26.520]   I didn't say it much before.
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.520]   [laughter]
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:31.520]   It's also the snarkiest show we do.
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:34.520]   You can join us every Wednesday afternoon,
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:37.520]   130 Pacific, 430 Eastern Time,
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:40.520]   2130 UTC on Twitter.tv.

[01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:57.520]   Thanks for being here.
