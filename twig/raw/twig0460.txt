[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higginbotham are both here.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.960]   We're going to talk a little bit about Apple's announcements at WWDC and compare and contrast.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.280]   They're do not disturb features with the Google features they announced in Android
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.160]   P. We'll also talk a little bit about Larry Page's flying car.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.360]   It's coming out but six miles an hour and Stacey catches one of my gadgets from me.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.800]   But I'm glad to give it to her. It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.360]   [Music]
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.200]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.200]   From people you trust.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.640]   [Music]
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.640]   This is Twig.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.440]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.840]   [Music]
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.040]   This is Twig. This week in Google, episode 460, recorded Wednesday, June 6th, 2018.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.040]   A confusing number of people.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.320]   This week in Google is brought to you by Rocket Mortgage by Quick and Loans.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.400]   Home plays a big role in your life. That's why Quick and Loans created Rocket Mortgage.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.400]   It lets you apply simply and understand the entire mortgage process fully
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.040]   so you could be confident you're getting the right mortgage for you.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.720]   Get started at rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.160]   And by Mooghsaw.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.360]   Reduce IT alerts and tickets by up to 99%.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.720]   Visit Mooghsaw.com to learn more and sign up for a demo.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.320]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, the show where we talk about the latest news
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.520]   and with the Google verse with Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.440]   Blogger@bismishine.com.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.560]   Author of such great books as what Google do public parts, key-experring gifts.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.840]   Hello, Jeffrey.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.760]   Hello, hello, hello. Glad to be back.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.920]   Good to see you. You were all over the place.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.760]   You were in London, Oxford, and Lisbon.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.960]   And Lisbon was for Google's European Newsgeist.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.720]   What is the newsgeist?
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.720]   It is an unconference. Normally we're on the US with the Knight Foundation in Arizona,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.000]   but Google started one in Europe four years ago and in Latin America two years ago.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.240]   And it's an unconference. You get together and 150-200 people in the field.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.600]   And we write little post-its and decide what we're going to talk about.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.080]   And I help compile those because it's really interesting to see what people care about.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.520]   And then we have great discussions.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.960]   I enjoyed those.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.760]   I will.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.880]   And go ahead.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.960]   Bill, Tim O'Reilly.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.000]   Bill O'Reilly.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.560]   Right.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.640]   Tim O'Reilly used to do that up here in the Sebastopol called it Fucamp.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.120]   The Fucamp.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.000]   Friends of O'Reilly.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.840]   And it was so much fun. I went to a few of those.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.520]   And then the open version of that was Bar Camp as in Fucbar.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.240]   Bar, right.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.320]   So is this based on that same...
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.120]   Yes, it is.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.600]   It is.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.600]   It is.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.000]   It's back around.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.200]   He was involved in the early days.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.880]   Then I think he just got bored and moved on and so Google stepped in.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.480]   One of the most fun things I've ever done.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.640]   If you get the right people together, it's just great.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.560]   Yeah, it is.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.160]   Also with us from Austin, Texas, Stacey Higginbotham, the IOT Maven from StaceyOnIOT.com.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.000]   That's a Kistacey.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.320]   And she's promising us a special delivery in the middle of the show today.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.640]   Maybe.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.640]   Maybe if you guys are lucky.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.880]   Ooh, how exciting.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.880]   Whatever could it be.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:30.640]   As IOT, there had been a lot of attention on IOT lately because of Microsoft and Google
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.040]   both getting very much involved in Microsoft's talking at Computex,
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.440]   which is going on right now in Taiwan about the...
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.120]   They call it the Intelligent Edge.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.680]   It feels like this might have been...
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.480]   It might be the year of IOT.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.600]   Microsoft's doing something called Windows 10 IOT Core.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.000]   Windows 10 IOT Core Series.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.360]   Every year of Stacey.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.000]   Yeah, I'm like, every year is my IOT.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.560]   No, Microsoft has really come out with a complete suite of products this year
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.840]   that are really well thought out.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.080]   And last year, AWS came out with some products, but it doesn't have the kind of
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.000]   messaging and the completeness that Microsoft has.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.440]   Microsoft's really helping the enterprise.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.040]   So with the IOT...
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.200]   I can never remember.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.360]   Everybody's like, IOT Hub Core or whatever.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.880]   They're IOT Core services.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.040]   A couple of things they're doing there, they're boosting their support.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.960]   They're promising it for up to 10 years, which is crucial for industrial and enterprise operations.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.600]   Because three years of support is nothing if you want to set up a conference room,
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.120]   or if you want to build a product.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.080]   And then the other cool thing that Microsoft's doing with their services is making it so
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.960]   you don't have to change your products.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.640]   You don't actually have to update them.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   They're promising stability for 10 years.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.800]   We talked about this on Windows Weekly today.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.680]   We just had to...
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.800]   I just had to laugh at you.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   If you pay Microsoft, you don't have to update.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.120]   Well, so but it really matters for if you...
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.800]   Each individual IOT Core.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.760]   Security.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.960]   You have to do security updates.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.400]   You just don't have to do feature updates.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.320]   Right. But it's a really big deal because you don't want to have to add new things to devices
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.280]   that you don't want to be having your developer's waste time on.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.600]   Right.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.080]   Well, especially in an IOT device.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:29.760]   Well, and think about a medical device or a manufacturing plant,
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.720]   kind of equipment and a manufacturing plant.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.400]   You don't actually want to change those things once you get them streamlined and perfectly working.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.720]   You want them to stay exactly as they are.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.040]   Right.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.640]   You need security and IOT very much need security updates.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.200]   But you don't want your light bulbs to start working differently either.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.280]   Sometimes I would like my light bulbs to work differently.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.120]   I'm like, "Yeah, you don't give me some more features.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.920]   That'd be great."
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.440]   Well, it doesn't mean you can't get an update.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.120]   It just means you don't have to get an update.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.800]   We thought that was such a hoot.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.200]   But Microsoft has really, I think...
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.040]   We talked a little bit about this.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.680]   They really see it a benefit.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.200]   And I think this is true if everybody's using the same version of Windows.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   They need to look no further than Apple and Google.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:26.400]   Apple talked on Monday at WWDC about the fact that there are a million active IOS devices.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.240]   And half of them are running the current version of the operating system.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.040]   That's phenomenal.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.280]   Meanwhile, on Android, it's Fragmentation City.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.960]   They're working on that.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.960]   That was Project Trouble, right?
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.440]   Yeah, Trouble's been a success, kind of a born out of necessity.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.960]   But everybody looks at Apple and says, "That's the gold standard.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.560]   If we could just get all of our users to update whenever there's an update
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.680]   so that we have a feature complete set of users that developers..."
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.320]   It's all about...
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.600]   Ultimately, it's all about developers.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.320]   It's called Chrome.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.520]   So an interesting story there, we are also talking about on Windows Weekly.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.680]   Microsoft bought GitHub, which is...
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.440]   I'm ready to know that happened on Monday.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.160]   $7.4 billion, huge amount of money.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.000]   But what I didn't think about, and Paul Thorett brought up,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.240]   is that GitHub developed Electron, which is the Chromium-based application framework
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.920]   that a lot of apps are running on, including Microsoft's App Skype.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.240]   And it includes basically, it includes a copy of Chrome,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.880]   or the open source version of Chromium, and every...
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.600]   And it's one of the reasons it's a very big file, in every Electron app.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.720]   So Microsoft now is going to be distributing Chrome,
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.400]   unless they release it to the wild.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.320]   I don't know, they may not keep it around.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.560]   It'd be kind of interesting.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.080]   What was the reaction in your world to the...
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.320]   I noticed a lot of open source people saying, "Oh, that's it.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:02.880]   We're out of here."
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.480]   I mean, Microsoft is really...
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.280]   Yeah, it's a terrible one.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.200]   Horrible history with open source, which is, I think, turned around,
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.040]   since the arrival of such a Nadella.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:17.600]   But nevertheless, people feel bit by Microsoft and don't want to take the chance.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.400]   So I noticed a lot of...
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.720]   There was a big spike on one of GitHub's competitors, GitLab,
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.560]   had a big spike in signups the day this was announced on Monday.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.960]   Well, is this just usual grumpy geekiness?
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.320]   I think it probably is.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.880]   But we'll see.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.920]   It's up to Microsoft to maintain it.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.120]   They say it's going to be independent, but every time there's an acquisition,
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.680]   that's always what everybody says.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.280]   It's not going to change, it's going to be independent.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.960]   And then we see...
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.960]   Skype's maintained its independence pretty well.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.440]   I know.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.600]   Microsoft stopped.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.520]   Remember when Skype was actually here at Gear?
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.160]   They killed the servers, yeah.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.720]   But the management of Skype is kind of separate from Microsoft.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.200]   LinkedIn maybe hasn't been such a great success.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.520]   Nokia, of course, the worst example of a Microsoft acquisition.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.640]   So it can go either way.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.040]   Oh, what did they buy?
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.160]   Oh, the guys...
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.120]   It's software.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.160]   I can't think of the guys name.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.920]   Mono, they bought Miguel Diacaza's business and turned...
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.000]   No.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.360]   No.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.960]   Starts with an R.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.000]   Recinivitch, Mark Recinivitch, and...
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.560]   No.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.720]   Okay, I'm just...
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.360]   I'm giving up.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.720]   I'm giving up right now.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.600]   Age, daisy, age.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.560]   They bought a lot of stuff.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.120]   So that's not...
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.440]   Yes.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.320]   GitHub also spoke with Google,
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.680]   but it was a relationship with Nadella and Satya Nadella himself.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.320]   That's right.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:36.960]   They brought it home.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.960]   Revolution analytics asks, Goo-Derex?
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.920]   Okay.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.800]   Now I'm going to tell you...
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.320]   Razi, Roya, Razi.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:44.880]   Oh, Razi.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.520]   What was his company?
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:45.920]   Razi.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.320]   Razi.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.040]   Yeah, he was a creator of Lotus 1, 2, 3, and they brought him in.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.840]   It wasn't an R.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.240]   They brought him in with the Groove.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.320]   Microsoft Groove was the thing he developed.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.600]   That's what it was.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.160]   Okay, so...
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.720]   He's gone.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.760]   Yes.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.000]   On gone.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.040]   And Groove never really...
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.960]   gone anywhere, so...
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.480]   So was Microsoft ever had a successful acquisition?
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.080]   So far we haven't lost anything else.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.520]   Oh yeah, there's tons of...
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.160]   Skypus...
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.960]   I mean, yeah.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.240]   Samarin, actually,
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.920]   which is the Miguel Deacaza mono acquisition is huge.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.160]   That's been very good for Microsoft.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.080]   You know, a lot of this comes back to another great...
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.360]   quote Ben Thompson all the time, gosh darn, he's too smart.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:31.040]   But a great article today, or actually yesterday in Stratecary, his blog,
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.320]   called The Cost of Developers.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.520]   And he's talking about how dominant Apple is.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.280]   Apple at WWDC said that they have...
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.720]   Their app store serves half a billion weekly visitors.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.560]   Developers have now earned over a hundred billion dollars.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.560]   Remember, Apple gets about 30% of that,
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.800]   so that's a big chunk of change for Apple.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.040]   Developers love it.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.200]   And they...
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.040]   Just the way they used to love Windows,
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.400]   because Windows was a place a developer could go and make a...
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.120]   make software, develop a relationship with his customer,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.840]   her customer, sell, make a lot of money.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.120]   It was a platform.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.600]   Apple's not nearly as open as Microsoft,
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.200]   but Microsoft's really lost...
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.600]   Look at...
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.160]   Compare the...
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.680]   You know, the Windows App Store to the Mac App Store,
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.120]   or Heaven for Fenn.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.120]   Compare either to the iOS App Store,
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.480]   and you can see where Microsoft's really losing out to Apple.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.160]   So that's the explanation for the GitHub acquisition,
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.520]   Microsoft needs developers if it's going to continue to succeed.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.720]   And at this point, Apple really is taking all the oxygen out of the room.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.680]   And Apple does not treat developers well.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.080]   They released on Monday, they released an app, a dopey app.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.320]   There was no reason for them to do called Measure,
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.080]   which used ARKit to measure things by turning on the camera,
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.480]   and you go edge to edge, and you can measure it.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.520]   There are at least a dozen apps in the App Store already that do that,
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.360]   all of which are now out of business.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.320]   Well, that's the way it is when you're a developer building these tiny little features.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.200]   It is when you're a developer in an ecosystem.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.800]   See, that was what was great about Windows.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.360]   Windows initially didn't do anything,
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.640]   and they did very little, and they let everybody develop on top of it.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.400]   Apple, with iOS, Apple took control of it very tightly,
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.440]   and developers are really living in the mouth of the alligator,
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.640]   and just hoping that the symbiosis continues to be beneficial for Apple,
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.360]   because at any point they could, boom, snap it down.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.840]   In fact, it happened so often there's a term for it, you know.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.400]   It's called being Sherlockt.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.280]   Have you ever heard that?
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.720]   Well, I have not.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:42.000]   So there was a great app for the Macintosh called Sherlock,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.080]   which was a finding app.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.960]   Let me see if I can find the history of Sherlockt.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.880]   The Forgotten Mac application app.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.840]   So what happened with Sherlockt was huge in Mac OS 8 and 9,
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.080]   and what happened was Apple built in Spotlight,
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.480]   and in 8.5.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.480]   And the minute that happened, Sherlock just died.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.600]   It was like they were Sherlockt,
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.800]   and pretty much every at Apple keynote now,
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.080]   you're looking for the apps that are getting Sherlockt,
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.000]   this time around, it's the measurement apps.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.680]   Well, that happens.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.920]   I mean, that's what every AWS reinvent is.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.360]   Yeah, I think Apple can really, though, just put you out of business.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.360]   But I feel like it's a smaller business, but maybe that's just me.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.200]   I mean, I mean, I'm having, well, having seen what happens
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.400]   with some of these AWS kind of feature launches,
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.040]   those can take out a full startup.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.360]   I mean, just not just an app.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.960]   This is like a full company gone.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.440]   I have to.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:14:02.320]   I showed everybody this on Sunday, on this weekend attack,
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.680]   and let me see if I can find it.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:09.040]   This was the App Store developer earnings.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:15.440]   In 2018, the number is going up.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.880]   But what's really interesting is the top grossing iOS apps.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.040]   Now, I almost don't want, I want you to,
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.920]   the number one app is Fortnite.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.680]   I wish I could do this without you seeing the numbers here.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.640]   This is the number one app.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.920]   Then Candy Crush Saga, Pokemon Go, Candy Crush, Sotas Saga.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.920]   How much do you think Fortnite makes in,
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.520]   this isn't in Fortnite?
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.880]   Fortnite's free.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.720]   No, yeah, in Fortnite.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:48.400]   Fortnite's free, but they sell like clothes for your, like, skins.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.520]   $1.9 million a day.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.200]   Jeez.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.560]   I believe it, man.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:00.720]   My daughter will spend crazy amounts of real money on digital accoutrements,
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.480]   skins,
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.560]   this is why people put up with any behavior Apple wants to exhibit
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.120]   $1.9 million a day selling skins.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.160]   It's a mind-boggling.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.080]   All right, let's talk about Google.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:28.720]   Apple, one of the things Apple announced on the WWC on Monday was
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:37.520]   Screen Time, which is Apple's response to the complaint by people that their phones are too
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.480]   addictive, including, by the way, shareholders in January.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:48.160]   Janna and the California Teachers Retirement Fund, both big shareholders of Apple stock
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.240]   complained to Apple, "You got to do something.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.360]   Your phones are too addictive."
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:58.240]   So Apple has come up and will ship this fall something called Screen Time in iOS 12.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.880]   But remember, Google did exactly the same thing, announced exactly the same thing for
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.960]   their next version of Android P. They call it digital well-being.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.800]   Good article.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.600]   This is the equivalent of that damned voice on the escalator telling you how to walk on an
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.320]   escalator.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.240]   Drives me friggin nuts.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.840]   This is the mind-the-gap moment.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:23.600]   Both of them will allow you to set a limit on how much you use an app.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.640]   Although Google is stricter.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.960]   When you reach the limit on an app and on an iPhone, you can override it.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.600]   With Google, you cannot actually use the app unless you turn off the limits.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.960]   You have to go into the settings and manually, you really have to dig deep in.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.360]   Parental controls are strong now.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.880]   You'll be able to keep your kids from playing Fortnite all the time, Stacey.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.560]   There's also--
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.680]   Mine doesn't play Fortnite.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.080]   Oh.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:52.240]   But yes.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.760]   She's too young still, she will.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.400]   No, she's a game card action game.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.240]   She just thinks it's too violent.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.240]   She's really anti-violence.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:00.800]   Good for her.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.280]   I know it's not gory, but she's just like, no, I don't like it.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.000]   Oh, it is violent.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.440]   You're killing people.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.400]   Right.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.360]   So who wants to do violence and there's violence?
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:15.520]   Apple will has the new Android, the ability to disable notifications.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.360]   Doing do not disturb, so you don't even know.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.120]   You've got notifications.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:26.720]   Google's doing a better job, though, with it's overnight, do not disturb.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.920]   They dim the screen.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.000]   They go black and white.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.920]   They really discourage you from picking the phone up.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.800]   Apple didn't do that.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.800]   Nanny culture.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.520]   You don't like it.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.480]   Oh.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.960]   You know, people who bemoan the nanny culture, I'm all about that,
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.360]   except some people need that.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.200]   And these phones are actually, I mean, the apps on them and the phones themselves
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.120]   are designed to be appealing to people and to take advantage of psychological weakness.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.320]   So knowing that, you got to help people.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.520]   You don't have to use it.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.400]   It's just a tool.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.040]   Right.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:07.200]   Of course, immediately after Apple chose this, then they announced MIMOGY,
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:16.240]   which are customizable emojis of yourself that will make you want to spend more time.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.240]   I thought it was like Bitmojis.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:18.720]   How are they doing?
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.200]   They're like Bitmojis, except they're animated.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.040]   You can stick out your tongue, as you can see.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.320]   And they're cartoons.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:34.000]   They're not unlike Bitmojis and Samsung's, whatever they call it, in the S9.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.040]   It doesn't take a picture of you.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.760]   And then actually Bitmojis, you can design one of your own, or you can use a picture.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.920]   It's more like the former.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.440]   You start basically from scratch and you add your hair and your eyes and all that stuff to make
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.240]   it look like you, or as much like you as you can.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.440]   So then it's like a Mibo.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.240]   A Mibo?
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.360]   What the hell are those?
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.160]   Oh, sorry.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:54.720]   Those are...
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.680]   What the hell are those?
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.560]   She said.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.720]   Those Nintendo things.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.880]   Meas.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:00.880]   Meas.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.360]   Meas.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.240]   Meas.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.040]   Oh, yeah, meas.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:03.440]   Meas.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.400]   M-I-I, right?
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.600]   Which...
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.880]   But didn't Nintendo kill that?
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.320]   I think so.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.680]   I think they turn off the server.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.800]   Uh, M-Mojis.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:21.280]   The problem I have with this stuff is that it's patronizing paternalistic,
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.480]   and fundamentally says that you don't have agency or sense.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.040]   Right.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.360]   People make choices, and those choices are okay.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.480]   And for others to come along and test hisk,
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.240]   the world is just too addicted to this stuff.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.200]   Okay, stop, stop, stop.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:38.240]   Well, some of these stuff, if you read the profiles about psychological manipulation in these,
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.800]   it is akin to something like nicotine.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   And you would not tell someone who's trying to stop smoking, just quit.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.640]   You would try to help them with nicotine gum, or something like that.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.040]   Oh, right.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.280]   Jeff, I would point out that that's exactly the complaint people had about seat belts,
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.880]   and helmets for motorcycles.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.200]   Uh, it's the many-
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:57.840]   Well, the-
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.280]   But seat belts are not-
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.480]   But seat belts are not the same.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.400]   Seat belts have literally saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:04.880]   This is-
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.480]   No, you're not smashing into walls.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.920]   Um, but little kids who stay up all night-
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:10.480]   Isn't that same?
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:10.480]   All night.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:10.960]   It's all night.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.800]   Oh, but like, okay.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.280]   My-
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.520]   My 11-year-old daughter, should she be, like, so unable to get off her phone,
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.440]   because there is a real both device kind of action here,
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.160]   and then the apps on it being leading to social pressure,
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.760]   she could not sleep for five, you know, day straight.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.920]   And maybe she gets kind of upset,
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.480]   and maybe bad things happened to her because of that.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.320]   I mean, no, you're not running into a wall.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.280]   It's a much more slow motion problem, but it's still a problem.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.160]   All I'm saying is that-
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.480]   Is that the same exact arguments were made about books,
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.080]   so we have people who spend too much time with books,
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.120]   so they spend too much time doing this,
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.160]   too much time doing that.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.120]   And-
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:47.520]   And-
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.120]   And this is about personal agency, and-
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.400]   And fine, you make a good point, Stacey,
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.800]   that if somebody wants an aid to give them an aid, is fine.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.520]   But I still think this fits into a larger narrative that,
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.040]   oh my God, these things are terrible.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.240]   They've addicted us all.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.400]   They're ruining our lives, and it's just not true.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.760]   It's simply not true.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.120]   And that's the problem I have,
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:11.040]   is it fits into a larger narrative that I find patronizing.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.720]   I have a lot of friends who can't go dinner without looking at their phones.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.480]   And so I would say-
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.680]   So that's a choice they make.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.360]   Who's to say that your decision about that is right?
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.640]   They made their choice.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.360]   You're not a proven.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.960]   You don't do it, but what's wrong with their choice?
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.320]   But they got little twitches.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.560]   How do you feel about nicotine gum, Jeff?
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.000]   Nicotine, no, Stacey's right, it was a good analogy.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.840]   It's like nicotine gum for your phone.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.000]   But I'm not buying, this is addictive physically.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.280]   That's because you're addicted.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.360]   You're classic denial.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.120]   What did you say?
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.320]   I don't know-
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:46.640]   I don't know-
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.400]   I'm not a problem, I couldn't at any time.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:48.960]   Wait a second.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.040]   I feel like I'll be honest.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.680]   I mixed feelings about this.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.400]   I don't feel like-
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.120]   I think it's fine.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.800]   I think it's great to offer these tools.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   I don't feel like these tools really help.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:08.720]   So I guess what I might say is that these are the companies doing the least they can do,
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.960]   that they've weaponized attention,
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:17.280]   not knowingly, and weaponized engagement to make it more addictive.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.840]   And now they're offering you these tools that-
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.960]   We can help you stop.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:28.640]   I think these kind of reminders in that sort of thing are actually helpful.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.120]   Are they?
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.520]   So yeah, there are times when I'm laying on the couch and it's late at night and I'm like,
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.560]   "Gosh, I should probably go to bed.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.320]   Let me just read a couple more articles."
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.320]   And then if my phone were like,
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.240]   "Let's just make this slightly less attractive to you,
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.080]   because really you should be sleeping."
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.040]   That would actually be nice.
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.880]   I wake up-
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.640]   I know better, but I wake up every morning at four o'clock.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.960]   And I've tried different things like putting my phone
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.920]   in the other room and stuff like that.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.960]   And I will actually get up, go get the phone and get-
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.560]   See, and that is kind of-
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.920]   That looks like a problem.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.320]   You would probably be a little happier if you didn't do that.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.280]   I regret it.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:05.760]   I do.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.080]   And I keep buying things on Instagram and I need help there too, but-
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.560]   It's not-
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.680]   Well, that's another story.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.760]   Oh, and then QVC-
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.800]   And QVC shorts.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.160]   "QVC, my father-in-law,
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.360]   God bless him, he used to buy capital,
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.440]   Monte on QVC and we'd say, "Stop!"
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.680]   Yeah, QVC is bad.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.400]   So the early days of the web, right?
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.280]   What do we all do?
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.160]   We browsed.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.680]   We followed all these links.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.680]   We could go in the hole for hours, right?
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.600]   And then we finally got bored with it and we said,
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.080]   "That's enough of that stuff and there's not much to do it."
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.960]   We stopped browsing.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.440]   Give us time, we figure it out.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:39.920]   It's smart.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.560]   What?
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.040]   I still go down Wikipedia rabbit holes for hours.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.560]   I'm like, "What's this?"
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.880]   Well, Stacey, perhaps you need some Wikipedia help.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.280]   Maybe I need it to go dark out.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.680]   Maybe I'll pay my five or ten dollar donation
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.360]   and it'll go dark after like an hour.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:53.920]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.960]   So somebody in the chair who said,
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.680]   and I think this is App,
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.400]   it's like a drug dealer offering you,
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.240]   "Hey, by the-
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.640]   or cigarette companies saying,
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.440]   "Yeah, we have smoking cessation programs if you'd like."
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.960]   Hey, we see this is the problem I have.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.200]   This is the narrative that's out there
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.080]   and this is the Tristan Harris and all that.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:17.280]   And they're equating technology to nicotine and drugs.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.720]   And that does not help in the larger discussion
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.880]   when you're going the four places like Congress.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.840]   The apps that are out there
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.520]   are designed to be psychologically addictive.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.600]   So are novels.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.840]   So are miniseries.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.880]   Novels are far less.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.920]   So are...
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:40.000]   Oh, that's true, but I've got my creative hack for miniseries.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.200]   So I stop before the cliffhanger ending
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.640]   and then I watch the cliffhanger ending.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.280]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.480]   We haven't talked about that before.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.040]   So what's this?
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:47.600]   What do you do?
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.000]   I have them.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.640]   Oh, so when I'm watching like Stranger Things
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.240]   or something on Netflix that totally,
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.920]   you know, they're like, keep going.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.680]   We always stop it like right before the end
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.120]   or we watch to the next section.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.120]   Oh, so you don't see the cliffhanger.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.720]   We either don't see it or we see it go a few more minutes
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.000]   and then we stop and then we start the next, you know,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.200]   that's like masochism.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.760]   That's an old other illness.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.120]   No, like sometimes you watch the cliffhanger
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.480]   and then you move on until, you know,
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.360]   you get the dating wand that the fun like intro
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.640]   to the next problem and then you're like, click.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.680]   We're done.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.960]   It's silly, but it actually works.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.720]   I want to pull your family about that.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.200]   My husband is totally for it.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.000]   He actually thinks it's hilarious that I feel the need to do this
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   because he's like, he can totally stop watching.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.560]   I on the other hand, I'm like, so.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:45.360]   Jeff, don't you think though that they're, I mean,
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.200]   are you asserting that it's not addictive at all?
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.840]   I'm asserting that it's not nearly that.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.360]   Yeah, it's not physically addictive.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.360]   What about the Jilpa mean rush?
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.400]   This is not the new heroine.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.160]   Listen, you could you could get addicted to anything.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.560]   So you're saying it's addictive, but it's just not that bad.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.960]   Well, let me say you could be, you could have a habit form around anything.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.680]   You could have a compulsion around anything.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.720]   Washing your hands.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.040]   Right.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.080]   Exactly.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.960]   And so anything can become that, but that doesn't make the thing bad.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.920]   The problem is this is being used as an argument for why these things are bad
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.400]   and the companies that make them are evil and they're manipulating.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.840]   No, they're giving people what they want.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.480]   That's okay.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.240]   And people have agency to sound like an academic.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.040]   I'm not.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.440]   And they can choose what to do.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.600]   What they do, you're an academic, Jeff.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.120]   I get bad news for you.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.120]   I did a string on Facebook.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.440]   Words that academics say that no one else says, my favorite one is agency.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.000]   Agencies.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.760]   The other one is normative.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.560]   Normative.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:46.960]   Love it.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.880]   Chat room.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.760]   What are the words?
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.280]   Actually, there's lots of them.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.160]   There's lots of them.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.840]   They don't know what the others were.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.920]   Anyway, all right.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.240]   Onward.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:56.800]   We've had our.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.280]   We've had our disagreement.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.840]   Yeah, I'm addicted to the to the rundown.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.600]   So I want to make sure we get through this.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.520]   Google has decided not to renew Project Maven.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:16.160]   This was the Pentagon drone AI imaging program that Google had bid for successfully one and
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.760]   was working on until hundreds of Google employees signed a petition.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.720]   Thousands, I think.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   Thousands.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.680]   That was a dozen.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.800]   It was a four thousand.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.000]   It doesn't quit over it.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.680]   Or doesn't quit.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.640]   And then thousands of.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.760]   Thousands signed a petition.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.920]   Project Maven Google has decided not to re-up.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.840]   They will not seek another contract for Project Maven.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.000]   And they're getting, believe it or not, some criticism
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.200]   for not continuing on.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:49.120]   Michael Bloomberg says Google has abandoned national security.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.480]   It's a grave error.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.680]   Okay.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.960]   So this is again, this is like loaded language.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.800]   Of course, that of course, some people who disagree with it are going to say there
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.160]   abandoning national security.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:05.600]   Just like the people who don't agree with it are saying Google's not going to become the panopticon.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:05.920]   It's like.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.200]   Let's try another way here, Stacey.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.840]   Well, let's talk about the real issues.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   No, wait, wait, wait.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.720]   Where we're war two and Ford says we don't want to make tanks.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.360]   In some views.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.160]   That would be bad.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.440]   Either way, that would be bad.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.000]   But what Bloomberg is trying to say is the same thing.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   And I understand the argument.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.760]   I'm not sure what I think myself on this because I saluted the employees who said,
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.240]   this is not what we want this company to do.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.200]   And they spoke up and the company listened.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.040]   And I think that's the right decision.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.240]   However, and apart from Vinal administrations, we may or may not have,
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.480]   at some point there are things that are in the interest of national security.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:54.320]   The Pentagon does depend on private companies to do many things like build hardware.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.920]   And so what it's a fascinating question to me is all I'm trying to say.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.600]   It's a fascinating question to just say.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:09.600]   So I would be anti patriotic, anti American, what would be against the interests of your nation.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.600]   And what's for?
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.240]   I don't know what the answer to that is, but I think it's more than just dismissing the criticism.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:16.960]   I think the criticism.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.880]   I agree with you.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.120]   Value.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:24.960]   And my frustration with this is we are only going to have the debate
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.800]   at these high level terms.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.520]   Oh, they're destroying national security.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.440]   Oh, they're not creating the panopticon.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.560]   When reality, we need to dig into these nuances.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:39.920]   And I would say that Google and especially internet companies more so than others
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:48.240]   are so international, I can see why an argument for national security may not really resonate with
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:54.880]   them because they are an international company at the highest level in terms of where they're
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.760]   audiences.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.800]   Thinking about, yes, they are headquartered here.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.080]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.240]   Bloomberg says that the program that Google was part of and I quote,
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:09.200]   is intended in large part to help the military avoid accidentally striking non-combatants
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.000]   and civilian infrastructure by being more accurate.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.960]   If you presume that the operator is trying to only go after combatants,
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.920]   then is it wrong?
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:24.080]   Is it evil for Google to help stop a lower the level of civilian deaths in the war that's going to occur?
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.000]   Anyway, or is it evil that Google helps war in any way possible?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.400]   Same way.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.440]   Like the Oppenheimer dilemma right there.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.560]   Should you build something that could be utterly evil?
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:38.640]   And I think the Google employees who kind of took that stance where,
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.280]   hey, this could be good in one sense, but horrible for mankind in general,
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.000]   or foreign to foreign to foreign to general.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.840]   Also saying that he trusts the Google employees to leaven the decision making being made
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.920]   and that he wants them in that debate and their voice.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.280]   Again, I'm not arguing either way here because I respect what the employee said and I respect
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.000]   what Google did.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.480]   But I think this is, as you say, it's a nuanced argument.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.960]   And I think Bloomberg's arguments are actually nuanced.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.720]   I think the headline may not be, but the point argument is.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.240]   Yeah, my arguments with the headline.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:17.120]   It's I find it very, you may be no better than I, Jeff, he was your mayor.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.000]   Actually, he wasn't your mayor, but you do work in New York.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.240]   Does he do a lot of bylined editorial pieces?
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.040]   No, he doesn't.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.160]   That's what's so interesting.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.040]   It's very rare to be very political to me.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:34.640]   This feels like a first volley in a presidential campaign.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.680]   Well, I watched him at a off the record conference talk about it the last time.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:48.080]   And he went through a really good argument for why an independent just cannot succeed.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.760]   This is going to change in a second.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.440]   But his argument is that a it's hard as hell to the most to win at all.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.520]   Even if you do win, you can't get anything done in Congress because both parties are against you
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.800]   because you're independent.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:59.920]   Well, that was pre-Trump.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:03.680]   Trump is kind of a Republican and he's kind of an independent that's taken over a party.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.360]   And I could see.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:10.000]   He's running as a Republican just to get rid of Trump, just to get rid of Trump,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.680]   a moderate Republican.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.920]   And I think this is the kind of thing you start with, which is a patriotic defense
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.920]   of America.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:18.800]   I think it's a point.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.280]   Hold us.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:24.080]   He's a little old, but he's not as old as Michael Bloomberg.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.560]   Hold us.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.440]   I had Feinstein.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.160]   76 now.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.120]   Elections in two hours.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:31.920]   He's 70.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.880]   He's he couldn't be more.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.520]   I've seen him. I've been I I refer to him as it's literally across the desk from him.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.320]   He's happy.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.200]   And oh yeah, he's he's in good shape, Michael.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:41.760]   Very good.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.920]   You know, but you're rightly.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.520]   I think this is I think it's almost it's almost moot whether he's got a point or not.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.920]   I think this is really more political gesture.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.120]   Well, I think there's another thing that happens.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:58.400]   So to me, it's fascinating the dynamics here because I it's not some point I expect an
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.280]   argument from some people to want to retake the Republican party.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.120]   Or there's kind of a new center that that goes with the Clinton esque Democrats trying to pull
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.600]   in the David from is the Michael Bloomberg's.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:17.440]   But meanwhile, you have Bernie Sanders on the far left trying to torpedo some centrist
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.760]   Democratic candidates this week.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.480]   And the dynamics are are exploding in terms of all the permutations and
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.000]   the complications that could occur here.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.120]   So yeah, Bloomberg could just be making a larger political.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.480]   It's the kind of thing you'd want to do if you're going to come in as a progressive
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.360]   Republican start with waving the flag.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:43.120]   Yeah, that would be before you start saying and by the way, no more big bottles of soda.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.560]   So I just speak of the nanny.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.600]   I was actually thinking of that.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.320]   That's the question.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.280]   Now I know how Jeff feels about the soda tax.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.920]   Is that still in place?
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.600]   No, no, no, he lost.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.400]   He lost that.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.360]   Rightly so probably people see that's interesting.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.680]   I don't mind Apple and Google putting anti addiction features into their phones,
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.800]   but nobody should be.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.840]   Stay away from my dog.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.160]   No, he should be stopped from drinking a gallon of soda.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:10.480]   Okay.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.280]   That's what they want to do.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.200]   I thought the soda tax was a good idea.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.080]   I am not going to lie.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.760]   I thought it was a great idea.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.640]   What's next?
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.000]   Crispy cream tax.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   I would pay.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.800]   No, what's next is Uganda's social media gossip tax.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.400]   Yeah, that is a funny one, isn't it?
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.840]   Funny if some of the people who want to be able to actually talk.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:35.440]   At the salary rate in Uganda, not trivial about money.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.560]   Significant amount of money.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:42.240]   It's pretty clear and Greg Farrow brought this up.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:48.560]   This is just another way of extracting money out of a country.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.560]   Some politician will get access to this fund.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:00.160]   Daily fee of a nickel, but that's a lot when the average per capita income is $600 a year.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:04.880]   Daily fee of a nickel for anyone who uses social network,
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.880]   they'll messaging apps and platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:14.160]   The president was a vocal supporter of an advocate of the bill.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:18.720]   He says social media encourages gossip.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.440]   And maybe other things like uprisings.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:29.520]   3% of your income, you do it every day.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.560]   That's a lot of money.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.160]   That's a lot of money.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.360]   But hey, I bet they're not addicted to their phones.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:40.400]   Here's something I might get addicted to.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:46.400]   Larry Page's flying car made its public debut today.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:53.600]   Kitty Hawk unwrapped its updated vehicle on Wednesday and allowed a CNN reported to pilot the vehicle
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.120]   with less than an hour's worth of training.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:03.920]   The update says it's so easy that you can learn how to fly this flying car
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.440]   without hardly any training at all.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.880]   I'm going to give you the predecessor here.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.360]   Very important.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:11.920]   Hold on one second.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.040]   This is something that may be tooled even for you and me.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.240]   Look at it.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.040]   It's so cute.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.040]   It's got to be noisy.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.320]   Can you hear the, are you?
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.680]   Are you getting my audio car?
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.320]   Maybe they're not going to give us the.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.000]   Look at that.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.120]   That's got to be noisy.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:31.360]   That is cool.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.440]   That is cool though.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.040]   So that happens to the wheels.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:35.920]   So when it lands.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.880]   It's 10 propellers.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.840]   How does it?
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.560]   It's got to be hot.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.160]   So it lands vertically.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.600]   And then does it drive?
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.400]   I want to see it drive.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.160]   It's a car.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.360]   Is it just land in the water?
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.520]   It's just like a car.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.120]   It's just a drone.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:51.760]   Oh no.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.000]   See.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.120]   Oh well, I don't know.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.000]   Leo, I just put in the run down in the comments.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.880]   Okay.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.320]   This is so old fashioned of Larry.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.600]   Larry's just not watching this.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.080]   This is children.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.920]   All right.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.120]   Let's look at this.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.960]   Let's look at this YouTube video here.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.840]   Jeff, this was a show.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.080]   I remember I think it reruns not originally.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.120]   I don't know what year it was on.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.480]   Bob, come in.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.280]   I remember this.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.640]   Bob, come in.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:17.920]   Give it a sec here.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.360]   Here is.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.920]   See that plane looks exactly the same.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:28.320]   It's a car and it really turns into a car.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.000]   The new Bob Cummings show.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.520]   This is the open.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.120]   Oh, he's going to go to the 61.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.640]   Oh, Bob.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.520]   Oh, Bob.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.640]   He was such a dog.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.920]   Bob actually was a, he will actually.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.400]   He was.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.040]   It's an issue.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:43.520]   Oh, really?
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.040]   I didn't know that.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:45.600]   Oh, shoot.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.480]   So the aero car.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.600]   Yeah, that wasn't in that one.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.520]   Here's the, here's the 1960s.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.160]   You watched the aero car.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:50.640]   Here it is.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.600]   Watch this.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.240]   Here we go.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.360]   Here we go.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:38:00.640]   I don't know.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.000]   Do you have, what's the deal?
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.040]   Are you not getting my audio?
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:03.680]   I don't understand.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.520]   So weird.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:07.920]   It comes.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.600]   Comes and goes.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:10.640]   It comes.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.920]   Oh, this is like trouble music right here.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.840]   Hold on.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.200]   I don't know what I'm watching.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.040]   What the hell am I watching?
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:19.760]   Oh, here it is.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.040]   Here it is.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.280]   It's driving onto the, onto the Mac at him.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.640]   It's, it looks like a trip on.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.200]   Where's the wings?
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.120]   Okay.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.760]   And the CNN reporter is being shown how to drive it.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.880]   That's Larry Page in the green hat.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.120]   Okay.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.600]   Says, here you go.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.600]   Let me, let me just attach the wings.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.840]   I like that knob.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.160]   What is it?
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:55.840]   But I don't see the, how's it going to take off?
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.040]   Oh, here.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:57.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.720]   We attach, we attach the wings.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.760]   Oh, it's, it's, it's hose the wings, I guess.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:12.480]   [Music]
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.080]   That seems like a terrible idea.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:20.160]   Humans are messed up.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.160]   Humans are just strange.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.160]   Okay.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.600]   Now they're detaching.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.640]   This was much easier when Bob comes to him.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.960]   I've got to have, this is from 1961.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.400]   This is the arrow car.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:39.360]   No, this was, this was much easier than this.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.240]   Well.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:47.680]   I'm disappointed with the learning that Bob Cummings was,
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.560]   it was a dog.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.320]   He's like such a nice guy.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.840]   Nice guys can be dogs.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:58.240]   You got that friendly guy at all.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.600]   Yeah, that's, that's real common.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.640]   Those are the worst ones.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.680]   I've got it on, what's my line too?
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.440]   Oh my god.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.680]   This is a little harder than Larry Page's.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:11.680]   They're now, they're now.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:15.520]   I'm not getting up in the air on this thing.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.400]   There's no way.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.640]   Uh, I think by the end of the show,
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.840]   we're going to get you to buy one Leo.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.720]   If it, all they need to do is an Instagram.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.520]   Are they sending the two little girls in there?
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.400]   An Instagram ad.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.000]   Don't let the little girls fly.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.560]   I think this is, they're not going to actually go in the air.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.800]   This is, this is no longer.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.240]   This is.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.120]   That was my fun.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.680]   That was the.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.640]   So I'm listening to Jim Fallows, Jim and Deb Fallows,
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.200]   Jim Fallows, the wonderful Atlantic Call of the Post.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.920]   They're book about flying all around the nation from 2014 to
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.960]   Japan, I think.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.680]   It's very good.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.520]   It's about finding hope in America today.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.000]   It's about finding optimism and good ideas
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.360]   and people are doing good things.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.600]   But Fallows is a pilot.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:55.840]   Right.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.120]   So he's flying the Cirrus, one of those planes with the,
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.720]   with the parachute.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.120]   You know about that right now.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:04.640]   It's the.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.520]   The one of those what?
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:13.280]   The Cirrus plane, if you go to CIDMLRUS, aircraft.com.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.920]   It's a plane with a parachute built in for the plane.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.680]   So like it's planning on crashing?
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.560]   No, it makes your wife feel safer versus Mrs. Fallows.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.280]   So if you look at the SR20 and then Cirrus Airframe Parachute
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.320]   System, there's a video there.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:36.640]   How do you know all this?
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.280]   I'm just weird.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.880]   Go down 20, go to the 20.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.400]   The perfect dual role airplane.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.360]   Now scroll down red, red type there.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.240]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.240]   Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, there.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.840]   The caps, the airframe parachute system.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.640]   So if you have, if there's a problem.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.720]   Yeah, you got a single engine.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.920]   You deploy the parachute.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.400]   It doesn't work.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.640]   You deploy the parachute and you come down.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.840]   So this is what he's driving.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.920]   Yeah, all around the country.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.920]   Actually, Scooter X says a few lives have been saved.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.600]   Yes, this is one of his life.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.400]   In this thing.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:18.800]   So she was flying in this plane, flying along, flying along.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:24.400]   And then all of a sudden, and it just, that's so interesting.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.680]   Isn't that?
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.440]   Huh.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:32.080]   These are now, I think, Cirrus are now the number that he said in the books,
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:38.080]   where I don't know what the, the category was, but largest selling plane in their category.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.040]   Apparently we have some.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:39.520]   Is it a parachute?
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.800]   Just they're also more comfortable, evidently.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:47.760]   We have somebody in the chair who flies him says it's a heck of a plane to fly.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.640]   Oh, look, there it is.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.840]   It's coming out of the sky.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.360]   Wow, that's what we see.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:53.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.920]   She's talking about, there we go.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.320]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.440]   Wow.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.400]   And all they had was a cracked.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.080]   Thing.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.680]   So save there.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:08.800]   See if this lady's life.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:10.960]   Well, that's pretty good.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.520]   Pretty good.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.000]   All right.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.720]   This is what we do.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.400]   We go off on tangents to tangents.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.200]   If I ever buy a plane.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.000]   It's just like the old days of browsing the web.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.840]   And I for one, find it addictive.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.360]   And I have no problem with that.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.120]   I'm addicted to our tangents on the way.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.200]   Yes, because I'm addicted.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.720]   I try to give it up, but I can't.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.320]   Why don't they have a buy button on the website?
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.240]   I wonder what it costs.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:36.960]   Yeah, what does it cost?
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:40.640]   Have you ever, did you ever, I've got a guest Leo that there was a time in life
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.760]   when you wanted to learn how to fly?
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.560]   Never.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:42.960]   Ready?
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.680]   Are you ready?
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.480]   Did you ever want to?
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.440]   Yes.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:50.160]   $439,000 in nine hundred cents.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.360]   Really?
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.440]   Yowza.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.840]   So those parachutes are saving the 1% half a million.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:58.800]   Shmackers.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.840]   Oh, Stacey.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.400]   Half a million.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.760]   How come I sit at call on?
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.400]   Now, if you want to get loaded, it's 539,000.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.720]   And you probably want it loaded.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.240]   That's their cheapest plane.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:08.640]   Yes, sir.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:09.120]   20.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:09.840]   Yes, the cheapest.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.600]   The jet is 2 million.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.600]   I don't know if the jet is a.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.120]   Does the jet have a.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.560]   Per shoot?
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.040]   I doubt it.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.800]   You know, it costs less than leasing my Tesla.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.680]   [laughter]
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.960]   Not quite as practical.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.640]   Okay.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.800]   So Kitty Hawk went up in the air.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.840]   Kitty Hawk.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:32.640]   We're excited.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.040]   Kitty Hawk.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:37.120]   A mysterious flying car startup funded by Google co-founder Larry Page
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.120]   unwrapped a huge update on Wednesday.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.720]   It's promising to get people in the air in under an hour.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:49.200]   It's now open for test flights for people in place to place pre-orders.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.080]   Wasn't mean in the air in under an hour without training?
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:52.400]   You mean?
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.680]   That's how much training you need.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:59.280]   Right now they're testing exclusively over water at a facility in Las Vegas.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:05.280]   After just an hour's training, the CNN reporter, Rachel Crane, was able to fly the machine
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.720]   now this must be wrong.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.840]   6 miles an hour.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.080]   That can't be right.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.840]   The height of 10 feet of over water.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.560]   That can't be right.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.600]   Or Sebastian Prun strikes again.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.360]   Oh, the creator of the Google self-driving car.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.000]   It says it's as easy to use as playing Minecraft.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.680]   It's powered by a lithium ion battery, which can be used for 20 minutes.
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.280]   Oops.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.000]   It has 6 wires an hour.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.960]   There's people in the road who can't think ahead to passing one car.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.280]   That means you can go to the mine after.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.040]   The joystick is so intuitive.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:47.440]   But it's not the most comfortable thing I ever sat in said Rachel.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.520]   You can definitely feel the vibrations.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.160]   10 motors, two control sticks.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:58.400]   It's conducted 1500 test flights so far among interested business partners.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.480]   And social influencers.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.200]   We have a chance.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.560]   Well, I'm the invite you.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.520]   Me, you.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.800]   I'm not going up in that thing.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:11.680]   Maybe this is good for like, you know, in Sydney with the water taxis.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:15.520]   Or if you think about a place like, I don't know.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:22.880]   They hope the vehicles will be able one day to fly it up to 100 miles an hour over populated areas.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.560]   Ah, as opposed to swamps.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.200]   I think the six miles an hour must be a typo.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.000]   No, I mean, that might be.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.520]   I mean, this is brand new, right?
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:38.240]   So, I don't know how fast the Wright brothers plane went.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.040]   I see in the video how fast it looks like it's going.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.520]   Looks like it's going a little faster.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.160]   I mean, not.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   Oh, that's faster than six miles an hour.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.160]   No, it's faster than six miles an hour.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.520]   Six miles an hour is a special.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.000]   You walk.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:50.560]   You walk.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.600]   Well, you.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:55.200]   Well, that's that's it's interesting.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.480]   I don't I don't know.
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:00.720]   See, I just want to keep my feet on the ground.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.040]   That's why I never really anchored to be a flyer either.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.520]   I don't mind commercial flights, but.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:09.200]   Daisy, would you if you were given a free hour of training to go, would you do it?
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.400]   Oh, yeah, I totally do it.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.040]   I'll tell you what I want to go hang gliding.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.480]   So I am clearly nuts.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:15.680]   I really want to buy this.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.480]   You are.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.600]   I did it once I did it in Napa after enough wine samples.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.920]   Well, I'm doing a glider in Napa.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.680]   Yeah, I want to hang gliding.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.800]   Hang gliding is where you're hanging.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:25.600]   You did a hang gliding.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.720]   No, I'm not doing that.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.440]   No, I'm not doing that.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.080]   Yeah, you're in a glider.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:28.720]   I did the glider.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:33.360]   You see it's like a plane with really big wings and then they pull you up in the air.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.360]   But what he didn't tell me is that right before the flight,
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.080]   they were trying to decide it was so windy if they should go up or not.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.920]   And they said, well, this will be the last flight of the day.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.800]   You ignore your life.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.960]   And then as I'm getting in, my wife, we just got married and said,
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.840]   do you have insurance?
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.000]   I said, yes, but it's not in your name.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.760]   It waved.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.000]   I waved goodbye.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.720]   Nice.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.360]   We've just gotten married.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.160]   I hadn't had a chance.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.960]   I didn't die.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.760]   Here's the goodness.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.440]   This is what I want.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:13.120]   This is a Google project called Project Oasis.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.880]   Oh, I like this too.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.760]   Okay.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.480]   This is kind of dumb.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:16.880]   You still not.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.600]   I got to figure out why my audio comes and goes.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.560]   Side, but inside a box.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:26.640]   We live in between nature and technology and we usually look at this from the beginning.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:27.040]   Here we go.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:34.960]   I'm her preeth and this is Project Oasis, a voice controlled terrarium that recreates
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:40.240]   weather outside but inside a box. We live in between nature and technology and we usually
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.640]   look at them as two very different worlds.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:48.320]   Project Oasis brings these worlds together and lets you interact with them by using your voice.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:54.880]   It's a self-sufficient closed ecosystem that can mimic sunlight, rain, and clouds.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.360]   What's the weather like in Hanoi?
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:04.320]   Report it.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:10.880]   Unfortunately, Project Oasis was made with Google's tools.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:11.440]   Dial up flow.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.680]   Well, you also can't tell the actual temperature.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:17.600]   It's a simple experiment to expand a conversation with nature and technology.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:17.840]   Right.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.960]   So I don't really get this.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.240]   You can figure out the reality of my life.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.920]   I think it is an awesome project.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.960]   It's a cool project for science class.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.600]   Yes.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.520]   It's a great project for science class.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.240]   It's also like, I mean, okay, I like terrariums.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:33.520]   We have lots of plants in my house and millennials, they love plants.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.880]   Oh, so you know why you love this.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.320]   This is IoT comes from plants.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.280]   It is IoT.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:37.760]   Yes.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.640]   It's IoT.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.560]   It's too bad Father Roberts leaving us because he could totally build this.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.680]   It uses an Arduino.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:46.960]   Wow.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:47.840]   We should build this.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:50.320]   I mean, it's kind of fun.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:50.960]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.200]   It's a Raspberry Pi 3 and an Arduino.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.600]   Yeah, you need the computer for the Pi and then the actuators attached to
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.800]   and managed by the Arduino.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.240]   Missed rain lights.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.840]   Something called a...
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.200]   And it's also, it is a terrarium.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.320]   So it's self-contained too.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:04.960]   You don't have a water.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:05.600]   I know.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:06.720]   I love these things.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.200]   Something called a peristaltic resonator.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.880]   Peristalsis is when you like throw things up.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:12.880]   No.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.640]   So I don't know.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:20.880]   And you use, you got to get openweathermap.org.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:25.040]   You get an API key and it uses Node.js and the Raspberry Pi.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.080]   I think I could do this.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.520]   Should we build one?
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:28.960]   Go for it.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.480]   I mean, they could put it in.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.280]   But make it larger.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.240]   Make it like, make it human sized.
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.560]   Make it so make the studio be the terrarium.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.080]   The studio into the terrarium.
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.240]   And then you could say, you know, Jeff, you could say,
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.000]   hey, let's make it like, Hanoy in here.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.560]   That starts raining on Leo.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:50.000]   So Stacy, you don't get the punch, but you get to this so cleo.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.000]   Oh, that would be OK.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.960]   Weather in Antarctica.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:59.040]   It does use Google's cloud.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.840]   I mean, the whole point of it, I guess, is using Google's cloud.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.160]   And it uses their voice kit.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:06.080]   You know how they've got these.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:06.480]   Right.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.400]   They've got these new voice kits.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.280]   They have another one that's like a servo kit or something.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:16.720]   Google's dialogue flow parses natural language for the required parameters of city,
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:17.920]   location or action.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:24.560]   So you got the dialogue flow functions, the cloud pub sub node,
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:30.080]   JS listener, and then the Arduino sketch doing the whole thing in there.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:33.280]   It's just, I mean, it's nice.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:37.840]   I'm not saying this is, I mean, there's nothing here other than like, hey,
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.160]   we have cool stuff and you could build cool stuff with it.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.520]   It's a science project.
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.240]   It's really cool.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:45.520]   Yeah, it's like it'd be perfect eighth grade science project.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.080]   Oh, man, you get an A for sure.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.440]   Why don't you build one with your daughter?
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.840]   I'm actually contemplating that.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:53.680]   Maybe that's our summer project.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:56.720]   Wouldn't that be a, oh, maybe we should have competing.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:00.000]   Should you're going to compete against my daughter?
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.080]   She's 11.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.160]   Okay.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.400]   So you have, you have all the resources of like everyone there.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:14.320]   Like, when she kicks your butt, Lee.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:14.800]   Bring it.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.080]   Jeff, were you worried when Google removed the tablets section from the, uh,
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.520]   Android site?
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.760]   And then they brought it back.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:32.000]   But my daughter was today was asking how big a, um, one of the kindles is, and
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.440]   she said, seven inches, how big is seven inches?
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.960]   I said, Oh, funny, you should ask.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.680]   Out comes my old Nexus seven, which I adore so much.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:38.480]   Oh, so good.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.160]   So I love it.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.600]   Let's take a break.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.240]   We'll come back with more Jeff Jarvis, Stacy Higginbotham.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:48.640]   This week in Google, our show today brought you by Rocket Mortgage from
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.560]   Quick and Loans, number one lender in the country.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:51.200]   Woo.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.320]   As of December, number one of volume, but always number one in your hearts.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:59.600]   Eight years in a row, according to JED Power, number one in customer satisfaction for
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:04.720]   mortgage origination, number one for the last four years in mortgage servicing.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:08.160]   People love Quick and Loans, and they're going to love it even more when they find out
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:11.920]   about Rocket Mortgage is an entirely online mortgage approval process.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.840]   No more dressing up to go to the bank.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:18.480]   No more big applications going to the attic and getting paper.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.480]   We're calling the bank and saying, do you have my bank statement from 2012?
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.040]   None of that.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.560]   All you got to do is go to rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.400]   You could do it right now, set up the account up without applying.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:34.800]   And then the next time you're in an open house, you see a house you like, or maybe you just want
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.640]   to lock in the low interest rates, because interest rates are going to go up.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.800]   You can refi right now.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.280]   All you got to do is go to rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.680]   You can do this on your phone, answer a few simple questions.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.760]   Then, because they have relationships with all the financial institutions,
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.880]   once you give them permission, they can go out and get everything else they need.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.800]   You don't have to go through the attic.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.280]   They do.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:02.080]   And it's great, because based on income assets and credit, in around 10 minutes,
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:07.040]   usually less, they'll analyze all the home loan options for which you qualify and get back
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.640]   to you with a run that's just right for you.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.600]   You choose the rate, the term, the down payment, and you're done.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:12.640]   You'll apply simply.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.160]   You'll understand fully, and then you'll mortgage confidently.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:19.120]   Rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:23.920]   Equal housing, lender license in all 50 states, and MLS consumer access.org number 30-30.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.640]   I know it's this is kind of the home buying season right now.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:32.000]   People going out and looking at houses, go armed, set gift right now.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   Go to rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.320]   Get it all set up on your phone, and then you'll be ready.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:40.080]   You see something you want before you leave the open house.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.200]   You can show the Realtor.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:41.760]   We're approved.
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.040]   See, it says that right here.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.200]   They even got for the old timey Realtor.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.880]   They've got a button.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:50.160]   It says print out a letter that says you're approved in case they need this.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:55.040]   rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:55:03.840]   I think on Monday, Apple took an opportunity to definitely to poke Facebook
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.320]   and not in a good way.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:09.680]   And I think even a little bit of Google as well.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:15.520]   So for instance, in the demo on digital well-being on hiding stuff,
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:20.560]   they showed usage and the three sites that they showed, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:26.320]   But also they're beefing up Safari.
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:30.080]   And this one, Steve Gibson brought this up.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:33.280]   And I thought this was a very interesting point.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:41.680]   They're going to add tracking protections in Safari to prevent ad tracking, new privacy tools.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:46.320]   And they specifically mentioned Facebook.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:50.960]   And this is the question that Steve asked.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:59.520]   They're going to block the like button and they said share button, similar buttons on sites,
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:04.400]   so that Facebook and presumably others can't get shadow
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:09.120]   dossiers on you by just following around on the net, whether you're a member or not,
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:10.240]   based on the like buttons.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:12.320]   That's a good thing.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:17.760]   But Steve pointed out, is it going to ask permission for every single thing it sees?
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.760]   And isn't that going to bug you?
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:23.680]   Are you going to say, right?
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.360]   It's like being in Europe.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:29.440]   I think it was cookie ads. Oh, God, I know there's cookies click.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.200]   Yeah, but this is going to be more having just come from Europe, Stacey.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:37.520]   Everything now, I mean, it's not, we're all getting this on our email newsletters right now,
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.120]   right? But you're there.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:43.280]   It's just bombarding you with verify, verify, verify, verify, verify,
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:46.240]   the W with the GDPR.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.280]   So that's really interesting.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.400]   Yeah, I bet it will be like that.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:52.480]   Craig Federighi said, we've all seen those like buttons and share buttons.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.880]   Well, it turns out that these can be used to track you.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:58.000]   It's true. Whether you click on them or not, it's true.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.160]   And so this year we're shutting that down.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:04.160]   And so he showed the web browser will prompt you,
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:08.320]   do you want to allow Facebook.com to use cookies and website data while browsing a website?
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:14.080]   Yes or no, presumably they'll also be allow forever, allow for, I don't know.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.760]   But if they do that for everything, it's going to be incredibly annoying.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.120]   Is that an anti-competitive move?
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.600]   Well, now what I'm wondering is maybe they're trust move.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.720]   Yeah, maybe they're only going to do it for Facebook and maybe Google.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.760]   I mean, maybe Twitter, maybe they're going to say,
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.880]   well, allow because I don't know about if you know this,
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:34.560]   but every set you go to has multiple trackers on it like that,
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:36.560]   including Google Analytics or even our site.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.040]   And we're not collecting any ad information,
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.920]   but we have Google Analytics, ChartB is another one,
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.640]   because we want to monitor traffic on the website.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:49.120]   Everyone will say this is Apple turning a bug to a business failure into a feature.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:49.760]   I'm really curious.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.040]   They tried to sell advertising.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.160]   They failed.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.360]   They don't know how to use the data.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.040]   So they don't need the data.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.560]   Thus, they can go after everybody else,
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.680]   they're competitors who do use the data as part of their business,
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:02.560]   which is not going to just be Facebook, not going to be just be Google.
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:04.080]   It's also going to be Amazon.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:06.240]   Yeah, they didn't mention Amazon.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:08.400]   Amazon is making a fortune in advertising now,
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.520]   and Amazon clearly needs to track you to make recommendations.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.320]   So the big three, so they're going after,
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.800]   they're the fourth horseman attacking the other three.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.440]   Well, and then there's this issue.
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:22.640]   The New York Times said that Facebook told it,
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:28.720]   that Apple, Samsung, and others had asked for information
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:32.160]   about users on the phone.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.720]   Isn't this for the old feature phones?
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:38.720]   Isn't this going back to an earlier and stupider time at the company?
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.720]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.600]   Facebook had really--
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.840]   I believe this was going--
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:45.520]   Microsoft, do they have phones now?
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.400]   BlackBerry?
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.560]   This was back to devices as I didn't read the full all the stories about it,
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:51.200]   so I could be wrong.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.400]   It goes back, but they said that some of--
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.440]   No, some of these are--
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:55.920]   No.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.040]   The relationships--
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:58.080]   In the original--
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.120]   Facebook said--
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:58:59.840]   They should have--
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:04.000]   We're going to start turning these off, but they should only ever since.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.200]   They started it, and then they let it go on for all kinds of modern devices.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:12.000]   The Times said most of the partnerships remain in effect,
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.240]   though Facebook began winding them down in April.
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.480]   So--
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:19.680]   Just as Cambridge Analytica occurred in 2014, they said,
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.840]   "Oh no, they cut it off in 2015."
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:24.960]   They got all that earlier life,
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.760]   because there's stuff that might have been okay at the time,
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:28.960]   might have not been okay at the time,
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.000]   in any case, it ain't okay now, and they got to figure this out.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.560]   Facebook allowed the device companies to access the data of users' friends
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.080]   without their explicit consent.
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.760]   Which was the case in 2014 for apps?
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:45.040]   Even after declaring it would no longer share such information without siders.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:49.520]   Some device makers could retrieve personal information,
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:53.680]   even from user friends who believed they had barred any sharing the New York Times found.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:56.560]   Then Tim Cook says, "No, it didn't happen."
[00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:02.800]   Well, and Facebook also kind of took issue with their reporting,
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.880]   but in a very self-serving way.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:05.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.360]   Facebook had a non-denial denial.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:11.200]   Tim Cook says, "We've never been in the data business."
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.760]   The things mentioned in the Times article about relations--
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.920]   Well, they tried to be for a while.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:17.200]   Actually--
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:21.760]   And they also keep data on you and your apps in a way,
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.080]   and then they piss off publishers,
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.320]   because they don't allow publishers to own the relationship.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.200]   Apple's not so purely a joke.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.800]   Well, and I've said this for a long time,
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.560]   which always irritates the Apple people.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.880]   But it's clearly true.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.600]   And remember, they were going to do iAds,
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.840]   which were in advertisements that would clearly--
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.480]   Hang on.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.280]   --been targeting you.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.560]   That failed.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.360]   Well, guess what?
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.000]   Exactly.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.360]   According to the Wall Street Journal,
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.360]   Apple is looking to expand advertising business
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.160]   with new network apps, with new network for apps.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.680]   In its control world where it knows a heck of a lot about you,
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.800]   and we'll be sharing data.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.520]   Guess what?
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.000]   They have met with Snap, Pinterest, and other companies
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.520]   about participating in an Apple network
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.400]   that was distributed ads across their collective apps.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.080]   Now, you and I both know, Jeff,
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.800]   there's no way advertisers are going to buy those ads,
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.080]   unless they can target them.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.120]   Yes.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.040]   It's not competitive if you can't target it.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:16.080]   Right.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:16.960]   Why would they buy it?
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.440]   So, yeah.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.280]   Yes, I have.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.200]   Under the concept discussed internally and raised
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.680]   with potential partners, users searching in Pinterest app
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.120]   for drapes might turn up an ad distributed by Apple
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.800]   for an interior design app.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.400]   Snap users searching for the NFL might see an ad for a ticket
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.080]   reseller app, one of the people said.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:44.800]   So Apple is only pro your privacy as long as it's good for them.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.440]   It's it's.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.160]   Right.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.440]   As long as they've failed so far at delivering a good marketing-based business.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.000]   Bingo.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:50.640]   So.
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.760]   Anyway, Tim Cook said, "No, no, no.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.760]   We never... Apple requested..."
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:02.480]   "This is so far into us, and not data we've ever received at all,
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.760]   or requested zero."
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:04.880]   So, somebody's lying.
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.880]   I don't know if it's Facebook or Apple.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.720]   Here's what Cook said.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.840]   "What we did was, we integrated the ability to share
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:14.080]   in the operating system and made it simple to share a photo
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:14.880]   and that sort of thing."
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.720]   So that is true.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:21.680]   In the operating system, Facebook and Twitter were kind of preordained.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.320]   If you once you connected your Facebook and Twitter account,
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.240]   you could share within Apple Apps right to Facebook and Twitter.
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.080]   And that was a nice convenience.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.640]   By the way, a convenience which has been eliminated apparently
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.800]   from Mojave, the next version of Mac OS,
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:38.320]   doesn't have that connect with Twitter or connect with Facebook anymore.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:42.480]   Now, so it's interesting how
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:48.560]   I think Apple... It's true that Apple's business model does not,
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:51.440]   for now anyway, does not require them to track you and so they don't.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:55.600]   Because they have you trapped in their ecosystem.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.640]   Right. Sorry, Susan.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.440]   Right. No, I was just going to say they may not have used the data,
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.880]   but they had access to it too.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.360]   Yeah.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:01.680]   Right.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.480]   That's a totally...
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.120]   Right.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:03.600]   Good point.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.120]   Back to the Facebook.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.880]   If I were them, and the Lord knows I'm not one of them, but if I were them,
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:20.480]   I'd be hiring some major consultant to go and basically do an audit of everything
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.960]   2017 and earlier.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:31.520]   Every old deal, every old API, every old business structure and just see what still is living on
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.560]   and get rid of it before it comes and bites again.
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.600]   It just keeps on coming.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:40.240]   It's a fertile field for reporting, that's for sure.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:44.480]   Well, what happens when they discover something that's actually making them money?
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.080]   Right.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.680]   Well, at some point, now there's a different balance of the potential damage.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:52.320]   Though damage hasn't really been there.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.120]   They haven't lost business.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.080]   They haven't lost users.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.520]   They haven't lost stock value, but they're still damaged.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:03.600]   I think it's very cynical to me, but I think it's safe to say that any corporations
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.040]   number one concern is monetization.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.320]   They're there to make a profit.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:08.880]   Good job.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.440]   They have a duty to the stakeholders, especially if they're publicly held,
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.800]   to use every opportunity to make profit.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:22.640]   And Apple services now make more money than both iPad and Macintosh.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:25.840]   They made almost $10 billion in services this last quarter.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.720]   That's a big and growing part of their business, so it's not just a hard work company anymore.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:36.240]   iCloud, by the way, a bit Paul Manafort on the butt.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.040]   Did you see that?
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.640]   Yes, I did.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:45.760]   This is one of those cases where sometimes tech is just too hard for people.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:50.720]   So Manafort is being accused by the feds.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:55.280]   They want to withdraw his bail and put him back in jail because they say he's tampering
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:55.840]   with witnesses.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.360]   They're accusing him of tampering with witnesses.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:02.240]   Two witnesses contacted by Manafort provided the messages to the Fed.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:08.320]   Salling him out, basically, saying they were sending, he was using WhatsApp and Telegram,
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.480]   encrypted messaging services to contact them and persuade them to commit perjury.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:20.160]   The evidence obtained by the FBI came from Manafort's iCloud account.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.560]   Turns out, even though he was using encrypted messaging,
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:27.600]   the contents of the messages were being backed up, unencrypted to the iCloud.
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:34.080]   And of course, the feds sent a warrant to Apple and got the message content.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.920]   Does that happen automatically?
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:39.920]   I thought they already had a warrant to search his device.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:40.640]   Maybe they did.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:41.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.000]   I mean, iCloud, it was unclear whether this was a new warrant or existing warrant.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.840]   And the people he had contacted evidently contacted the authorities and said he's coming
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.440]   after us to tamper with our testimony.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:56.800]   My technical question is, if you're on an iPhone and you use Messenger,
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.800]   does it back up automatically to iCloud?
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.720]   If you back up to iCloud, most people do.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:03.360]   Apple encourages you to back up to iCloud.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.680]   So everything you do is backed up.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:09.120]   In fact, when you say...
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:17.200]   This is where things like Google Photos and iCloud and all of these services,
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:22.080]   you don't think about how far they go.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:26.240]   And that's why I'm saying tech is just sometimes too hard for people because
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.880]   you're like, "Oh, it's so convenient.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.680]   I get all my stuff when I lose my phone, me-do."
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:36.160]   But then you're like, "Oh, it does live somewhere that's not my phone."
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.840]   And that means other people can't it.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.240]   Here's the message you get from iCloud on.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.800]   Back up your chat history and media iCloud.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.760]   So if you lose your phone or switch to a new one, your chat history is safe.
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.200]   You can restore your chat history and media when you reinstall WhatsApp.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.160]   That should be, by the way, right there, a red flag.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:55.600]   It does say media and messages you back up are not protected
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.480]   by WhatsApp and encryption while in iCloud.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.360]   Oh, that's nice of them.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.000]   So you did...
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.920]   I mean, it was, he just didn't read that, but who does?
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:09.200]   And I think there is very much the general sense that, "Oh, Apple,
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:13.120]   everything's encrypted. Apple's protecting my privacy.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.480]   I don't have to worry about that."
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:19.040]   But it's backed up, unencrypted to the cloud.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.680]   And there is a box you can check that says encrypted,
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.760]   but it's not... This I'd like to find out more about,
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.080]   but I think that means it's encrypted on your machine.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.560]   I don't think it's not encrypted in the cloud.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:36.880]   Although I would say if you're going to tamper with witnesses,
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:41.120]   go the old-fashioned way, do it in person, do it on the phone.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.080]   Get a guy named Joe.
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.920]   Well, he has ankle bracelets.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.320]   Two.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.680]   Oh, he can't leave the house.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.680]   Okay, well, so then he should make...
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:48.960]   Well, his phone's probably tapped.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.920]   Yeah, he's screwed.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.760]   Then he's going to have to get creative.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:56.480]   Well, he's going to have to have a friend of mine who can have a child.
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:02.320]   It would be a shame if anything were to happen to you at a nice home.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:06.800]   Signal and wire don't allow you to backup.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:14.000]   Both messaging apps allow users to set up messages to self-destruct.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.520]   Signal and wire don't let you back up,
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.760]   so they manage to block that function in Apple.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.280]   Yeah, they're not part of the backup.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:22.880]   Not it.
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.480]   So just a word of warning.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:24.960]   If you...
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.440]   Next time you want to do a little witness tampering.
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:34.080]   Or anything really that might be considered illegal or ill-founded.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.160]   Or you just don't want anybody to know.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.080]   How did he communicate with the Russians?
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.000]   You think it would have some training along the way?
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:42.240]   No.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.160]   This stuff's hard.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:49.360]   No, but the competence level being exposed here is not super high.
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.920]   Do you remember when we were laughing at Facebook?
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.240]   In fact, Jeff, you came up with a solution for this.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:54.960]   I did.
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:55.920]   This is why I put it on there.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:56.240]   Yes.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:00.640]   They said, "If you don't want revenge nudes to be posted of you,
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:04.080]   we can prevent that, but first you need to send those nudes to us."
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.160]   That way...
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:10.640]   They'll hash them and destroy them, was the argument.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.520]   Yeah, but...
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.400]   That's what they do.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:16.160]   Yeah, but I think somebody's going to have to look at them just to make sure that they are...
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:16.880]   Yes, it says they're...
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.520]   Yes.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.240]   Fine.
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:18.400]   It is...
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:21.760]   Be reviewed by a human being, that alone, right?
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.960]   Now, I argued when we discussed this originally,
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:29.120]   that they should give you a hash so you can scan your own photos
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.440]   and send the hash to Facebook already hashed.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:31.760]   Right.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.040]   And then the problem...
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:35.760]   But then you could...
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.760]   They're concerned that then you might hash just photos of yourself.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:40.160]   Right.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.400]   But the solution then to that is that when there is a match,
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.520]   then a human at Facebook...
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.800]   Then they review it.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:47.200]   Right.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.040]   But wait until there's...
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:52.160]   At least wait until there's a match before you look at my nude pictures.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.440]   It's a solution.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.200]   I think there are better ways to do this,
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.080]   but at least they're doing something about revenge porn.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.840]   So I can't really complain.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.600]   A team of five...
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:08.560]   Count them five Facebook employees will be looking at your nudes.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.680]   Unix, all of them.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.760]   I was curious about this.
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:12.960]   So five...
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.960]   Is this each photo or just a team of five is going to handle all revenge porn?
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:21.120]   I find it hard to believe that a team of five could handle the volume.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.000]   But how many people are going to send new photos?
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.680]   Well, how many people are going to send new photos?
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:26.640]   Well...
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.120]   So this was a confusing number of people to me.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:36.560]   And by the way, the image is transformed into a hash and deleted within seven days.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.200]   So they want to keep it around for a little longer so we can pass it around a little bit.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:46.160]   Well, my assumption is they will have a backlog and you've got seven days to do with it.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:47.680]   I could be wrong.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:53.360]   I mean, so the idea here is someone I break up with somebody and they've got naked pictures of me
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.360]   and I'm concerned about what they do with it.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:58.000]   I would send them my version of those pictures.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.840]   Your copy of those naked pictures.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.600]   Well, I presume you would have them to make a picture.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.000]   Right.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.920]   So there's that assumption.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.560]   And then there's also the assumption because hashes can be deceived by just altering bits of the
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.080]   original photo.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.600]   Yeah, you could just crop it.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.000]   It might...
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:12.960]   It would be different hash.
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:18.480]   So there's a lot to see concerned about.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.400]   Unless they just take the body part or something like that.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:20.960]   It's terrible.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.000]   I mean, it's terrible.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:22.960]   It's a terrible thing.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:23.360]   It's terrible.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.160]   We have to do all this.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:29.600]   I have several good friends who had this happen to them that, you know, malicious exes have
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:34.080]   distributed nude pictures of them and it is devastating and there's nothing you can do.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.160]   There really isn't anything you can do about it.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:36.800]   It's horrible.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.240]   This is why I'm like very against nude pictures.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.840]   I don't care what...
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:42.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.240]   Like, "Go second photos for you."
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.480]   It's kind of a sensible general statement here.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.400]   Don't let anybody take pictures of you.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:53.600]   I mean, the problem is it's your husband or boyfriend or somebody you love and trust at the moment.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:59.120]   Well, and guys also really pressure girls into that, especially younger girls.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.240]   There's a huge amount of pressure at younger ages to be like, "Ah, yeah.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.520]   So, it's so semi-pictured.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.240]   They're boobs.
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.600]   I want to see yours."
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.640]   It's like part of flirting.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.280]   Well, now, and now among young people, right?
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.360]   That sexting is very common.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:19.600]   So maybe the answer is there'll be nude pictures of everybody in the future, so it won't be a big deal.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.080]   So.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.880]   It's terrible.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.320]   Well, that would be my kind of answer, right?
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.360]   So that is your answer.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.040]   That is the ultimate publicness.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:29.520]   Right.
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:34.080]   So I was talking to somebody the other day who took a course in photography at Harvard many
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.280]   years ago with a famed photographer.
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.640]   Of course, it was Harvard.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.480]   And the first assignment, he said, "I want you to pair up for an assignment."
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.400]   So as this woman who told me this said, "Well, you look for the cute boy, the cute girl,
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:51.680]   and then you send a credit because the assignment was to go and photograph each other naked."
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:52.000]   What?
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.600]   What a horrible assignment.
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:58.880]   So because it's only way, only this way, so this professor, you understand how the person
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.440]   is making themselves vulnerable to you when you go take their portrait.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.760]   That professor's an dirty old man.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.120]   That ain't happened today.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.400]   One hopes.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.440]   I do remember an acting class.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:16.800]   I had a love scene, not a naked love scene, but you'd be kissing somebody, which is very hard,
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.720]   by the way, to just kiss somebody in an acting scene.
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:24.320]   But I had a partner and we'd rehearsed it and we got used to it, so it was fine.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:29.600]   And then the day of the performance, the acting teacher says, "Okay, switch partners."
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:30.800]   It was like, "What?"
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:36.400]   It was not, it was surprisingly difficult.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.480]   But I think that was the intent, because if you're an actor, I think you have to get used to that,
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:40.720]   right?
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.440]   I don't think the last one.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.080]   I was watching a picture.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.680]   Don't tell me what's happened.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.880]   Do not tell me what's happened, because I have an episode and a half away from the end.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.800]   Watching the Americans is interesting.
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:51.840]   Nope, I can't hear anything.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.360]   I know, I can't either.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.240]   You're safe with me.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.120]   I've never seen it.
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:55.920]   Oh, it's great.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:56.880]   I want to see it.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:57.440]   I haven't seen it.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:00.480]   Everybody's raving about the last episode, like it's the best thing ever.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.440]   I don't want to hear anything.
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:02.080]   Jack room, nobody.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:02.880]   I want to hear anything.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:05.920]   But when they kiss, because you know, hey, I have a crush on her.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:06.800]   She's wonderful.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.280]   And so they had a crush on each other and they now are a couple and they're having a kid.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.320]   But they had a kid.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:16.160]   But when they kiss on the show, you just look at it differently, right?
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:20.240]   You know, it's not an actor that moment, but it isn't an actor at that moment.
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:21.360]   It's interesting to me.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:25.200]   Yeah, I always feel really bad for actors that have to do love scenes.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:25.840]   I really do.
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.920]   Well, and he's got this crazy Welsh accent.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.120]   Yeah, if you ever see him talk, you're like, what the what?
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.000]   Philip?
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:34.240]   No.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:38.240]   Oh, the actor himself is Welsh, but he plays an American.
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:38.880]   Yes.
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.560]   Well, or is he a Russian playing a Russian who plays an American?
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:42.800]   Wow.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.480]   So how many seasons?
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.720]   Five or so.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.000]   Wow, I got a lot to watch.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.320]   I'm saving some really good shows for the old age home, because I figure I'll be watching more TV then.
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.680]   Or down a little bit.
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.120]   You should watch the American soon.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.160]   I think I started.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.200]   Those don't be good shows.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.360]   I watched the first season.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.640]   It was not popular at the beginning.
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.760]   I liked us at the beginning.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.280]   I love her.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.240]   I think she's great.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.000]   Oh, she is just a bit of billions.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:06.880]   Have you watched billions?
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.160]   Billions is great.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.600]   I'm all on the date on billions.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.720]   Oh, what a good show.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.640]   Babylon Berlin.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.680]   Best show ever.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:14.240]   Excellent.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:17.600]   Also, interestingly, the most expensive TV show ever made.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:18.800]   Wow.
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.160]   I didn't I'm not sure why, but I guess they recreate Berlin in 1928.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:22.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.440]   Nominal.
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:24.640]   Yeah, that's a beautiful show.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.600]   Okay.
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.040]   Now, here's the other question.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.280]   No, we like talking TV.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:31.680]   Give up.
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.000]   I had to give up on Hamman's Tale.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:34.960]   It was too dystopian.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:35.680]   I couldn't watch it.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.320]   It was grim.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:36.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.520]   Do it season two.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.120]   I gave up season two.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:39.680]   I gave up season two.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:40.640]   I gave up season one.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.600]   I after what I couldn't.
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.400]   I watched I was stuck on a plane.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.200]   So I watched that.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.800]   I gave up midway through season one,
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.240]   and then I watched the rest on the plane.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.080]   But then I was like season two.
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.760]   I was like, no, I can't.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.520]   Did you start at all or no?
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:56.240]   No, I saw some of the I actually know I did see.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:57.760]   I saw a screener at the first screener,
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.920]   and I was like, nope, done.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.040]   I didn't make it through the episode.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:05.760]   Oh, Sonos has announced a new speaker with...
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:06.320]   Yes.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:08.320]   Madam-ay.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.520]   Madam-ay built in.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.880]   It's the Sonos Beam 399.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:16.160]   It is designed to be a sound bar, but it's small.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.560]   Somebody could, I think it was Dieter Bonin,
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.080]   the first compared it to a baguette.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.440]   It's 24 inches.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.320]   It look at all the speakers in here,
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.560]   and it has Madam-ay built in.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.040]   So it would not...
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.000]   The thinking is...
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   And HomeKit, right?
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.120]   And HomeKit.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.160]   The thinking is...
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.440]   And Google, right?
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:42.080]   It has seven array mics.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.000]   It doesn't do Google out of the box.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:44.480]   Oh, no.
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.520]   No Google out of the box.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:45.920]   Sorry.
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.680]   So just Siri and Alexa.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:50.400]   They say eventually, Google Assistant.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.640]   It does support AirPlay 2 Apple's new protocol,
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.640]   which they just put out a year after they announced it.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.640]   So the idea of this is...
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.920]   Dieter Bonin says it is like a Dieter Ram's
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:03.360]   design digital baguette.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.640]   It is...
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:10.320]   The idea is it's for somebody who wants a...
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.360]   You know, Assistant device,
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.440]   but doesn't want to have one sitting in the living room.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.040]   So this is your TV sound bar,
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.960]   and it's your assistant,
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.480]   which I think is an interesting idea.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.680]   That's...
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.480]   Yeah, you're going to stop seeing standalone assistants
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.600]   in another year or two.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:26.240]   I think you're right.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:26.720]   Which makes sense.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.400]   I think you're right.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:28.400]   I mean, this is...
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.840]   You can now have it in a thermostat.
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.360]   So now it's in your hallway.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.720]   I've got it in light switches.
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.200]   So now it's wherever that needs to be.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:38.400]   And in your media places,
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.160]   you'll have your Sonos devices.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.920]   And I don't know,
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.680]   what else has these things built in?
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:46.480]   And both Google and Amazon are really fostering this, right?
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.360]   They have APIs.
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.360]   They make it easy for companies to do this.
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:53.360]   So I actually, in the information a couple weeks ago,
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:57.200]   did a story talking about how if you are an
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:01.200]   "Madam A" enabled device hardware partner,
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.800]   that Google doesn't sound like a machine.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.720]   It sounds a little seen, Madam A.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.200]   Madam A sounds like S&M or something.
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:07.840]   We keep going.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.320]   Your mind out of the gutter,
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.440]   it is a responsible...
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.360]   It's like a polite name for something.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.640]   Yeah, I just call it echo.
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:16.160]   I know, but it just sounds so mysterious.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:16.880]   Echo seems safe.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.640]   Echo does seem safe.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:22.800]   Okay, so let's see if I can find that information article.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.560]   'Cause that was really interesting that they didn't...
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.000]   So that if they know that you're doing that,
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.760]   they say, "No, you're not gonna be able to use our Madam A."
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.200]   Right.
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:31.840]   Interesting.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.240]   So there is a little competition going on.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.320]   Yep.
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:36.800]   Yep.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:37.120]   Yep.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.000]   One of the yetta.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.440]   You got it aside.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.360]   Amazon themselves have launched...
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.320]   This is weird.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:46.320]   Four new PC designs with Madam A built in.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.720]   So...
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.760]   You're doing my show.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.560]   This is you, baby.
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.600]   We were talking about this on...
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.400]   This is what Kevin and I talked about.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.760]   On this weekly, these are with something called ODMs.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.440]   So it turns out Dell and other companies,
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:02.320]   actually, in many cases, don't manufacture their own computers.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:06.400]   They are manufactured by original design manufacturers, ODMs,
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.840]   and then sold by other people's brands.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.680]   So whether this...
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:17.280]   I'm not sure if this will be over an Amazon brand.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.720]   The lineup includes all in one desktops from Wistron,
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.600]   Compile, Quantum, none of whom you've ever heard of,
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.640]   but you probably owned at some point a Wistron or a Compile.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.360]   They also make their big server in...
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.200]   They started out in the server business with them.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.400]   Now they do the PCs.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:34.640]   Right.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.320]   So there's a couple of notebooks, convertible notebooks.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.600]   There's an all-in-one PC.
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:44.000]   And all of these have Madam A built in.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.320]   I'm not sure if that means Amazon will sell them,
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:53.680]   or if Amazon's going to make them available to HP Lenovo.
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:55.360]   And I guess you're speaking of Lenovo,
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:00.800]   that Lenovo Google Home is coming in a few weeks.
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:03.680]   You know, we saw that on B&H Photo.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.640]   They took it down.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.600]   And they took it down.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:05.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.000]   But it was the ship date was 9-3,
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.760]   which I believe is Labor Day or the day.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:10.560]   It's supposed to be July 7th.
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.000]   What's the price of that one going to be?
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   No, it's...
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.800]   You could pre-order, but the ship date was 9-3.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.280]   Right.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.080]   Pre-dollar price.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:22.160]   It depends on if it's an 8-inch or a 10-inch.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.120]   Yeah, but a nice big one,
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.240]   and that's the one I'd like to get.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:27.680]   I love that everybody hates their Echo Show, but I love it.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:30.960]   You know, I don't love mine, but I do want...
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:32.880]   - Which screen is nice. - Especially if I keep the...
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:36.720]   Yeah, if I keep my Google stuff, then...
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:40.000]   or rather buy the Google stuff,
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.120]   then I would want it.
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.320]   Because it is nice to be like,
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.600]   "Who's at the door?"
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:44.400]   and see a picture of it.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:44.560]   Yes.
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.480]   Exactly.
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.320]   Or Jimmy Fallon's monologue.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.720]   My daughter watches.
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.880]   She asks Madam A for...
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.880]   - YouTube videos and stuff.
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:59.520]   Did you read the Wall Street Journal article,
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.640]   Kristen Grind and Deepa Cetharaman
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.000]   behind the messy, expensive split
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.760]   between Facebook and WhatsApp's founders?
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:13.440]   I split with Wall Street Journal, so I can't read it.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.760]   I didn't have access to it either.
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:18.080]   Oh, but I can tell you that the Lidovo ones,
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:22.640]   I'll tell you, 8 inches, 150, 10 inches, 229, 99.
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:23.440]   That's very great.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:25.280]   That's much cheaper than the show.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.200]   And they're nice, and they can go...
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:30.160]   The big one I think goes in portrait and landscape.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:30.560]   So...
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.160]   It's got that weird dog ear to hold it up.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.400]   Okay, sorry.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:36.960]   Back to that.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:41.120]   Apparently, the WhatsApp creators are leaving $1.3 billion
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.360]   on the table walking away from Facebook.
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.720]   Now remember, they made $22 billion.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.240]   Yeah, exactly so.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.880]   So it's not like they're going away poor.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:56.400]   But apparently, the dispute was whether there should be ads in WhatsApp.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:00.720]   The WhatsApp duo of Jan Koom and Brian Acton
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.080]   had persistent disagreements.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:05.520]   We kind of know that because both of them have tweeted nasty things about
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:08.160]   Facebook Acton said everybody should get off Facebook.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:08.880]   It's terrible.
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:13.360]   In recent years, the two have battled Mark Zuckerberg
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:17.760]   and Cheryl Sandberg, who grew impatient for a greater return on the company's
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:22.080]   2014 blockbuster $22 billion purchase of the messaging app.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.840]   Many of the disputes with Facebook involved how to manage data privacy.
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:30.160]   We're not surprised Facebook wanted some of that WhatsApp info.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.360]   Also, about making money from WhatsApp's large user base,
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:39.360]   including through targeted ads, which Koom and Acton had long opposed.
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:44.480]   In the past couple of years, Sandberg and Zuckerberg pushed the WhatsApp founders
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.680]   to be more flexible and move faster in other plans to generate revenue.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:53.440]   Once after Koom said, "I don't have enough people to implement a project you propose.
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:56.400]   Zuckerberg dismissed him with, 'I have all the people you need.'"
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.840]   That makes sense.
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.600]   You paid $22 billion for something.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.200]   You want to make a little money back to it.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:09.440]   Well, if you paid $22 billion for something, and then you told them that you weren't going
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:13.840]   to do something and then decided to change your mind, I think that's a little different.
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:19.840]   When you decide if you're going to promise them not to sell ads,
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:24.000]   but you're still going to shell out $22 billion, maybe they're not worth it.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.720]   Right. When Facebook, this is again, Wall Street Journal,
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:30.880]   when Facebook bought WhatsApp, you never publicly addressed how the
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:32.960]   divergent philosophies would go exist.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:35.440]   The WhatsApp founders were very privacy focused.
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.960]   That's why they created WhatsApp.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:40.160]   Zuckerberg told stock analysts that he and Koom agreed,
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.520]   "Advertising wasn't the right way to make money for messaging apps."
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:48.320]   Zuckerberg also said he promised the co-founders the autonomy to build their own products.
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.960]   That's what you say at every time you buy some.
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.040]   Right. This is again.
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:54.080]   This is again.
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:56.480]   Mark is not a trustworthy individual.
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:01.040]   He is very much whatever needs to happen will happen.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:04.800]   Maybe let's call it real politic if we're being nice, but I would just say he's a straight up player.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:05.760]   Trustful to get to whom?
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:07.920]   Do his shareholders? That's the other way to look at it.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:14.560]   His shareholders then, you can't go spending $22 billion on something
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:21.040]   and promise them that you're not going to do the one thing that could make you that money.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:26.960]   Yeah. All I'm saying, this is Steve everybody enough and makes this point,
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:30.080]   where he says that I'm too optimistic about companies.
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.400]   The companies must be companies. They can't be anything else, but
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:36.640]   and so of course they're going to do this and that's why they should just recognize.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:42.240]   Right. Well, if we want to recognize that, then we should take much stronger steps to
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:48.560]   rein them all in, I think. These guys are promising to be so social, to be so
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:51.440]   lovely and friendly and change the world for the better.
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.760]   They had stayed till this November.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:57.920]   Acting left last year, Koom leaves mid-August officially.
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:03.120]   If they stayed till November, both would have been fully vested,
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:08.800]   which would have meant $900 million to Brian Acton, $400 million to Yankoom.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:13.840]   They were so unhappy that they left that money on the table and walked,
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:16.000]   even though all they would have had to do is stay till November.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000]   Yeah, but they already had money.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.160]   I mean, I guess we'll share a billion or two. It doesn't really.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.360]   Well, yeah.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.000]   Still, I don't know.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.680]   I mean, yes, it's a lot of money to walk away from, but they probably felt pretty bad.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:40.320]   I mean, put yourself in their shoes. They created this thing and it is now that they sold it,
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.960]   which was probably kind of dumb of them. And now-
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:43.920]   No, it wasn't touching.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:44.400]   They're well-
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.120]   Are you kidding?
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.080]   You got $200 million.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:46.160]   So-
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:46.160]   So-
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.600]   That was the best score-
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:51.760]   From their point of view based on what they built it for.
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:56.080]   Then they're having this attack of conscience. It's conscience.
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:00.080]   It's probably easier to walk away from that so they can sort of still live with themselves.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:05.760]   The journal says that it wasn't a spoken disagreement. There was a lot of passive,
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:12.880]   aggressive stuff going on. The WhatsApp employees were very sound noise-sensitive.
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:16.640]   And so there's a sign here that says, "Please keep noise to a minimum.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.160]   A sign in WhatsApp's office is at Facebook headquarters. Some Facebook employees
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:24.240]   mocked WhatsApp with a chance of, "Welcome to WhatsApp. Now shut up."
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:28.240]   [laughter]
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:31.120]   A komb was from the Ukraine-
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.080]   Not the Ukraine.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:32.960]   It was from Ukraine.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:33.520]   Ukraine.
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:33.920]   Thank you.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:40.160]   And very focused on privacy. They sat across from each other at Yahoo.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:43.280]   Remember that story? It was a great story. And hated it.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:47.840]   And they left Yahoo because they were really upset with the display ads.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:51.360]   They thought it was garish. It ruined the user experience.
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:55.920]   So they kind of melded over how much they hated the ad experience at Yahoo.
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:01.120]   And they wanted to launch WhatsApp ad-free. Remember that charge 99 cents?
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:04.480]   No ads designed to be secure.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:09.760]   And the only thing is how do you actually, when you sell your company,
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:12.080]   you give up your company and sell it.
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:12.160]   That's called selling it.
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:12.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:17.520]   I mean, are you going to have a, what do you call it when you have a piece of property that has it?
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.560]   Yeah, but they have a duty.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:23.040]   They have a duty and they tried to meet it to their users
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:27.520]   where they had stipulations on the sale.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.480]   That's a good point.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:33.840]   But there weren't stipulations. Were there contractual stipulations on the sale?
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:34.160]   Apparently.
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:35.360]   You can't do that when you sell a company.
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.080]   There never are.
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:36.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.080]   There's two reasons I've never sold.
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.040]   Who is I going to let you?
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:40.800]   There's two reasons I've never sold to it.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:43.600]   I mean, I really seriously, I never wanted to give any.
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.600]   I knew you sell it, you give up control.
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:46.560]   I never even took investors.
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:47.920]   The other reason is nobody offered.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:50.000]   But that's neither here.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.640]   I always wanted to keep control.
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.080]   It's, you know, if you even take investment, you're giving up control.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.280]   That's just what happens.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.200]   It's just reality.
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:27:59.920]   Everybody knows.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.440]   And, yeah.
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:05.520]   So I'm not arguing Stacy that they weren't fighting the right fight,
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.160]   fighting the right battle.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:06.880]   I'm going to say this now.
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:10.480]   It's naive as hell to think once you're selling a company that you still have control of it.
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:11.920]   You don't, that's the definition of sale.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:12.560]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.360]   You gave it up.
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:14.640]   Wait a minute.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.160]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:18.960]   Mr. Zuckerberg assured Messers-Kumen Acton at the time,
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.440]   this is the Wall Street Journal report, that he would not place advertising in the messaging
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:23.920]   service.
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:28.160]   They also negotiated an unusual clause in their contracts that said,
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.000]   "If Facebook insisted on making any additional monetization initiatives,
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.800]   such as advertising in the app, it could give the executives good reason to leave
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.760]   and cause an acceleration of stock awards to have investors."
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:41.120]   Why didn't they get their full vesting then?
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:44.640]   Well, we didn't even get it accelerated.
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:45.840]   Maybe they got it accelerated.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.920]   More than nobody really knows.
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:55.040]   Acted initiated the clause, but Facebook's legal team threatened to fight.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:57.360]   So already worth more than three billion.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:58.320]   Acton just walked away.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.080]   He left 900 million on the table.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:02.800]   There you go.
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:04.880]   Yeah, but that's in your contract.
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:05.440]   That's what it is.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:09.360]   And there's always a clause that says they can change your mind and here's what it costs you.
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:09.680]   Right.
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:16.400]   Yeah, we don't know that there won't be more action in this.
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.520]   It's a great story.
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.680]   It'd be worth paying for the Wall Street Journal just to get that.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:22.720]   That's pretty expensive.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:23.680]   You can't do it, huh?
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:25.120]   Wow.
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.400]   See, I won't pay for Bloomberg.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:34.160]   I won't pay 35 bucks a month for the Bloomberg website, but the journal I'll pay for.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:37.680]   The only one that's bugging me that I haven't paid for yet that I may end up paying for
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:41.840]   just because of what we do here, but I have is wired.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.520]   Oh, why?
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:44.880]   Wired's only five bucks a month.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.160]   Yeah, super cheap.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:46.640]   That's worth it.
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:47.520]   And you get a UB key.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.560]   Yeah.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:51.840]   I think Conda did the right thing with Wired.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:54.000]   I'm really surprised Bloomberg's asking for so much.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.520]   Although they have great content, I'll probably end up paying it.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.840]   What's the order they asking?
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:00.960]   35 bucks a month.
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:03.440]   Well, that's a lot.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:07.200]   Dude, the Wall Street Journal was asking for 1815.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.000]   But you get a newspaper.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:08.480]   There are magicals.
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.320]   I don't want a newspaper.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.920]   Then I got to go down my front yard.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.360]   I got no, I got no.
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.400]   It's like a little bit of a thing.
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.120]   I just like grab it.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.400]   Yeah, no, that's not cool.
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.560]   Lisa, Lisa likes the newspaper.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.880]   Well, she can come down.
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.320]   She can walk down my driveway.
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:25.520]   I think we might be, we might have gone all digital, but we started.
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:31.360]   She subscribed to it early on, and then we got the digital as a result.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.600]   Hmm.
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:42.080]   Stacey, you can now get Madam A's echo look in your house for a mere $200.
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:47.440]   I saw that and I was like, but it's still so expensive.
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:50.480]   Leo, I'm sad that you never sent me yours because I have all kinds of fashion.
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:50.960]   It's yours.
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:52.560]   I'm sending it to you right now.
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:53.280]   All right.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.360]   Because I'm not going to use it.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:00.720]   I really want because I was like, oh, $200 is too much paper, but I'm really curious.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:01.680]   Merry Christmas.
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:02.960]   Whoo.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:03.760]   When's your birthday?
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.000]   April 12th.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:06.800]   Happy birthday.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:07.360]   I missed it.
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.560]   I'm so sorry.
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:09.440]   It's on its way.
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:14.400]   Here's a scary invasive camera that will take pictures of your clothing.
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:16.560]   And it's still linked to my account.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.240]   I'm going to fix that.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:18.480]   Oh.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:22.880]   No, I don't use it.
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:24.560]   So you're absolutely welcome to it.
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:25.040]   Would you like?
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:28.720]   I also have the scanning wand for your refrigerator.
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:29.280]   Would you like to?
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:30.160]   I'll throw that in.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:30.800]   Oh, you already have it.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:34.160]   No, my daughter, my daughter discovered that ours makes noise.
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.280]   I guess she never realized this.
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:37.920]   So actually the last two weeks she's been running around.
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:42.800]   You know, soon your Apple Watch will do that too.
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:43.520]   That'll be nice.
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:47.920]   The Apple Watch is adding walkie talkie functionality like those next tell
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:48.160]   funds.
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:50.800]   Remember how horrible that was when people had next tell funds?
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:54.080]   Did you ever get stuck with, you know, like in a subway car, Jeff or,
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:57.040]   you know, with those push.
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:59.760]   Oh, oh, all right.
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:02.000]   Leo, can you pick up some bread on the way home?
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:04.480]   I was thinking the other day.
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.680]   Yeah, honey.
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:08.480]   What is next till that was the only thing that was the cut them alive.
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:11.440]   And it was a key feature for some businesses, right?
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:13.120]   Yeah, a lot of construction people.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:13.760]   It was ahead.
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.360]   It was the end of the world.
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:16.320]   Look at that.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.520]   I'm going to pack that up.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:24.160]   That is going to use Stacy Higginbotham, your very own Leo Laport camera in your house.
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.400]   I'm just going to call it the echo look.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:32.400]   Would you do you know a favor that when you pose for it, would you say hi, Leo?
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.080]   No.
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:37.440]   No.
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:38.000]   No.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:38.400]   Oh, well.
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.920]   Oh, well.
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:43.360]   I'll give you my, I'll give you my feedback on the show.
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.080]   How's that?
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:45.360]   It's cool enough.
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:49.360]   I mean, it's, you know, it's got to, you know, maybe my outfits will be better.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:49.920]   That's what I'm going to do.
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.240]   You'll get more better results than I ever did.
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:52.560]   That's right.
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.320]   I have a lot more variety, you know.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:33:01.040]   No, it's not for me, obviously, but you, but you, but I mean, for somebody who has,
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:06.320]   I don't have outfits, but if somebody had outfits and looks, it would probably be a good thing.
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:12.640]   It's that this is the thing that does a style check and it will say which look is better.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:14.960]   And I'm not sure how it knows.
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:21.280]   And they say they do it with machine learning, but also human fashion experts.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:24.880]   I think I'd be very curious what you think of it, actually.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.440]   This is good.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.320]   I'm glad I can send it to you.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.280]   I'm glad we mentioned this.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:28.560]   I had no idea you wanted it.
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:30.000]   Yay.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:30.400]   Thank you.
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:34.640]   Anything you see of mine that you want, just tell me because most of this stuff ends up in a box.
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:35.600]   Oh, Tesla.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.400]   I have one of those.
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:39.600]   Dibs.
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:42.080]   Just like on it.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:46.560]   They're really, they're really knocking it out of the park with these batteries.
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:48.080]   This is a very interesting.
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.280]   Yeah.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:53.280]   From Australia to Puerto Rico, the company is changing the world's power grids,
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.840]   according to Fast Company and making renewable energy more reliable.
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:00.400]   These giant batteries store the energy.
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.000]   This is always a problem with solar arrays and wind arrays.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:11.200]   You can get a lot of juice, but the problem is at night or when the wind dies down,
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.480]   you don't have any.
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:13.680]   Storage is critical.
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:20.000]   So the cost of battery storage, thanks, I think, to great degree to Tesla,
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:31.360]   is dropping 73% between 10 and 2016 from $1,000 a kilowatt hour to $273 a kilowatt hour.
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:36.320]   And they expect that to keep dropping by 2025 to $70 a kilowatt hour.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:39.840]   So Bill Gross from ideal lab, our mutual friend.
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:40.640]   Yes.
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:45.600]   He has all kinds of businesses around energy storage involving hot rocks and all kinds of
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:50.480]   things he explained to me that a lot of times water is pumped up and then comes back down.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:52.000]   As an energy storage mechanism, right?
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:52.560]   Yeah.
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:57.600]   And the calculations around the cost per kilowatt hour is just fascinating, absolutely fascinating.
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:58.080]   I agree.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:02.960]   It really solves this issue of renewables because they're not consistent.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.160]   It's like a generator.
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:04.640]   Right.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:09.040]   And if you can solve this, it's going to be huge for us all.
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.880]   It's going to change the world.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:18.400]   So one research firm estimates annual energy storage deployments will go from
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:27.440]   2.3 gigawatt hours last year to almost 10 times greater in 2022 to 21.6 gigawatt hours.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:30.720]   And it's all about Tesla.
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:35.120]   They've really, you know...
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:37.200]   So is he uniquely good at making batteries?
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.840]   Is he having something in other batteries or is he just seeing a market different?
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:41.520]   I think he focused on it early on.
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:43.280]   And then of course...
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.400]   Put a whole bunch together.
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.000]   Built the Gigafactory, right?
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:49.440]   I think Elon was really smart.
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:53.440]   He doesn't see electric cars as the end game.
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:36:00.080]   It was a step along the road to a better world.
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:03.680]   We're not relying on fossil fuels.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:04.320]   I mean, he really...
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.280]   He wrote it all out.
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:07.760]   It's really...
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:12.080]   But less a better world and more like stopping us from killing it, like destroying the world
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.120]   before we get to Mars.
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:13.840]   Yeah, a world we continue to live in.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:14.640]   Right.
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:16.880]   You know, Mars, Mars, you know, someday.
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.440]   Well, no, I mean, that's his plan though.
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.480]   That was his...
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:21.280]   He likes Mars.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:21.680]   It's just...
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.920]   Well, that's fair.
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:24.880]   Oh, give him that.
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:25.440]   It's fine.
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:27.440]   It's like, I like Mars too.
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.200]   I don't know if I'd really want to live there.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.760]   I question whether we'll be able to live there, frankly,
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:33.520]   whether it'll be worth the energy.
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:35.520]   What do you think of this?
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:39.440]   Now, I love Nuzzle.
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:40.720]   I'm a big fan of Nuzzle.
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:45.040]   Friend... We've had Jonathan on the guy who created Friendster.
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.360]   And Nuzzle is something he created.
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:48.480]   I use it all the time.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.240]   They've decided to...
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:55.520]   Do... Jonathan Abrams, who founded it, has decided to do something that...
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:58.560]   Actually, Elon was thinking about doing with his Proveda thing.
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.320]   Nuzzle rank.
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:06.480]   An authority ranking of news sources using signals from top business influencers.
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:07.440]   Have you seen this, Jeff?
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.720]   Yeah, I am.
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:10.080]   Jonathan said it to me.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.040]   I think it's very interesting.
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:14.720]   And I'm going to be doing a fair amount of work around this question of
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:20.400]   how to help determine quality in news.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:21.920]   And not an easy thing to do at all.
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:24.480]   So are the sun lights coming out of my house?
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:29.840]   I like the idea that it will incorporate signals from actual users.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:30.240]   The behavior...
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:31.040]   Yeah, I think that's...
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.560]   So here's the way I ran a session at Newsguysed on this.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:40.000]   Here's the six areas of signals about quality that I see.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:40.400]   Ready?
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:43.600]   One, self-declared signals.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.800]   A trust project.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:47.600]   I, Sally Lerman, and Nerchur Jingeris,
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:52.000]   do 80 news sites have promised to ascribe to certain standards.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.440]   And that needs to be audited.
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:55.040]   Two, observed signals.
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:00.000]   Add companies like Trust Metrics and Moats look at sites and say,
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.160]   "Oh, they have junky ads or they have hate speech or they're this or that."
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:06.320]   Three, algorithmic, scaling of the above.
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:10.640]   Four is behavior.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.240]   You've failed 100 fact checks.
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.960]   Five is public opinion, which is that.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.120]   Some subset of the public.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:20.080]   And six is endorsements.
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:22.720]   I trust you, Leo, to tell me who good tech sites are.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:27.680]   And at the end, there's all kinds of people doing signals across all those kinds of areas,
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:29.040]   and they're all disparate.
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.360]   And I'm going to try to work on a project to bring them all together
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:36.720]   into an aggregation to make them useful to platforms and add networks
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:37.760]   and agencies.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:43.440]   So all these efforts to create more signals around quality and lack thereof in news,
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.360]   I salute and I'm glad it's there.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.960]   I'll be curious about that, because as a small site,
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:52.320]   I feel like I'm eminently credible in the area that I cover,
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:56.560]   but conveying that can be tough in the idea of having...
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.120]   This is really key.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:57.840]   Right.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:01.120]   Well, an audit or something like that is interesting.
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:05.840]   So long as it's something that I can, as a single person or two person shop,
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:06.800]   can handle, right?
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:08.800]   So that gets...
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:10.640]   I'm like, "Ooh, is it dark?"
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:11.360]   Well, I think it's credible.
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.920]   Look up the trust project, Stacey.
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:14.880]   I will look it up.
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:18.640]   Is it something that I think is mainly for larger sites,
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:20.800]   the Washington Post is doing it, the Globe Mail is doing it.
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:26.640]   And I'll be interested to hear what burden it would be on a small site,
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:27.600]   maybe done it all.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:32.480]   It's things like labeling opinion versus news coverage,
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.960]   having a masthead, having a reporter bio, and things like that.
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:35.840]   But let me know.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.280]   Here's what Jonathan writes.
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:40.640]   "Prepriate, there are three components to calculating a Nuzzle Rank Score.
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.320]   Proprietary Nuzzle Data, including reading behavior of our users.
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:45.600]   I read Nuzzle every day.
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:47.280]   It's part of my news gathering.
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:50.800]   So they pay attention to what I click on, what I read.
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:55.360]   Integration of external signals about the engagement and authority of news sources.
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:58.080]   I'm not sure what that means, but it's kind of what you were talking about, Jeff.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:00.160]   That's what I'm talking about is all those things that may exist.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:00.880]   Right.
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:04.800]   And then partnerships with initiatives like the trust project.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:05.920]   And news guard.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:10.480]   And so they have 100,000 sources, Nuzzle does.
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:16.240]   So presumably with 100,000, that would include Stacey on IoT and a lot of other things.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:17.200]   That's a lot.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:20.160]   If people link to it, if I link to Stacey on IoT enough and you do,
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:21.120]   then Nuzzle picks it up.
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:21.600]   That's something.
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:22.160]   Right.
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:22.720]   Right.
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:28.400]   And surveying is not, I think, a good...
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:29.680]   You can't ask somebody.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:30.960]   Is this trust or not?
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:33.520]   Well, it's in Facebook.
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:34.720]   It's that around Broly Trusted.
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:39.120]   But I talked to a guy named Raspis Klais Nielsen, who's a brilliant researcher at Oxford Internet.
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:42.000]   Oxford Institute for the Study of Journalism.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.960]   And he argued that it is an important factor.
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.200]   That it's only one and it can be outweighed by other factors.
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:55.920]   But next week, he's releasing a study on top news sites against political views and other
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:56.400]   factors.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:01.600]   And he argued that that matters because it's what the public is telling you one way or another.
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:06.400]   What's interesting about Nuzzles is he's defining it as business leaders.
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:07.280]   Now, I don't know how he's...
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:11.280]   If he's cutting off some users and emphasizing others, I have no idea what he's doing.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.600]   But Nuzzle is pretty much a news junkie service.
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:14.720]   Well, it's kind of...
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:20.240]   It sounds a little bit like Google's PageRank, which is the higher ranked,
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:23.600]   the source that's ranking you, the more the stronger that signal.
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.240]   I heard somebody recently say that PageRank is as much as a goner,
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:29.760]   because it's just got game so much.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:30.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:30.880]   That's too bad.
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:33.040]   Gaming is always a problem.
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:33.920]   It's going to be a problem with it.
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:35.520]   It's always, always the problem.
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:37.200]   Humans are terrible that way.
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:40.080]   So I went to nuzzle.com/rank and it's not live yet,
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:42.880]   but I look forward to seeing it on...
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:45.280]   It's nuziel.com if you want to.
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:46.320]   We had Jonathan on the show.
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:47.120]   Have you had a lot of fun?
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:48.480]   I've done triangulation with him.
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.600]   I like Jonathan a lot.
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:50.880]   I think he's been on...
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.560]   We could get him on again.
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:54.640]   I think he's been on with us, actually.
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:54.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:55.600]   I can't remember.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:57.600]   Yeah, I like him a lot.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:59.120]   And I think what he's doing with Nuzzle...
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:02.480]   He's kind of hung in there because I think it's probably been tough.
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:04.160]   It has been.
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:04.400]   Yeah.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:08.720]   It's the case of having a good service without necessarily
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:09.760]   coming in with the business model,
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:11.840]   but it's a really good service.
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:12.720]   I use it every day too.
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:13.920]   Yeah.
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:16.640]   I actually told Alan...
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:18.240]   Oh gosh, what's his last name?
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.480]   Now he's the editor-in-chief over at Time Inc.
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.920]   or Meredith or whatever.
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:22.160]   Alan.
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:23.360]   Whoever owns it now.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:24.640]   Alan Murray, thank you.
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.480]   He was asking me where I like,
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:27.680]   how I kept track of everything.
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:29.920]   And I was like, oh, Nuzzle, it's great.
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:31.120]   So he started using it.
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:35.120]   Well, the irony of Nuzzle is it gets his signals from Twitter
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:36.720]   and if you included Facebook.
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:41.840]   So it's a great way to stand top of what's going on in Twitter
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.280]   without reading Twitter.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.080]   I really like it.
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:45.360]   I really like it for that reason.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:45.760]   She...
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:46.560]   I'm curious.
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:47.680]   I'll roll this.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:50.240]   Are you guys been using the new Google News?
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:51.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:52.080]   Every day.
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:52.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.600]   Mine's still not getting better, Jeff.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.320]   I'm not loving it.
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:57.520]   I am constantly telling it how sucky I think
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:58.960]   its decisions are to me.
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:01.120]   And it is constantly showing me sucky decisions.
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:02.560]   Let me see what my top five are,
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.080]   just out of curiosity.
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.280]   Because yeah, I think it varies.
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:06.640]   It does vary.
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:07.280]   I agree.
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:08.400]   CNN, number one,
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:11.120]   Trump's great night for Republicans in the California primaries.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:12.720]   Wasn't so great after all.
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:15.120]   Number two, NBC News,
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:17.040]   Melania Trump making her first appearance.
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.320]   Jalopnik, number three,
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:20.160]   Tear Down of Tesla's Model 3 battery.
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.680]   So it does kind of know what my interests are.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:24.560]   Number four, FCC Accuser Spreading Lies.
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:27.440]   Number five, the Beam, Sonos is at the ambition.
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:30.320]   So those four or five are actually all articles I would read.
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.240]   It's clearly paying attention to my signals.
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:33.280]   But remember,
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:34.880]   Stacy, if you hit the headlines button,
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:38.240]   that's not in any way algorithmic.
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:39.840]   That's just all the news.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.120]   Right.
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:42.480]   But it's not really what it's done.
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:45.840]   So my Stacy's briefing today is President Trump today.
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.520]   Trump predicts Red Wave,
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:49.920]   Keenan Thompson, SNL,
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:54.240]   Kanye's Project Wyoming from Pitchfork.
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:56.640]   And then Valve says it will now everything on Steam,
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:59.280]   unless it's illegal or quote, straight up trolling.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.560]   Of those stories,
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:03.840]   I would probably only click on the Valve one.
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:06.640]   And I'm talking.
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:08.160]   I'm President Trump today.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.400]   This is basically a home run for Democrats.
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:13.760]   Attempted burglary of a car on the next town over.
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:15.760]   Siri, Google Alexa,
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:18.240]   aren't yet equipped to handle people with suicidal tendencies.
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:19.440]   Uh oh.
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:20.800]   It's interesting how different our fight is.
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:23.760]   Here's everything new in Android P development preview.
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:26.000]   It's funny how different these three are.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:26.720]   So different.
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:28.560]   Wow.
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:33.120]   I still have so much celebrity news that's ridiculous.
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:34.640]   I had more.
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:35.200]   This is the first.
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:36.800]   That's usually my complaint Stacy.
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:37.600]   I agree.
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.760]   This one funnily enough, it's down.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:42.400]   You've gone into favorites and taken that out, right?
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:46.640]   I am Google Pixel Book is now only $749 for Brothers Day.
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:46.640]   Yes.
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:47.040]   You see that?
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:48.320]   They dropped the price a lot.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.160]   See, I do not get these.
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.000]   That's a good price.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.840]   Ghost of John Perry Barlow lives on in his posthumous memoir.
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:57.440]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:58.000]   I didn't know that.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:58.720]   So these are things that I'm interested.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:01.440]   I gotta say, it's better than last time I lived with you.
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:02.640]   Oh, I just saw that on Twitter.
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:05.280]   I, yeah.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:06.160]   Oh, there you go.
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:07.760]   So this is good.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.360]   So they have a Father's Day gift guide.
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:09.760]   Let's see.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:10.480]   This is good.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:16.640]   The Google Pixel Book save $250 on the 128.
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:18.560]   Oh, it's the low end one, not the high end one.
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:24.000]   Did you say it was the high end one, Jeff?
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:26.080]   That's what the headlines sound.
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:28.240]   I think they mean Pixel high end in general.
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:28.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:29.600]   Yeah, not high end.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.200]   Pixel puppy high end.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:35.360]   So $750 for the base model, which is what I have.
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:36.960]   You and I both have, and it's fine.
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.880]   That's a good price.
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:40.080]   $750.
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:43.600]   That's a, I think that's fair for that.
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:45.520]   Students can save 10%.
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:48.640]   All right, let's see.
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:49.920]   They are adding new phones.
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:51.520]   Oh, really on top of that?
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:53.520]   I don't know if it's on top of that.
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:55.600]   They are adding new phones to a Google Fi.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:59.760]   I'm happy to say you can now use Motorola.
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:02.960]   There are a couple of phones from Motorola, like the G5, the G6.
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:05.840]   You can also add your kids to a family plan now.
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:08.880]   Oh, the Google Fi family plan can now include kids.
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:10.080]   Oh, that's good.
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:10.960]   And you're searching.
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:12.880]   But obviously it's up to the parent how it's run.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:15.760]   Someday, I really ask the phone.
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:18.720]   Actually, when they turn 13, you just pay for them on another.
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:19.600]   They're another adult.
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:21.360]   They're another adult.
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:23.840]   Dude, I don't want this is, this drives me nuts.
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:26.160]   Cause my child at 13 is not an adult.
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:26.400]   Right.
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:28.000]   She does get more.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.640]   She gets more things.
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:34.240]   But actually, 13 year olds should cost more than adults.
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.840]   On a phone?
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:36.240]   Yes.
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:37.680]   Of course they should.
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:40.240]   I don't talk on them.
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:41.600]   She uses it more than you do.
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:44.480]   Well, no, not more than no.
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:49.440]   My, my daughter, I bet she spends an hour on the phone a year.
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:49.840]   What?
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:51.360]   You mean talking?
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:56.560]   Well, yeah, talking, but also she has a phone that she never charges.
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:58.640]   She is constantly just on her computer.
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:46:59.200]   That's awesome.
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:02.400]   But it's because they don't go anywhere.
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:05.520]   And when they go places, they just go places with the,
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:08.400]   like she loads up her computer and like goes to a friend's house.
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:09.920]   Wow, that's so weird.
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:13.760]   She's an adult liar and she may also be too young.
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:17.920]   Well, her school is an outlier because all of her friends do this too.
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:18.320]   Okay.
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:20.720]   I think maybe, or maybe that's just what they think.
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:21.360]   Do what your friends do.
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:22.320]   You do what your friends do.
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:26.320]   So I have bad news, you guys.
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:26.560]   What?
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:31.440]   My special, like my, my dad said it was delivered.
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:32.160]   Let me, let me.
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:32.880]   And then it didn't come.
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:33.680]   Let me do an ad.
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:36.080]   Maybe it'll come during downstairs.
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:37.040]   Maybe it's by the garage.
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:38.400]   You said it was set up was delivered?
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:40.160]   So that's good.
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:41.120]   Maybe they put it in the garage.
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:41.680]   Go check.
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:42.400]   We'll find out.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:42.720]   Okay.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:47.840]   Our picks of the week coming up after this word from our sponsor, Moog Soft.
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:51.920]   You know, if you're an IT, you know, it's crazy out there.
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:55.040]   You're getting all these alerts and tickets lighten up your monitor,
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:57.040]   your phone, all these notifications.
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:58.800]   Sometimes they're coming so fast and furious.
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:47:59.840]   You don't even know what's wrong.
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.280]   You can't figure out what to do first.
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:04.000]   That's not being productive.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.200]   That's just being stressed out.
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:09.840]   No mere mortal can analyze all those alerts and respond to all those tickets.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:15.600]   And that's why you can use and need to use Moog Soft's AI ops to reduce the noise
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:17.920]   and get things done.
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:22.880]   Moog Soft's AI ops, AI stands for algorithmic IT ops.
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:30.000]   It's a platform that reduces your IT alerts and tickets by get this 99% guaranteed.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.880]   Up to 99% guaranteed.
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:38.000]   Moog Soft's AI ops platform integrates with all of your existing IT tools.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:38.720]   Of course it does.
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:39.760]   Otherwise it wouldn't be useful.
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:41.520]   You get all of those notifications.
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:45.840]   But then what happens is they're patented technology based on machine learning correlates
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.840]   events into situations.
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:54.320]   These are actionable work items and they're far fewer, but they're all correlated in together
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:58.480]   so you could focus on tackling the stuff that matters and get back to work.
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:01.040]   This is awesome.
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:04.480]   Here's a case study from HCL Technologies.
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:10.320]   They're a global IT managed service provider and they use Moog Soft's AI ops as the event
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:13.280]   management layer in their award-winning dry ice platform.
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:17.840]   They say that's helped their client streamline operational workflows and reduced time
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:20.800]   in the detector correct lifecycle of incident tickets.
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:25.040]   33% reduction in mean time to restore.
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:29.600]   33% which means they can support more customers with service quality,
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.000]   keep operational costs low and efficiency high.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.240]   HCL Technologies loves it.
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:36.000]   You will too with Moog Soft AI ops.
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.920]   You can reduce your IT alerts and tickets by up to 99% right now.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.520]   Get a demo.
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:42.560]   That's the best thing to do.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:46.800]   By the way, correlates alerts across tools and that's something else.
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:52.320]   You've got 15 different tools and they're each learning you the same condition.
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:53.120]   You don't want that.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:58.080]   You want to get information coming in, see how they bundle them up into a situation.
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:59.520]   It's something you can handle.
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:01.520]   It's all on the website, moogsoft.com.
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:02.160]   Get a demo.
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:05.840]   Why not moogsoft.com?
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:09.760]   It's the next generation platform for IT incident management.
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:12.560]   moogsoft.com.
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:15.520]   Try it today.
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:17.520]   Stacy's back.
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:18.960]   Was it down there?
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:21.760]   No.
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:25.040]   They lied to you.
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:26.000]   How dare they?
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.600]   Or they delivered it to your neighbor?
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:29.600]   Well, it might be.
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.120]   I still have something cool to show you.
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.240]   So it's not the end of the world, but fire was ready, Stacy.
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:37.680]   This was the wise cam, pan cam that I was going to show you.
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:39.120]   But now I ordered one.
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:40.720]   I ordered one too.
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:42.080]   It was supposed to be here today.
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:42.720]   I ordered three.
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:43.200]   Oh.
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:43.440]   Wow.
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:44.960]   All right.
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:46.000]   Wise cam.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:46.960]   That's we talked about.
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:47.920]   You were here.
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:48.720]   $30.
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:50.080]   That's why I ordered three.
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:50.560]   They're cheap.
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:55.520]   And they're cameras that will pan tilt zoom.
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:56.320]   Do they tilt and zoom?
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:57.600]   No, just pan probably.
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:58.800]   No, they tilt and zoom.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:50:59.200]   PTC.
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:01.440]   They 360 and then 90.
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:02.320]   Wise cam V2.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:03.840]   That's it.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:04.400]   Yeah.
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:05.280]   No, wise cam.
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:05.840]   $20 now.
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:07.120]   No, no, no.
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:08.320]   The B2 is the second.
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:08.880]   Cam pan.
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:09.680]   Yes.
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:11.040]   YZZE.
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:12.800]   Wow.
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:15.280]   I wonder if mine's on its way too, since you got yours.
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:17.120]   But I didn't get mine.
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:19.440]   It came to me instead.
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:22.480]   Did you order it before you talked about it that day?
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.520]   I did.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:25.120]   I had ordered it that morning.
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:26.160]   Oh, that morning.
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:27.600]   Yes.
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:32.240]   But today I'm going to talk to you about, I don't know if you can see it.
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:34.320]   Can you see this little glowing thing on my wall back here?
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.320]   Yes.
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:36.960]   Yes.
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:37.360]   Oh, wait.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:38.240]   This is the wrong camera.
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:39.280]   Lower the lower.
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:40.960]   It's up by hidden behind the bug.
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:41.600]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:42.080]   There it is.
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:42.960]   Oh, no, no.
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:46.160]   OK, so I'm going to go get that and show you all about it.
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:48.320]   I love these like Blair Witch style videos I do.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:50.240]   Shaky cam.
[01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:54.880]   Just unplugging it.
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:56.240]   Is it an Eero beacon?
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:56.800]   What is it?
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:59.200]   All right.
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:01.280]   This is the AWARE GLOW.
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:06.720]   And this device is a air quality monitor plus a smart outlet.
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:11.200]   So you have the pass through right here.
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:13.840]   No, we're no longer looking up there.
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:15.600]   It is the pass through right there.
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:17.040]   So or you can have it.
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:18.160]   So it's a plug.
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:22.320]   The light, there's a light that goes around here that acts as a night light.
[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:26.480]   And then there's another light here that glows green or yellow or red
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:29.120]   to like give you a visual indicator of your air quality.
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:34.800]   Oh, and I just got two minutes ago that the CO2 in here is high.
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:36.560]   Oh, that's because of a lot of that air.
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:37.360]   Stop breathing.
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:40.000]   There is a lot of hot air.
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.640]   Right now we're in a rush hour reward situation.
[01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:44.480]   So my air quality is about to go way down.
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:46.240]   What's a rush hour reward?
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:50.560]   Oh, it's a demand response.
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:52.640]   Sorry, they call it rush hour reward my utility.
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:55.680]   So let's go to the score.
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:57.920]   Oh, I see you get your electricity costs less.
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:02.800]   No, they turn my thermostat down or up rather
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:05.280]   because we're having trouble producing enough power.
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:06.720]   The utility does?
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:08.080]   Uh-huh.
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:09.360]   It's a voluntary program.
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:09.920]   I need.
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:11.840]   So how do they access your thermostat?
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:13.120]   I will show you.
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:15.920]   It's my nest and they just go right in there and they say,
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:17.920]   that is not my nest app.
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:19.200]   Let's go to my nest app.
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:25.440]   So like right here, it's like 81 degrees in here.
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:30.000]   And it's like, it's getting hot in here.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:30.880]   That's really hot.
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:32.720]   It is hot.
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:33.840]   Is that hot out there?
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:37.280]   Oh my god, it's like 102 degrees right now.
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:38.800]   But you don't have AC in your house?
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:40.560]   Well, no, I do have AC.
[01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:43.280]   It's just right now it's set to 82 to save energy.
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:44.720]   Oh, because it's a rush hour reward.
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:46.320]   Right.
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:47.360]   Wow.
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:50.000]   Do you guys don't have this?
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:50.240]   No.
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:51.920]   Okay.
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:56.400]   Here in Petaluma, it's always a balmy 72 degrees.
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:58.320]   Okay, well, that's nice.
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:53:59.120]   And dry.
[01:53:59.120 --> 01:53:59.760]   And dry.
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:01.440]   We don't really have the extremes.
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:03.920]   People don't have AC out here.
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:06.560]   In fact, I actually had a house for four years.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:07.520]   They didn't even have heat.
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:13.120]   It was an unheated, unerred condition house when the kids were young.
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:14.000]   And you're plumbing?
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.040]   Yes.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:16.560]   We did.
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:20.080]   But there was a wood burning stove in the kitchen.
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:22.320]   And that was, you know, it doesn't really get that cold here.
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:24.160]   Huh.
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:26.400]   Bring back out houses.
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:28.560]   Anyway, the coolest thing about this device.
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:28.880]   Sorry.
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:31.760]   No, I'm like, I don't know what to say to that.
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:32.080]   Okay.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:35.200]   Is you can actually plug this.
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:41.760]   You can plug, if you plug certain devices like a fan or a humidifier or a air quality or air filter.
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:47.280]   Through here, you can detect, you can tell the app what kind of device is plugged in.
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:52.640]   And it will actually, when it gets too hot, it'll turn on the fan or it'll purify your air.
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:53.600]   So if you're in New York.
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:55.360]   So much work to get up and turn on the fan.
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:56.800]   Okay.
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:58.000]   It's automatic.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.360]   So what we have it plugged into an air purifier.
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:04.000]   And so when it detects high chemicals.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.400]   But if you have like an out, if you have a.
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:11.360]   So what is the detect besides CO2?
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:16.000]   VOCs, CO2, humidity and temperature.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:16.640]   Not pollen.
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:20.080]   That's particulate matter in the air.
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:21.440]   So that's part of the monoxide.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.960]   Not carbon monoxide.
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:25.760]   Not carbon monoxide, just carbon dioxide.
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:28.800]   Just CO2 and volatile organic compounds like paint.
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:31.120]   And interesting.
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:32.640]   And it's not expensive.
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:35.600]   Do you get too much CO2 in the air besides hot air?
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:36.400]   Three people.
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:37.920]   She needs to open her window.
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:38.880]   So what are you doing?
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:43.360]   It gives you little notifications like, hey, open your window.
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:44.320]   This is happening.
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:51.120]   Or, and you know, like when I'm cooking, I can see like, holy cow, my chemicals in the air are going nutty.
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:53.200]   So that's interesting.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:56.560]   And you can actually set it to prioritize different things.
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:55:59.760]   So I have mindset for allergies because we all have allergies.
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:03.840]   And you can also set it for productivity.
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:09.440]   So then it tends to want to keep it cooler and notify you if it gets too warm.
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:10.880]   And if there's too much CO2.
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:17.360]   So I don't, I mean, is this the most accurate sensor on the face of the planet?
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:18.240]   I think not.
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:24.000]   But it is nice for general trend tracking and it's for $99.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.760]   It's also a lovely smart plug.
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:27.120]   You can actually use it without.
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:29.840]   Just to turn it on and off remotely.
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:31.600]   Like if you stuck a curling iron in there.
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:33.200]   Nice.
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:34.400]   Cool.
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:36.000]   And it's not expensive.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.160]   I like that.
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:41.120]   Can I ask you about the way it was camera?
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:42.320]   Same as last week?
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:42.640]   Yes.
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:43.840]   No.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:45.040]   So we got here's my issue.
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.360]   Stacey, you're so mean to me.
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:48.800]   So here's my issue.
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:51.520]   Wonderful little lovely cat.
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:56.000]   Girl can't pee in litter box for the dam.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.200]   Half the time is peeing like right out.
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:02.720]   But in the litter box, feet are there, but somehow managed to be.
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:03.920]   We have no idea how this happens.
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:04.720]   We don't know what to do.
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:05.200]   We don't know any of this.
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:07.280]   We tried high boxes, low boxes.
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:09.440]   So which camera should I put on?
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:15.280]   Do I need the full pen camera or all that?
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:19.440]   I guess what I need is 30 dollar motion sensor and then it turns on.
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:19.760]   Yes.
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:21.120]   That's why it's a can be too.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:24.400]   That has motion sensing and both of them have motion sensors.
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:29.760]   It's it turns it stays on.
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:31.280]   I mean it motions when it has.
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:32.320]   And you can stop it from moving.
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:35.040]   If you don't want it to move all that's just a feature, right?
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:38.160]   Yeah, that's a feature where you're like, you know, it's the patrol.
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:39.600]   It will also scare the cat.
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:41.920]   Stopper from peeing at all.
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:43.600]   And then we'll have a hell of a mess in the house.
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:45.440]   So wait, you just want.
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:45.840]   Moving around.
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:51.120]   You want the camera just to like send you a picture of the cat not peeing in the litter box?
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:53.280]   No, peeing in the litter box.
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:55.120]   I want to figure out how she pees.
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:56.480]   We cannot figure out how she goes.
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:57:58.800]   I don't know if this camera is going to really pick that up.
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:00.800]   Oh, yeah, you're going to have to.
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:01.680]   I don't.
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:03.760]   That's sure.
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:05.520]   Well, it's going to record her peeing.
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:09.760]   Let's now I'm waiting for you privacy nuts to go after me and tell me that the cat has
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:10.720]   some level of privacy.
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:11.600]   I'm violating here.
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:12.880]   Oh, the cat has no level.
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:15.040]   If the cat is being in front of you, the cat doesn't care.
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:17.120]   Well, we'll be in front of us.
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:17.680]   That's the problem.
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:18.960]   You'd have to put it near.
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:24.160]   The litter box close enough so that you can actually see what's going on.
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:24.800]   Do.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:29.680]   15th, second, eight extra digital zoom, 1920 by 1080.
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:31.760]   That's pretty good.
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:32.640]   It sees pets.
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:33.760]   See that?
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:34.320]   See that?
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:35.280]   Oh, it's cool.
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:38.480]   Yeah, it saw a norm, which is Kevin's dog.
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:41.360]   So yeah, just it's 20 bucks, Jeff.
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:42.640]   Just stick it in there and see what happens.
[01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:43.120]   Which one knows?
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:46.240]   Like at the wise cam tour, I get the wise cam pan pan cam.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:47.680]   No, the pan's going to move.
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:50.640]   And if the pan moves and your cat freaks out, that's not going to help you.
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:52.720]   By the way, it has a speaker in it.
[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:53.360]   So you could say.
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:55.120]   Doesn't the wise cam two doesn't move?
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:57.600]   Say P in the box, you dumb cat.
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:59.840]   And they both have two way audio.
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:02.960]   Hey, buddy.
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:04.160]   Drive your cat crazy.
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:05.520]   Hey, buddy.
[01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:07.920]   Oh, there's a raccoon.
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:10.000]   Actually, let me make sure the wise.
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.400]   I don't understand how this could be so cheap.
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:16.960]   This is that I need to move it to the deck because a raccoon took a huge dump on the deck.
[01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:17.920]   I hate it when that happens.
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:19.920]   Racoons are such FU animals.
[01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:21.280]   It missed the litter box too.
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:26.320]   I break this.
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:26.960]   I really showed down.
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:27.920]   I break it down.
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:29.520]   On wise cam two.
[01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:31.520]   Wise cam two, 20 bucks.
[01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:32.080]   Okay.
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:32.480]   The heck?
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:33.360]   Yeah, just buy it.
[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:34.240]   It's 20 bucks.
[01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:36.240]   I know.
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:37.280]   They're so cheap.
[01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:39.680]   And they don't charge you a subscription fee.
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:40.560]   You get two weeks.
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:44.720]   You do have to buy your own SD card to stick in there if you want to put it.
[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:46.240]   If you don't want to go into the cloud.
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:46.560]   Yeah.
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:51.440]   But you get free 14 day rolling cloud storage.
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:52.560]   I don't.
[01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:53.840]   I'm just baffled by this.
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:56.080]   How they get away with this.
[01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:58.240]   And it was just all Wi-Fi, right?
[01:59:58.240 --> 01:59:58.960]   Yep.
[01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:02.320]   I can't wait to get mine.
[02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:04.000]   You solved the P problem.
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.320]   Maybe or the cheapest tree at least.
[02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:09.600]   I don't know if you're going to actually see anything of value.
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:14.400]   I tell you what, get your camera, bring his video.
[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:15.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:20.240]   Your number, my friend.
[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:22.240]   Let's see.
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:25.520]   I had three at the bottom, but I'm the one that fascinates me a little bit
[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:27.840]   is a story about Sundar, a petchai's name.
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:31.760]   On a, it's up in the Google section.
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:35.600]   So the number is one.
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:36.880]   Sundar is just Sundar.
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:42.320]   So a friend named Richard Hay said in a comment on somebody's, a friend of mine.
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:46.400]   So a friend of mine, a colleague of mine was complaining that Macbook Pro had no USB port
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:46.880]   and choose to play.
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:50.080]   And so I said next time Chromebook, because I'm obnoxious like that.
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:51.520]   That's what I do, even with my friends.
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:59.680]   And so anyway, this guy, Richard Hay came down and told a friend from a TGI effort Google
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:04.240]   that Sergey, there were about to announce the Chromebook.
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:10.080]   And Sergey had Google Glass on and he asked for the name of a finance minister of India.
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.800]   And the display came out and said it was P,
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:15.200]   additional P, somebody or other.
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:17.200]   And he wanted to know what the P stood for.
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:20.800]   And he asked in it and it didn't tell him he thought it was a failure, walks away.
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:25.680]   Sundar then comes on stage and stopped to tell a story first.
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:29.280]   He referenced an earlier incident with a finance minister's name and mentioned that he was from
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:33.200]   Chennai where you were only given a single name at birth and no surname.
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:33.680]   Why?
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:36.560]   The rest of the world refuses this cultural convention.
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:42.560]   So folks from Chennai adopt initials to fill out, to fake other name, to satisfy the cultural
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:43.600]   norms of others.
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:45.200]   He was born simply Sundar.
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:50.160]   He adopted Sundar P, but when he was applying for US citizenship, that wasn't good enough.
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:53.280]   So he took his dad's name, Pichai, as his surname.
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:57.040]   He said a friend came back home and asked him how it was working out.
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:01:58.320]   And he said pretty well.
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:01.840]   He said, my wife freaks out when someone calls her Mrs. Pichai.
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:04.480]   Wow, that's interesting.
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:05.280]   That is.
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:06.560]   Richard Hay, thank you for that story.
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:07.600]   I found that really interesting.
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:09.200]   I love cultural moments like that.
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:10.800]   Make me feel like that's good.
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:12.480]   What was your dad's first name, Jeff?
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:14.080]   Darryl.
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:15.280]   So you'd be Jeff Darryl.
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:19.840]   Or you could be, you know, if you're in Iceland, you'd be Jeff Darrylson.
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:22.000]   My dad's name was the same as mine.
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.120]   So I'd be Leo Leo.
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:25.840]   Leo squared.
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:26.560]   Leo squared.
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:30.320]   Stacy, what was your dad's first name?
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:31.680]   Or moms?
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:33.760]   Would it be my dad or would it be my mom?
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:37.360]   Oh, well, if you're an Iceland to be your moms, or no, you'd be dad's.
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:39.200]   Do tier, but you'd be do tier instead of.
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:41.760]   I would be Lynn if it's my mom's Don.
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:42.640]   Stacy Lynn.
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:43.840]   Stacy Lynn.
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:44.400]   Stacy Lynn.
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:44.880]   That's it.
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:46.320]   You'd be a country singer if you had that name.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:46.800]   Yeah.
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:47.840]   That's my middle name.
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:48.480]   Oh.
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:49.120]   Oh.
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:52.400]   Ta-da.
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:54.560]   Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:56.160]   So mine's a little one, but it's a good one.
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:03:02.800]   If you ever use Google Lens, they finally made a, you know, you had to watch the camera
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:05.120]   and then go press the lens button, go to Lens Now.
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:08.880]   There's just a, it's just a shortcut really on Android, but download it and you can
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:10.000]   install it from the App Store.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.440]   It's the Google Lens shortcut and now it launches Lens directly.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.320]   Which is really much more useful because you want to do it as fast as possible in some cases.
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:19.360]   So here's-
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:21.280]   The lens still doesn't know what it's looking at.
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:22.720]   Your lens, well, wait a minute.
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:23.360]   Watch this.
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:25.520]   See if the lens knows what it's looking at.
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:26.160]   Let's see.
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:28.080]   Let's see if it's looking at the look.
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:29.200]   See if it knows the look.
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:31.120]   You got the look.
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:31.600]   You got the look.
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:33.760]   Tap on objects.
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:35.280]   Nope.
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:35.760]   Yeah.
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:36.240]   Yeah.
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:36.560]   Yeah.
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:37.040]   Yeah.
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:39.520]   It might be one of these.
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:41.920]   It said Amazon.com.
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:44.400]   Looking for results.
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:46.000]   No, it just knows it's Amazon.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.280]   Ah, it, no, that's terrible.
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:53.520]   It might be one of these and Amazon.
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:54.640]   Well, it is.
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:55.360]   Oh, you know what?
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:56.720]   It saw the word Amazon.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:59.280]   So I'm going to say thumbs down.
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:01.360]   You got it wrong.
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:03.040]   Right.
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:03.600]   Free fair.
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:05.760]   That looks a lot like the Canary Flex.
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:07.120]   It looks kind of like the lighthouse.
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:08.400]   It looks like a lot of cameras.
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:09.200]   Here, let's do this.
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:11.760]   Then this looks like nothing in that you ever saw.
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:12.880]   This is a knob.
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:13.760]   It won't get this.
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:16.400]   This just looks like a gray,
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:17.920]   a gray, oh, it crashed.
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:18.080]   No.
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:18.400]   Okay.
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:20.800]   Yeah.
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:21.280]   Enough.
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:24.160]   Yeah, I'm not, I'm not excited about this lens app just yet.
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:24.960]   I got to be honest.
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:25.920]   I know that.
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:27.760]   I will show, I will just a little tease.
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:29.840]   I'll be doing a review of this device,
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:31.280]   which is kind of an interesting device.
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:32.480]   It's an Android phone.
[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:35.040]   It was an Indiegogo project from Planet Computers
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:36.160]   called the Gemini.
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:37.600]   If you ever use a scion,
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:39.600]   or like the scion five,
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:40.720]   this is exactly like it.
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:43.760]   It's an Android 7.1 phone,
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:45.440]   like 5.7 inch screens,
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:48.800]   just like a phone attached to actually a pretty usable keyboard.
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:51.280]   Type C charging on both ends.
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:56.080]   It's got stereo sound and it can be used as a kind of big and ugly phone.
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:58.160]   But as you can talk into it like a phone,
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:03.120]   it is, and it was not expensive compared to most other Android phones,
[02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:04.480]   about 699.
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:06.400]   So I will give you my review of this.
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:07.920]   I put a T-Mobile SIM in it.
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:09.200]   So it's just like, oh,
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:11.440]   oh, it kind of brings back memories.
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:12.000]   Doesn't it?
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.920]   And the thing is, it's really nice to type on it.
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:15.360]   It's like you could actually,
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:17.360]   I mean, I wouldn't want to write an article on it,
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:19.920]   but you can definitely type away on it.
[02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:21.520]   What's the brand?
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:24.160]   Gemini from Planet Computers.
[02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:26.400]   If you look for Gemini on Indiegogo,
[02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:28.160]   I think it's still up there.
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:32.800]   And I still apparently have my bad habit of buying things on Indiegogo.
[02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:35.440]   But this one I like.
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:37.760]   This one I think I'm going to give a positive review to.
[02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:41.200]   I mean, it can run Linux as well if you want to put Linux on it.
[02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:46.400]   So that might end up being what happens.
[02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:48.400]   They've raised $2.3 million,
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:53.440]   this English company Planet Computers, to make this 2018.
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:55.680]   So is it just the keyboard or is it the phone?
[02:05:55.680 --> 02:05:56.320]   It's the whole thing.
[02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:57.440]   It's the whole thing.
[02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:57.760]   Okay.
[02:05:57.760 --> 02:05:58.160]   Yeah.
[02:05:58.160 --> 02:05:58.560]   How much?
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:01.920]   I think I bought, oh, 599.
[02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:04.080]   599, if you want Wi-Fi and 4G,
[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:05.600]   we'll compare that to a phone.
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:07.040]   It's less than a pixel.
[02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:09.120]   499, if you just want the Wi-Fi version.
[02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:12.960]   I don't think that that does that feel expensive?
[02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:13.840]   Just like the phone.
[02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:14.640]   Oh, it's like, right.
[02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:15.200]   Because it's a phone.
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:18.560]   I mean, it could be your full time phone if you don't mind.
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:22.720]   It's not really slim, but it's not super huge either.
[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:24.800]   Here could be one just just wind the other day
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:26.080]   about not having the blackberry anymore.
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:26.240]   Yeah.
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:27.840]   Here's the Pixel 2 XL.
[02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:29.920]   It's roughly the same size as that.
[02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:32.240]   A little it's thicker, obviously,
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:33.600]   because it has a full-size keyboard.
[02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:36.800]   It's not, unfortunately Android 8.
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.000]   It should be, but it's not.
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.920]   It's Android 7.
[02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:42.960]   Oh, so people are talking about the price differential
[02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:44.160]   for the WISE cam?
[02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:46.720]   All that is is shipping for the people wondering.
[02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:48.320]   It's like 8 bucks to ship it.
[02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:49.440]   They don't give you free shipping.
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:51.680]   They shouldn't at that price.
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:54.960]   Oh, because Amazon, yeah, it's $25 versus $22
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:55.920]   for the small one on Amazon.
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:56.560]   $37.
[02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:57.040]   I see.
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:58.080]   Right.
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:01.920]   So my total out-of-pocket cost buying from WISE
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:03.920]   was $37 or $38.
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:05.840]   I think it was $37.95.
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:07.680]   OK, so it's $37.98 on Amazon.
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:09.440]   OK.
[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:10.080]   With shipping.
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:10.880]   With ship free shipping.
[02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:12.960]   Well, but it's not free shipping,
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:14.720]   because WISE is still charging Amazon
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:16.080]   to get it out of their house, I think.
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:21.840]   No, Amazon says $37.98 and free shipping.
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:23.200]   Yes, Booby.
[02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:24.000]   $30.
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000]   Like shipping.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.240]   WISE charges you $29.99.
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:30.560]   Then they charge you $7.95 shipping.
[02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:31.120]   Same price.
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:31.920]   No, there were.
[02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:32.400]   Same price.
[02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:32.720]   Same price.
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:33.280]   Same price.
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:33.920]   That's what I'm saying.
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:35.200]   It equals out.
[02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:35.840]   We agree.
[02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:36.560]   That's what I'm saying.
[02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:37.040]   Yes.
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:38.480]   I'm just pointing out to people who are like,
[02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:39.600]   it's this much on Amazon.
[02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:41.200]   I'm like, that's because of the shipping.
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:42.000]   It's shipping, right?
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.440]   Even though it's not really the shipping.
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:45.840]   I was giving another data point.
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:48.720]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the conclusion
[02:07:48.720 --> 02:07:51.120]   of this fine program.
[02:07:51.120 --> 02:07:53.520]   We thank you so much for being here.
[02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:55.440]   We invite you to stop by again.
[02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:58.000]   We do it every Wednesday afternoon,
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.920]   right after Windows Weekly,
[02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:02.000]   about 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern.
[02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:04.880]   That would be 2030 UTC,
[02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:06.800]   Wednesday afternoons.
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:08.960]   Watch live at twit.tv/live.
[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:10.160]   Or listen there.
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:11.520]   We also have audio streams there.
[02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:13.040]   You can listen if that's more convenient.
[02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:15.120]   And of course, if you watch live,
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:20.720]   you should join us in the chatroom live at irc.twit.tv.
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:24.160]   You can also subscribe and get an episode delivered to you,
[02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:25.120]   audio or video.
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:26.800]   The minute it's available,
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:30.080]   you can go to twit.tv/twig.
[02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:32.240]   For all your options.
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:34.080]   Thank you everybody.
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:36.800]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:37.600]   Bye bye.
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:47.840]   (upbeat music)
