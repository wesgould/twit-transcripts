[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   with Mr. Jeffery T. Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.800]   I added a T just because it seems like you need a middle image.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   What would the T stand for in your mind?
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   Terrible rude person.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   Jim Taribullicosta.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   Jim Taribullicosta.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.800]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York at the Time Night Center
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   and he's a great guy.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.800]   I am at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   I'm so confused.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   I have a piece of paper somewhere with all of that.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   Anyway, great to have you Buzzmachine.com at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   We also have Stacey Higginbotham in the house.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   She's at Stacey on IOT.com at Gigastacey on the Twitter.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   Did you get up this morning and watch the Samsung Developers Conference keynote?
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   Stacey?
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   I did not get up this morning to watch that.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   However, I did see the news.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   Do we want to go into that?
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   There's a foldable phone.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   That's what I was watching.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.440]   You know, it looked really cool in the demos, but then someone was tweeting how with the
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.800]   lights on you can clearly see the line of the morning demarcation.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   The guy who was demonstrating it said this is not what it looks like.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   This is that we've hidden it inside a cave.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   This is normal practice with a new phone.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   Apple does it too.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   They hide him inside of kind of industrial generic cases so you can't see the details.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   But what he's showing is a phone that has a screen on the front.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.800]   Looks kind of like a thick normal phone.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   Again, we don't know how thick because of the case.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   And then it is.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   You're watching that loop.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   And he opens it up and it's got one screen that has unfolded.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.800]   With that and perceptible, you know, line down the middle.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   So yeah, in the other video with the lights on you see the line down the middle.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   Oh.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   Oh.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   Yes.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   Who to do that?
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   They demoed it in the dark.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   Oh, that's a little.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.700]   Oh, there was a tweet from someone in the tech press who saw it the night before during
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.960]   the rehearsal run through.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.800]   But I did not like it so it's possible I will never see it again.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.400]   So I was paying attention to some of the smart things stuff because, you know, IOT.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.480]   That's what I thought of you is during the IOT presentation.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.800]   They didn't mention security at all.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.240]   Well, they mentioned interoperability.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.400]   That seemed to be a key.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.280]   This is this is a different interoperability than they had pitched.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:28.880]   So I've been watching Samsung do this for, let's see, 2004 CES 2014.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:37.040]   Maybe it was or 2013 when Samsung's who was it who keynoted and he just was like, la la la
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.520]   internet of things, hand holding, everything's going to be magic.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.440]   This was kind of a return to that.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:52.640]   And the problem is they're grafting this vision, which is actually still very Samsung centric
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.080]   onto a platform that was designed for super nerds.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.920]   And the super nerds hate the platform.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.920]   And the normal people are looking at this and going, what the hell do I want my dishwasher
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.400]   to talk to my television?
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   And the demo they used had a refrigerator with a screen bigger than this on it.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.160]   I mean, it was huge.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.520]   So you know, I could be doing twig from my refrigerator cam one day.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.960]   I'm not a fan.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.600]   But yeah, so it's kind of a cool vision, but it's not as open as you would think.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.960]   It's not as it's not as transparent how we're going to get there to normal people.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.680]   You have to do a lot on the back end.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.960]   And I'm not sure if it's really worth it to people who aren't named Samsung.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.640]   So that's my quick 20 second take there.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.560]   It seems like it's really pushed Bixby as well.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.400]   Their voice assistant said they're going to spend $22 billion on AI, a higher a thousand
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.840]   AI developers.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.480]   They brought the former developer of Siri, who of course, when Apple acquired Siri, left
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:03.440]   Apple and started VIV, which is Samsung that acquired, he's still in Samsung and really
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.480]   promoted the idea that Bixby is going to be in everything.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.360]   And how do we think that's going to work?
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.960]   I'm not I'm not having a big speed couple of Bixby phones of the last year.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.880]   The note nine and the S nine with the hardware dedicated hardware button never used it.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:28.400]   But that was from a different era.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.120]   Just designed to open apps on the phone to do things with apps on the phone.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.080]   Now it's supposed to be a full fledged voice assistant, which they kept saying is smarter
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.320]   than any other voice assistant you've used.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.920]   It could be with VIV.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.400]   So if they do this right and they create a voice assistant, we're like, Hey, Bixby, let
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.000]   me let me think of it, have my doorbell contact me when the postman gets here.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.080]   If I can say something like that, I like that.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.320]   And that actually works.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.320]   And VIV actually makes up very easy to develop on the backend theoretically.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.280]   That's what they showed.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.280]   That's what they showed.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.320]   They showed a really nice developer environment.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.120]   He booked a room on Mars at a hotel that was very expensive.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.120]   And that was the demo.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.720]   And he did a little bit of magic, turned a tape tie into a real tie, which distracted
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   me.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:24.720]   But it's all wishing right now from Samsung.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.920]   But you know what?
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.320]   This is a nascent technology.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.960]   Amazon has the lead right now.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.120]   Google's coming on strong.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.120]   Apple would like to be there as well.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.120]   Microsoft's given up with Cortana.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.320]   They've really said, I don't think we're going to they actually moved it to the Office
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.320]   365 group this week.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.640]   Oh, that makes that makes sense though, because Cortana clearly isn't going to be in your
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.640]   home life.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.440]   So it's only going to be your assistant for business.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:54.120]   I'll say for Bixby, here's where Bixby with the VIV could actually the VIV with VIV could
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.600]   win or do well.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:02.200]   It's with creating those experiences in a way that's very seamless for the user and
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.720]   relatively easy for the developer.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.440]   Because right now, if you want to do Amazon or Google, especially Google's still a pain
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.480]   to develop for.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.640]   It's a little bit harder.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:22.240]   And with VIV, the theory is you would tell it, you basically use this AI, and I'm using
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.560]   that in big quotes here, AI, to understand what a user wants to do and automatically pull
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.160]   together the right APIs to make that happen.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.800]   So if that actually does work, that could get them into a lot of places.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.480]   Just because if I had one Samsung thing and I wanted to tie it to other things, it's possible
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.240]   that that might work.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.880]   So yeah, it's all it's for every one of these companies, it's an ecosystem play.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.640]   And this is the thing that's a little frustrating.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:53.240]   And it's one of the things that's held back, IOT in my opinion, is everybody's a silo.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.640]   So there's always this promise.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.080]   In fact, smart things started was a Kickstarter based on the premise that we're going to be
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.080]   universal.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.480]   We'll talk to Zigbee, we'll talk to Z-Wave.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.040]   Is it still that universal?
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.600]   Stacy?
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.600]   It would like to be?
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.400]   I mean, yes, it will talk to all those radios.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:15.360]   Yes, they have features that will tie into other APIs if a device has it.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.960]   The problem is people are not building things that tie into smart things.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:25.880]   Instead, everyone wants to lock down their own APIs and make it like, oh, you want to
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.200]   talk to the world pool?
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.720]   I mean, Samsung says they'll talk to anybody and I actually believe that they would.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.240]   But Whirlpool's not going to bust its hump to be like, "oh, yeah, let me have my appliances
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   talk to Samsung".
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.240]   -That's the problem.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.240]   -Then make sure they work.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.380]   -It's the historic problem with home automation going back 20 years.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.280]   Is everybody wants to own it?
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.280]   Everybody wants a silo.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.460]   And all I see is Samsung saying our silo, our silo, not Amazons, not apples, not Googles,
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.100]   our silo, our silo.
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:59.040]   Nobody wants to be, maybe, I feel like nobody, no consumer wants to say, "okay, I'm just
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.440]   going to buy all Apple stuff".
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.440]   It'll all work better.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.920]   -Well, consumers do actually buy all Apple stuff, just to make it work better.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.920]   -They're the only one.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   -That's the only company.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.920]   Samsung know, right?
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.920]   -Well, if a loyal to Samsung, I'm only going to buy Samsung stuff.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.920]   So, some countries.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.720]   -I'm sure some, but yeah.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:25.580]   -I bet in Korea, they're really big there.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.780]   One of the problems is we don't have, that's what OCF was trying to do.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:36.380]   We don't have the equivalent of a hypertext for the Internet of Things.
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:42.100]   So we don't have a data schema that everything uses that you can kind of build around.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.540]   You have to do custom for everything.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.000]   That was the problem that we all saw back in 2013, even when Samsung was like, "we'll
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.040]   be open, it'll be amazing".
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.040]   That doesn't scale.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:59.000]   That doesn't scale beyond computing because the real world has so many more devices and
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.880]   things you have to care about.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:11.200]   The computing guys are, I don't know if they're willfully blind to this or what, but yeah.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.740]   And there still aren't great use cases for some of this stuff.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.140]   Do I need my refrigerator to talk to my television?
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.140]   I really don't think so.
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.540]   -But is Stacey, is there an unused standard in this?
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:29.460]   -Well, there's the OCF, which is long and storied and went through some efforts.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:34.020]   That's got Intel, Samsung, Huawei, LG are all involved.
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:38.980]   That's basically a data schema for over 100 different devices.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.100]   It says basically, "I'm a light bulb".
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.340]   If you're a light bulb and you use OCF, it's going to say, "This is how you recognize
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.340]   a light bulb.
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:51.780]   This is how it turns on, off, goes through X number of colors, dims, etc.
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.640]   You see Amazon took that and instead of using something like the data schema from OCF, they
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:02.160]   created a voice related data schema with three different things, an on, off, a range,
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.800]   and a mode setting.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:10.400]   So again, that's another way of doing it.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.400]   -They exist.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.760]   There's just a lot of them.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.760]   -What would it take?
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.200]   I'm asking the two of you.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.000]   For you, I mean, Stacey is actually a bad person to ask because you do all this.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   You try it all.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.480]   You've got lines that won't open but could if Andrew would just say the right words,
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.480]   that kind of thing.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.600]   But maybe I should ask Jeff, but I'll ask you Stacey, put yourself in a normal person's
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.280]   mindset.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:37.640]   What would it take for home automation to take off?
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.820]   -I thought we were there.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:46.400]   I thought way back in 2012 and 2013, I thought I saw the creation of those standards.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.240]   It was all joined.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.900]   OCF was coming around the pike and things like SmartThings that really did want to try
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.540]   to work with everything.
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.240]   -You'll agree though, we're not there.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.240]   -We're not.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.240]   We're not.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.240]   So it takes a universal standard.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.700]   It takes cheaper devices, right?
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.140]   So at the time you had devices that were very expensive.
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:12.480]   It also takes a really good and coherent communication of the value to end user, which
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.040]   the tech companies just blew right past.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:21.560]   You can remotely turn on your crockpot is a really crappy reason to spend $150 for a
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.560]   connected crockpot.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.400]   -You're talking to the guy who got Bluetooth pots and pans.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.400]   I mean, it's...
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.400]   -Right.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.600]   -Dopey is dopey.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.240]   -That's why you see things like security systems.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.320]   Those do really well.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:38.740]   You saw the Nest do well for a while because it had energy savings associated with it.
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:39.740]   -For a while.
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.660]   Why did the Nest stop doing well?
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.780]   -I think there's a very big price ceiling of number of people who are going to spend
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.780]   that much.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.260]   And there you go, back to price.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.980]   -But I think also it's just...
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:52.980]   Like if you could...
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:57.460]   Jeff, if you could move into a home that it was all set up and everything worked with
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:02.580]   your voice and it worked reliably, that would be okay, right?
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.580]   -That's the idea.
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.880]   It's like, you know, imagine when we had Cat 5 through the whole house.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.880]   -Ooh!
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.880]   Right?
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.480]   -But Stacy says it's right.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.480]   It's about standards.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.320]   And it's not just about standards that exist today.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:20.160]   It's about standards you have the faith that are going to exist in 5, 10 years.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.560]   -I think it's even more amazing to have an intercom in it.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.560]   -Yeah.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.400]   -And there wasn't a true standard, but they were bad and they died.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.000]   -Where people would wire some stuff.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.420]   -In their house, they spent a lot of money to put wired speakers in.
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.700]   -You're right enough to remember what people would wire speakers.
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:38.700]   I think...
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.700]   -I have wired speakers.
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.900]   -Well, you're not again in a no way do you worry about it.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:45.900]   -Sorry, sorry.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.420]   -You are the queen of IOT.
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.340]   We are merely subjects in your kingdom.
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.620]   -So you guys are touching on some really like, yes, essential.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:00.260]   And I would say I'm about to hit this real time because we're putting the house on the
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.700]   market in a couple months because we're going to move.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.700]   And I am sitting here thinking about...
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.700]   -You're going to be in a normal house.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.260]   -So they're all like, you should definitely keep a lot of the smart things that are in
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.060]   there, not necessarily smart things.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:19.860]   But I'm like, how do I separate my devices from the brains, which is the value?
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.220]   And so that's becoming kind of...
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.220]   And do I...
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.260]   And he's like, maybe you could give them like an hour of consulting time so you could set
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.260]   it up for them.
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.020]   -That's the problem in the nutshell.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.020]   No one...
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.020]   -No one wants to do that.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.100]   -And their right mind wants to do that.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.100]   It's just too much work.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.100]   -Right.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.020]   -This is why voice is so interesting as an interface.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.340]   And I think that that is...
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.180]   As I think about your question, I think it's computer.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.180]   -Yeah.
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.460]   -Be me up to, right?
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.580]   You want that ability at some level to know that there's...
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.140]   -But you need a Scotty to set the whole damn thing up before you move.
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.140]   -Yeah.
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.900]   Well, because like my...
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:55.900]   I'm keeping...
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.260]   I'll tell you guys you've seen it.
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.380]   I have a Madam A. powered faucet.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.700]   But my echo isn't staying here because...
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:07.340]   Well, it could stay here, but I'd unaffiliated it with my account thus breaking that connection.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.340]   -Oh, yeah.
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.020]   -So I'm going to have to break that, tell someone else how to set it up.
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:17.900]   So I'm thinking I could create an echo and then an email address for the house for them.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.900]   So...
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.900]   -No, you're being too nice.
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:24.180]   You should do what every other seller does, list it as a capability, and leave and get
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.340]   out of town before they move in.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.340]   -[laughter]
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.340]   -Seriously.
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.340]   -No one...
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.100]   You'll see when you move into your new house.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.100]   -Oh, no.
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.100]   I mean...
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.020]   -You won't even know how to turn on the fireplace.
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.260]   You'll have to figure everything out.
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.260]   They don't leave.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.260]   Nobody leaves...
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.340]   Oh, here's our manual for how to run the house.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.420]   And that's what it's going to take is a manual.
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.420]   -I have started documentation.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.420]   -Wow.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.420]   You're too nice.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.340]   -You're going to build a house from scratch.
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.500]   What would you build into it?
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.900]   -So we built this house.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.100]   We built it in 2012.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.100]   I built Cat 6.
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.420]   -See what you've learned since.
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.420]   -Cat 6.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.420]   -Oh, look at that.
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.420]   -Beats can't find.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.420]   Take that.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.580]   -We were going to get gigabit ethernet or gigabit connectivity.
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.060]   -So I was coming to Austin.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.820]   -Yeah, Google was coming to Austin.
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.180]   I'm so excited.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.460]   Silly.
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.900]   I would build...
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:18.780]   Honestly, I would build ethernet to every room because I'm still a wired land kind of
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:19.780]   girl.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.540]   So that's one.
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:29.180]   I would actually invest in extra deep switch boxes for my light plates, my light switches,
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.700]   and my outlets.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.820]   If they weren't, I would actually, if I were doing it, I'd just put in neutrons, switches
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.820]   personally.
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.580]   -You know what you should do.
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:42.180]   -And this will get you $50,000 more in your house.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:50.100]   It's been $35 on a Raspberry Pi and maybe another $20 on a screen and put it like in
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.100]   a closet.
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.100]   You have a wire closet already, right?
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.100]   You have a switch.
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.100]   -I do.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.100]   -Put it in there.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:59.940]   Put a wiki on it that's called, you know, the house wiki and then over time, just add
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.380]   the wiki, add the wiki until you have like, that's your manual.
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.100]   And you will say, and by the way, welcome to our home.
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.860]   It's fully documented here with our soup and you maybe dress it up with a nice...
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.860]   Maybe it'll make it an informational mirror and put it in the bathroom or something.
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.500]   -Oh, good God.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.500]   You go to the bathroom to reach your house.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.500]   -That's wicky.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.940]   -I'm telling you, a wiki is a solution.
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.180]   You can put it on a Raspberry Pi, put it on a SD card.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.340]   You could dress it up with one of them informational mirrors types.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.900]   But I don't care where you put it out in the living room.
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.260]   You could get a story in the paper about the most wired house in Austin.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.980]   -You would get, I'm telling you, $15,000 more easy.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:39.980]   -Okay.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.980]   -Easy.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.380]   The cat's sex alone I would pay for.
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:49.140]   And then if I knew it had a house wiki, well, well, you know, as you tell Stacy, she's
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.140]   not normal.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.700]   I hate to break it to you.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.700]   You're not either.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.700]   -But there's other people in Austin.
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:19:00.340]   -Well, Austin has a tech sappy buyer base, but for the most part, they're going to get...
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.140]   -I think it's a selling point.
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.060]   -They'll get the sink.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.060]   Oops, sorry.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.060]   -Yep.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.060]   It's all right.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.780]   -They'll just turn water on in five homes across the ocean.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.940]   -Right.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:11.940]   That's how many have it.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:12.940]   They'll get the sink.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.420]   They'll get light switches.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.700]   They will get a doorbell.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.900]   They will get the my queue garage thing and they'll get the thermostats.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.180]   But I think that's about it.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.180]   And I can leave them.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:29.860]   -Spend $1,000 for $50,000 increase in price.
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:30.860]   I'm telling you.
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.340]   -Oh, don't tell my husband that.
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.180]   -Why are those whole thing up?
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.540]   Like crazy.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.740]   And then when you have open houses, have a little...
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.500]   Get one of those curry robots.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.980]   I think they're selling them cheap.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:46.500]   And have it come to the door and say, "Welcome to your new home."
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.500]   "Fire.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.420]   Have a canopy.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.900]   Let me show you around."
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.540]   I'm telling you.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.540]   -Okay.
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.540]   -You get the paper.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.700]   -I do have a Raspberry Pi running like openhab.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.700]   -Yeah.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.260]   -But the statesman would publish a story about you.
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.460]   You'd get in the New York Times.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.380]   It'd be a full spread.
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.380]   It's selling...
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.380]   -It's not a party.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.380]   -It's not a party.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.380]   -Jetson's house.
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.380]   -The Jetson's house.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.700]   Get a conveyor belt outside with a fire hydrant on it.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.180]   You said stop this crazy thing.
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:21.300]   So Google must have known what Samsung was up to because in the Android Developers blog,
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.220]   I didn't realize this right now the Android Developers Summit is going on.
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:30.940]   And the very first thing they say is how to do a folding phone for Android.
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.940]   -A-da.
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.100]   -It's a new category.
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.700]   Get ready for foldables.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.380]   Two screen devices and one screen devices.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.260]   The Samsung device is a two screen.
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.100]   It looks like a phone but when unfolded.
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:52.900]   The defining feature is what we call screen continuity, says Google.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.780]   For example, oh, look at this.
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.660]   Start a video with the folded smaller screen and later you could sit down an unfolded device
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:06.020]   and get a larger tablet-sized screen for a beautiful immersive experience.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.540]   We're optimizing Android for this new form factor.
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:13.940]   So that's, you know, expect to see foldables from several Android manufacturers including
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.900]   one Samsung preview today and plans to offer.
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.940]   -Do you imagine any lust for a foldable phone?
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:20.940]   -Oh, you got it.
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.940]   -I kind of do.
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.060]   -You knew what my next question was going to be.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.220]   You want it?
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.220]   -I want it.
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.220]   -You can put your wiki on it.
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.380]   -This phone doesn't fit.
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.660]   So this phone's too big for me.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.900]   If I could get a slightly smaller thing that folds and then unfold it to something bigger,
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:35.900]   that would be great.
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.620]   So it's like a pixel -- -But shorter.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.620]   I need it to be shorter.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.620]   -Shorter as well.
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.620]   And then -- Yeah, the Samsung phone actually did look kind of small until you opened it
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.620]   up.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.620]   Yeah.
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.260]   It didn't look like that big a scream, to be honest with you.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:53.700]   -Well, how do you hold -- I imagine somebody opening a thing on the subway or --
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.900]   -I don't know how to predict.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.660]   -I'm going to predict this is a flop.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.660]   -Yeah.
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:03.500]   -This is the -- -And there's unknowns because --
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.860]   -That's the mechanical issue.
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.140]   How well is that going to wear?
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.860]   It's the first eight-track phone.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.860]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:09.860]   -Oh, well, that's true.
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:10.860]   Okay.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:11.860]   I can see with it being novel.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:16.900]   But I think -- I kind of like the idea of the form factor.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.260]   I'll be honest, but I like paper bag books.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.260]   I've read newspapers.
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.620]   -Oh, I think also the thinking is people want a bigger phone, but like Stacy, they
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:25.780]   don't want a bigger phone.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.780]   -Right.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:31.820]   -They want more scream real estate, but they want to -- so it's kind of a hybrid.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:37.020]   I have to say, though, that the history of hybrid devices and technology is uniformly
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.020]   terrible.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.220]   I can't think of it.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.220]   -Look, as -- -Windows 8.
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.220]   -Windows 8, it's -- -Right.
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.220]   -Right.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.220]   -Right.
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.220]   -Yes.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.220]   -It's struggling between desktop and tablet environment.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.100]   -Well, I'm still -- I'll tell you later.
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:56.340]   I went and saw a slate today, and I still think that Chrome is not a good tablet OS.
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.340]   -Perfect example.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.340]   So you're not going to get a slate.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.340]   -No.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.100]   -We are in the time.
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.020]   -They're available now.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.620]   Actually by the time we got to it, the top of the line models were all gone.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.620]   -The top top?
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:09.620]   -Yeah, the top two.
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.620]   -The one seven?
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:11.620]   -Yeah, seven.
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:15.780]   -Yeah, we had to get an M3 based, or I three based machine.
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:16.780]   -Wow.
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:20.420]   -So -- but I don't -- you know, Jason -- I said, "I don't want it.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.420]   Jason, you get it.
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.420]   I stole my pixel.
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.660]   He's using an old Chromebook.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.820]   I have my pixel book."
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:29.780]   So Jason's going to get it as his new Chromebook, and we went to the order.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.940]   Actually, let me go to store.google.com because you could pre-order them now.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:38.020]   As of yesterday, I think you could pre-order them.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.460]   But I think that they didn't -- they ran out.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.740]   Let me see what the status is.
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.740]   Let's order.
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.740]   Shall we order one?
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:49.860]   First of all, you don't want -- I was kind of surprised because the top of the line models
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.860]   are expensive.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.940]   There's Team 99 for the i7 out of stock.
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:59.020]   Oh, all the top three -- now the one we got, the M3 version is now out of stock.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.460]   So all you can get is a Celeron version.
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.460]   -Yeah.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.740]   -This is counter -- counter -- intuitive.
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.700]   I would have thought the cheap ones would have sold first, but that just shows you when
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:13.620]   people buy a pixel from Google -- a Pixelbook or a Chromebook from Google, they don't mind
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.620]   spending more money.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.580]   -There's another possibility here, which is they make any.
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.580]   -Exactly.
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:23.900]   -But this -- we ended up getting an 8th gen Intel Core M3.
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.940]   That's a pretty sluggish processor.
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.260]   But maybe not for --
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:31.700]   -Kevin says Best Buy still has stock of the slate.
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.700]   -Oh, thank you, Kevin.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.700]   -I just got it.
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.940]   -Hi, Kevin.
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.300]   So yeah, which one did Kevin get?
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.300]   -Okay, I'll ask him.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.300]   -Let's go see.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.260]   Let's find out what we can get here.
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:50.180]   iPad Pro is on the front page, of course.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.180]   Good luck.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.180]   You know why they still have them?
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.180]   -I5.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.180]   -Oh, yeah.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.180]   I knew this one.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.180]   I shouldn't have even had to ask.
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.780]   That's the one we would probably want to get.
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.780]   -Yeah.
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.780]   -Let's see.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.780]   -Plus the keyboard says, Kevin.
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:02.780]   -Oh, yeah, don't forget the keyboard.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:08.580]   -So this is something Kevin and I have been talking a lot about because I am in the market -- well,
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.980]   I'm in the market for a new laptop.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:15.780]   And with the new MacBooks and the butterfly keyboard, I'm like, "Ah!" or the MacBook
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.780]   airs.
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:20.500]   So he's trying to convince me to buy a Surface laptop, but I'm still kind of like, "Ooh."
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.620]   -Okay, this is really confusing.
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.140]   I think Best Buy needs a little bit of explanation here.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:31.820]   They're trying to upsell me on Microsoft Office for my Pixelbook.
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.820]   -No, sorry.
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.820]   It's Chrome OS.
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.980]   -Well, but actually, wait a second.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.140]   Is that the online version?
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.980]   Then you actually might want to buy it.
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:40.980]   -Let's see.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:41.980]   -Sure.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:42.980]   I'm stuck in an office.
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.940]   -No, it's 365, personal or?
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:45.940]   -It's just --
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:46.940]   -So --
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.820]   -But wait, but it's a subscription to the online.
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.820]   You can use that.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.620]   -The online's free.
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.620]   -Not for the -- -
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.620]   -The Web-based one.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.740]   Oh, you mean this is going to be -- yeah, I would not recommend.
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.740]   So --
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:00.740]   -Oh, I would --
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.740]   -See, I don't know.
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.660]   If the release date for this item has not been announced, so I think you could order
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.980]   this and you may not -- it may not mean that you're going to get it.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.140]   God, it's expensive.
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.140]   -It is.
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.820]   -This is ridiculous.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:18.140]   Because this is $9.99 for the i5 version with 128.
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:21.060]   -What's the equivalent iPad Pro?
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.060]   -Yeah.
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.260]   -You want to see a $2,000 tablet?
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.740]   Take Feast Your Eyes.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.740]   -That's the end.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.740]   -Feast Your Eyes.
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.940]   Well, I'd not mind, actually mine isn't.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.820]   I couldn't bring myself to get a terabyte of storage, but it's pretty expensive.
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:40.700]   I don't remember exactly what, but there's $200 for this keyboard, which is, by the way,
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.980]   what Google's charging for their keyboard.
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.700]   This is the folio keyboard.
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.700]   It goes on here.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:50.300]   -Man, this is just a way to make laptops less durable and irritating to use.
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.300]   -Thank you.
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.180]   With an operating system that just doesn't do it all.
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.180]   -Sucks.
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.180]   I want my Nexus 7.
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.180]   I want my Nexus 7.
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.180]   -That was a great Android tablet.
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.180]   -Great device.
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.180]   That's a tablet.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.180]   This is a laptop.
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.420]   Making a laptop into a tablet just doesn't make any sense.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.020]   -Again, back to my contention.
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.220]   Hybrid devices have a very poor history.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:21.260]   -You know, the only, only, only time that I use my Pixelbook as a tablet, I guess?
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:25.460]   -These are generally, please shut down your large, electronic devices.
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:29.140]   You may use your tablet, so I turn it into a tablet and they don't bother me.
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.220]   Then I turn it back into laptops, as we're up.
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.500]   -I bought the 12" iPad Pro.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.500]   That's $9.99.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.340]   I can't even order.
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.500]   Oh, you have to choose the color.
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.500]   If you want a terabyte of storage, it's $17.49.
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.900]   I didn't go that crazy.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.780]   I only got 256 gigs of rims.
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.580]   I did get Wi-Fi and cellular.
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.580]   So that's $12.99.
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.580]   -Which I wish I could get.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.580]   -Yeah, cellular, I might consider it.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:55.340]   -I'm putting a Google Fi chip in and I'll let you know how that works.
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.340]   -The data chip.
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.340]   -I think it'll work.
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.340]   -It might work?
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.340]   -Yeah, no, I think it will work.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.340]   It might look like a T-Mobile SIM, but it'll work.
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.540]   -I thought Fi only worked in certain devices still.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:06.060]   -I've been able to use this data SIM.
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.900]   I was using it in a Windows and HP NVX2.
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:09.900]   -You're kidding.
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.900]   -Should I try it?
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.900]   -Sure.
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:19.340]   -I just happened to have a SIM puller on my...
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.340]   No, I don't.
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.820]   I'm on my key chain.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.380]   -John's going to go get it out of my drawer.
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.380]   -I will say it.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.460]   -I keep a bottle opener on my key chain.
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.660]   -I do keep a SIM puller.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:34.460]   -I keep a little plastic holder SIM cards, however, call me nuts, but I happen to have...
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.460]   -Good on.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:36.460]   -Let's see.
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.460]   I think I'll use...
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.780]   Today I have T-Mobile, AT&T.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.740]   I think I shall choose the Google Fi SIM.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.620]   -How do you know it's the Google Fi?
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.620]   -It says Fi.
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:50.180]   -But on some of them, I have two T-Mobile, I have to write the phone number on it.
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.860]   Very tiny handwriting.
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:52.860]   All right.
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.620]   -Oh, thank you.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:59.660]   -John's like your friend Norton on Howard Stern.
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.820]   He just anticipates your need and goes and gets your puller.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.220]   -He's better than any Fred.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.860]   -He is the king.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.300]   Oh, and see the magnetic pencil?
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.300]   -Yeah.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:23.780]   -I got two, one for Megan, it says dream girl, and mine says dream boy, because you can
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:24.780]   monogram them.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.780]   -What does that cost?
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.500]   -I think it was free, because the pencil is $129.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:35.020]   $200 keyboard, $129 pencil, $12.99 for the iPad.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.660]   I think I did get close to $2,000.
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:38.660]   -Yeah.
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.460]   -Plus, do you ever buy service for these things?
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.460]   -No, no.
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.060]   -Because you get rid of it.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.020]   -Yeah, no, I don't.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.180]   I self-insure.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.140]   All right, there's the sim.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.780]   This slot, let's just put a little Google Fi in there.
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:54.780]   -Are you bored?
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.780]   -Oh, sorry.
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.780]   -No, I'm sleepy.
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.780]   I was up late last night.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.780]   -Why?
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:00.780]   What were you doing?
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.420]   -I was watching the election returns, and then I was angsting.
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.420]   -I like how she said.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.420]   -Yeah.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.420]   -I was watching.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:11.180]   In California, we knew Beto lost before midnight.
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.260]   -Well, I knew he'd lost as of like 10 o'clock.
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.260]   -Yeah.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.260]   -Yeah, Beto, no, no.
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.260]   -It still felt sad.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.260]   -You know what?
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.540]   I was thinking, and then they echoed it.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.940]   Now he's wide open for presidential run.
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.580]   Think of it that way.
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:27.660]   -I'm assuming he'll run in 2020 for Senate in Texas, which
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.660]   would be smarter.
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.860]   -This is what we all win.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.460]   -I mean, yeah.
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.940]   Yeah, anyway.
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.940]   -Where do I find out?
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.220]   I go to cellular.
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.220]   Let's see.
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:42.660]   Cellular data on SIM card.
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:51.060]   -Ooh, maybe I'll have my family bring me a cup of coffee.
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.980]   -So, I'm waiting.
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.620]   While we're waiting.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:56.620]   While we're waiting.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.620]   I think it worked.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:58.620]   I don't know.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.940]   -Can I get advice on my laptop conundrum, or should we do an ad?
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:02.940]   You should probably do an ad.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.820]   -Do your laptop conundrum, then we'll do the ad.
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:06.820]   -Okay.
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.740]   I currently have a MacBook Air, you guys.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.180]   I use all of my USB ports.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.500]   I have a -- like, I plug in audio.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.060]   La-la-la-la-audio.
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.980]   I do Skype for Twig.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.900]   I need a new laptop.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.580]   I don't love the keyboard and on the MacBook Air.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.580]   The butterfly keyboard and the thing.
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.580]   -Do you mind Windows?
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.980]   -I don't mind Windows.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.780]   I have had Windows computers in the past.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:31.580]   So the question is, what laptop should I go with?
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.220]   And I do want it to be light for travel.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.620]   -John, would you bring me, Fred?
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:41.500]   Bring me the Huawei Mate Pro X.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.740]   -I'll show you one of my favorites.
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.100]   I'm going to test.
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.940]   Skype might work on a Chromebook.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.420]   -I also run Audacity.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.340]   I do some audio transcription.
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.340]   -Yeah.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.340]   -Audio editing.
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.340]   -So.
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.140]   -So, how do you feel about the Chinese government?
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.140]   [ Laughter ]
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:05.780]   -All right.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.780]   I am a little nervous about the Chinese government.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.220]   -So this is a company called Huawei.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.980]   They're a Chinese company.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.980]   This is the Huawei Mate Pro X.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:20.340]   It is -- Okay, let me show you next to the brand new MacBook Air.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.660]   Roughly the same size.
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.620]   It has a fairly good keyboard.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.620]   Fingerprint reader.
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:30.500]   Unlike the Air, the screen goes almost all the way to the Edge.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:35.180]   The Air's screen does not.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:39.300]   On the other hand, the Air's camera is an insensible spot, which is at the top of the
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.300]   screen.
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.340]   You can see where the bezels are.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.340]   But there's room for camera.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.700]   The camera -- and I don't know if you care about this.
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.220]   The camera on the Huawei is hidden away in the function key.
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.220]   Right there.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.220]   There it is.
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.220]   It just popped up.
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.220]   -So it -- -Oh, that's weird.
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.220]   -It gets your nose hairs?
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.220]   -It's a nose cam.
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.220]   -Okay.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.460]   -But if you really -- I mean, if you really wanted to use it, you could probably just, you
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.140]   know, do it like this.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.140]   [laughter]
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:06.580]   -I mean, I have an external camera.
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.540]   So how many ports does it have?
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:13.700]   -Ah, the Apple comes with two Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:18.660]   The Huawei comes with a Type A USB 3.1 port.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.340]   Dual Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:25.420]   So you have a little more flexibility, both charged with Type C, which I think you should
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:26.420]   get.
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.980]   This has a fingerprint reader.
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.740]   I think a much better keyboard than the Apple.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.700]   A little more travel.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:36.060]   If you really care about keyboard, though, as a writer, you might look at a ThinkPad
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:40.620]   from Lenovo, which aren't -- the ThinkPad -- I mean, look, the most beautiful laptop
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.900]   out there is the ThinkPad X1 Carbon.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:43.900]   It's stunning.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:44.900]   It's light.
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.300]   It's thin.
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.420]   It's a little pricey.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:53.300]   This starts -- well, I think the one you want is about $16.99 on the Huawei, which is pretty
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.300]   good for this.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.300]   The Apple comparable Apple -- well, there is no comparable Apple because they're using
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:03.460]   a much slower processor, but is about $100 more.
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:06.940]   I think the ThinkPad X1 Carbon is probably in that price.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.420]   It's sub-2000.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.780]   The X1 Carbon is really nice.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:11.780]   That's --
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:12.780]   Check it out.
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:20.260]   I mean, if there are a couple of advantages to doing a ThinkPad, the keyboard is unparalleled.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.260]   Okay.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.260]   Yeah.
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.700]   Kevin was pushing me towards a Microsoft Surface.
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:26.700]   No.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:27.700]   Thank you.
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:28.700]   No.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:29.700]   Because you don't like that --
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.180]   Oh, that was decisive.
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.180]   No.
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:33.180]   I wouldn't.
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.860]   Well, I'm still going to go -- I've got to go check everything out, but I'm really kind
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.100]   of hacked off.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.700]   So this is -- thank you guys.
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.740]   6th Generation X1 Carbon.
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.740]   Beautiful.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:42.740]   Starts at $11.39.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.860]   You can customize it to be a little bit more beefy.
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:50.180]   If you want a 2-in-1 where you can flip it over, they make a yoga, which does the same
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.820]   thing as basically X1 yoga.
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:52.820]   So same thing.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:35:00.580]   I like that just like Jeff does in the airplane you can content it.
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:03.220]   You can watch a movie that way, which is nice.
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.660]   I really think ThinkPads are great.
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:11.660]   Also a Chinese company in Lenovo, but not one of those Chinese companies that people
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.980]   in the Commerce Department are worried about apparently.
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:16.980]   And now --
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:21.300]   I'm going to tell you what you could watch on that new Tented notebook.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.820]   How about that?
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:26.660]   Are you familiar with CuriosityStream?
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:29.380]   I know you're curious.
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:34.540]   CuriosityStream is the world's first streaming service that's addressed to your lifelong
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.060]   quest to learn, to explore, to understand.
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:43.180]   I want you to go to curiositystream.com/twit.
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.740]   It's as little as $2.99 a month.
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.420]   So you got to love that.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.420]   They have amazing documentaries.
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:51.940]   It's founded by John Hendrix.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.740]   He was a guy who created Discovery.
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:36:01.140]   They do have Roku apps, Android apps, Xbox, smart TV, iOS, Chromecast, Amazon Fire, Amazon
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.060]   Kindle, and Apple TV apps.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.380]   So you can watch it anywhere.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.540]   It's available worldwide.
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.460]   There are no geographic restrictions.
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:14.380]   The content spans everything from science, nature, history, lots of technology, lots
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.820]   of society and lifestyle.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:20.740]   There's the Stephen Hawking series, favorite places, the hunt for dark matter, birth of
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:25.620]   the internet, destination, Mars, cyber war.
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.140]   It's basically documentaries.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.860]   I love documentaries.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.460]   I want to watch more documentaries all the time.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.900]   By the way, they also have a premium plan, which includes Ultra HD and 4K streaming.
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.860]   A lot of these are in 4K streaming.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.740]   So I am a huge fan of CuriosityStream.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.540]   More often than not, we'll say, "Oh, what's on?
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:49.540]   What dramas around?"
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.940]   Let's watch Wild Venice.
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:57.060]   Did you know that Venice has its own coral reefs?
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:02.100]   Two thousand plus documentary features and series.
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:08.380]   Visit curiositystream.com/twit and use the code to get one month free.
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:12.500]   There's always new stuff too, which I really, really like.

[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.180]   CuriosityStream.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:27.100]   History of food, the trials of Muhammad Ali, Wallace Simpson, the secret letters.
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.500]   Wire bees facing extinction?
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.860]   This actually, you know what?
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:36.180]   You're laughing, but you've never seen photography of bees like this.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.100]   It's amazing.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.660]   Bees are fascinating.
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.660]   Bees are great.
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:41.980]   Bees are awesome.
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.220]   Well, then you would want to watch this.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:49.820]   I was laughing because I heard wire bees and I thought wire bees.
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.140]   My brain was like, "Oh, wire bees."
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.660]   Then she said, "I want them."
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:55.660]   Yes, exactly.
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:56.900]   I'm like, "I need some wire bees."
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:57.900]   You could get it because it's wired.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.900]   I want it.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.900]   Whatever it is.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.900]   You can get bees in your new home in Seattle.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.380]   All right.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.340]   So we helped you buy a laptop.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.340]   I shouldn't.
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.700]   I haven't tried this yet.
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:16.420]   It's very nostalgic for me to see a MacBook Air because I just loved this form factor.
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.420]   I really did.
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.420]   I did.
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:19.420]   Yeah, I loved it too.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.420]   It was so great when it came out, but it's not.
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.820]   And that was the problem with it now.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:24.820]   Keyboard?
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.660]   It's got a very short travel keyboard.
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:27.660]   I hate it.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.660]   I hate those scripts.
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:29.860]   I'm not a fan.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:32.780]   The second generation is a little better.
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.780]   Not much, but a little.
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.260]   Well, this is the third generation, but for what ever it is.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.260]   Yeah, the most recent.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.980]   Because I have the MacBook Pro with the newest one.
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.420]   Didn't they just announce one?
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.140]   Is that the just announced new one?
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.140]   Yeah, this is it.
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.140]   Yeah.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.740]   It's in a lovely gold.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:48.060]   I was excited about rose gold.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.780]   I was like, ooh, I'm thinking fast.
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:50.780]   It's gold gold.
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.740]   Oh, I wanted the rose gold.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.180]   I think gold gold's pretty sweet.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:39:00.180]   Well, yes, you come at that computer there, Leo.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:03.260]   I have way too many computers.
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:08.220]   I think that Huawei shows what Apple could have done, but it is there is an issue.
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:11.420]   It's from a Chinese government related company.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:15.380]   Yeah, I don't know if I'd buy a Huawei laptop, honestly.
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.300]   Then look at the Lenovo's.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.460]   Those Lenovo's don't the think pads though, the think pads.
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.460]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.140]   And man, you could that you could bang on them.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.260]   The keyboards are replaceable.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.260]   The screens are replaceable.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:26.900]   The track bread is replaceable.
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:27.900]   They are great.
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:28.900]   Yeah.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.900]   Look at these.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.900]   Andrew has one.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:31.900]   Oh, Andrew knows.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.380]   Ah, beautiful bees.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.900]   Wow.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:40.260]   So I'm reading a novel right now about the amazing life story of Madame Tussaud.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.820]   Ooh.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:42.820]   Of the wax.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.820]   The wax fame.
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:44.820]   Yes.
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:49.460]   So speaking of wax, it's amazing how much wax people used to use all those bees.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.660]   You need to produce a lot of wax.
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.660]   And then I just.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.660]   Is that where wax?
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.660]   Okay.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.420]   I know there's beeswax, but is that where all wax comes from?
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.420]   No, not anymore.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.220]   Like more of a back then.
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.380]   That's all they had.
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.380]   I don't know.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.380]   Okay, that is all they had.
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.700]   Or maybe a little amber-griss.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:06.700]   Throw it in.
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.700]   What?
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.500]   Oh, the whale throw up.
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.180]   Oh, that's a little waxy.
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:16.260]   So last week, we didn't talk about it.
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:20.300]   We talked a little bit about all the kerfuffle, but we didn't talk about the walkout.
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.180]   Because it was on Thursday, I think.
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:29.460]   And on Monday of this week, a couple of days ago, the Google executive team met to say,
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.460]   what are we going to do?
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:36.500]   20,000 workers in Google offices across 50 cities walked out in November 1st at 1110
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.740]   AM.
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:41.500]   Here's the San Francisco walkout.
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.660]   Some of them holding up signs.
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.900]   Many of them holding up signs that say, don't be evil.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.180]   Make Google do it.
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.460]   I'm happy to quit for 90 million.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.060]   Says one of them.
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.980]   I don't know if I'd be advertising that.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:56.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:57.940]   Yeah, really.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:03.340]   They're talking of course about how Android founder Andy Rubin got a 90 million dollar
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.340]   payday when he left.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:11.500]   But it turns out he left also because of sexual harassment charges or in a, actually,
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:12.500]   it wasn't harassment.
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.220]   It was inappropriate sexual conduct.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.460]   Conduct sexual misconduct, I believe is what they call it.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.460]   Misconduct.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:23.620]   I think it's misconduct these days.
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:28.220]   We have the eyes of many companies looking at us at Google employee, Tanuja Gupta in
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:29.220]   New York.
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.220]   We've always been a Vanguard company.
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:33.060]   If we don't lead the way, no one else will.
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:36.420]   So I think that's how a lot of Googlers are seeing it is not so much that there's something
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.100]   wrong with Google, but we have to be even better.
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.100]   Yeah.
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.980]   We have to lead the way.
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.980]   Right.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.340]   Did you understand the New York Times headline?
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:49.820]   Google workers reject Silicon Valley individualism in walkout.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.820]   What?
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:54.100]   I'm sorry, headline.
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:59.380]   For decades, Silicon Valley has been ground zero for a vaguely utopian form of individualism.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:05.100]   The idea that a single engineer with a laptop and an internet connection could change the
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.780]   world or at least the long established industry.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:11.940]   Class consciousness was passé, unions were the enemy of innovation and anchored to the
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:12.940]   status quo.
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.780]   What the heck is this report?
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:19.220]   I think that's somebody in New York's idea of what Silicon Valley is all about.
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.220]   Don't think that's accurate.
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.220]   Comies.
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.220]   Comies.
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:24.220]   It's a bunch of comies.
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.220]   They hate unions.
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.220]   I hate unions.
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.420]   Well, that is true.
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:31.980]   I think actually libertarianism probably sums that up really well.
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:32.980]   Not needing it.
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.980]   But anyway.
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.980]   By the way, according to...
[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:38.780]   I don't think individualism was not the real issue here in my view.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:39.780]   That's all.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.780]   No.
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:41.780]   That was sexual.
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:42.780]   Yeah.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.700]   Actually, it saw this and was kind of interested in the idea of what that meant for collective
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:50.300]   action by workers in Silicon Valley.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:55.620]   If you wanted to protest sexual harassment, do you also want to protest things like contract
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:56.620]   labor?
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.100]   I don't know.
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:04.020]   So, if you got a more politically aware class, what that might mean, but that's just me
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.260]   being all crazy.
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.740]   I have turned off Wi-Fi.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.100]   I have full LTE.
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.140]   It identifies as Google Fi.
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.140]   Wow.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.980]   Wow.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:15.980]   Wow.
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:16.980]   So...
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:23.260]   Why the heck didn't Google with Google Fi put that in the damn slate?
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.260]   It just drives me nuts.
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.940]   Maybe that's why they did it, Jeff.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.500]   Kevin, I don't know how to drive me nuts.
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:29.500]   It's true.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.500]   Google.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.500]   Google.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.300]   Kevin Tofel tweeted me that there was a...
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.140]   I forget, which one it was, but it was a...
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.940]   Somebody added LTE to a Chromebook.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.940]   Jarvis is going to want that.
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:41.940]   I did.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.740]   Well, you can always hotspot and stuff, but I...
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:45.740]   I can't.
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:46.740]   I hope the hotspot is...
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:51.180]   Because I have a grandfather at AT&T unlimited.
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.820]   And they won't let you do that, huh?
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.820]   No.
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:58.820]   Oh, Kevin says Google Fi sims work on any unlock device, but stay on the Tmo network.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:43:59.820]   It's a new mobile.
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.820]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.100]   Although, in the past, I've seen them identified as Tmo.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:05.700]   This is identifying as Google Fi anyway, which is a...
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.060]   That's a good sign.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.060]   Actually...
[00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:12.220]   I feel like a medium channel in Kevin.
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.220]   And now...
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.300]   Kevin is saying...
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:20.740]   Wait a minute.
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.220]   Kevin's raising the table.
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:23.980]   It was a Samsung.
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:24.980]   Samsung.
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:28.900]   If you're going to hell, ring a bell.
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.420]   I was going to say, you know, this is...
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:36.100]   I have a table that could be raised, and I could connect it to Kevin.
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.020]   He could IOT it on you.
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.020]   Uh-huh.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.820]   Kevin could raise your table.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.860]   Oh, spirits.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:51.420]   Speak to me if there is going to be a new Google Pixelbook.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.380]   Ring three times.
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.940]   Kevin says, "Does anyone want to speak to their great-grandparents?
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:00.700]   I have to bear with me."
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:04.540]   For those of you on audio, Leo is geeking out with his raiseable table.
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:05.540]   My table went up.
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.820]   Oh, did you not see my table go up to?
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:08.820]   Or did you miss it?
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.820]   Well, my table is hiding your table.
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:11.820]   He's hiding your streak.
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:12.820]   He's hiding here.
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:13.820]   There I'm going.
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:14.820]   Oh.
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:15.820]   Oh.
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.020]   Wow, we can all do that.
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:19.860]   The thing is, because her camera is on the table...
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:20.860]   Exactly.
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:21.860]   Look, it's Stacy's case.
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:22.860]   She's disappearing.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.860]   I'm just going down.
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:25.860]   Yes.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.620]   I think it's way more effective.
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.860]   It's like that stair-climbing-mining thing that could happen.
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:31.860]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.900]   So I have colleagues here to get the stand-up desks, and then they sit down.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.900]   They type like they have those motorcycles that they use.
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:39.900]   It's just ridiculous.
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:40.900]   What?
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:41.900]   Do they really?
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:42.900]   Those are generally just chompers.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:43.900]   They really do.
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:44.900]   Chompers, thank you.
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.420]   I'll never understand chompers.
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.100]   So they sit like this, and they type.
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.100]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:50.780]   No, it's way up here.
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:51.780]   It's literally up here.
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:52.780]   Are they good?
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:53.780]   They're looking up at the screen.
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:54.780]   They're doing that to message you.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:55.780]   You did the purpose.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:56.780]   Yeah.
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:57.780]   It's odd.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.700]   I just want to sit down.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.020]   I just want to sit down.
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:04.020]   We have a thing called a desk.
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.020]   All right.
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.100]   So I guess we don't have anything.
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:11.260]   We talked about this last week, the Google walkout, but it actually happened.
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.260]   And I don't--
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:17.260]   It's interesting to me that Sundar said before the walkout, I endorse the walkout, and I
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.380]   will make sure that nobody gets a troll for walking out.
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.980]   Which is the right thing to do, right?
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.380]   Yeah, but it makes your walkout like a non-protest.
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.380]   Exactly.
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.380]   It's like--
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:26.380]   My risk free protest.
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:27.380]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.380]   Go ahead, Lee.
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:29.380]   I'll run away from home.
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:30.380]   See what I hear.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:31.700]   It's from high school.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:36.260]   In high school, we would leave school to protest the Vietnam War, and the teachers would come
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.260]   with us.
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.260]   It was like, "Ah."
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.260]   They do that.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:44.060]   So they had that, although not in every school in Texas, but if you wanted to protest, the
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.660]   day the students walked out for a gun by them--
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.140]   Yeah, that was really cool.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:48.660]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.020]   They supported that, right?
[00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:51.020]   Yeah.
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.020]   Yes.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.020]   Which--
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:54.020]   They should.
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.020]   I mean, but yeah.
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:59.460]   And it is nice that Sundar was solidarity in that way, but is he in solidarity in the--
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:04.420]   OK, maybe I won't give anybody else a golden-- what is it, Golden Nut handcuffs parachute?
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.140]   Golden parachute.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:07.140]   So--
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:09.900]   I haven't-- maybe I missed it.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:15.460]   That Monday meeting with the executive team, and Sundar Pichai, was-- did anything come
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:16.460]   out of that?
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:18.460]   I didn't see any announcements.
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:19.460]   I would either--
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:20.460]   Well, they were going to do that.
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:21.460]   They didn't fire a protest.
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.580]   Yeah, what are they going to-- I mean, the test of this comes next when they can't
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.100]   claw back the money from Andy Rubin.
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.100]   No.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:35.980]   What we saw-- and we talked about the article and the cut and what they were asking for.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:43.300]   And while some of that, I think, isn't going to happen, such as putting an employee representative
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.660]   on the board.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:49.140]   But they wanted to end forced arbitration in cases of harassment and discrimination.
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.740]   This is actually a big battle in California.
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:56.980]   The California legislature approved a bill making forced arbitration illegal.
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:01.940]   Most employers, including, I should say, in full disclosure that Twit does this as well,
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:06.140]   we have a clause in your employee contract that says you will go to arbitration in cases
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.620]   of dispute.
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:12.780]   And the whole idea there is to keep everybody out of court and save us the huge expense.
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:19.260]   Because it's very easy for employees who have been terminated to hire a lawyer on contingency
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:23.700]   and make our life expensive and miserable at no cost to them.
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.340]   So we put this in.
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.660]   I mean, I don't think we thought it was up.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:33.300]   I think this is just the normal employment contract.
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:37.660]   But they say they wanted to end to that, at least in cases of harassment and discrimination.
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:43.140]   Governor Brown vetoed the bill when the legislature approved it.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.140]   The governor signed it.
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:46.580]   It would not sign it.
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:47.480]   Number two, a commitment.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.700]   But I think that this is something, especially in the case of harassment and discrimination.
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.900]   This is something that Google might agree to.
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.260]   Their lawyers may not like it.
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:58.420]   A commitment to end pay and opportunity and equity.
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.420]   Well, of course they're going to say, yeah, absolutely.
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:01.420]   We commit.
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:03.420]   We will no longer do that.
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:04.420]   Up there.
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.140]   At least it was reading me last night.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:10.580]   There was a UN report on pay inequality that says it's going to take 231 years before
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.700]   women get paid the same as men.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:13.700]   I said, what?
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.060]   When they come up with that number.
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.940]   And it's based on how much it's been going up.
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.660]   Like a penny a year closer.
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:26.180]   At that rate, it'll be 231 years.
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:31.740]   Number three, a publicly disclosed sexual harassment transparency report.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.740]   I think that could be done.
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:37.580]   A clear uniform, a globally inclusive process, reporting sexual misconduct and safely and
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:38.580]   anonymously.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.580]   Absolutely.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.700]   In fact, the fact that they don't have that is kind of surprising.
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:46.860]   And then they want to elevate the chief diversity officer to answer directly to the CEO and
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:48.740]   make recommendations directly to the board of directors.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:49.740]   I think that's actually reasonable.
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:50.740]   All that's reasonable.
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:55.020]   I don't know about the employee representative on the board, but maybe they do that.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:59.180]   Or you just make your HR like the head of your HR and people.
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:01.300]   It doesn't even have to be chief diversity officer.
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:04.940]   Just has to be someone who actually gives a hoot about that sort of thing.
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:08.220]   Well, frankly, that's what the HR person should be given a hoot about.
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:09.220]   Okay.
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.780]   Well, that is not necessarily what HR people are.
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:12.980]   Sometimes they represent the company.
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.980]   They're there to protect the company.
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:21.180]   I have a very good friend who is head of HR at a variety of companies currently at Silicon
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:22.180]   Labs.
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:26.300]   And she has strong opinions on HR and the role of HR.
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:28.820]   And I love her for it.
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:33.340]   Is it to protect the company against exposure or to protect the employees against the company?
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:34.500]   No, it's to create it.
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:40.220]   It's basically to create the type of environment that the company wants to have and to push
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.220]   that.
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:42.220]   That's fair.
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:45.740]   I have a really dickish HR person if you have a company that doesn't really care about
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:49.100]   their workers, but we care.
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:52.860]   If you care, we care.
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:55.460]   So did you run off to Best Buy to get a Pixel Slate?
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:56.460]   No, you did not.
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.940]   No, I did not.
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.980]   No, you do not want the Pixel Slate.
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.420]   I do not want the Pixel Slate Sam I am.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:04.420]   Sam I am.
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.020]   That's going to say.
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:11.620]   There is a contract Google has agreed to along with Facebook.
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:15.420]   Tim Bernier Lee's contract for the Web.
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:23.300]   This is such a bull.
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.460]   Well, tell us how you feel.
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:27.820]   I'm trying to find it.
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:28.900]   What is the contract for the Web?
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:29.900]   What is the contract?
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:33.860]   I put that on there, but I had to read the contract for the Web yet.
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.740]   It's really vague.
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:38.300]   It's basically like, hold on, I'll get the actual.
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.300]   Contracts for the Web.
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:40.460]   Core principles.
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.740]   The Web first, Core principles.
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:44.340]   This site uses cookies.
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:51.020]   Okay, look at that.
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:55.580]   The Web was designed to bring people together and make knowledge freely available.
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:56.580]   Really?
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:57.580]   I guess so.
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.820]   Yeah, I guess that's what Tim Bernier Lee was trying to do, right?
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.940]   Maybe Nick knowledge freely available was number one, then bring people together.
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:06.300]   Everyone has a role to play to ensure the Web serves humanity.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.300]   Okay.
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:10.020]   By committing the following principles, governments, companies, and citizens around the world
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.020]   can I protect it?
[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:13.420]   The open Web is a public good in a basic way for everyone.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:15.580]   Can't disagree with that.
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:25.140]   Governments will ensure everyone can connect to the Internet unless it violates free speech.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:30.080]   I'm mocking the FCC commissioner who said, oh, we can't have municipal Internet.
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.220]   That would violate free speech.
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.700]   Get out.
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:35.200]   Sorry.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.260]   Keep all the Internet available all the time so that no one is denied their right to full
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:40.260]   Internet access.
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:42.900]   I like that.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:47.860]   Respect people's fundamental right to privacy so everyone can use the Internet freely safely
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:48.860]   and without fear.
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.300]   I'm waiting to see where the Stacy is going to pop up and.
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:53.100]   That's kind of a non-starter.
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:57.860]   No government's going to say, well, we're going to, you know, you all, I mean, yeah, privacy
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:59.340]   unless you're a terrorist.
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:00.340]   Right.
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.340]   That's the safely.
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:06.060]   So the government's part is kind of silly in the sense that, hey, if you're Iran, you're
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:08.940]   going to shut down the Web when you want to.
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:09.940]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:13.860]   So I'm like, eh, but the companies, which is sort of Google and Facebook, I mean, short
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:17.660]   Google and Facebook are like, yes, governments, let's provide affordable access to the Internet
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:19.500]   so people can consume our services.
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:23.100]   But making the Internet affordable and accessible to everyone.
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:28.300]   So they're actively trying to do that because again, for their own cynical reasons, get
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:29.940]   more users.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:35.700]   And so saying they respect consumers privacy and personal data, I'm sure that Google is
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:37.580]   feels that they do that.
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:42.660]   I'm sure that Facebook would tell us they do that and they have in the past and then
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:48.420]   lied through their teeth and develop the technologies that support the best in humanity
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:49.940]   and challenge the worst.
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:50.940]   Oh, God.
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:51.940]   Please.
[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:54.700]   Yeah, it's kind of pretty amorphous.
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:57.580]   These are sweet, but they're not anything that can be realized.
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.940]   I mean, it's like, don't be evil as your corporate slogan.
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:03.020]   Google was going to get rid of that because that was a ridiculous corpus filled in.
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:04.020]   All right.
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.460]   Well, let's, there's a third part us as users.
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:09.580]   Others will be creators and collaborators in the web.
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:11.340]   So the web has a rich, relevant content for everyone.
[00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:13.180]   I think I like that.
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.980]   Everybody might have has something to say on the web.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:18.900]   Everybody should get to put something up about citizens will not be a holes.
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:20.900]   It does not adhere.
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:22.060]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:26.940]   This kind of is build strong communities that respect civil discourse and human dignity.
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:29.900]   So everyone feels safe and everyone feels safe.
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:30.900]   All right.
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:31.900]   All right.
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:32.900]   Everybody is a troll.
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:33.900]   You can argue.
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:34.900]   You can argue.
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:35.900]   You can argue.
[00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:40.100]   So I just had it.
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:45.220]   So you might argue that that white nationalists won't feel Trump or won't feel free and available
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.420]   in some communities.
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:47.420]   All right.
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:48.420]   Fight for the web discussion.
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:49.420]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:50.420]   Do the last one.
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.420]   Fight for the webs.
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:54.020]   The web remains open and a global public resource for everybody everywhere.
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:59.060]   Yeah, this is very soft and not, you know, it's, it's nice.
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.060]   It's nice.
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:01.060]   That's nice.
[00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:02.060]   It is.
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:03.060]   It's so sweet.
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:04.060]   Nice.
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:05.060]   So here's a related question.
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:10.660]   I was, I was talking to a academic researcher, I respect immensely and she's working with
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:18.780]   somebody else we all know on trying to come up with the metrics of positive social impact
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:24.340]   and positive society on the net.
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:31.060]   And they, they're debating as of the moment they want to exclude civility as a metric.
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:34.060]   What do you think?
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:36.860]   What do you think of like as civility?
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:38.660]   Does that preclude disagreement?
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:41.180]   No, I don't think it does.
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:45.100]   I think the problem is that they see is that everyone defines it differently.
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:48.980]   And I had this discussion with Yasha Monk, who's a brand Harvard professor who's written
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.020]   books about the death of democracy.
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:54.860]   And I said, the problem with the word civility now, I'm hearing is that like fake news, it
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:56.500]   got co-opted.
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:01.300]   And so the far right ring will say, if you try to shut down Milo, then you're not being
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:03.540]   civil to him.
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:08.140]   And, but Yasha said, no, no, no, no, no, don't give up on the word.
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:09.140]   Don't, don't.
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:12.300]   You can be civil and still call evil evil.
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:15.500]   It is not uncivil to call evil evil.
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:22.020]   So you can have that large carve out, but that civility is still a goal.
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.340]   So we went back and forth a lot.
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:26.300]   And the problem they're trying to grapple with is that how the hell would you ever come
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.020]   up with an algorithm to measure this?
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:30.820]   And I said, you're not going to come up with one size fits all algorithm.
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:35.900]   Because as the project that I announced last week, we said in our long post about that,
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:40.620]   you know, the uses of certain words are going to be different.
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:45.580]   If you're, if you're, if you're the root reporting on racism, you're going to use charged words
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:51.340]   that elsewhere would be absolutely for Bowdoin and context and audience matter.
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:53.380]   So there's not a one size fits all.
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:57.300]   I do think you need humans to create learning sets around this, but I do think it's possible
[00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:03.780]   to start to imagine flags of incivility or flags of civil behavior, flags of peacekeeping
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:04.780]   behavior.
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:11.180]   It's hard to, I mean, like what are, what are the challenges I think with online debates
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:16.100]   or even telephone debates in all honesty is it's very hard to see that the other person
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:19.780]   is actually listening to you, which is an important part of any civil debate is feeling
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:21.700]   like you've been heard.
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:22.700]   True.
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:24.780]   And that's, that's very challenging online.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:28.060]   It's even challenging, like when I'm talking to my mom on the phone about her decision
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.180]   to vote for Ted Cruz.
[00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:34.460]   And so I can see you rolling your eyes, Stacy.
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:35.460]   I don't even look at you.
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:36.540]   I can see you rolling your eyes.
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:38.340]   I know you're rolling your eyes at the.
[00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:43.780]   I wasn't, I wasn't, I actually deeply saddens me because I understand her point of view.
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:46.700]   We don't agree with it, but I understand it.
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:54.380]   And that's, that's a hallmark of civility is the ability to, like, to convey that.
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:59.820]   And so the other person doesn't like feel that you're, you are rolling their eyes at
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:00.820]   them, right?
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:02.820]   >> I told you guys about Spaceship Media.
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:03.820]   You heard about this company?
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:04.820]   >> No.
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:10.140]   >> Wonderful company started by two journalists in San Francisco to convene communities.
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:13.500]   This is answering your questions, Stacy, about how they have a methodology of this.
[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.900]   They convene communities in conflict and conversation.
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:19.900]   So their first was getting 25 women who voted for Trump, 25 women who voted for Clinton
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:21.700]   in San Francisco and Alabama.
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:24.940]   And the journalist interviewed them all and put them in a Facebook room.
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:29.580]   And at first, of course, they talked nicely and then it fell down quickly.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:33.180]   But two of my graduates in the social journalism program were working full time there and they
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:37.820]   have a methodology for, look at the seven steps of dialogue journalism.
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:44.180]   They have a methodology of making sure that people are hearing each other and reflecting
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:49.700]   what they hear and asking questions rather than making accusations and ending up with
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:52.980]   a civil conversation.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:55.340]   And that's really a neat, neat, neat company.
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:56.340]   These people are great.
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:59:00.260]   They're doing one now with 5,000 women eventually.
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:04.220]   They've done, I forget the projects, but they've done like African American students
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:05.220]   and teachers.
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:08.260]   They did a huge national thing with advanced publications on guns.
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:14.180]   I think we tend to presume that people go into these chat rooms and it's all negative
[00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:15.180]   and all awful.
[00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:18.180]   And the worst of the worst, of course, is over there with 20,000 people hired by Facebook
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:21.460]   to get rid of things that don't meet their community standards.
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:27.740]   But it's possible if you put some resource and some investment into it and that the people
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:33.740]   in the room care enough to have it, you pick them, frankly, that you can start to learn
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:35.140]   how to have civil conversations.
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:38.980]   I think there's the beginnings of this online beginnings.
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:44.260]   Anyway, so I'm like, let's do it.
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:45.260]   Tim Berners, yeah.
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:49.180]   Well, Leo, you haven't, I was thinking about this, you haven't in your chat room.
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:50.180]   We do.
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:51.180]   You do.
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:53.300]   And it works.
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:56.820]   And it works because people have reasons to be there or reasons to protect it.
[00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:01.340]   Actually, it works because we have a dozen moderators with big sticks.
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:04.820]   Yeah, but they want to protect the chat room.
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:05.820]   Right.
[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:11.100]   And I think the vast majority of people in the chat room have to share that goal.
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:15.220]   But honestly, without enforcement, it doesn't matter.
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:19.900]   And that's the problem with trolls is they're norm breakers and you can have the norm, you
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.300]   can have the standard, you can, everybody can agree.
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:25.740]   And then one troll can do whatever they want because they're norm breakers.
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:26.740]   Yeah.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.740]   Right.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.380]   And that's, they're not bound by norms.
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:30.780]   So then I hate to say it.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:33.020]   That's when you break out the ban hammer.
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.700]   Yeah, you do.
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.700]   That's part of what you do.
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:37.700]   You got it.
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:41.420]   It seems more important than norms, frankly.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.420]   The norm is the chocolate does.
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:46.260]   But this is where I think some burgers, Lee is trying to get something.
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:49.700]   You start to say, do we have a shared goal?
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.820]   And it does start Stacey's absolutely right.
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:53.780]   It starts up in the cloud.
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:57.540]   It's up on, you know, it doesn't seem very tangible in any way.
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:01.900]   But you have to start, I think, and agree to the path before you can get down to the tactical
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:02.900]   level.
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:03.900]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:04.900]   Maybe.
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:08.940]   Because otherwise you're going to get the weeds right off the bat or defining civility.
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:09.940]   Yeah.
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:10.940]   Which is hard to do.
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:11.940]   It's hard to do.
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:14.540]   I know it when I see it.
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:21.980]   Well, indeed Stacey, my argument is the Info Wars thing, the algorithm writers and the
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:27.780]   comms people and policy people to platforms and the regulators and media somehow want
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:32.260]   to have a preset list of rules that they can write their algorithms to and write their
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:33.260]   regulations to.
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:34.260]   Right.
[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:38.660]   What happened in the Info Wars case is that a large chunks of society said, I don't know
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:39.660]   what your rules are.
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:43.140]   But if this is on the right side of it, your rules are wrong.
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:45.980]   It's on the wrong side of whatever the heck the rules are, get rid of it and then figure
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:46.980]   out your rules.
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.820]   And that's how society works.
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.380]   That's the negotiation of the norms and standards.
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:55.340]   And it starts transactionally and anecdotally.
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.860]   Info Wars has to be wrong.
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.860]   So deal with it.
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:05.220]   And all the, all the at Jax you see are, you know, Jack, how can this be okay?
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:12.220]   It always starts not with the rule, but it starts with the anecdote, the example.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.780]   Right.
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:21.500]   Let's take a little break, come back and we're going to talk about content ID, YouTube and
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.220]   why I'm mad as hell.
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:24.220]   Oh, no.
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:25.220]   Oh, no.
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:31.740]   Are you sure today brought to you by rocket mortgage from quick and loans introducing rate
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:35.500]   shield approval if the time has come for you to buy a home, you probably aren't writing
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.500]   a check.
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.100]   You're probably not bringing a bag of gold coins.
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.260]   You're probably getting a home loan.
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.860]   May I suggest you go to the number one lender in the country?
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:44.780]   Number one in customer satisfaction.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:50.780]   Eight years in a row, according to JD power, number one in volume two, thanks to that.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:57.500]   And you'll love this new three step power buying process.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:01.940]   Using interest rates make already anxious process a little more anxious.
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:05.500]   There's always a chance that as you're shopping for a house, interest rates will go up and
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.300]   it'll cost you thousands of dollars more.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.660]   Stacey, you'll know all about this soon.
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:10.860]   Can't wait.
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:11.860]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:16.380]   So wouldn't it be nice if when you get your loan, it gets locked so that rates can't go
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.380]   up.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:18.380]   That's rate shield approval.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.220]   Step one, the power buying process.
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:23.100]   You go right now to rocket mortgage.com/twigs.
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.500]   Set up the account.
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:28.740]   So a few simple questions you already know the answer to your social, your birthday, your
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:32.660]   name, your address and they will check your credit and then say, here's the loans you
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:34.060]   qualify for.
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.900]   You choose the term, the rate, the down payment.
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:39.980]   You'll love the, by the way, the rates are really good.
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:43.740]   And boom, you got pre-qualifant approval in less than 10 minutes with no trips to the
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:48.420]   attic, no trips to the bank, no need even to put on neckwear.
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:49.580]   No ties required.
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:54.100]   Quick and loans will verify your income and assets and credit in the next 24 hours.
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:56.700]   In these cases without you doing anything because they have trusted relationships with
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.620]   all the financial institutions.
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.180]   And then they give you something called verified approval.
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:02.180]   That's step two.
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.460]   It gives you the strength of a cash buyer.
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:07.260]   It means when you go to buy a house, there's no contingency.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.260]   You're good for the money.
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:11.460]   It's, you got the loan.
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:15.700]   Step three, once you're verified, you'll qualify for the all new rate shield approval.
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:19.180]   This is something exclusive to rocket mortgage and you're going to love it.
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:21.740]   They lock your rate for up to three months while you shop.
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:23.700]   It cannot go up.
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:27.980]   If rates go down, unlikely, but if they did, your rate would go down.
[01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:29.020]   More likely they're going to go up.
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:31.260]   At least you know your rate stays the same.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.300]   You know how much that loan is going to cost.
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:34.380]   And that takes some of the pressure.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.340]   You don't have to rush to buy that house.
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:39.780]   You have three months to look to find exactly the right place.
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:42.980]   This is why quick and loans is number one, honestly.
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.460]   To get started, you go to rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:50.020]   Rate shield approvals only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions.
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.580]   Additional exclusions or conditions may apply.
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:56.500]   Next on quick and loans data in comparison to public data records.
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:01.020]   Equal housing lender, licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org.
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:02.180]   Number 30, 30.
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:07.860]   It's rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:12.420]   We thank them for their support.
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:22.420]   So Content ID is the tool, the automated tool that Google uses, YouTube uses to find copyright
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.740]   violations.
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:27.540]   Google says, "Our anti-piracy efforts are doing very well.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:36.820]   They pay $3 billion to copyright owners through Content ID."
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:42.100]   Now the way it works, in most cases, is it's an automated system.
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:45.900]   If you get a ding on a YouTube video and we've gotten them, you can appeal it.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.780]   Or you could say, "Yep, you got me."
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:51.780]   And then the copyright holder has the right to pull you down if they want.
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.940]   Or to monetize against you to put ads up there.
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:59.780]   And that's so if you're a recording company and one of your songs is being used, you could
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:04.140]   pull a video down or you could have an ad for that song pop up, which would be nice.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.580]   Or just credit, you get your choice.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:08.140]   So it sounds like it's been very successful.
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:15.020]   This is a paper titled, "How Google Fights Piracy" that they put out in 2018.
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:20.020]   The video platform's Content ID scans uploads against a database of files submitted by
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.620]   content owners and creators.
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:26.460]   And when it detects it, it gives you those choices.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:31.580]   There's also, though, this is the one that's making me angry, a little head up.
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:37.140]   By the way, we have to say, I'd say we have been dinged from time to time by Content ID.
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:38.140]   We always appeal it.
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:39.140]   We say, "That's fair use.
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.380]   We're doing news operation."
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:44.940]   And in every case, it's been lifted and we've gone ahead.
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:46.220]   There's been one case.
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:48.140]   And I think this was actually legit.
[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:54.180]   We were showing off a TV and I had a BBC Planet Earth video playing, which we identified.
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:07:01.460]   But BBC said, "No, you can't do that because you're not reviewing Planet Earth.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.620]   You're reviewing a TV and it's showing Planet Earth."
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:04.940]   And I think that's actually legitimate.
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:07.380]   So BBC was still being a bit of a...
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:08.380]   We gave him a big plug.
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.100]   We said, "Isn't this beautiful footage blah, blah, blah."
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:11.340]   And we weren't showing it full screen.
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:13.980]   It wasn't like, "Oh, I don't have to buy the video now.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:17.140]   I could just watch the YouTube review of that TV."
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:17.980]   No.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:18.980]   Is that how much?
[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:21.260]   I mean, don't you have like a 30 second exemption or is there...
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:23.460]   No, there's no technically, there's no time limit.
[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:24.540]   There's no...
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.780]   The fair use rules are funny too because they're not...
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:29.820]   They're a defense.
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:33.060]   So they really don't come into effect unless somebody sues you and you go to court and
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:34.940]   then you say, "Well, you're on or this is fair use."
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:37.260]   And then the judge gets to decide.
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:40.940]   As Larry, all the sudden, fair use is the right to hire a lawyer.
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:41.940]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:47.100]   But most cases, our experience with YouTube has been great and that's all worked.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:48.820]   But last week, we had a little bit of a problem.
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:50.420]   I don't know if I mentioned this last week.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:51.420]   Oh, yeah, you did.
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:52.620]   I was going to ask how that worked out.
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:53.620]   Still down.
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:56.340]   And I have a letter from YouTube.
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:57.820]   It wasn't YouTube that pulled us down.
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:00.900]   It was an attorney hired by Apple.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.900]   What?
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:02.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:03.900]   Oh.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:05.380]   And so we've appealed it.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:07.540]   Now the way it works, it's different with YouTube Live.
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:10.700]   I just described what happens with uploaded video with YouTube Live.
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.820]   You only get one chance.
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:13.820]   We've appealed it.
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:21.060]   Now it goes to that, Google says, or YouTube says to that attorney, the complainant, okay,
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:22.500]   you're going to pursue this or not.
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:27.420]   And they have somewhere between two and three weeks to respond.
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:30.820]   If they sue us, if they send us these and assist, then Google says, "All right, that's
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:32.300]   a strike.
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.620]   You're off YouTube Live for 45 days."
[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:35.620]   Boom.
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:36.620]   Oh.
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:37.620]   Just the slam.
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:38.620]   Just the slam.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.300]   And then this is so open to slam.
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:41.500]   What's their motive not to say?
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.500]   Yeah, we'll sue.
[01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.500]   Good question.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.220]   I mean, I guess I could defend it.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:50.500]   In fact, as far as I'm concerned, I'm going to court.
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.900]   But I hope they heard that.
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:58.860]   But yeah, I mean, talk about a chilling effect.
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:08:59.860]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:03.140]   Plus Apple, you're a Richard.
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:06.220]   Yeah, it seems a little weird.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:10.380]   What we did, just so people who didn't know, I will tell them, we do what we always do.
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.740]   We just did it with the Samsung event.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:18.300]   We will stream their keynote and comment on it at glossing it, annotating it, which I
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:21.140]   consider fair use for news purposes.
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:24.700]   It doesn't diminish the value of their stream because they're not selling it.
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.500]   It might if you say mean things about it.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.500]   Well, they may not.
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:33.740]   So that may be, in my opinion, Apple is taking a page from the Trump playbook, which is,
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:38.500]   you know, if you don't like what people say, go after them.
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:42.740]   This is why I have a Chromebook, not an Apple.
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:44.940]   Well, that's the irony of the company.
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:50.820]   I do probably the number one Apple podcast, the number two Apple podcast, iOS today, and
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:52.220]   at Mac Break Weekly.
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:55.580]   I buy every goddamn thing because Apple, I don't take loners.
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.220]   So I buy everything.
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.500]   I review it.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:04.060]   So Apple made the, at last week, they made $10,000, $15,000 off of me.
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.060]   So there's the irony.
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:07.260]   I don't feel like I cannot do that.
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.260]   I have to review it.
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:09.260]   That's what we do.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:13.740]   This is our business is to tell people what Apple's up to and what we think of Apple's
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:14.740]   products.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:15.740]   That's my job.
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:18.580]   They're just like, Jim Acosta, they're trying to pull the microphone away from you.
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:22.380]   That's what bothers me because it doesn't, it's not a take down of that video.
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:27.020]   We are not on YouTube live now and we won't be on YouTube live until a either Apple doesn't
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:30.420]   do anything about it and then YouTube will lift the strike and we'll be back on next
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:33.220]   week or for a month and a half.
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:38.100]   And at that point, there's a massive chilling effect because another, I mean, after I
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:42.700]   have cameras, two or three strikes right on YouTube live, they close the account and
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:47.380]   all associate accounts, Twitter would be gone.
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:49.020]   So there's a lot of me.
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:52.580]   Now I all of a sudden have to tip toe around Apple.
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:58.500]   If you, if you decided, uncle, I'll pull that video of the live thing tomorrow.
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:10:59.800]   That's not it.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.800]   It doesn't even help.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.100]   No, it's not related to that.
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:04.140]   In fact, that's still up, right?
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.140]   Is that up?
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.140]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.140]   That's up.
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:08.140]   I don't know.
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:09.140]   It's against it.
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:12.100]   It was against the live stream.
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:16.980]   But the live stream that gets, then gets archived the way this the way.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:17.980]   Well, yeah.
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:20.380]   And it's by the way, Twitter, I should check, but I'm pretty sure we have it up on the
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:22.380]   Twitter TV specials.
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:26.780]   The, it's a Twitter TV slash specials.
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:27.780]   I shouldn't.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:28.780]   I'm giving the man.
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:30.180]   You initially, I'm sure this guy's watching.
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:36.060]   I actually was used to be on a board with the chief counsel, another new chief counsel
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:37.060]   with Apple.
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:39.660]   It means it is a third person.
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:41.060]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:42.660]   Oh, it's a third person.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:48.140]   So you can watch this now on download or on our site.
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:50.860]   This was just YouTube live.
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:54.100]   But it has the effect of knocking us off YouTube live.
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.940]   You can't watch Twig right now on YouTube live.
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:12:00.460]   Fortunately, we have other live streams, but you can't watch you Twig on it.
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:02.020]   You can't watch our floss coverage.
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:06.020]   You can't watch anything on YouTube live from Twig.
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:11.700]   It bothers me a little bit, but there's nothing I can do about it.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.500]   This life bothers me.
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.020]   Yeah, it doesn't.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:18.380]   As a journalist, I'm like, oh, it seems so.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.980]   I mean, maybe the argument is, well, is that fair use?
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:23.820]   You showed we did show it in its entirety.
[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:25.980]   So that's one of there's three tests with fair use.
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.300]   One of them is the amount that was used.
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:32.500]   And we do show it in its entirety, but it's a mystery science theory to 3000.
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.500]   We're sitting on the talk.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.380]   Fisking, as we say in blogs.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:37.380]   Fisking.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:42.180]   Named after Robert Fisk, who bloggers didn't like early on.
[01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:48.020]   And you would take the entire column, someone wrote and paragraph by paragraph, respond
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:49.020]   to all the points.
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.820]   So you ended up repeating the entire column, but because you needed it.
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:52.820]   Well, that's what we'll have to do.
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:53.820]   You respond to every point.
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:54.820]   That's what we'll have to do.
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.020]   We'll have to fisk it next time.
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:57.900]   Or I'm going to use puppets.
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:00.500]   Extremely unflattering puppets.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:03.100]   No, just kidding.
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:06.460]   I mean, the funny thing is, you say it's a third party.
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:11.060]   You mean it's an attorney hired by Apple outside of outside council.
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:12.060]   But still Apple.
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:13.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:17.220]   I mean, he's working for Apple.
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:21.140]   But his offices aren't in Cupertino there in San Francisco.
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:26.940]   It's just I'm going to it's not going to affect my coverage of Apple, obviously.
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:28.660]   I still do it.
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:33.140]   And it's not going to bias me against Apple.
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:38.020]   In some ways it biases me against the YouTube process because it's way too easy for somebody
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.380]   to do that.
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:42.340]   Yeah.
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:47.580]   But see, and all along from day one, I never said, well, we're going to and I see people
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:48.740]   who've done that and I feel bad for them.
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:52.860]   Well, we're going to Facebook live as the future of our content or YouTube is the face
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:54.340]   future of our content.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:14:02.700]   We've always been ancillary to our own broadcast and our own streams and our own downloads.
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.420]   Do we talk about white genocide?
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:06.860]   I think we did.
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:09.260]   I missed that.
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:12.100]   I'm okay about missing it, but I did miss that.
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:19.220]   So did you see the intercept was able to buy ads on Facebook?
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:22.980]   Targeted at people who were interested in white genocide.
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:27.020]   Is this the idea of what is people killing white people?
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.020]   Is that what?
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:31.460]   Yeah, the fear that the white people will be killed.
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.700]   The white race is going to be destroyed.
[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:34.700]   Oh, okay.
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:35.700]   Yeah.
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:36.700]   These are those people.
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:37.700]   It's anti-Semitic.
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:38.700]   Yeah.
[01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:39.700]   It's anti-immigrant.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:43.140]   And Facebook said we're not going to do that.
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:47.340]   Earlier this week, the intercept, Sam Biddle writing for the intercept was able to select
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:54.700]   white genocide conspiracy theory as a predefined detailed targeting criterion.
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.540]   Facebook said there are 168,000 users you're going to get.
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.100]   Here's the actual.
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:02.140]   And by the way, your ad is approved.
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:08.380]   Well, let me say two things to this, if I may.
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.780]   One is, yeah.
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:13.900]   He listed it as a boy, a data society.
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.700]   Is it automatic?
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:20.940]   People are making up new phrases like incel all the time.
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:23.980]   And the systems are a step behind.
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:30.740]   So white genocide was a key to an evil kingdom that the bad guys put out there and then they
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:32.220]   populate things online.
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:33.220]   And it's a strategy.
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:39.820]   I'm going to be holding a meeting next month about what Dana calls information voids just
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.140]   around this issue.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:44.580]   But to play gotcha on that is naive.
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:50.100]   Point, I can give you a very good scenario where you want to target those people.
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:57.460]   You are a good actor trying to bring sense and sensibility to people looking at this
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:58.460]   crap.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:05.260]   It's a technique that is used against terrorism.
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:06.580]   The State Department uses it.
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:09.580]   Others use it where they find people who are searching on bad stuff.
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:14.300]   So you can show them things that will try to counter that.
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:19.300]   So to act like, oh my God, Facebook enabled this is sensationalistic and naive.
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:21.220]   Facebook took it down immediately.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:22.540]   Of course, of course.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:28.140]   Now full disclosure here, remember that I raised money for my school from Facebook to
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:30.780]   work on just such problems as this.
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:34.420]   And among others, and I'm independent of Facebook and I received a money personally from Facebook
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:35.420]   already on the top.
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:38.460]   I would say this is of course auto-generated.
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:39.460]   Yeah.
[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:42.780]   As most of these, all these terms would be.
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:46.500]   But doesn't Facebook have a little bit of a responsibility to have some humans come through
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.700]   these looking for now?
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:50.700]   How can you?
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:58.340]   I could probably target an ad tomorrow based on big toe bunions.
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.340]   Right.
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:01.180]   And I'll find all the people who talked about big toe bunions.
[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:02.900]   But it could be a dog whistle.
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:03.900]   We anticipate.
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:04.900]   Right.
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.060]   And you don't know.
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:10.860]   So part of what we need to do, we immediately need to work with the platforms.
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:14.500]   Like the common mission against these bad actors.
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:18.540]   And it is naive to think that Facebook should just be all knowing and know all of these
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:19.540]   things that come out.
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:23.900]   If you listen to data in society, which I do respect them immensely and also clear
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:25.380]   wortle at first draft.
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:26.380]   But honestly.
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:27.380]   But these are experts in this area.
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:29.020]   But honestly, Jeff, I'll just stop popping up.
[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:33.020]   If you're a human editor going through categories and you saw white genocide.
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.020]   Of course.
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:36.820]   You would have said, yeah, let's not self ads against that.
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:39.940]   But Leo, it's not as if you have a finite list of categories.
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:40.940]   I assume this.
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:41.940]   I don't know.
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:42.940]   But I used to be this way with Google.
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:46.380]   I can go and look for anybody who uses a string of words.
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:50.100]   So it's not as if there's a catalog and you take the book off the, oh, here's all of our
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:51.580]   categories under W.
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:52.820]   It says white genocide.
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:53.820]   That's a point.
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:18:00.820]   No, it's that you're searching the entirety of public discussion to find a phrase and try
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:02.740]   to target ads against that phrase.
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:07.660]   So it's it's it's it's after the fact generated.
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:08.660]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:16.260]   And it was out Franken saying to was a Facebook or Google, rubles, you should have seen rubles.
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:18.900]   When in fact, there were legitimate ads coming in for rubles.
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:22.900]   They didn't know what was happening once they knew, not at all hard to say.
[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:24.340]   Oh, let's look at those ruble ads.
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:26.980]   Once you know what genocide is there, you get rid of it.
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:28.420]   Facebook's response was to take it down.
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:29.420]   Oh, okay.
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:30.820]   Yeah, you shouldn't be able to buy that category.
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:32.300]   Oh, of course not.
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:35.580]   But there's going to be more because there's always more because you can't and because the
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:40.780]   bad guys are using this, not just for ad buying, but for dissemination.
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:46.100]   And so so how does China solve this problem because they have this problem and their sensors
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.060]   still pretty tight.
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:54.700]   They have they have thousands upon thousands upon thousands of humans and they have catalogs
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:58.780]   trying to go around and try to find out what what people are saying and you don't have
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:18:59.780]   any freedom of speech.
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:04.100]   I and they also have a mechanism to punish every citizen and a little bit.
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:06.820]   Stuff like this gets through the differences.
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:08.740]   You don't have a free press trying it.
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:09.740]   Finding it.
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:10.740]   Right.
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:11.740]   I still bet.
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:13.740]   I mean, stuff gets through all the time.
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:14.740]   It's inevitable.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:15.740]   You can't get this.
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:16.740]   There's too much activity.
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:17.740]   There's too many possibilities.
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:20.020]   Then use coding, coded language.
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:21.020]   Yeah.
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:25.220]   I am gratified though to see that as a survey of more than 3,400 US Facebook users found
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:31.020]   that 44% of users 18 to 29 have deleted the app from their, if they didn't kill their
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:36.620]   accounts, just deleted the app from their phone in the last year.
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:37.620]   That's not a bad.
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:42.700]   I mean, I would I feel like there's definitely a movement to manage notifications, handle
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:44.060]   crap on your phone.
[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:46.140]   That was my it's the it's the gateway drug.
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.900]   That was the first thing I did is I removed Facebook and Twitter and Instagram for my
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:49.900]   phones.
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:52.860]   Then I went for my life.
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:56.900]   But it's interesting if would you be worried if you were Facebook?
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:59.580]   Is this number scary?
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.580]   Some people are your future.
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:04.340]   I guess not people like me.
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:07.300]   They don't care if a 61 year old man deletes his Facebook account.
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:09.180]   Yeah, but the young people are on Instagram.
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:11.060]   They're not deleting Instagram.
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:13.260]   That's a good point.
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:15.940]   That's a very good point.
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:19.500]   This is from the the usual Pew survey of the end.
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:23.420]   I will say that I encounter and it frustrates the heck out of me.
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:27.700]   I encounter lots of places, even like hotel chains, where if I want to text someone in
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:30.380]   the hotel chain, I have to use Facebook messenger.
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:33.220]   And I'm like, Hey, that's not business.
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.140]   That's not business.
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:38.860]   Facebook has informed me, however, that even though I've deactivated my Facebook account,
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:40.860]   I could continue to use messenger.
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:45.860]   Well, yeah, Facebook lets me know like every week about I could get back on Instagram or
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:46.860]   get back on this.
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:51.700]   By the way, when I deactivate my account, both of you guys were sad.
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:54.140]   It said you guys were going to miss me.
[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:57.100]   Oh, I haven't been on my Facebook account forever.
[01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:58.100]   Okay, it didn't.
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:20:59.580]   I mean, I really do miss my account.
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:03.900]   It did pick a random nine people and say these people are going to miss you.
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:07.420]   I don't actually Facebook knows they're right.
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:09.780]   Every time I deactivate, I get a new set of people.
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:10.780]   That's good.
[01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:12.500]   I like it.
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:13.500]   I don't miss you Leo.
[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:14.500]   I see you.
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:18.540]   You'll never miss me unless you're on, you know, your, your many cruises.
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:22.700]   And then I'm like, Oh, I am very excited because you no longer can miss me because I will soon
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:27.700]   be getting my Facebook portal at the Facebook pop up store.
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:31.580]   Oh, Leo, but don't even give them publicity on this.
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:36.460]   Just don't just just pretend it doesn't happen.
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:37.700]   It doesn't exist.
[01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:38.700]   There is no portal.
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:39.700]   There's no problem with it.
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:42.820]   Are you kidding me with it?
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:43.820]   Yeah.
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:44.820]   Facebook portal.
[01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:45.820]   Okay.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:47.300]   I don't pop up store the pop up store.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:49.220]   Well, what are they selling at the pop up store?
[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:51.380]   No, they're they're premium brands there.
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:52.380]   They're premium cool brands.
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:53.380]   They're the dual on Instagram.
[01:21:53.380 --> 01:22:00.340]   Oh, it's kind of like here's a here's a here if the most reflex, the most is loved brands
[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:02.580]   on Instagram, it'll go.
[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:03.580]   Let's kick Facebook.
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:06.580]   Some of the brands have a product called the portal.
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:09.580]   If the pop up store, they will be selling the portal.
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:12.300]   They will be selling the portal, but that was on stuff.
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:16.020]   Yeah, they'll also be selling stuff from love your melon and two blind brothers.
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:22.340]   So they're, Macy's actually had a phenomenal portal of neat gadgets.
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:26.020]   I happened to go through their only because it was raining like crazy a few weeks ago.
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:30.260]   And there was this great selection in New York Macy's world's largest department store
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:33.940]   of really neat stuff will display.
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:37.060]   And I don't think it was a Macy's brand such, but I think they're trying to do the, you
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:39.420]   know, so this is the same idea.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:40.420]   Yeah.
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:43.220]   Mark space kind of like boutique inside of the.
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:44.220]   Wait, hold on.
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:45.980]   This gets into my thing from the this week.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:48.900]   So I also get into my number for the week.
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:49.900]   Zip it.
[01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:55.340]   Amazon's giving everyone free shopping on every free shipping and the shopping will be free
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:58.740]   free shipping on everything for the holidays.
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:01.020]   Thank you, Amazon.
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:07.020]   Just one more reason to pee in a jar if you're an Amazon employee.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:11.460]   We finally, you know, cause you're working hard delivering all those free things.
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:14.220]   Oh, I thought it was about drug testing.
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.860]   No, no, they have to pee in a jar cause they can't take breaks.
[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:20.740]   I used the only thing with the tridactants story.
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:24.020]   Use the world word wilds as opposed to wilds.
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:27.940]   Wilds is only in Britain or is it or Australia or is it true here?
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:28.940]   What a great word.
[01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:32.180]   I'm going to use wilds from now on and I've never heard of myself.
[01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:34.060]   It's always going to be one.
[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:35.780]   Is that true in the US or not?
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:38.020]   One does not know.
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:40.260]   Or my favorite is the New Yorker.
[01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:41.860]   This author.
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:43.860]   This author.
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:47.820]   Wait.
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:50.180]   Do we care where Amazon's heavy HQ is going to be?
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:51.940]   They'd look like they're going to do two.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:52.940]   What a new.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:53.940]   Do you think this was?
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:55.180]   That's what I want to know for me all.
[01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:56.180]   How many what?
[01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:57.940]   How nefarious do you think this was?
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:00.220]   Do you think this was a big data grab?
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:01.220]   Nefarious.
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:05.500]   You mean going to those cities and saying getting all this data and being like, Hey,
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:06.500]   we might.
[01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:09.220]   And now they can use it to open their warehouses or do other things.
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:10.220]   We might.
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:12.220]   They were shopping the best.
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:13.220]   No, they were shopping the best.
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:14.740]   They were shopping the best tax break.
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:15.740]   That's all.
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:16.740]   Yeah, they were.
[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:18.740]   I really wanted to do Newark because Newark needs them.
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:19.740]   Newark has audible.
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.740]   No, it's going to be Loyland City.
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:22.740]   Oh, Long Island City.
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:23.740]   That's right.
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.740]   Newark.
[01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:28.380]   What is tell us about long Island City, Jeff?
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:33.780]   Long Island City is right across the river and it was it was it was never hip because Queens
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:36.620]   was never hip, but then Brooklyn got too f inexpensive.
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:43.140]   So now Queens is hipper and Loyland City is the first entry point of hip into Queens.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.140]   Oh, interesting.
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:49.780]   Oh my God, I had a friend when I lived out there in 2000 and she lived in L.I.C. and
[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:52.540]   holy cow, you just never saw her.
[01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:55.180]   No, because it's so far away.
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:57.100]   No, it's not actually.
[01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:58.100]   It's right.
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:59.660]   It's closer than a lot of hell of water, Brooklyn.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:00.660]   It's right across the river.
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:01.660]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:02.660]   You get views from Manhattan.
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:03.660]   It's on the East River.
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:04.660]   So yeah, you get the view.
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:05.660]   There's nothing there.
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:09.220]   There's just nothing there except whether there's some good like random cheap international
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:10.220]   foods.
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:11.540]   Here's the here ladies gentlemen.
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:14.100]   I give you long Island City.
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.940]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:18.020]   Oh, I see that I've seen this across the river.
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:19.020]   Yeah.
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:20.020]   It's those buildings.
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:21.020]   Yeah.
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:22.020]   Yeah.
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:23.940]   It's like Emeryville.
[01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:27.340]   That's right, which is that's exactly where you go.
[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:33.980]   If you want real estate for my HQ said I would have to go over a bridge and that would scare
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:34.980]   me.
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:35.980]   So I wouldn't go to Emeryville.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:36.980]   Let's do a quick change log.
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:37.980]   What do you say?
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:40.740]   Oh, I like that reaction.
[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:41.740]   I'm not.
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:42.740]   There it is.
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:48.500]   The whole change log.
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.540]   This is a file they're playing obviously, right?
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:52.060]   Because we're digital.
[01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:57.300]   And the name used to be like S13599 or something, right?
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:59.820]   Something, but Carson knew that name.
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:03.340]   And then when Carson went on vacation, the new guy couldn't find it.
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:04.340]   Remember?
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:06.900]   So he renamed it to Google change log.
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:10.020]   Now, Carson can't find it.
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.020]   Why would you call it that?
[01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:15.340]   By the way, can we run it again?
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:18.380]   Because I want to see how many of those logos are now uploaded.
[01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:21.140]   Oh, it's all out of date.
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:22.540]   The Google change.
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:23.540]   Out of date.
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:24.540]   Out of date.
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:25.540]   Out of date.
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:26.540]   Google plus.
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:27.540]   Out of date.
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:28.540]   I think there was inbox in there.
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:29.900]   I don't know too fast.
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:30.900]   Yeah.
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:31.900]   That's fun.
[01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:36.660]   Eight noteworthy features coming to Chromebooks this very month.
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:37.660]   Hey, hello Kevin.
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.660]   Hello Kevin.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.380]   What do you want to read about these things with Kevin?
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.380]   J.R.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:43.580]   Raphael writing in the computer world.
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:45.700]   These hidden gems.
[01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:48.580]   Number one new multitasking gestures.
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:50.060]   Swiped.
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:52.180]   This is a I can't wait to try this.
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:57.420]   When you're using a convertible Chromebook in tablet mode or using maybe the slate.
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:00.180]   Swiped down from the top of the screen.
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:04.580]   That will let you drag an active app or browser window into a new multitasking interface where
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:07.060]   you can see alongside of other open items.
[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:10.460]   Ooh, that's kind of windowsy.
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:11.460]   You can let go.
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:15.300]   Walk your mouth out and drop the app into the open slot on the multitasking grid or drag
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:20.940]   it to either edge of the screen and snap it to that side and start a split screen view.
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:24.540]   So try dragging down from the edge and then just see what happens there.
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:26.060]   It's kind of complicated.
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:27.740]   There's quite a bit more.
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:30.860]   And Android esque floating keyboard.
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:33.780]   This is as of Chrome OS 70.
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:37.140]   You can tap the second icon within the top row.
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:38.140]   You see that funny.
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:39.140]   I don't know if you can see it.
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:40.940]   There's a funny little icon.
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:46.180]   Tap that and the keyboard goes and it'll shrink down into a little floating keyboard that you
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:51.180]   can move around by moving it around.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:54.020]   That's kind of cool.
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:56.180]   And you can even tap the little squiggly line.
[01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:57.780]   Let me show you that.
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:59.940]   See that little squiggly line right there?
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:06.060]   Tap that and now you can use your pen to write howdy.
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:07.660]   And no, they're just wait.
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:08.660]   There's more.
[01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:11.900]   Tap the microphone and you can start to tape.
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.300]   So that's pretty nice.
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:14.660]   That's pretty sweet.
[01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:19.380]   By the way, that's partly because system-wide dictation has been added.
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:20.540]   But you do have to turn.
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:22.300]   It's inaccessibility as usual.
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:23.420]   They hide it.
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:26.060]   But you can turn it on.
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:28.620]   Go to the settings type accessibility.
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:36.180]   Change accessibility features, keyboard and input enable dictation speak to type.
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:39.660]   And then you'll see a microphone icon in the bar.
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:42.300]   It's kind of down in the notification bar.
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:43.300]   See there?
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:47.700]   And you can tap that at any time and start dictating.
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:49.060]   They're going to be app shortcuts.
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:51.660]   This is also from Android.
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:55.860]   Long press or right click or two finger click any icon in your Chromebook shelf and see
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:57.420]   a list of available shortcuts.
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:29:00.300]   That's nice.
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:02.900]   I use this feature a lot in Android.
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:07.340]   And Apple has a similar feature with a force touch.
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:08.340]   Force touch sounds bad.
[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:09.380]   It's not a force touch.
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:10.380]   What is it?
[01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:11.380]   Long touch?
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:12.380]   No, it's not long.
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:14.380]   It's a 3D press or...
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:15.380]   3D touch?
[01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:16.380]   3D touch.
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:18.380]   I can see Apple has all these.
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:20.380]   It's a meaningful touch.
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:21.380]   It's beautiful.
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:22.820]   There was actually a force touch for a while.
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:23.900]   I think it was force touch.
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:24.900]   It's a force touch.
[01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:26.460]   Yeah, I think it is.
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:31.940]   The Files app now has the ability to let you browser manage your storage connected to both
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:33.380]   play files.
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:36.900]   That's anything associated with the Android app you've got installed in Linux files if
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:39.780]   you've got Krustini turned on.
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:43.820]   So I don't know if you've played with the Files app, but it sees everything.
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:45.100]   You can add Dropbox to it.
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:50.980]   It's really a nice little way to access cloud data as well as chemical.
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:51.980]   That's how I use it all the time.
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:52.980]   It's cloud data.
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:53.980]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:54.980]   All I have.
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:56.420]   You don't want to store it on the computer.
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:58.860]   You want to keep it in the cloud.
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:03.180]   An updated app drawer with smart suggestions.
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:04.180]   Have you seen that yet?
[01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:06.420]   I don't know if you've seen that.
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.580]   And a quick desktop mode for detachable devices.
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:14.340]   If you get like the slate, you'll get a more traditional desktop Chrome OS when you connect
[01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:17.060]   the physical keyboard, you'll go into tablet mode.
[01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:19.540]   These are all very windows-y kind of annotations.
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:21.100]   Watch it, fella.
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:22.100]   Watch it.
[01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:23.420]   New wallpaper picker.
[01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:27.140]   The wallpapers, initially on a Chromebook, you picked one and only one.
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:28.700]   Then they got kind of rotating wallpaper.
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:31.740]   Now they're doing the Android style daily refresh.
[01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:33.460]   And they have a lot more styles too.
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:34.460]   Nice.
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:37.260]   Thank you, JR.
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:44.940]   JR Raphael with some of the new features coming to Chromebooks with Chrome OS 7.0.
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:47.220]   We did already mention photable devices.
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:52.020]   That would have been in the change log, but I moved it up because I think it's interesting.
[01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:53.020]   News worthy.
[01:30:53.020 --> 01:31:07.100]   Now, step into the sights of sound with Pixel 3 powered by YouTube music.
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:09.740]   I have no idea what this is, but it's...
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:11.700]   What's in the future?
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:12.700]   It's the future.
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.500]   It's core positive.
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:15.900]   Kind of crazy.
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:16.900]   I don't know.
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:17.900]   I'm hypnotized.
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:21.420]   To show you some of the new features on the Pixel 3 phone, we created sites of sound powered
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:27.780]   by YouTube music and immersive pop-up experience coming to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin,
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:30.500]   Miami and Hotland of this fall.
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:33.940]   Step inside rooms inspired by four musicians.
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:38.300]   Use your Pixel 3 to navigate, capture and share the experience.
[01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:41.500]   And there will be a puzzle that you'll have to solve using your Google lens.
[01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:42.500]   Oh my God.
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:44.300]   What if this is the future of entertainment?
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:48.220]   So we're moving beyond the empty pop-up museums like the Museum of Icecoaster.
[01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:49.220]   That's what this is.
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:50.220]   This is a pop-up museum.
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:52.100]   Yeah, but it's a Google one.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:54.100]   But it also has a puzzle.
[01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:57.900]   It's like, Mist meets the Instagram generation.
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:02.180]   I expect your Instagram feed to be loaded with these, Stacy.
[01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:03.620]   I don't have a Pixel 3.
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:04.620]   What?
[01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:06.120]   You don't have a Pixel 2?
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.120]   I have a Pixel 2.
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:08.120]   Yeah, no, they said Pixel 3.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.120]   It's a half to be a Pixel 3.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:11.120]   I thought it was a Pixel 3.
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:12.120]   You can use your lens.
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:13.120]   Yeah, it has to be a Pixel 3.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:16.420]   Yeah, I don't have a Pixel 3 either.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.420]   I'm gonna...
[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:18.860]   First time I haven't had Full Run B.
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:19.860]   I...
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:23.340]   Yeah, you don't miss this.
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:24.340]   You don't miss this.
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:25.340]   I'm okay with that.
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:28.740]   You know, I tried the Google emoji thingies and they suck.
[01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:31.500]   Oh, the AR stuff where your Iron Man drops in?
[01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:34.500]   No, where you like decorate your old little thing with the cheaper.
[01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.300]   Yeah, that was terrible.
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.300]   Yeah.
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:38.300]   That was not work getting...
[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:40.500]   It did not have any blue stripes.
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:43.740]   You know what you're gonna like then?
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:46.540]   The Sephora tutorials on your Google Home Hub.
[01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:48.740]   Oh, I love Sephora.
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:52.620]   And I love Sephora tutorials even though I cannot do anything with them.
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:54.340]   Want to ace your arch?
[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:55.540]   Here's what you do.
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:57.340]   Just try this.
[01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:01.100]   Play Get Ready With Me, Eyebrow Tutorial by Sephora.
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:04.540]   Okay, here we go.
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:06.340]   Play Get Ready For Me by...
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:07.340]   What?
[01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:08.340]   Eyebrow Sephora?
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:09.340]   Hey, go, go!
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:10.340]   Go, go!
[01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:11.340]   How about this one?
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:12.340]   Listen carefully, Stacy.
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:13.340]   Okay.
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:14.340]   Play every day.
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:21.140]   What about this one?
[01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:24.340]   From Sephora.
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:25.340]   Play every day.
[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:28.340]   Contour tutorial from Sephora.
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:31.340]   All right, here's every day.
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:33.340]   Contour tutorial on YouTube.
[01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:34.340]   Here it goes.
[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:35.340]   Yeah.
[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:37.340]   There's also a Smokey Eyes video.
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:38.340]   Oh.
[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:39.340]   Foundation tips.
[01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:40.340]   There are Sanders.
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:42.340]   And bold lip colors.
[01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:47.340]   Got him.
[01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:48.980]   Okay.
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:56.220]   And if you happen to live near one of the 10 flagship Sephora stores, which you do not,
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:34:00.060]   you can stop in to check out the Dream Vanity Experience.
[01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:04.260]   Use the in-store Google Home Hub to nail your favorite night on the town look.
[01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:08.700]   Get the perfect Smokey Eye and see many other things that the hub can do.
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:13.700]   You will just watch the press conference.
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:15.900]   They did pull the YouTube, I mean this is YouTube content.
[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:17.860]   This isn't a Sephora.
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:18.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:20.420]   What's, it's kind of interesting.
[01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:28.180]   It's just a branding deal right with Sephora, but it shows that Google, I mean this is, they're
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:31.660]   going after women, right?
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:33.660]   Or, or, or RuPaul.
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:34.660]   I don't know.
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:35.660]   I could have made a terrible joke.
[01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:38.660]   I know where you were going.
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:42.220]   Hey, I like, I like Adjut Pai.
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:45.980]   He says, it's time we stopped Robocallers.
[01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:49.620]   This is the best thing that the chairman of the FCC has done.
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:53.180]   He says, you guys by next year have got to figure this out.
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:54.860]   Robocalls are out of control.
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:35:02.180]   He wants companies to adopt a call authentication system to identify these.
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:05.740]   He wants answers by November 19th and the status of these efforts.
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:11.820]   He called out Sprint in particular among others saying you let too many through.
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:16.460]   So I have to say I'm behind this one.
[01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:20.700]   Canada has already set a 2019 deadline to kill Robocalls.
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:23.060]   And now the US says the same thing.
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:25.500]   He wrote to the major telephone service.
[01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.220]   Can they even get rid of them?
[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:30.620]   Because, because the Robocalls are fooling.
[01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:31.620]   No, no, no.
[01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:33.580]   Well, not, they're also fooling the system.
[01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:34.580]   Yeah.
[01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:40.060]   They do some sort of caller ID on them.
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:44.460]   Authentication so that you can answer your phone with confidence, Jeff.
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:48.100]   By this time next year says Adjut Pai expect consumers will begin to see this on their
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:49.100]   phones.
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:52.140]   So it's going to take a little while.
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:53.660]   Oh, I apologize.
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:55.780]   I forgot that I set off everyone's thing.
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:56.780]   Oh, that's okay.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:59.420]   Everybody's getting smokey eye tips right now.
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:00.860]   I need smokey eye tips.
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:02.380]   That is what I'm going to look up.
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:03.380]   Although I don't know how to conquer.
[01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:05.780]   I keep ignoring my Sarah Huckabee Sanders jokes.
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:07.340]   But that's okay.
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:08.340]   You're what?
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:09.340]   Smokey eyes.
[01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:11.340]   Sarah Huckabee Sanders jokes.
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:12.340]   Well, he eyes.
[01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:15.340]   Oh, and one terabyte of free storage and limit free users.
[01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:17.060]   Oh, smug mug bought Flickr.
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:18.060]   I love smug mug.
[01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:22.820]   We did an interview with the Christmas Cascale who's the CEO and founder of smug mug about
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:23.820]   his intent.
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:29.620]   That's on our triangulation show a couple of weeks ago because we knew that, you know,
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:33.140]   Yahoo was not the best steward of Flickr, which is a great photo sharing site.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:35.660]   Smug mug should be and will be.
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:38.820]   One of the first things they announced though is that they're going to end the free terabyte
[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:42.460]   of storage and limit free users to 1000 photos.
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:47.660]   Smug mug is a paid service and it sounds like they want people to sign up for Flickr
[01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:53.700]   Pro if they're going to use it for more than 1000 photos, but they will add some other features
[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:55.860]   as well.
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:37:01.300]   If you have photos on Flickr after January 8th, they will start deleting them.
[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:03.820]   Actually, February 5th, they'll start deleting them.
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:07.140]   Will they send you an email and offer to have you pay for them?
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:09.340]   Yeah, presumably they are going to do that.
[01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:10.340]   Oh, okay.
[01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:11.340]   It was like, geez.
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:12.340]   No, this is it.
[01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:13.340]   This is your email.
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:14.340]   This is your email.
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:15.340]   This is your email.
[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:16.340]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:17.900]   It might go to your yahoo account.
[01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:22.140]   Paid customers, $50 a year for Flickr Pro, which I've always paid for and I will continue
[01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:27.540]   to pay for, will be given unlimited storage for photos and videos at full resolution.
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:32.460]   No ads, additional data on how their photos are performing because there's a whole social
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:34.140]   aspect to it.
[01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:37.020]   Premier customer service, you can do videos up to 10 minutes long.
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:43.020]   That used to be three and discounts from Adobe, Smug mug, Peak Design and more.
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:47.860]   And if you sign up for Flickr Pro through November 30th, 30% off.
[01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:55.780]   I know, yeah, no more free, but free is not tenable in the long run and I'm glad to see
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:59.100]   Flickr, Flickr under new management.
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:00.260]   These guys are really good.
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:02.060]   So I already paid for Flickr Pro.
[01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:03.060]   I'll continue to do that.
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:04.100]   I also pay for Smug mug.
[01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:05.900]   I love Smug mug.
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:09.900]   So the cloud ain't free, kids.
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:12.900]   And finally, oh, do we finish the change log?
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:13.900]   I forgot.
[01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:14.900]   Yes.
[01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:16.380]   Blow the trumpet.
[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:18.580]   Pound the pound the trumpet.
[01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:20.780]   Blow the drum.
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:22.380]   The change log.
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:23.380]   Time has come.
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:26.540]   Oh, I thought you were going to say that change log is now done.
[01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:27.540]   It's now done.
[01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:28.540]   Thank you.
[01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:29.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:30.540]   You are a good editor.
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:33.900]   I do what I can to make sound your best, Leo.
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:34.900]   Sam, I am.
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:36.140]   What is spaceship media?
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:37.140]   Did you put this in here?
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:39.860]   No, we don't already talked about them.
[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:40.860]   We talked about them already.
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:41.860]   Was I here?
[01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:42.860]   Yes, you were.
[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:44.860]   You put them.
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:48.020]   Shh, don't tell a kolio.
[01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:49.020]   He's getting the little love.
[01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:51.020]   Why don't you say kids?
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:52.020]   We see.
[01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:53.020]   A little punchy here.
[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:54.020]   We see.
[01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:55.020]   We're going to talk about this.
[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:56.020]   We're going to talk about it.
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:57.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:38:57.020 --> 01:38:58.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:38:59.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:00.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:01.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:02.020]   I'm going to talk about it.

[01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:39.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:40.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:42.020]   I'm going to talk about it.

[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:45.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:46.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:47.020]   I'm going to talk about it.

[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:50.020]   I'm going to talk about it.

[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:53.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:54.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:42:54.020 --> 01:42:55.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:56.020]   I'm going to talk about it.

[01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:58.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:42:59.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:00.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:01.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:02.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:03.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:04.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:05.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:06.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:07.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:08.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:09.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:10.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:11.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:12.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:13.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:15.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:16.020]   I'm going to talk about it.

[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:20.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:21.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:22.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:23.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:24.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:25.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:26.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:27.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:28.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:29.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:30.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:31.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:32.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:33.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:34.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:35.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:36.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:37.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:38.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:39.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:40.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:41.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:42.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:43.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:44.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:45.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:46.020]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:51.020]   It's such a great -- if you script the server, you just delete the droplets start over.
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:52.900]   It is just fantastic.
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:55.020]   I've got Node.js running here.
[01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:56.660]   I've always got Emacs.
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:44:01.380]   I'm running a ghost server, some Django because I want to play with some Python frameworks.
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:02.700]   I told Kevin about this.
[01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:03.700]   This is awesome.
[01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:08.980]   If you're on a Chromebook, you just SSH into your server and you could do all of this stuff.
[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:11.700]   They've got load balancing and a whole lot more.
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:17.540]   Go.co/twit to get started with $100 credit.
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:21.420]   Digital Ocean, designed for developers built for business.
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:26.140]   Actually, in my eye, in my eye is the best little toy a guy could ever want.
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:27.620]   I love it.
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:29.620]   Digital Ocean.
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:31.940]   Stacy, your pick of the week.
[01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:32.940]   Just changed it.
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:36.660]   I was going to do Oprah's favorite things because that just came out today, but I didn't care
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:38.660]   for it.
[01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:44.060]   You know, Oprah apparently is President Trump's favorite thing.
[01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:46.700]   Did you hear him talking about her?
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:47.700]   No.
[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:52.220]   She says, "I've -- she's been to Mar-a-Lago.
[01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:53.220]   We used to be good friends.
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:56.620]   I don't know what happened," he said.
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:45:00.460]   Yeah, so she put out her favorite things if you're into that.
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:02.460]   Her tech stuff is not very exciting.
[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:05.940]   How does -- do you think they really are her favorite things or she just -- that's just
[01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:08.060]   advertising, honestly?
[01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:13.340]   She -- so she did a deal clearly with Amazon because everything is available on Amazon,
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:17.100]   even the Apple stuff, which isn't actually -- so she definitely has an affiliate deal
[01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:18.300]   going with this.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:19.300]   Okay.
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:23.420]   Anyway, we're going to skip to that because I found something way cooler.
[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:25.420]   Oh, this is cool.
[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:31.340]   So you are going to have to give your email to download the actual presentation, but I
[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:33.220]   used to be a broadband reporter.
[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:35.700]   So I used to have cable maps on my wall from tele-geography.
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:37.060]   I love this company.
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:41.860]   They map internet cables, like subterranean, subterranean -- well, that too -- submarine
[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:44.220]   cables.
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:51.740]   And this actually talks about dead cables or cables that are not in use anymore that have
[01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:54.060]   extended past their economic life.
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:59.540]   It's kind of cheesy and it was done in the spirit of Halloween, but it gives you examples
[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:05.300]   of what happens when the undersea cables that provide internet and connect the world become
[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:07.020]   economically useless.
[01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:13.820]   Here is a 4,250-mock-kilometer cable linking American Samoa to Hawaii.
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:15.540]   Nobody uses it.
[01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:17.100]   It's just sitting there.
[01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:18.100]   Yeah.
[01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:21.660]   So sometimes they pull them up because some governments require you to pull them up.
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:24.460]   Sometimes they leave them there, the bottom of the ocean floor.
[01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:28.100]   But I just thought that was interesting because a lot of people, it's kind of the invisible
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:30.100]   infrastructure of the internet.
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:34.780]   If you go and download the full presentation that it links to, it's kind of a funny little
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:35.780]   presentation.
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:41.180]   It talks about kind of why this happens and when it may not happen.
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:42.180]   So yeah.
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:45.980]   When cables age out.
[01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:46.980]   I know.
[01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:49.660]   It's really super nerdy, but I like to get about this stuff.
[01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:52.140]   Do you have these underwhelmed the original undersea?
[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:53.140]   I used to.
[01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:54.140]   Yeah, you can buy these.
[01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:55.140]   They're beautiful maps.
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:56.140]   I can't remember.
[01:46:56.140 --> 01:47:02.060]   They have in 2014, or maybe it was 2013, they had a beautiful old world, hereby Dragon's
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:03.060]   Style 1.
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:04.060]   Yes.
[01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:05.060]   And I bought that one.
[01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:06.060]   I love that.
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:10.900]   And I used to have a spectrum chart on my wall, the FCC spectrum chart.
[01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:11.900]   Wow.
[01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:12.900]   That is nerdy.
[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:13.900]   That's geeky.
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:15.740]   That's very good.
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:18.100]   It was really useful in my job.
[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:19.100]   Nice.
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:20.100]   Still geeky.
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:21.100]   Nice.
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:22.100]   I know.
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:23.100]   That's why we like you.
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:24.100]   That's why we love states.
[01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:26.260]   So read that if you're interested in that.
[01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:28.100]   I think it's, I don't know.
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:29.620]   I like making that stuff visible.
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:31.100]   I agree.
[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:34.020]   And Oprah's list will be here next year.
[01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:35.540]   You put the Echo Spot on that, you guys.
[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:36.540]   Okay.
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:37.540]   It's just lean.
[01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:38.540]   I like the Echo Spot.
[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:39.540]   It's in my closet.
[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:40.540]   I know you do.
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:41.540]   I know you do.
[01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:42.540]   It's not my bedroom though.
[01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:43.540]   What?
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:44.540]   No.
[01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:45.540]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:46.860]   Well, this is piss off Stacy.
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:49.140]   So it's not Oprah's list.
[01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:50.140]   It's not Oprah's list.
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:51.140]   It's not Oprah's list.
[01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:52.140]   It's not Oprah's list.
[01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:53.140]   It's kind of.
[01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:54.620]   It's kind of so for the sake of the show, I decided to take my lunch hour today and I
[01:47:54.620 --> 01:47:58.180]   went downtown and I went to the Google pop up store and the Amazon four star store.
[01:47:58.180 --> 01:47:59.180]   Oh.
[01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:00.180]   Just to see what they were like.
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:03.140]   The Google pop up store is all try to be too cool and all that.
[01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:06.180]   That's where I saw the slate and saw that.
[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:07.180]   Nice.
[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:10.180]   I don't think so.
[01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:13.300]   And by the way, the trackpad wasn't working.
[01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:15.300]   It's about the, oh man, you got to use the screen all the time.
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:16.860]   But somebody else just had the same problem.
[01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:19.940]   And the guy in the store said, yeah, the problem is it's got Chrome 71 on it.
[01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:20.940]   It's buggy.
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:21.940]   Oops.
[01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:26.820]   But so they had everything there is what is little cute stuff.
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:27.820]   Not very exciting.
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:28.820]   There's not much to do.
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:31.980]   I think they're making a mistake not selling some Google swag or Google this or Google
[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:34.780]   that, you know, something you can say, I would think of all store.
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:35.780]   But that's fine.
[01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:39.980]   So then I went to the Amazon four star and these things have been around.
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:41.860]   I haven't seen them.
[01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:45.700]   This is everything rated four stars and above everything.
[01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:46.700]   Not everything.
[01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:48.500]   Everything in it has been rated.
[01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:49.780]   We have an Amazon.
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:53.300]   So it's not the Amazon store.
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:55.100]   It's not the book store.
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:59.100]   This is a different store and it is cluttered as can be.
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:02.100]   It's kind of Walmart-y.
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:06.460]   Obviously has all the fire sticks you could ever want in life and all that.
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:13.020]   But it has pet toys and kitchen gadgets, little kitchen gadgets, big and notebooks
[01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:19.180]   and books and like just two small racks of books and toys and all kinds of stuff.
[01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:21.620]   It was kind of overwhelming in a way.
[01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:22.620]   But there's no deals.
[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:23.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:24.620]   These pictures look nutty.
[01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:25.620]   Yeah, they are.
[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:26.620]   I took a picture.
[01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:28.620]   I should have sent it to Karsten.
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:31.140]   But it's pretty amazing.
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:36.140]   So they've popped up in a few cities and you can go into the four stars store and actually
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:43.500]   as kind of claustrophobic as I found it, it is a decent browsing opportunity for gifts
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:44.500]   and things.
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:46.500]   There were things like, I didn't know that existed.
[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:49.980]   Of course, you're going to both have five of these, I'm sure.
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:54.380]   The high-speed super duper air fryers.
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:55.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:57.980]   Megan just got one of those.
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:00.300]   Our June ovens have air frying.
[01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:01.300]   Exactly.
[01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:02.300]   We have convection ovens.
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:03.300]   We don't need that.
[01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:06.300]   Have you ever used it that way, Stacey?
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:07.300]   Yes, I have.
[01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:08.300]   I've made chicken tenders.
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:09.300]   They were delicious.
[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:10.300]   Really?
[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:12.300]   I have to try it.
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:13.740]   And no fat, right?
[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:14.740]   Yeah.
[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:19.100]   There's always fat in anything I make because fat mixing tastes good.
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:22.780]   You never tasted a worst chicken tender without fat.
[01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:24.340]   There's nothing worse.
[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:29.340]   It's like shoe.
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:30.700]   In the park right nearby office, they have ice skating in the winter and they have food
[01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:33.540]   stalls and Christmas stalls and all that kind of stuff.
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:35.340]   So I went and they had empanadas.
[01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:36.340]   They're smaller.
[01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:39.260]   So I had one chicken up going on, which was fine.
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:42.300]   Then I had a cheese empanada.
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:46.860]   And there's this feeling of wondrous joy that comes over you with good cheese.
[01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:48.700]   Oh, I agree.
[01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:52.380]   The other thing they have there that I haven't gone to yet because it's not cold up yet
[01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:54.780]   is the baked cheese house.
[01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:56.940]   Oh my God.
[01:50:56.940 --> 01:50:57.940]   I clap.
[01:50:57.940 --> 01:50:58.940]   I clap.
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:50:59.940]   I clap.
[01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:00.940]   I clap.
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:01.940]   I love it.
[01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:02.940]   Watch the thing bubble.
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:03.940]   Yeah.
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:08.580]   And then they take this wonderful baguette and they scrape the melted cheese onto the
[01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:09.580]   baguette.
[01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:11.940]   I saw that little bigger joke.
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:12.940]   Yeah.
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:18.940]   Little mustard, few corny show, no better sandwich in the world.
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:26.380]   This just gives you a sense of well-being.
[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:30.340]   Turns out there's reason behind our craving cheese contains casein.
[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:38.900]   It also contains casein fragments called get this queso morphins, a casein derived morphine
[01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:41.380]   like compound.
[01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:45.460]   Basically dairy protein has opiate molecules built in when consumed.
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:50.020]   These fragments attached to the brain receptors that the same ones that heroin and other narcotics
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:53.940]   attached to your stone, Jeff, on cheese.
[01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:54.940]   Oh my God.
[01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:58.500]   I will, I will stone up on queso with you, man.
[01:51:58.500 --> 01:51:59.500]   Yeah.
[01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:00.500]   That's fine.
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:01.500]   A lot.
[01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.500]   Oh, I should have told people about this.
[01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:06.260]   I'm going to tell you really quick because it's almost the holidays.
[01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:07.260]   Okay.
[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:12.580]   If you do outdoor lighting, the I devices, Madam A, and I think Google Home and maybe
[01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:19.620]   even HomeKit enabled outdoor outlet is $45 right now on Amazon.
[01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:21.900]   That is a good price for that.
[01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:26.820]   Please do not buy the knockoff ones because those are not UL listed.
[01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:30.100]   I feel that UL listing is really important in your books.
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:32.020]   It's very early outside.
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:34.220]   But this is 45.
[01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:37.020]   The other one's in doesn't require a hub.
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:40.660]   If you want to do outdoor lighting, I'm going to tell you this is amazing.
[01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:41.660]   You set it up.
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:43.460]   And tell Madam A or Google.
[01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:44.460]   Is it this one?
[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:45.460]   Yes.
[01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:47.740]   I'm buying them because you know why?
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:51.300]   I've never done this before, but we hired somebody to decorate the house.
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:52.540]   Oh, good God.
[01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:55.540]   Lisa says you're too old to get a whole ladder.
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:56.860]   Well, yeah.
[01:52:56.860 --> 01:52:58.340]   Well, yeah.
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:01.540]   But we're not too old to enjoy Christmas.
[01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:03.300]   So how many of these do I need to do?
[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:04.300]   How nerdy you're going to be?
[01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:07.100]   How many strands you need to plug in?
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:09.220]   I'm going to get five.
[01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:10.380]   I have six.
[01:53:10.380 --> 01:53:11.380]   Six?
[01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:12.820]   Well, because I have a rooftop.
[01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:14.380]   I have two front balconies.
[01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:15.900]   I have a back.
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:18.100]   I have the snowball thing in the front.
[01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:20.940]   So you say, echo, turn on the snow globe.
[01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:21.940]   And it does.
[01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:22.940]   No, I have it.
[01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:26.940]   Have you not seen my vimeo video of Alexa turn on Christmas?
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:27.940]   Have we?
[01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:28.940]   I'm sure you guys have it.
[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:29.940]   The annual tradition.
[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:30.940]   I should save it for next month.
[01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:33.740]   Yeah, you will do it next time because you got to go.
[01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:35.220]   Should I really get these?
[01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:36.220]   But wait a minute.
[01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:37.220]   What are you plugging them into?
[01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:38.220]   Your Christmas lights.
[01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:40.820]   Oh, and the other side is plugged into somewhere.
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:41.820]   You have to have power.
[01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:43.500]   But I guess I guess I'm going to get it.
[01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:46.540]   This is a magic extension cords.
[01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:48.580]   Yes, it plugs it.
[01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:56.940]   So this basically turns it voice activates or remote control activates your outdoor lights.
[01:53:56.940 --> 01:54:00.420]   I have a tip for my pick of the week.
[01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:02.820]   Be careful what you buy on Amazon.
[01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:09.940]   For instance, if you buy a butt head mask, let's just say, and then every time you go
[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:16.820]   to Amazon, it says, here's your recent order of a butt head mask.
[01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:21.260]   It kind of takes the fun out of going to Amazon.
[01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:22.260]   Sure.
[01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:23.820]   I'm just saying.
[01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:25.340]   Don't.
[01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:27.900]   And if you do, don't buy it on Amazon.
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:31.340]   I'm on that butt head mask and I hunt my Amazon forever now.
[01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:34.500]   It's going to go everywhere all around the web.
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.900]   Why did you buy this?
[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:37.900]   Why did you buy this?
[01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:39.820]   You buy a butt head mask, Leo.
[01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:42.260]   I thought it'd be funny.
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:43.260]   It is funny.
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:45.620]   I'm enjoying it tremendously.
[01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:46.620]   I have it.
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:47.620]   You want to see it?
[01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:48.620]   It was short.
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:49.620]   I like Stacy.
[01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:50.620]   Oh, good.
[01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:51.620]   Here's her video.
[01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:52.620]   Go ahead.
[01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:55.020]   Just say it for us.
[01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:58.140]   Oh, I say it.
[01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:02.060]   Turn on Christmas.
[01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:03.420]   And it'll it takes a 10.
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:05.220]   It's on Vimeo.
[01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:07.620]   Oh, there it goes.
[01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:11.300]   Oh, play holiday music.
[01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:17.340]   Oh, holiday classics on prime music.
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:19.580]   So festive.
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:22.900]   Alexa, turn off downstairs lights.
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:29.500]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:31.900]   So festive.
[01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:34.260]   I hope you get a million views on that.
[01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:36.620]   Oh, I think I had that up forever.
[01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:37.980]   We don't need a million views.
[01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:38.980]   It's just--
[01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:40.980]   It's not a FIMI, yeah.
[01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:42.460]   Don't get anything for that.
[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:43.740]   All right, everybody.
