[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.920]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.280]   From people you trust.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.840]   This is Twig.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.600]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by cash fly,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.000]   C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.480]   This is Twig, this week in Google,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.720]   episode 1 for August 1, 2009 in beta.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.600]   This show is brought to you by listeners like you
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.800]   and your contributions.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.960]   We couldn't do it without you.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.680]   Thanks so much.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.680]   This is Twig, a brand new show this week in Google.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.280]   I'm Leo Laporte and I am very excited to cover the show.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.280]   And I have to give credit to Dane Golden,
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.880]   who's our executive producer here, the president of Twit.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.520]   He came to me a few months ago and said,
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.760]   you have shows on Windows, you have shows on Macintosh,
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.440]   you have shows on open source.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.280]   Isn't Google at this point, with all of the things it's doing,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.320]   including the Chrome OS, and a parody with these other companies?
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.080]   And I said, yeah, we really should do this.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.200]   But even more, we should cover the cloud.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.680]   So that's what this show is about, Google and the cloud.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.480]   And I couldn't be happier at the panel we've assembled.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.200]   For this first show, we're just going to have the core members.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.440]   But in time, we'll add others on an ad hoc basis.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.240]   But first, let me introduce Gina Trapani, some of you
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.320]   know from Twit and, of course, the founder of Life Hacker.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.800]   She's at smarterware.org.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.840]   And one of the smartest people I know.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.320]   Also, a developer who's written add-ons,
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.240]   she has a great Gmail add-on, better Gmail.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.080]   In fact, you have several Gmail add-ons.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.560]   Yep.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.520]   Yep.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.200]   So she knows Google, and I presume is going to talk about Wave
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.320]   at some point, because I want to know more about that.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.280]   Oh, yes.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.400]   Also with us both Gina and Jeff are authors.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.320]   But Jeff's newest book is kind of apropos.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.880]   What would Google do?
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.840]   Jeff Jarvis of Buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.000]   So glad to have you on the show.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.640]   Harder to be here, Lee.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.800]   So this is going to be a show about Google, not just
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   the Google, the software, but Google, the company,
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.520]   Google, the trends, the stories.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.200]   And I hope we can get some tips as well from Gina especially
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.040]   on using Google better.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.160]   And we'd love to hear from you and your input as well.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.080]   So we're going to set up email accounts for all of us
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.080]   so that you can give us your feedback.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.280]   I will start a friend feed room, and we've
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.360]   got the chat room, too.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.520]   And you can watch us do this.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.440]   We're going to start doing it live every Saturday
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.360]   at 6 p.m. Eastern, 3 p.m. Pacific time.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.760]   That's 2,200 UTC if you want to watch it live.twit.tv.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.640]   But of course, it is a podcast.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.280]   I suspect most of you are going to be listening that way.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.840]   So let's jump in because the timing couldn't be better.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.760]   Although, as I've been thinking about doing this show more
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.400]   and more, I've been looking at Google stories.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.520]   And every week I say, boy, the timing couldn't be-- oh,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.360]   there's even more.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.280]   The biggest story is about Google this week.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.200]   And it's really about a triumvirate, about Google,
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.320]   about Apple, and about AT&T.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.680]   The FCC has said it's going to look
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.600]   into the rejection of the Google voice app from the Apple
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.520]   store, in particular, wants to know, what did AT&T
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.720]   have to do with this?
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.960]   Do we all use Google Voice?
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.880]   You use it, Jeff?
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.240]   Yes.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.280]   I'm just a friend.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.120]   It's fantastic, isn't it, Gina?
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.120]   It's awesome.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.640]   It's awesome.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.960]   I love it.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.520]   I've had an account since Grand Central.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.760]   And I actually-- I hate the phone in general.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.640]   I try to not do phone calls as much as possible.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.120]   But I switched to my Google Voice number,
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.800]   and it makes dealing with voicemail.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.240]   I mean, before I would get voicemail,
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.080]   and I would just let it blink and blink and blink for days
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.720]   and not check it.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.360]   But it's awesome.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.200]   Google Voice does voicemail transcription,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.400]   as well as centralizes your number.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.000]   So you can have several phones ring from one number,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.600]   and have it behave differently depending on who's calling
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.720]   or what time of day it is.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.720]   I mean, it's really awesome.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.480]   It makes the phone so much more usable.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.560]   So it's an incredible app.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.040]   And I mean, this thing that happened this week--
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.400]   I was just obsessed with this story,
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.560]   because iPhone critics had their, I told you so moment.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.760]   We all knew that Apple could reject applications
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.040]   in the App Store.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.320]   But everyone said, well, they won't
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.000]   reject anything that consumers want.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.280]   The market will out.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.080]   And in this case, they-- not only do they kick out third party
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.360]   independent developer apps that use Google Voice,
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.000]   but they rejected Google's own native app.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.920]   And it's not clear whether or not it was AT&T's.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.360]   I mean, John Gerber said-- and he's got great sources
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.120]   in Apple inside Apple, said that it was absolutely AT&T, right?
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.360]   And now the FCC has--
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.840]   I'm sorry?
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.000]   I mean, it would have to be AT&T.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.560]   Why would Apple care one way or the other,
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.680]   but AT&T cares desperately, eh?
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.120]   Well, Apple's excuse, which is their stock excuse,
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.160]   is it duplicates functionality already on the phone.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.480]   But they had already approved the GV mobile app.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.640]   It's been in the Apple Store.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.560]   And pulled it.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.080]   And then pulled it, yeah.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.880]   And that was the reason they gave Sean Kovacs,
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.520]   I think it was his name, the GV mobile developer.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.960]   I mean, I guess it all came to a head when Google created
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.520]   their official application.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.880]   That's when AT&T stepped in.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.280]   I mean, at what point does Apple stand up to AT&T
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.000]   and say no, we're not doing it.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.360]   They can't--
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.120]   I'm sure they've got contractual obligations if nothing else.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.240]   But you know what was interesting?
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.840]   David Pogue this week launched his Take Back the Beep
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.560]   campaign about long voicemail instructions.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.840]   And he said in his piece about that,
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.480]   that Apple had actually insisted that AT&T
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.200]   remove those voicemail instructions for iPhone users.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.640]   So AT&T has--
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.600]   excuse me, Apple has said to AT&T, we will or won't do this.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.160]   And I have no idea what the terms of their contract were.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.600]   But it seems stupid to me that they--
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.040]   What did they--
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.960]   my question is, what did this app do that--
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.440]   I mean, did it give you a portal to your voicemail?
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.520]   Did it allow you to dial phone calls?
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.600]   I think the key thing if it did this that would be really
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.400]   annoying to AT&T would be free text messaging.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.320]   Right.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.360]   So I haven't used, obviously, the iPhone app.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.320]   But I have the Google Voice application running on my Android
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.640]   phone.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.000]   I ditched the iPhone for Android a few months ago.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.800]   And the Android app integrates Google Voice Calling
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.040]   with your dialer and Google Voice SMS
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.360]   with your native messaging app.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.480]   So if I want to call someone, I don't
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.960]   have to get launched a browser and start a call that way
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.320]   or send an SMS that way, I can do it directly.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.680]   And it tells me, hey, this is from Google Voice.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.160]   And it makes it just a much more seamless experience.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.120]   So it's free calls too or cheap calls too.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.480]   Does it work on 3G as well as Wi-Fi?
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.480]   Yes, yes it does.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.600]   Oh, there's another problem.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.100]   It does.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.680]   But the thing is, from what I understand,
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.160]   you do use AT&T's line to make a Google Voice call.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.240]   It calls a Google Voice number.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.800]   So Google's paying them.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.120]   So well, I mean, you're using your minutes.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.680]   I mean, you use AT&T time.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.440]   This is the thing that I don't understand,
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.160]   AT&T isn't losing business insofar as that you change your number
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.680]   and you're not locked into a contract with that same number.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.360]   You're losing control.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.400]   At the end of the day, this is the end of the phone company.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.560]   As we know it, it's been a long time coming,
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.800]   but we're finally there.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.480]   Why have a phone company?
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.040]   Well, and that was the reaction.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.440]   I think maybe it was your reaction, Jeff,
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.920]   when the Voice.Google.com went live.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.440]   I mean, Grand Central wasn't much of a threat.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.440]   But Google Voice is a pretty big threat to the phone companies.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.760]   It's clearly a replacement for the phone companies coming from Google
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.760]   is even more scary.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:49.880]   So is this the FCC?
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.640]   I don't think has any control over Apple.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.720]   Certainly not over what Apple approves in its App Store.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.200]   But it certainly has control over AT&T.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.720]   So if AT&T didn't have anything to do with this,
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.080]   can the FCC still step in?
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.000]   The FCC, all you're right on AT&T,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.680]   but the FTC could get involved as well, I think,
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.960]   and I wonder about anti-competitive issues.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.640]   Right.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.160]   Well, it's certainly anti-competitive.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.080]   Well, so Gina, you left for Android
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.680]   because you think Apple's fascists?
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.520]   Kind of.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.640]   Yeah, I have to say that--
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.000]   I mean, Android is open.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.560]   Android's open, and I'm a developer,
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.280]   and I would never develop for the iPhone platform.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.440]   Listen, I will say straight out that iPhone experience is nicer
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.920]   than Android.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.120]   I really am a big fan of the Android operating system.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.240]   I have a G1, not really a fan of the handset.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.360]   But I kind of put up with the little bits and pieces
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.720]   that aren't as smooth as the iPhone,
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.520]   because I feel more comfortable.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.520]   I feel more in control.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.240]   I feel like you can customize the phone better.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.000]   There are some bits about Android that actually
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.160]   are better than the iPhone OS.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.040]   I like the window shade as a better notification mechanism.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.280]   And I can customize the phone in ways
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.920]   I can't with the iPhone.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.400]   The apps are not as good.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.000]   But yeah, I switched because I just didn't--
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.320]   I just was more excited about Android and its open philosophy.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   And I felt like-- and also the integration with Google Apps,
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.520]   specifically Gmail.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.520]   The Gmail client on Android is awesome.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.160]   It's not as good as any other mobile client I've seen for email.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.400]   And I primarily use my phone for email.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.160]   I mean, you can do things like multiple labels
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.760]   and muting conversations and reporting spam.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   And you can do it with that native client on Android
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.720]   better than with mail on the iPhone or even the web app.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.640]   Although the web app is getting better for Gmail.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.760]   TechCrunch has published the FCC letter to Apple.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.840]   I presume that this is the real deal.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.720]   I don't know where they got it.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.960]   Catherine DuVell, Vice President,
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.760]   worldwide government affairs apple,
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.680]   incorporated Dear Ms. Novelli.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.760]   Please provide the following answers
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.120]   to questions by close of business Friday, August 21, 2009.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.880]   Why did Apple reject the Google voice application for iPhone
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.680]   and remove related third party applications?
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.920]   In addition to Google voice, which related third party
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.000]   applications were removed or have been rejected?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.280]   Did Apple act alone?
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.240]   This is-- I think this is the smoking gun, right?
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.360]   Or in consultation with AT&T and deciding
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.320]   to reject the application, if the latter
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.680]   described the communications, does AT&T
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.280]   have any role in the approval of iPhone applications
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.760]   generally or in certain cases, if so,
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.440]   under what circumstances and what role does it play?
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.800]   Please explain any differences between the Google voice
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.760]   iPhone app and any voice over internet protocol apps.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.880]   Apple has approved Skype, notably.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.440]   I'm adding this is on the iPhone.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.160]   What other applications have been rejected on the iPhone
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.160]   and for what reasons?
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:47.640]   Wow.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.160]   That's long last.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.800]   Wow.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.480]   That's a phishing expedition.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.880]   But they're gunning AT&T, not Apple itself.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.960]   I think it's pretty clear.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.960]   What are the standards for-- although I don't know,
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.800]   these last two questions are really all about Apple.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.600]   What applications have been rejected in general?
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.480]   Is there a list of prohibited applications
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.520]   or of the categories that is provided?
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.080]   If so, is this posted on the website
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.040]   or otherwise disclosed to consumers?
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.360]   Yeah, this is kind of an FTC-like thing.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.400]   What are the standards for considering and approving
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.600]   iPhone applications?
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.160]   What is the approval process?
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.680]   This is all stuff Apple has always historically
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.480]   refused to tell anyone.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.720]   What are the percentage of applications rejected?
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.160]   What are the major reasons for rejection?
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.800]   Now, Apple can say we want the answers to be confidential.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   Although it's--
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.960]   It will happen.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.880]   It says blanket requests for confidentiality
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.920]   of a large set of documents are unacceptable.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.880]   You have to kind of go one Z2C.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.520]   Wow, that's really interesting.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.960]   Yeah, this is really interesting.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.680]   It's just going to see what happens with this.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.440]   Very interesting.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.000]   All right.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.520]   Well, I have two minds.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.680]   On the one hand, I really hate to see the government intervene.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.680]   I'm not a free marketer, but I hate
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.320]   to see the government over intervene,
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.360]   over involved in the minutia of a business.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.720]   But at the same time, the FCC clearly
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.880]   has an obligation to protect consumers
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.160]   if there is kind of a general harm.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.960]   Is there a general harm to rejecting the Google Voice app?
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.400]   I mean, that seems like kind of a small, small potatoes.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.480]   [CRICKETS CHIRPING]
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.960]   Hmm.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.240]   It is, but it's the beginning of something.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.080]   I don't know.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:26.920]   I don't know.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.160]   I feel like this is the worst thing that could have happened.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.280]   I mean, Google Voice is really, really useful.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.240]   I mean, this is the first app that everyone is up in arms
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.160]   about because it's really useful for consumers.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.440]   And it really changes the whole--
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:39.960]   That's true.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.080]   --in the people for the telephone.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.840]   And I mean, I have a problem with--
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.240]   Apple's being able to reject an app without--
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.440]   I mean, I suppose the duplication of features
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.040]   is a-- I don't know if that's a reasonable response.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:55.600]   I don't know.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.200]   What do you think, Jeff?
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.440]   Gina, I wonder if this is really the beginning
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.320]   of the net neutrality fight.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.040]   The question is, is the iPhone a phone or is it the web?
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.000]   If it's merely if phones have traditionally
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.160]   had control over their networks end to end, and that's that.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.280]   If the iPhone has some consumer promise of bringing us
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.360]   the web, then how neutral must they
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.440]   be about the applications that go there?
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.440]   And that's going to be hard for Apple to swallow
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.040]   beyond the telephony questions to--
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.320]   well, should they open up the apps to everything?
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.360]   That's a little hard for them to swallow
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.400]   because they're going to say there's a quality issue.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.080]   On the other hand, if the iPhone really is not a phone at all,
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.800]   it is a computer with ubiquitous constant web access,
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.760]   then we're starting now in the path of net neutrality
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.440]   and that debate.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.240]   And that's what makes this, I think, really juicy and hard.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.200]   That's an excellent point, Jeff, because I would say absolutely
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.880]   the FCC has the right to force net neutrality.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.360]   Then that makes it much more than just,
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.560]   you're not letting this app in.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.200]   This is about, do you have full access to the internet
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:57.680]   on the phone?
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.440]   And do you deserve full access to the internet on an iPhone?
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.440]   Right, and I can get to--
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.080]   the other question is, I can get to anything
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.120]   I want through the web portion of a browser.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.720]   But then if a function is stopped there,
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.200]   is that different from stopping an app here?
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.680]   And certainly Skype has been stopped at some level.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.080]   All right, I can only use it when I'm on Wi-Fi.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.440]   Well, what's the definition of my consumer expectation
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.360]   of my network control?
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.120]   I don't know yet.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.640]   Well, we'll see.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.120]   I mean, I think that's a really great story.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:37.000]   And the pot is definitely boiling now for AT&T.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.640]   This just adds, of course, to all of the hatred AT&T
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.240]   has been earning from iPhone customers.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.720]   But I have to say, it wouldn't be any different
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.720]   for any other carrier.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.360]   And if you have a BlackBerry with Verizon,
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.840]   you see the same kind of hobbling limitations.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.680]   I'm surprised that T-Mobile hasn't done that with the G1.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.040]   But I guess it's probably because T-Mobile's such a small company
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.360]   and the G1 is such a limited device.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.400]   It's not something they're going to worry about.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.280]   Well, one of the links you have up on the wiki
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.920]   is about a lot more G phones coming.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.760]   Well, there's the G2, the G2 from HTC,
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.880]   which a lot of people like no keyboard.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.480]   And then Motorola is going to do a bunch of less expensive
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.400]   Android phones.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.200]   Yeah, bring on more Android phones,
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.480]   because the G1 really needs some better successors.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.440]   I have a G1, and I don't use it because I just
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.400]   don't like the hardware.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.000]   The hardware is so limited, I can't really--
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.480]   and so I almost can't even judge the Android OS.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.680]   Yeah, I'm right there with you.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.960]   The battery life is terrible.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.320]   It's big and clunky.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.800]   Yeah, there's a lot of things that are wrong.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.640]   It doesn't have a headphone jack.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.080]   There are a lot of things wrong with it.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.160]   Have you developed for Android?
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.600]   I haven't broken out.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.840]   I've installed the SDK kind of played around a little bit
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.160]   with it.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.360]   But I haven't gotten a real serious about it.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.560]   Why, Jeff, you look a lot at what Google's business model is.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.080]   And obviously, it's advertising.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.280]   What is the play with Google Voice?
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.600]   Would they put ads at some point in the text messages?
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.800]   Chris Anderson said in his book, Free, Just Out,
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.080]   and Tim O'Reilly talked about this, too.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.600]   Look at Google 411.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.720]   Their argument that Google's real benefit there
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.000]   is that they get more voice samples from more people
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.720]   and find out what's right and wrong than anybody else.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.880]   And so when we get to the voice-driven web,
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.120]   they know what's what.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.000]   Yeah, Google has incredible voice recognition
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.880]   because of Google 411.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.360]   Exactly.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.040]   So when they go into some new line of business,
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.480]   they're always looking for that side door.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.040]   And when it was Google Docs, to some extent, yes,
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.240]   it was just the fact that there's
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.400]   an advertising opportunity there.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.000]   Although that's pretty small.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.080]   But the cost is low or addiction to Google is high.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.120]   You listen to Gina's passion about using Google Voice.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.200]   If you have an addicted customer, that's just a good thing.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.840]   You know, heroin's a good business, man.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.120]   But it reminds me of the old story.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.440]   We're not charging anything from that.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.800]   Yeah, but we make it up in volume.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.080]   I mean, you've got to make money somewhere.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.240]   You can't just say, well, we've got lots of eyeballs.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.440]   That equals money.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.560]   Well, but look at Google News.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.440]   Google News itself makes nothing,
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.640]   but it enhanced the search and it gave Google a leg
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.720]   into the live web.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.520]   Google 411 gives them voice samples.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.840]   All these things give them data and relationships
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.560]   that they find a way to monetize later.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.760]   97% of Google's revenue right now is advertising.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.960]   And Eric Smith said at the Aspen Ideas Festival
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.240]   that his board keeps pushing him to find more legs
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.720]   to that stool because there's a little wobbly on that.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.040]   But it's a damn good business that he said he said--
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.400]   But no--
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.320]   He loved advertising.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.200]   No pressure to go beyond advertising.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.600]   It's OK to continue to make the money on the advertising
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.520]   or is there pressure to go--
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.120]   We like some other variety in that.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.280]   But 97% Smith said we love advertising.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.080]   Let me say it again.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.080]   We love advertising.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.640]   Now AP does not love Google News.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.320]   Let's talk a little bit about that because that's--
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.120]   journalism is your life's blood.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.040]   And some people have said that Associated Press
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:59.440]   has just kind of ended its useful life by this fight.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.320]   What is AP saying?
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.840]   So the AP worked with some other players to do it.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.760]   What at one blush looks smart--
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.960]   Stevie Elvington has a very good blog post about this.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.960]   They're trying to come up with a structure for metadata
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.640]   and micro formats for news that would help make news
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.240]   more findable by algorithms and aggregators.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.640]   And that on the one hand is great.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.560]   The bad part here is the AP came along
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.440]   and they tried to put a kind of a DRM wrapper on news.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.320]   And I'm going to try to find out how many people are stealing
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.080]   the news as if that's much.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.200]   And Tom Curly-- here's the bad part--
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.120]   Tom Curly, the president of the AP, who's a smart guy.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.520]   But he said in the New York Times,
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.360]   playing blank that any use--
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.840]   and he included in that just a headline and a snippet--
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.280]   may be beyond what they call fair use.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.520]   And so I argue that the AP is now gunning for the internet.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.000]   If they're against links, they're against the internet.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.640]   If we all can't link with a headline and a snippet
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.520]   to something, and someone's going to argue
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.120]   that that's not fair use and they're going to sue us for that
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.040]   and they're going to chill the whole internet, it's stupid,
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.720]   but it's also very dangerous.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.200]   It's also harmful to journalism because every damn journalist
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.160]   out there quotes somebody else, we don't do it all ourselves.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.520]   And it's all about fair use and quoting.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.640]   And so the AP has gone over the deep end here, I think.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.640]   They've gone after bloggers before to stop them from linking.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.320]   That's just stupid in the link economy.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.480]   The link economy is where the values are.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.880]   In the old content economy, the value was in the content
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.400]   in the soul of many times.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.000]   On the internet, it's a link economy.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.880]   And the value comes in with links.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.560]   And I think what should really happen
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.800]   is that those who receive the links
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.520]   should pay those who send the links.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.040]   And by that logic, people should be paying Google for links,
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.200]   but they're not and Google's not demanding that.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.520]   The AP has gone way over the deep end.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.920]   And I talked with Josh Cohen, the product manager
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:54.000]   for Google News this week for my Guardian podcast, MediaTalkUSA.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.720]   And he's so far ahead of where media companies are thinking,
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.320]   they're thinking protectionism and trying
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.440]   to put a pay wall around their content
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.360]   and trying to extend copyright.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.440]   And that's just not how the internet works.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.920]   It's interesting.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.000]   It's sometimes hard, and even for me,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.240]   to understand this new economy.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.920]   When we talk about, well, how does Google make money?
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.560]   Well, how is the AP supposed to survive in the link economy?
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.840]   It's such a new way of thinking about economics.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.800]   And I think it's not immediately obvious,
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.200]   let alone to mainstream old news, old media types,
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.960]   even to people like me, I live in this thing.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.440]   And I still kind of am baffled by the whole idea.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.240]   It's all entirely new, and that's not to plug my book.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.440]   But what would Google do after all?
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.040]   I think the question is this.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.160]   Is that the world, thank you, Nick Lee.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.840]   The world has changed early.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.320]   And if you look at how media operates online,
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.000]   they're still selling scarcity.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.360]   Scares, I'm in a scarce banner position.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.320]   Scares the scarcity.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.960]   It's over for scarcity.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.400]   Exactly. It's an abundant world.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.280]   And Google figured that out by selling ads everywhere
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.960]   on the internet to become more relevant
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.040]   and sell performance.scarcity.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.400]   Old media operates by the old rules of an old economy
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.360]   that was dominated by owning the press.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.080]   Right. Sorry, guys, it's over.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.760]   Right. I love that, and I get that.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.320]   And I get the ultimate democratization of media
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.200]   that that brings about.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.840]   But I can understand why old media is scared about,
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.200]   but how do we make a living doing it?
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.240]   You know, I teach at the City University of New York,
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.440]   graduate school of journalism.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.480]   That's a mouthful.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.400]   And we're doing a new business models for news project
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.960]   where we're looking at how the ecosystem of news
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.840]   will operate after the last Metro paper in a city dies.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.040]   And we've found that there are hyper local bloggers
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.320]   who are making bringing in gross revenue of $100,000 to $200,000.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.320]   It's a real business.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.160]   Interesting.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.840]   And the new news organization is going to have to work
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.680]   with that layer.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.120]   And there's going to be a framework that's going to make
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:54.720]   that work.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.320]   There was an announcement Thursday on a new company called
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.000]   Growth Spur.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.440]   And I've been advising them on a CUNY.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.080]   Mark Potts who did Backfence to try
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.000]   to allow the creation of networks locally.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.160]   I think what's happening is that the big old companies
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.080]   that control news in a town will no longer control.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.040]   That's obvious.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.760]   And it's going to be a bunch of startups
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.680]   that we have to encourage who are going to really run the news.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.080]   You know, look at Gina.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.800]   You, Gina, have created news empires
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.120]   by grabbing a topic and making it yours.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.280]   And you're eating on it, right?
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.600]   You're making a living on this.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.920]   Yeah, I mean, for the last four years,
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.360]   I've made my living being a filter,
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.960]   essentially, you know, being a blogger.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.800]   Let me ask you, Gina, because you and I both are doing that.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.240]   And I think it's more intuitive than really a deep grasp
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.200]   of what's going on.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.480]   I couldn't write a policy paper about why a paywall
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.920]   is a bad idea and why what we're doing and scarcity.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.160]   I just, it's more intuitive.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.800]   Or do you really understand what's going on?
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.120]   I don't really understand what's going on.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.480]   I mean, I know that it's working.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.640]   You make me feel better.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.120]   (laughing)
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.000]   'Cause it's beyond me.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.960]   I let the philosophers like you, Jeff and Jay Rosen and NYU,
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.720]   I let you guys figure out what's really going on.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.840]   I mean, I know I had a paying job doing this
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.040]   for the last four years and it was working.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.120]   And yeah, I looked at Jeff to explain why.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.480]   Yeah, we're the empiricists.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.320]   (laughing)
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.720]   But it's scary, it is scary.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.800]   And it's kind of similar to open source development.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.960]   People ask me, why do you build things
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.760]   and then just put the code out there.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.280]   And it's scary.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.280]   Hey, there have been times when I'm like,
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.360]   well, if I charge and then maybe,
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.840]   but I get hired to do things, cool things like this,
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.240]   based on the stuff that you give away.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.600]   So it's not intuitive.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.280]   I'm not always sure exactly how it works,
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.600]   but it does kind of work.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.600]   No, it does.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.440]   Magic.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.680]   And maybe it's 'cause I'm an old media guy.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.640]   And so I have a foot in both worlds
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.800]   and it feels like the dock and the boat are going farther
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.960]   and farther apart.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.680]   And your legs are on into Blobby.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.920]   Yeah, and it's kind of, well, hmm.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.560]   So, but you're right, I know it's working.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.280]   So empirically, I know there's something to this,
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   giving it away, but it's still a little bit scary.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.120]   That's all.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:02.960]   And hard to explain for sure.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.520]   And really hard to explain.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.360]   Yep.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.200]   I mean, I spend many hours a week
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.640]   trying to talk about this stuff in a way
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.720]   that makes any sense at all.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.040]   Let's talk about something that Steve Ballmer says,
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.320]   "Nobody gets the Microsoft Yahoo deal."
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.840]   You've got an article coming up in the Guardian, Jeff,
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.160]   about this.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.880]   In its essence, it's not,
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.440]   and Ballmer was quick to point this out,
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.680]   nobody bought anybody.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.440]   It's not Yahoo selling to Microsoft.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.480]   It's a deal where the Microsoft search engine
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.000]   becomes the Yahoo search engine,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.880]   Bing becomes Yahoo's search tool.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.480]   And Yahoo's gets to sell the ads on Bing.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.640]   Why is it so hard for people to understand?
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.280]   Why does Ballmer think that we don't get it, Jeff?
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.680]   - Well, Ballmer came off, I think,
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.960]   like the clever cat here.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.880]   He managed to get Yahoo's search traffic
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.360]   without having to pay them any cash
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.200]   and without having to manage the rest of Yahoo,
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.920]   which is in problems.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.560]   Yahoo, it's really kind of sad.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.600]   And you think back, you know, it's really quaint, I think.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.160]   If you look back 15 years,
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.640]   it was Yahoo that first organized the web for us,
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.800]   and it was--
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.640]   - Imagine how naive it was.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.720]   - They had this kooky notion.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.480]   - They could organize the entire web with people.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.640]   - Catalog it.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.000]   - That'll work. - Is that funny?
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.280]   - It's so cute, I think.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.120]   And that's over now.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.960]   Yahoo has now given up on its core mission
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.600]   of organizing the web.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.560]   What strikes me is that they're both fighting
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.760]   the last war and an unwinnable war at that against Google.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.640]   Meanwhile, Google's looking way past search
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.600]   and looking at the future of the web.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.640]   I was really struck just today about the stat that said,
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.120]   Josh Cohen at Google News said,
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.720]   "Google News causes a billion clicks a month."
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.200]   And then I saw unpaid content that Bitly,
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.920]   the URL shortener for the world now,
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.480]   also causes a billion clicks a month.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.000]   - Wait a minute, Bitly has as many clicks as Google News?
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.320]   - Yes. - It's not.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.320]   - Isn't it amazing?
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.640]   That's like a John Henry story of, you know,
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.000]   Steel Drive and Man versus the algorithm, right?
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.760]   And it says that search isn't the whole world here.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.760]   Google has the most important win,
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.080]   which is advertising.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.760]   And then there's still fights going on
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.360]   over the social web and the live web and the local web
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.320]   and the mobile web.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.280]   And those are all fights yet to be had.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.000]   Meanwhile, Microsoft and Yahoo are still fighting
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.360]   the last war of the search.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.640]   And it's not all about search.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.000]   It's about all this other stuff.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.560]   - This is very typical of Microsoft.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.880]   I mean, for them to be fighting the last war
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.920]   is no surprise at all.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.760]   - I mean, they got Yahoo to help them win it.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.000]   Well, win to an extent.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.520]   They all have 20% market share in the US.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.760]   They'll have something like 10% market share in the UK.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.040]   Google is still the killing winner,
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.760]   even if micro who gets up to 30%.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.600]   So what?
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.760]   - Well, my friend Jason Calicanis points out
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.680]   that every percentage of search market
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.080]   you have is worth a billion dollars.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.600]   It's not, you know, 30% is another, is 30 billion dollars.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.560]   - That's Jason's streams of,
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.720]   from the show from Apollo. - Yeah, he wants to follow.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.560]   - Yeah.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.400]   (laughing)
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.360]   - But is this it?
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.640]   I mean, are we giving up now?
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.600]   I mean, search has done, Google's done it, and that's it.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.480]   Like, I felt so, I mean, this news made me feel so sad
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.840]   because I was just like, oh, I remember when Yahoo
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.160]   was a search company and--
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.160]   - Well, Bing's a pretty good--
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.000]   - And they were brand of choice.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.320]   - Bing's a pretty good search engine, isn't it?
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.520]   - Bing's a pretty good search engine.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.920]   And actually, I switched my search shortcut to Bing
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.800]   for a full week after Bing launched.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.640]   - No.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.080]   - And, you know, I think the best thing that we all
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.800]   can say about Bing is that it's a lot better
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.160]   than we thought it would be, right?
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.680]   I mean, you know-- - It's no Google.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.000]   - It's no Google, but it's better than we thought.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.200]   I just, as a consumer, I like the idea of having
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.720]   a few different sort of viable choices.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.720]   Yeah, Google's the clear winner, but really,
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.200]   is Google it for search?
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.040]   Are we done?
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.680]   Like, is that it?
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.520]   That makes me sad.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.360]   - Well, what do you want?
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.600]   - Google even looks at past search.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.440]   When I talked to Josh Cohen at Google News,
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.880]   his message to media companies was thinking about
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.560]   how you have to distribute your stuff
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.000]   all across the web.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.560]   You can no longer expect people to come to you.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.680]   So that notion of, you know, having a homepage,
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.840]   how quaint in 1999, where the whole world comes
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.720]   to you through Google, we're already thinking past that.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.360]   And if you look at Google Wave, and you look
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.120]   at Google Elements and things like that,
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.360]   it's about distributing yourself and having your audience
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.760]   distribute you everywhere.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.440]   And I think that gets past search to new means
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.560]   of discovery, and Twitter is just one of them.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.080]   - So I like that.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.240]   So that's what you meant maybe, is that it's discovery,
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.520]   not search. - Yes, yes.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.000]   - Really, 'cause we were using search
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.660]   as a form of discovery, but it's really only a little
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.560]   bit of it, really there's better ways to find stuff.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.840]   - Well, it's still a major part of it,
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.160]   and it still will be, but search is not to be all in end all.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.280]   And if Google threw its entire fortune
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.520]   into nothing but search, as Microsoft and Yahoo have done
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.280]   online, that'd be the mistake.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.280]   Google's looking past that.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.840]   - So you're saying too little, too late for micro-hoo?
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.720]   - Yeah.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.600]   - There you go.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.960]   - Yeah, I guess so.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.760]   I still wish that there was like a--
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.120]   - You're so wishful.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.180]   - She wants more, she wants more.
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.740]   What's missing? - I search a lot.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:08.780]   - What's missing?
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:12.100]   - I want another search engine that's just as good,
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.820]   and even sometimes better than Google,
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.380]   because I want people to have a choice.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:19.060]   Because listen, hey, I'm Google fan girl, I'm here,
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.660]   I'm a critic, I'm a user, all those things,
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.620]   but I would like other choices.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.260]   I like competition, I like choices.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.900]   - Well, hey, by the way, we should make this clear.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.820]   This is not the Google fan show, by any means.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.180]   This could end up being the Google is Sucks show.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.220]   It's just about Google.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.000]   So it's perfectly okay for you to say,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.520]   I want something more besides Google.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.000]   But you know, and look, we had that for years,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.720]   and nobody used it, we just used Google.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.320]   - Right, it's true, it's true.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.920]   It freaks me out that Google gets my all my queries every day,
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.520]   and all my email, and all my voice stuff.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.120]   And we can talk about my sort of paranoia
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.280]   about Google getting all my data
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.960]   just because they're simply best in market.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.600]   - I share that with you, Gina.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.920]   It terrifies me that Google's so good.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.680]   - Because I just, if I look at what I use, Google Docs,
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.740]   Google Mail, Google Voice, Google Search,
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:10.020]   they own me, they own my data smog, 100%.
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.900]   - At the Aspen Ideas Festival,
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.220]   Brian Lehrer from WNYC Radio questioned Eric Schmidt,
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.500]   and said, "I'm stuck with you."
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.620]   And Schmidt said, and so did Kai Risdall,
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.620]   the host of Marketplace.
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.940]   And Eric Schmidt said, "No, for every single one
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.860]   of our functions, there is a perfectly good alternative."
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.180]   And he's right, there it.
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.140]   - Tell that to the Department of Justice.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:32.380]   - Yeah. - Tell that to the EU.
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.840]   - Well, that's the other interesting thing, Leo.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.220]   It's gonna be hard for Microsoft
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.140]   to scream anti-trust against Google.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:37.980]   - That's right.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.720]   - Microsoft has 30% share of search.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.540]   That doesn't look like anti-trust monopoly, any.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:42.380]   - Right.
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.400]   Could have been a strategic mistake.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:50.720]   So if government molly coddling is your business strategy,
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.680]   which I don't think bomber is into fact,
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.840]   I hope having been on the other end of it for too long.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.300]   - Let's talk about some Google specifics,
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.880]   'cause we're also gonna do a lot of that on this show.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.640]   On behalf of is gone.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.360]   Did you, did this bug you, Gina,
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.720]   that every time you used a third party SMTP server
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.080]   that would add this on behalf,
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.280]   Gmail would add this on behalf of?
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.400]   - It was very annoying.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.720]   So we all know that a Gmail as a web interface
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.240]   is a pop-up feature, right?
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.880]   So it can fetch mail from other servers.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.480]   And then you can send mail as from another address, right?
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.960]   So I can send mail from my Gina Trippani@gmail.com account
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.680]   and make it look like it's from Gina@lifehacker.com, right?
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.760]   - Many of us would prefer that,
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.320]   'cause I want the return to come to my Twitter address
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.000]   not to the Gmail address.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.400]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.520]   But before, because you were using Gmail's SMTP server
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.000]   to send out those messages, Gmail would rightly,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.320]   it's the email protocol, add this on behalf of a bit
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.920]   to the headers and not all email clients showed it,
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.680]   but I know at least Microsoft Outlook did show it.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.480]   So the person would receive your email
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.160]   and it would say from Gina Trippani@gmail.com
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.440]   on behalf of Gina@lifehacker.com.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.280]   And it was annoying 'cause people knew
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.080]   like that you were using Gmail,
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.680]   which you don't want people to know
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.040]   when you're using a username and another domain, right?
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.120]   I mean, you want your email to look professional,
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.360]   you don't wanna announce the world,
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.880]   you're using this free web mail.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:16.880]   - Hey, it could be worse, it could be say,
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.680]   could say Hotmail, I could never understand
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.640]   why people would use a Hotmail address.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.680]   It sounds like it sounds sexy or something,
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.680]   it's just weird.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.520]   - It's weird.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.720]   - Hotmail, hotmail, hotmail.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.520]   I'm a hotmail, yeah.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.400]   So what Gmail did this week, the Gmail team did this week
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.240]   and I gotta tell you, Gmail is one of my favorite
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.680]   Google products and I love them for this kind of thing,
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.960]   is that now in your Gmail account,
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.200]   if you go into settings accounts
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.920]   where you set up those custom from addresses,
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.880]   you can now assign on a per custom from address basis
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.320]   a custom SMTP server.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:51.240]   So for my Gina@lifehacker.com address, yeah.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.600]   I can say, hey, when I send mail from this address,
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.560]   use the lifehacker.com SFTP server,
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.120]   which means that that on behalf of business is gone,
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.960]   which means that you can use Gmail
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.840]   without anybody knowing that you use Gmail
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.040]   from whatever domain that you want,
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.360]   which is really awesome.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.720]   And I mean, it turns the Gmail web app into a mail client,
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.360]   like a true mail client for any addresses that you want.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.960]   I mean, it's kind of wacky how open the Gmail team
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.800]   has made the web app.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.120]   I mean, it supports iMap now, custom SMTP servers,
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.080]   it can fetch mail.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.600]   I mean, it's truly just an email client
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.200]   and that's it for any address you want.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.400]   - Yeah, it's a good power tool.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.800]   I still, I use, I like iMap and I use Fastmail,
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.760]   which is a commercial iMap provider,
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.480]   just, and the only thing that I would switch to Gmail
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:45.400]   on a heartbeat if Gmail had better mail filtering capabilities.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.120]   And this Fastmail has this program called SIV
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.480]   that you can actually write a program
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.920]   that does very complex filtering.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.400]   - Yeah, Gmail's filtering, it can do quite a bit,
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.680]   but it is missing a few things.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.480]   I have definitely run into roadblocks with filters.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.400]   Of course, some of my filters,
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.840]   I'm sure like yours, Leo, were probably edge cases,
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.000]   but I'm sure some of your filters aren't seen.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.800]   - Major edge cases.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.560]   (laughing)
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.400]   - Yeah.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:14.400]   - I have one filter that if it's CCs,
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.040]   oh, I can't remember, it was like too many people.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.720]   It's all sorts, a lot of it's spam, weird behavior
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.880]   that spammers, that kind of is a flag for spammers.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.440]   But I also use it for vacation and sophisticated vacation email
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.280]   and so forth.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.480]   And Gmail doesn't quite get there,
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.160]   but it sounds like you feel like they're moving
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.200]   in that direction and that's their intent.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.320]   - They are, they are, they launch Gmail Labs,
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.680]   so they have all these kind of experimental features,
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:38.880]   they're calling them--
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.080]   - What's your favorite Gmail Labs feature?
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.400]   - Oh my gosh, I'm looking at my Gmail account right now.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.560]   I love something-- - I like the drunk mailer.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.440]   I like the drunk mailer.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.600]   I turned that on, but it was such a pain in the butt,
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.160]   I tried to turn it off.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.720]   That's one where it makes you do math problems.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.120]   If you try to send an email after a certain hour,
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.600]   let's say midnight, then you have to do some math problems
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.000]   just to make sure you're not drunk mailing.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.520]   - So that's one of the silly ones, right?
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.160]   I mean, it's funny. - It's not that useful.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.280]   - And it's a little silly, but there are some
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.160]   that are seriously cool.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.960]   There are canned responses, which I use a lot,
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.800]   I get a lot of email about stuff that I've written
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.200]   and I can just do a canned response.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.200]   - Can you do this?
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.040]   - Most of them know this.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.160]   - Can you do a canned response based on content?
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:19.040]   - You can do, I don't want to tell you the wrong thing.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.360]   No, there's canned responses that you have to actually click
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.880]   on the canned response and send it off.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.720]   - Oh, I see.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.200]   So it's snippets.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.160]   - Yeah, you can't do based on a filter set.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.200]   - That's what I want.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.000]   - Yeah, so they had something with filters
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.800]   and I want to just play the right thing.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.840]   - So if somebody sends me an email,
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.920]   it has the word Mike Arrington
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.960]   and I just sent a response and says, "Screw you."
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.800]   (laughing)
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.640]   And then it's very straight.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.960]   - You said that, we didn't.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.800]   (laughing)
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.920]   - We were so afraid.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.760]   What are you afraid of?
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.840]   - Oh yeah, I'm lurk.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.720]   - No, no, no, no, don't fear the air, Arrington.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.560]   He says, "Pussycat."
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.520]   He says, "Sweetheart."
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.560]   He says, "Sweetheart."
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.760]   Mike knows, I joke, although I am getting T-shirts printed
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.840]   that say, "Screw you."
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.040]   (laughing)
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.200]   It's more of a branding thing than I do.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.840]   - Should we the pussycat claws on her butt?
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.120]   (laughing)
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.760]   - No, Mike says, "Sweetheart."
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.600]   (laughing)
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.320]   So what else do you like, Gina, in the--
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.240]   - So no, you can't do, sadly you can't say
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.560]   like based on certain criteria, you know,
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.160]   respond with "Screw you."
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.000]   (laughing)
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.080]   That would be funny, wouldn't it?
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.320]   - It would be very funny.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.040]   - And the labs could be working on that, we're gonna--
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.480]   (laughing)
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.000]   - So I like Gmail offline, which lets you, you know,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   use as Google gears and lets you check your Gmail
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.680]   in the browser when you're, you know, offline,
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.240]   like on the, you know, on the plane,
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.240]   which is always the example.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.400]   - So you didn't help me out here,
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.120]   a little personal consultation.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.720]   It won't let me do things like attach documents
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.400]   and write all much email and other stuff offline.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.680]   It's not as good as having an offline client.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.440]   - Right, it's not quite as good as having offline client.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.760]   It lets you read and send, but yeah,
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.680]   that is an issue.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.240]   And actually, I haven't tried the file attachment,
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.320]   but you're probably absolutely right about that.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.920]   - Awesome, you're wrong, it's quite possible.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.600]   - Wait a minute, wait a minute, it says,
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.040]   I'm looking at the Google blog, by the way.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.960]   This stuff is so complicated that you actually have
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.120]   to read third parties blogs to understand
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.640]   what the hell is going on with Google.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640]   (laughing)
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.640]   So according to the Gmail blog,
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.960]   you can set up different automated messages
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.920]   for different keywords.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.280]   And then it says, we're friends,
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.840]   so I trust you to use this power responsibly.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.520]   (laughing)
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.320]   - Well, what's the name of that labs feature?
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.880]   That's a labs feature, right?
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.880]   - Uh...
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.240]   - It's gonna be just in filters.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.400]   - It looks like it says,
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.720]   Gmail already lets you create filters
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.200]   based on a combination of keywords,
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.720]   sender, recipients, and more in your incoming messages.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.280]   If you turned on canned responses in labs,
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:40.080]   you can set a filter to grab a saved response.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.920]   - Yes. - And create an automated reply.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.240]   - You are correct, I knew, I knew it was in there.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.240]   - Oh, that's very powerful.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.520]   - Yeah, so you enable, this is right,
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.840]   you enable canned responses,
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.640]   you set up a couple of canned responses,
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.000]   and then when you make a filter,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.640]   one of the options for the action,
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.880]   so you set up your search criteria,
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.040]   and then you hit Next Step,
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.000]   and the action is you can send a canned response
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.760]   and then choose from the list of canned responses.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.800]   So that is super cool.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.520]   So you could set up a filter for Mike Arrington, Leo.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.640]   - Oh, I would just say.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.640]   (laughing)
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.960]   - Love you Mike. - Love you Mike.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.320]   - Love you, babe, how you doing?
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.000]   (laughing)
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.200]   - Thank you for finding that.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.200]   I knew that was buried somewhere.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.240]   - Well, thank Ken Sheperson.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.640]   Ken, K-Shep is really great,
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.280]   he's in our friend, one of our regular friend feed,
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.720]   well, I always start a friend feed discussion
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.200]   in the Twitch conversations room,
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.480]   and he's always a regular in there,
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.680]   and it's very quick to find these things.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.520]   - Cool, right on. - Very good stuff.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.160]   You know, I don't wanna go too long on this,
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.280]   so I think we'll probably wrap it up,
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.680]   but I wanna ask you both a question,
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.160]   and we'll do it on the show so we can have this discussion.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.960]   How do you feel about having Google employees on this show?
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.320]   If we had the opportunity to say,
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.840]   have the Gmail product manager on,
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.120]   would that be appropriate or inappropriate?
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.600]   - I think it'd be great.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.400]   - I think we can hear from them the better.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.840]   And Google competitors and Google critics,
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.880]   but I think hearing from Google folks
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.120]   about what they're up to is part of the news that we can--
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:05.000]   - Okay, I always like to start with a journalistic base.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.880]   You know, none of us, we're all unaffiliated,
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.640]   so we can speak our mind.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.520]   But I'm always very careful about putting vendors on,
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.240]   but I think this is one case where,
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.680]   you know, they'll be identified as Google employees,
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.120]   and after they leave, we can mock them.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.680]   But, you know, I think it is good,
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.440]   especially with so much going on at Google.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.600]   It is really good. - Just make them sign the NDA.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.920]   - Yeah, there you go.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.560]   - Are they gonna come on without, you know,
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.160]   a PR person from Google, like,
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.040]   like, blanking them, like, on both sides or what?
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.160]   - That is always my, there's two things I don't do.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.400]   One is submit questions ahead of time,
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.520]   which is why I've never interviewed Bill Gates.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.080]   And the other one is allow PR people in on the interview
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:42.920]   while we're doing it.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.360]   So if they won't do it, if they won't do that,
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.880]   then we won't have them on.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.360]   But my experience has been that they're actually pretty good
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.760]   and they don't seem to have too much trouble.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.720]   - They sometimes have them around
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.360]   and I've seen folks get nervous,
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.200]   but blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.040]   actually we got interviewed Josh Cohen
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.120]   and there was no flack in sight.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:56.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.360]   I think Google treats their employees as grownups.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.440]   What a concept.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.760]   (laughing)
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.240]   What an odd concept.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.160]   Do you think, now, one of the things, Gina,
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.200]   wanted to do on this show is not just talk about Google,
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.480]   but talk about other cloud apps like Zoho Office,
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.000]   which you and I, Gina both love and think the world of.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   What did you think of Microsoft's announcement
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.680]   that Office 2010 is gonna be in the cloud?
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.960]   (laughing)
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.520]   That's a big yawn for those of you not watching.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.920]   That's a big, a big hohum from Gina.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.080]   - Yeah, that's a hohum from me.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.080]   I don't know.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.320]   (laughing)
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.320]   - I'm not so much fan of the office.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.840]   Microsoft should have announced that,
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.520]   they wouldn't have impressed you.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.840]   - I'm sorry, was there a time when if they had announced it?
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.840]   - What year?
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.840]   Microsoft has sent that to the box.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.160]   - Two years ago?
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.320]   - Yeah, 'cause it won't be till 2010.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.160]   - Yeah.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.000]   (laughing)
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:49.840]   - Ah, jeez.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.920]   I don't even know what to say about that.
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.920]   I mean, is there, do you have to run a SharePoint server
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.400]   and license a bit of the software?
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.720]   And this is just totally cloud.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.560]   Is it IE only?
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.200]   I mean, these are the questions that come to my mind.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.040]   - No, it works on Safari.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:00.880]   It works on IE.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.120]   It works on Firefox.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:05.200]   It is a free service through Microsoft's live service.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.200]   It isn't the full office.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.240]   You know, it's a feature limited office.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.880]   But a lot of people complain about Google Docs
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.360]   as an example is they're kind of Spartan.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.200]   - Yes.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.280]   - And this will have the ribbon,
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.280]   this will have a UI that feels familiar
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.480]   to those who've used Office.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.640]   You're not an Office user,
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.200]   so you're probably the wrong person to ask on this.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.920]   - Well, my editors are, so.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.840]   - Yes, they want stuff in Word, don't they?
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.200]   - I bet that's true for you too, Jeff.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.680]   I mean, that's the bane of,
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.520]   (laughing)
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:34.080]   - What, and the problem is Office has too much.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:34.920]   - Right.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.920]   - There's a way to get into it and figure out
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.440]   what the hell is there.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.560]   And I don't want to talk to the Talking Paperclip
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.640]   to tell me how to use it.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.480]   - Yeah.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:44.560]   As far as I know, there will be no talking paperclip.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.400]   - Nope, paperclip.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.960]   - Or nobody named Bob.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:50.200]   In the online thing, but that'll be.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.400]   - So what happens?
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.560]   You connect Sporta file that you do in Office Live online.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.400]   You get a .docx file to your desktop
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.200]   and then you need Word to open it locally.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.600]   - Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.520]   I don't know if they'll have a gears-like mechanism
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.840]   for having it locally hosted.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.720]   - Yeah, I mean, I know that they offer word readers
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:10.920]   that are free to download, right?
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.880]   But you probably couldn't.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.880]   I mean, I suppose that's the way Google Docs
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.600]   and Zoho Docs also works.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.320]   I don't know, you know, the Office stuff online
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.600]   is kind of like.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.440]   - What do you use to write?
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.000]   Do you write with Zoho or?
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.400]   - I use a text editor,
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.400]   but that's just 'cause I'm a programmer first.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.120]   Yeah, I just use a good editor.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.320]   Yeah. (laughing)
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.320]   Sue me.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.480]   I don't use a VIR e-max.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.080]   - I was gonna say VIR e-max.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:32.920]   I was gonna say.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.760]   (laughing)
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.000]   - No, I actually don't.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.840]   - Oh, she's on time tonight, yeah.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.000]   (laughing)
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.400]   - No, no, no, I'm not that bad.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.560]   I use like edit plus on Windows and text me on the Mac.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.640]   I mean, you know, just a good text editor.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.400]   - I like text make quite a bit, actually.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.880]   - Yeah, it's an excellent application.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.880]   - Well, Microsoft's Office 2010 live version
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.080]   goes in a beta next month.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.000]   We can talk about it once we've played with it a little bit.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.520]   Another thing that is now finally getting invitations
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.680]   are being sent out, 100,000 invitations going out
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:03.240]   to Google Wave didn't get mine.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.920]   Jeff, you got yours?
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.240]   - I'm not a developer, but I think it's hugely important.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.640]   And I've been arguing that Google Wave
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:13.280]   is not just the future of email communication.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.240]   It's the future of news.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.680]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.360]   See, I think it's, yeah, okay.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.240]   I think it represents the future of the web,
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.120]   which is real time.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.640]   So I think that one school wave comes out.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.000]   See, this is what people keep asking.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.440]   What's Google Wave going to do?
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.920]   And Google, what Google Wave is gonna do?
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.440]   And what's gonna be most important is now,
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.960]   is not how you're gonna use Google Wave specifically.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.280]   It's the expectations that people are gonna have
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.120]   around what happens online, right?
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.880]   And it's kinda like the way Gmail
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.840]   raised the expectations for what you can do with Ajax.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.640]   I think that Google Wave is just gonna make people
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.000]   expect to be able to chat live in any web page
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   and anywhere.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.920]   And I have a confession to make about Google Wave.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.640]   I made this big to do about how badly I wanted an account
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.960]   and begged everyone I knew, knew someone at Google
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.160]   and got my developer account a couple,
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.000]   I don't know, a month ago or so.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.280]   And I played with it and blew my mind
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.240]   the first couple of days.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.080]   I was freaked out, I couldn't sleep, it was awesome.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.280]   And then I haven't really gone back on.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.040]   And part of it is that most of my friends
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.680]   just don't have accounts, so I can do much--
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.520]   - I think that's the key.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.000]   Until we're all on it, you can't collaborate with yourself.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:19.840]   - Right, exactly.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:20.680]   I mean, I was literally--
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.400]   - It's like, you can only Twitter.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.000]   - Yeah, if you're the only tweeter.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:24.840]   - Right, exactly.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.800]   I mean, literally strangers on Wave would just come to you
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.520]   and say, "Hi, can we try this together?"
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:32.120]   And I literally just made this actually nice guy.
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.320]   Turned out to be a tech book author.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.280]   It was actually quite a good chat.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.200]   And this was socially acceptable in Wave now.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.640]   - Well, I could see us using it for this show, for instance.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.000]   It'd be fantastic.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.400]   But to agree with what you said, Jeff, not just internally,
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.920]   but as the starting point for a larger conversation
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.120]   with the audience.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:53.240]   - What hit me in that fabled hour and 20 minute
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.000]   great video introducing Wave with developers
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.200]   and plotting features was that when you can use this
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.120]   to produce content, to produce the web.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.400]   And that's the key thing.
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.520]   So if you look at a news event with multiple contributors,
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.560]   correcting each other, contributing to each other,
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.000]   asking questions, giving answers.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.960]   And that becomes the new focus of news.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:17.280]   I've been arguing for some time that the article
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.480]   is outmoded as the atomic unit of news.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.880]   You come to it once, that's it.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.680]   It's over.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.280]   In a Google world, you've got to have something
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.160]   that has ongoing additive value.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:31.280]   So it gets Google juice and more information as it goes on.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.440]   It's a combination of the process as you'd see in a blog,
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.440]   the kind of wiki snapshot of knowledge,
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.480]   curation through links, discussion.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.840]   And Wave brings all that together as a way to create content.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.440]   And I think that's going to be hugely important
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.120]   for the way we think of the web.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.680]   I'll give you a silly little example otherwise.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.760]   I've been using the tool Prezi.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.760]   If you haven't seen it in my--
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.240]   Prezi, although I had all my presentations
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.160]   on the last key cruise on Prezi,
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.760]   and it died 15 minutes before my presentation.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:01.120]   And I--
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.000]   Don't tell me that.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.960]   But I've got a big presentation coming up.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.280]   I saved everything locally.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.400]   But I can't figure out what the data file is.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.000]   I agree with you.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.960]   I think Prezi is amazing.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.680]   And it makes me rethink the web.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.840]   It's not about page, page, page.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.280]   It's about a space.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.680]   Yes, they consume and move.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.240]   And yes, I agree.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.720]   So rule wave, Prezi, these kinds of things
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:25.480]   are going to make us rethink content, including news,
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:29.040]   but not just news, at an atomic level.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.240]   If you go back to Meg Horahan, one of the co-founders
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.920]   of a blogger in the day, said that the new atomic unit of content
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:40.200]   was no longer for publication or the section or the page
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.480]   or the story, it was the post.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.880]   It was the thought.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:46.280]   And I think it was a very important thing back in 2003.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.400]   Boy, she thought of that before Twitter.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.200]   Exactly.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.200]   But now Google Wave comes along and tools like that
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.920]   that blow open our assumptions about what content is
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.480]   and how it's presented and how it's used
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.960]   and how we interact with it.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.120]   I think it's really exciting.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.440]   And I can't wait for people like Gina to invent stuff
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.760]   because I can't do it.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.080]   I know.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.080]   It makes you wish you were a programmer, doesn't it?
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.320]   Yeah, it really does.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:09.520]   Well--
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.200]   I'm an old dog.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.000]   Those are new tricks.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.400]   Now, Anil Dash has talked about kind of--
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.320]   well, what we're talking about is real time web,
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:22.480]   kind of the decomposition of information
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.120]   and kind of reflowing of information.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.400]   And Anil has talked about this, what
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.560]   he calls the push button web.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.800]   Yeah, that piece-- Anil wrote that great piece on dashes.com.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.280]   And Anil and I have actually been--
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.560]   he's a good friend of mine from New York.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.400]   And we've been talking for quite a while
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.480]   about this kind of stuff.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.000]   And what I really like about his point--
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.800]   and so he's calling the real time web a push button protocol,
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.480]   a push button web.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.400]   And what I like about his conception of that,
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.520]   he's basically saying the technologies
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:54.160]   to have real time updating web pages are all available
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.240]   and around us.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.600]   It's Ajax.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.120]   It's Ajax, right?
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.000]   So he talked about Pub/Sub/Hub/ub, which
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.120]   is actually a Google project.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:03.680]   But it's an open source Google project,
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.240]   and it's not Google specific.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.680]   So Wave is open source as well.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.320]   But with Wave, you have to install a Wave on a server
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.200]   somewhere to use it.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.960]   But with Pub/Sub/Hub/ub and the technologies
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.760]   that Anil was talking about, which is just RSS and Atom,
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.520]   which we're all very familiar with and web hooks,
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.880]   he's talking about ways that different websites can notify
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.840]   one another that they have changed without polling.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.200]   So this is the way it works now.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.680]   As you subscribe to an RSS feed and you constantly ask,
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.320]   has this updated?
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:33.960]   Has this updated?
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.480]   Has this updated?
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:39.800]   With Pub/Sub/Hub/ub, which kind of acts the way Wave is,
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:40.840]   it notifies.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.880]   So you subscribe to it and it notifies other sites.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.280]   Yes, this is updated.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.600]   And so what I'm a little more excited about the push button
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.080]   concept over Wave is because--
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.800]   and this is-- and I'm totally quoting Brad Fitzpatrick
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.520]   and the other developers at Pub/Sub/Hub/ub
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.520]   is that it bootstraps the current web.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:56.520]   So when feeds came out--
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.040]   You're not throwing everything out.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:58.840]   And so you've got to--
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:48:59.840]   Sorry, you're not throwing everything out
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.800]   and saying you have to use this bit of JavaScript
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:03.520]   to enable Wave.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.160]   And you have to have this Wave server.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.760]   You can add a little extra line to your RSS feed.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.480]   Literally, it's an attribute in your Atom or RSS feed that
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.680]   says, hey, here's my hub.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.920]   And then things update real times.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.280]   And you do a post and Google Reader shows your update right
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:18.480]   away.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.960]   I just actually set it up on my blog this week.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.400]   So this is so I'm kind of interested to see how the push
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.680]   button stuff happens amongst independent developers
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.560]   as Wave happens.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.160]   Are using a feed burner as your intermediary?
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:33.840]   Yes, I am.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.200]   So that's how you're doing it.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:35.880]   That's how I'm doing it.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.360]   Yes, because they do the ping for you, basically.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:39.720]   They do the ping.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:41.840]   Feed burner handles all that for you.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.000]   So I just updated it.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.080]   It's not on by default.
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.760]   And I'm actually still testing it to see how well it works.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.480]   So the idea is if I subscribe to your hub instead
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:56.480]   of your RSS feed, I don't have to go out and pull it.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.680]   As we do with the feed reader, I just get--
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.080]   it just happens because the hub is saying, I got new stuff.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.120]   Yeah, it's event driven.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:03.840]   It's event driven.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.520]   So I publish and the hub then pings you and says, hey,
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.920]   here's the new stuff.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.760]   So it's much less resource intensive.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.040]   It saves you bandwidth.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.440]   It saves me CPU.
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.440]   And everybody gets stuff immediately.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.080]   So this is the thing with Google readers.
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.520]   There can be a delay for how long feeds update depends
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.080]   on what their polling mechanism is.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.440]   And their polling mechanism is pretty good.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.320]   And actually, we have bookmarked the Net Newswire
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.920]   and Google Reader story.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:29.760]   There's another story.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.440]   Yeah, Net Newswire is kind of--
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.240]   I give up.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.520]   We give up.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.360]   But what are the reasons to use a desktop news writer?
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.400]   It's to use authenticated feeds at number one.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.640]   And number two, it's the ability to hit the refresh button
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.880]   and know that you have exactly what
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.760]   is in every single feed at that moment
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.240]   versus what Google Reader has.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.840]   Gene, does this go to Dave Weiner's
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.240]   been talking about the last week or so about the kind
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.960]   of Twitter and the cloud?
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.920]   Yeah, the RSS cloud is--
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.080]   one who's also a Weiner project.
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.080]   Yes, exactly.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.840]   The notion of constant updates anywhere
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.360]   almost takes Twitter as an architectural point
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.040]   across the web.
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.120]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:08.280]   Yes, yes.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.000]   Fascinating.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   And it's something I've been talking about also
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.560]   for a long time because as a content creator,
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.160]   I want everything to be real time.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.480]   I don't-- well, same with you, Gene, with your blog.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.360]   We want it to be a conversation.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.440]   We don't want it to be a monologue.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.120]   We want it to be two-way.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:28.800]   And also in journalism, what I hope for
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.200]   is that when I make a correction,
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.240]   people who link to me should get an update and say, oh, it's
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.080]   wrong.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.120]   And that's the way more reliable.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.000]   Right.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.440]   The whole notion of a correction layer across the web
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:44.040]   can be implemented with this kind of live update.
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:46.440]   That's a very exciting time as we live in.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.440]   Yes.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.760]   This is going to be such a fun show to do because I
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.840]   think this is going to be the show where we're really talking
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:55.200]   about the stuff that's really changing in the world.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.520]   And not just Google, the cloud, everything
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:02.400]   that is happening here-- Pub/Sub, Hubbub, and more.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.400]   I feel lucky to be alive right now.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.160]   I do too.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.200]   I feel like we're watching--
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.240]   The second childhood for region.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.760]   And me too, Jeff.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:13.800]   I mean, as old media guys, so many people in the old media
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.880]   are kind of watching the ship sail.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.600]   And as I said, I've got a foot on the ship
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:18.440]   and a foot on the dock.
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.240]   But at least I got a foot on the ship.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.400]   You're from the ship.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.720]   You're on the ship.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.840]   And it's very exciting for people who love media, who
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:30.080]   participate in media, to see this be reinvented right
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.440]   before our very eyes.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.640]   And because stuff happens so fast nowadays,
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.840]   Gutenberg might have invented movable type.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.280]   But it was long after he was gone before the real power
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.840]   of printing materialized.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.080]   We're seeing this happen almost in real time.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.280]   I recommend highly Clay Shurkey's essay,
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.560]   Thinking the Unthinkable About Newspapers.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.720]   And he really draws--
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.280]   He does the best job I've seen.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.520]   Clay's brilliant at arguing that we are really truly now
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.320]   on the Gutenberg age 570 years later.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.520]   That's how fundamental things--
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.360]   It just took a little while.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.240]   Hey, I'd love to get Clay on the show.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:04.680]   I don't know if--
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.400]   You'd be fantastic.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.000]   Can I go through you, Jeff, and see if we can get
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:08.920]   Clay on the show?
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.000]   And Seva Vadnathian has a book coming out
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.400]   called The Googleization of Everything.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.320]   And he and I disagree in fun ways.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:15.600]   He can be great to have on the show, too.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.720]   I think we're going to have no dearth of wonderful guests
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:19.560]   for this show.
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:20.880]   But I love our core group.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.600]   And Gina Tripana, you're fantastic.
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.720]   It's so great to get a show.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.360]   Finally, with you on the air.
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:27.200]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:27.720]   Thank you.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.200]   It's fun.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.160]   Smarterware.org is the best place
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:33.200]   to go to find out more about what Gina's up to these days.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.240]   And we're going to see you every Saturday here on the show.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.640]   I'm really glad you're here.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:41.160]   Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com, the author of What Would
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.280]   Google Do?
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:46.240]   And don't forget the Guardian podcast, too, Media Talk USA.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.200]   It's for the blog.
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.320]   Would you get at guardian.co.uk, or just search for it on our
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:51.320]   blog.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.880]   / MediaTalkUSA.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:55.080]   There you go.
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:56.480]   It's really great to have you both.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.880]   I thank everybody for watching.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:01.880]   If you do want to watch live, we do it 6 p.m. Eastern, 3 p.m.
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.120]   Pacific every Saturday at live.twit.tv.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:08.400]   And while this is not yet a podcast, because first we have
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.080]   to edit it and post it, it will be in the next couple of
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.920]   days on iTunes.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:16.080]   And you can look for Twig on iTunes or on the Zoom store.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.200]   Or just look in the Twit.tv Artist page.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.080]   It'll be our newest podcast there.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.480]   And we hope you'll come back next Saturday and every week
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.640]   for this week in Google.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.840]   Thanks, everybody.

[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.140]   (upbeat music)
