[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Aaron Newcomb joins the regular crew as we talk about the latest from Google.

[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.960]   We'll take a look at a new Qi charger that works pretty darn well.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.400]   And some new additions to Google Glass that make it even cooler. Stay tuned this week in Google is next.

[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.480]   Ladies and gentlemen I give you Gina Trapani, founding editor at LifeHacker.com.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.840]   She blogs at Smarterware and is a principal at ThinkUp.com.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.640]   Where they are currently on a tear raising money for the big launch of their managed think up.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.440]   You've got $1,177 backers three days left.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.720]   Three days left. Got to get to $2,000 by November 15th if you want a free year of
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.920]   think up to give to a friend. Come on! Come on!
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.840]   You didn't get a late bird special.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.720]   Get on in that late bird special.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.440]   Also with us.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.720]   I'm really happy with where we're at.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.600]   Yeah you're doing great.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.120]   Hey you made your thousand.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.160]   That's the key.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.480]   We did.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.360]   We did.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.600]   Also joining us of course is always from the City University of New York.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.040]   He's a professor of journalism there.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.880]   Are you do you have a chair?
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.200]   No I don't have a chair.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.680]   Well let's endow a chair for Jeff.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.080]   I like that idea because three million bucks.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.440]   Three million for a chair.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.480]   How long does that last?
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.840]   Well it's just if you just pay off as it goes.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.320]   It's not a year or anything.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.760]   Then I could say I'm the professor, the Twitter professor of journalism.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.280]   I like it.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.760]   That's nice.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.240]   I like it.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.400]   And now the Twitter professor of journalism at the City of New York.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.760]   Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis author of What Will Google Do?
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.600]   Which is on I just noticed.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.200]   I didn't know enough problems on Twitter.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.160]   My favorite moment of the day was when Farhad Manju came onto Twitter and said
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.640]   I really need something to do my shopping list and this and that.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.080]   I said to do text and he came back from his letter and he said
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.240]   perfect just what I wanted.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.640]   Awesome.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.360]   Nice.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.320]   That is in the mail.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.480]   Thank you.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.840]   A little log roll of inside the twig staff here.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.840]   We're loyal to each other.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.720]   That's awesome.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.080]   You could also find Jeff at Buzzmachine.com.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.520]   That's where he blogs.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.040]   And joining us now from NetApp, a regular at Floss Weekly and all about Android.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.400]   Mr. Newcomb who is going to perform a feat of
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.240]   ledger domain during this show.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.720]   That's right.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.120]   I am.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.680]   So after my last appearance, whenever that was a few weeks ago, a lot of people contacted me
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.840]   and said hey, I noticed you mentioned on your Galaxy S4 you're running Google Edition and not
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.320]   TouchWiz.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.960]   How do you do it?
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.960]   Did you buy it from Google?
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.400]   No, I did not.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.960]   Yes, no.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.960]   Yes, no.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.840]   This is a AT&T from the AT&T store.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.200]   Looking with TouchWiz.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.600]   Rooted it, loaded recovery mod, loaded the Google Edition or there's a couple different names for it,
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.880]   but I call it the Google Edition ROM.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.880]   And they're selling them out there.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.880]   There's so many extracted it from the Google phone.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.840]   There's several of them out there, right?
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.240]   So this happened to be version 4.3, but since 4.4 came out, I thought during the show,
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.680]   what I would do is take my phone and see if I could get 4.4 running while we're discussing stories
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.080]   and everything else.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.040]   This never works for me, but I'm going to do it anyway.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.600]   Live demos, don't work.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.000]   Is there a chance you'll brick your S4?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.280]   There is a good chance of that, yes.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.760]   Oh, no.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.240]   How exciting.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.240]   So, yes, a little bit of surprise.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.000]   So they've pushed out 4.4 for the Google Edition S4?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.960]   I don't believe so, not yet.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.400]   And they have it for your HTC One.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.960]   I know Gina's uses a Google Edition HTC One.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.440]   Yes.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.520]   They're supposed to put it out for the Nexus 7, but they haven't.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.160]   I know.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.120]   And I'm supposed to, supposedly they said in a few weeks for the Moto X haven't seen it either.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.960]   Yeah, I haven't gotten it yet.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.360]   I thought it was November 15th.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.640]   Ah, well, that's a couple of days.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.040]   You got a little...
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.320]   Yeah, so I still got a couple days.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.440]   System is up to date.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.120]   Up to date, so.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.840]   So where does the 4.4 GE come from?
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.760]   So this is AOSP, Android OS.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.320]   Oh, awesome.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.440]   And so what happens is the lovely hackers over at XDA developers take AOSP and reformat it to work
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.880]   on a particular device, in this case, the Galaxy S4 from AT&T.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.120]   So I just saw a ROM pop up there today.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.240]   I've been waiting with BetaBreath.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.640]   I check every day to see if 4.4 is there.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.360]   So how do you do it?
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.920]   You download the ROM from the site.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.080]   You put it in a place you could find it.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.560]   Right.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.760]   And now you're going to boot into recovery mode and install it.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.960]   Right, so you have to be rooted.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.720]   So root and then load recovery.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.840]   That's the critical steps.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.120]   That's where most people brick their phones
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.680]   because there's some things you can do to brick your phone during that process.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.360]   The root software now is pretty sophisticated,
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.240]   but one thing I would warn people is to make sure you have the root for the right.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.400]   There's S4s and there's S4s.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.880]   Absolutely.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.920]   There's four different forums over on XDA developers for S4s.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.160]   Right.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.120]   So for the different team mobile.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.680]   I can't for instance, I have the international Exynos version.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.520]   Yours is a Snapdragon version.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.800]   The Exynos version is virtually unhackable, unfortunately.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.200]   Right, because of the they've got a locked server.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.680]   And it's also a Samsung processor.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.960]   And they never publish source code.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.480]   So my international S4, I'm stuck with and I can't even update it anymore
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.680]   because I've triangled it too many times.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.360]   So I'm stuck.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.000]   But this is safe to do on an AT&T Sprint T-Mobile or Verizon S4.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.720]   If you get the right--
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.880]   If you get the right thing now, what I always tell people to do,
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.080]   and this is what I've been telling people for the past couple of weeks since I was on last,
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.560]   is go to XDA developers, go to the forums and look for your model phone
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.800]   and you can find out what's possible and what's not.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.080]   So start there, see what other people are saying, read the reviews.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.720]   I got it to work.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.520]   I didn't get it to work.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.800]   I bricked my phone.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.880]   Look for that kind of stuff and then go from there.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.880]   And the instruction should be pretty straightforward for anybody probably watching this show
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.160]   that's relatively tech savvy.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.840]   You should be able to do it.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.920]   But follow the instructions, read the reviews first,
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.680]   make sure that it's going to work the way you want.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.720]   You'll see if you go to xda-developers.com, they have a device search.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.280]   But you'll see if you enter Galaxy S4 that there's more than one Galaxy S4.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.760]   That's right.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.440]   Actually, I did the wrong search it looks like.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.960]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.120]   Oh, these are articles, not devices.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.880]   Yeah, if you go to forums.xda.com--
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.240]   It says, this always says find your device in the forums and have yet to have it work.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.440]   So let's not--
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.880]   Oh, maybe I'm supposed to enter it there.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.840]   That's probably where I'm supposed to.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.240]   So forum.xda-developers.com.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.720]   Right.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.280]   You could have-- also, you could have a mini, you could have an active--
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.000]   you could have eight different carriers.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.160]   So it's good if you can find the carrier that--
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.560]   you could get the number that goes with your carrier.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.760]   There's 9505.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.880]   Which one do you have the nine?
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.320]   This is the--
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.880]   I have a 9500.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.120]   This is the 1337, I think it is.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.760]   Or--
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.120]   The 9500 is the international--
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.120]   It is--
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.080]   You have late.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.360]   The 9500 is the international version.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.080]   Five, I would guess.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.080]   Let me just chat.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.080]   I'm having trouble with the search or something going on here.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.280]   Yeah, I know. The website's kind of--
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.560]   It's kind of a long C.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.040]   Long C-ly.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.280]   Anyway, you'll find it all here.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:11.760]   I will find it.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.800]   So I'm going to do this right now.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.280]   There's stuff--
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:13.920]   You never will see how this is.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.960]   It's like network TV.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.880]   This last three minutes.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.280]   It's--
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.880]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.840]   It's all wonky.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.040]   Well, they would edit that out of network television.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.400]   Yes, they would.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.520]   So, OK.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.360]   So can you-- you have an over-the-shoulder shot for Aaron's phone so we can see what's going on?
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:29.600]   All right.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.480]   So are we in--
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:30.720]   OK.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.120]   We're in--
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.840]   We're down.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.440]   So this is 4.3.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.120]   So this is Google Edition that I'm running.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.240]   I've been running for forever.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.520]   It has great battery life.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.080]   I'm on 4.3, but I want to go to 4.4.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.320]   So while we're talking about the stories,
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.880]   I'll go ahead and load the ROM and we'll see what happens.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.680]   All right.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.320]   You want to--
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:46.960]   Just just show it.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.560]   You want to go walk through it?
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.320]   Well, have you already downloaded it?
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:50.880]   I have not.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.680]   So I've got to download--
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.920]   Well, show us that process first.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.160]   Because you're going to use a browser to download it, right?
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.400]   Right.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.760]   So I actually did that already.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.640]   So you have the file on your SD card.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:00.960]   Right.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.800]   This particular ROM is called Gummy.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.120]   I don't know.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.080]   You probably can't see that there.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.640]   It's called Gummy is the name of this.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.920]   And it's supposed to be 4.4.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.400]   OK.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.600]   We've got screenshots and everything.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.360]   So I've downloaded that already.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.320]   And what I'll do is I'll show you how the process starts.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.440]   Who did the recovery mode, right?
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:15.840]   Exactly.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.400]   All right.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.080]   And then we can go from there.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.280]   So I'm going to hold down power until the power off comes up.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.160]   So you're turning it off.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:22.880]   Turning it off.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.640]   It says yes.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.360]   You're going to turn it off.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.960]   And every device is a little different in the buttons
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.120]   that you have to press to get it to go into recovery.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.680]   For this particular device, you hit power.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.240]   I believe it's volume up and the little,
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.160]   whatever this button is, the home button, all at the same time.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.120]   Is it up or down?
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.240]   Volume up power?
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:42.880]   Up.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.320]   Up is recovery down is--
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.960]   Down is that fast boot.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.600]   Fast boot.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.360]   So you can see we have a custom ROM on there.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:51.600]   Right.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.000]   It says go.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.320]   Custom ROM.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.240]   And you notice there was a little thing in the corner saying--
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.960]   There you go.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.440]   There was a--
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.000]   So this is--
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.880]   This is recovery mode.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.400]   This is recovery mode here.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.800]   And so what you can do from here is you go down.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.680]   There's lots of different things.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.800]   The one you want to do,
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.280]   which I'm not going to do right now because I need to download one more thing,
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.440]   is install zip from SD card.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:07.520]   OK.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.520]   And then when you go in there, it's going to say choose a zip.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:09.920]   We've got it.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.280]   Let's come back and we'll do that.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:11.600]   OK.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.240]   So let me know.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.760]   We'll just interrupt and we'll say,
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.080]   all right, he has downloaded all the files he needs.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.200]   And that makes us about ready to--
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.200]   We're just like, we were ready to come back to Houdini
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.360]   as he tries to get out of the case dangling over New York.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.960]   So again, just to recap,
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.800]   you need to have a rooted phone to do this.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.360]   Root phone.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.200]   So look on XDA developers for how to root exactly your specific model.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.400]   It can be a little tricky.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.120]   Yep.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.000]   Once you've got it rooted, you will also, in the process of rooting,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.600]   you'll be installing a super user program,
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.240]   but also generally recovery.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.520]   You need a custom recovery.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.960]   There is a-- there is a program in your phone called Recovery.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.440]   And what that obviously allows you to do is go in and load new versions.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.120]   It's what the phone uses to upload when you get one of those,
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.000]   you know, big downloads over the year downloads.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.880]   Typically, it uses recovery to load that new version
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.480]   of the operating system onto your phone.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.120]   Custom recovery lets you do things like actually browse your device
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.400]   for the actual files you want to install and kind of overcome
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.400]   some of the limitations that you have in the stock recovery application.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.440]   And I use clockwork mods, recovery.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.400]   Clockwork mod is great.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:16.960]   That's very popular.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.000]   What does the other one, Torp?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.440]   Yes.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.160]   There's another one, TWWP, I think it's called,
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.880]   which works very well as also.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.200]   Is it relevant that there's now a cyanogen mod launcher in the Play Store?
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.600]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.040]   It's a long-- it might be the Google launcher.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.520]   It requires a tether to a Windows machine, so I can't use it.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.600]   Yeah, it's a way to install cyanogen mod.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.400]   You need the Windows installer, you need to connect your--
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.480]   you know, you connect your device to your Windows machine
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.600]   and then run this installer.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.840]   It does help you install cyanogen.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.560]   But it's pretty cool that in the Google Store,
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.000]   you can find a way to get rid of the--
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.880]   Yeah, they could ban that.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.800]   It's certainly Applewood, right?
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.000]   Yeah, Applewood, absolutely.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.080]   Is that it?
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.040]   I don't know if-- there it is.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.760]   One click installer for your Android phone.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.400]   That's cool.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.120]   There you go.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.200]   I got excited that I saw it at a Windows machine.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.800]   Yeah, there's a lot-- I mean, not to--
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.040]   I think it's great, but there's just--
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.040]   there's a lot of conditions here, requirements.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.440]   One being that you need a Windows machine
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.040]   and you have to download the desktop client
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.520]   and then connect your phone via that and all that.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.440]   I think one reason that Google doesn't worry
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.600]   about this too much is the level of sophistication
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.040]   required to do this is sufficiently high of a barrier
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.560]   to keep people who might just want to mess around
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.560]   and then come cry into them for help away.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.560]   I mean, really, you have to be a little bit sophisticated
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.840]   to even root it.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.880]   But once you've rooted it,
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.520]   then you probably won't install clock
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.040]   where Mod's ROM manager and it becomes very easy.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.640]   Now, this is not available in ROM manager,
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.600]   so you can write down loads of--
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:51.600]   Correct.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.560]   Yeah, this is a different ROM.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.600]   And it's-- I haven't seen clockwork or--
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.040]   or Sanogen mods ROM that includes any of the 4.4 stuff yet.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.160]   So they're still working on that.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.400]   Oh, let's cheer everybody out.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.080]   Are you ready for the heartwarming Google video of the week?
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.640]   This could be a new feature.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.240]   It's a little long, it's three minutes,
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.280]   but it's really very good.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.520]   Well, we'll do this while Aaron's downloading the latest.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.240]   Oh, that's good.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.640]   Ah, this looks like Istanbul.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.200]   Yee-yee.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.160]   Where is this?
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.200]   Yee-yee, you're so--
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:21.920]   It is.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.800]   It's a little bit easier.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.760]   It's easier.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:29.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.320]   Okay.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.600]   For those of you just tuning in.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.040]   There's an old guy talking to a young girl.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.840]   In another language.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.080]   Is there-- are there subtitles?
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.200]   Nope.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.960]   No, you couldn't do that, but you don't need to.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.360]   All right.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.120]   You kind of get the idea.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.320]   He was showing her a picture of olden times.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.400]   And she's now contemplating--
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.000]   She's looking at that picture of two boys.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.840]   Probably grandpa is a kid.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.560]   She's searching for--
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.760]   She's down to guess what?
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.160]   Park with ancient gate and lahore.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.720]   Oh, she found the mochi gate.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:03.760]   What is--
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.880]   Nice music.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.080]   Jar Jaraya.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.200]   Oh, corn, milk, and ghee delicacy.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.040]   Oldest sweet shop near mochi gate.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.640]   La Zal sweet's.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:14.880]   Wow.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.120]   She's really narrowing it down.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.200]   She's found a candy store.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.240]   Niele the gate.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.560]   I mean, she had the two boys,
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.160]   I guess, in front of that candy store, right?
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.640]   Fuzzled sweet.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.640]   She's calling the sweet store.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.200]   Fortunately, the guy who answered the phone is really cute.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.200]   (laughing)
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.600]   This is getting ready for a sequel.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.480]   There's already discussion.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.080]   And now there's an older--
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.080]   I am your long-lost daughter.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.560]   Get me a million dollars.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.240]   You know it was firm banks, some time in banks.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.520]   What is this?
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.720]   What is going on here?
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.480]   Am I supposed to understand what's going on?
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.480]   I'm telling you, it's gotta pay off.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.920]   He's looking at the phone, how's she?
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.000]   She's smiling and breathing deeply.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.840]   Now he's looking at the boy,
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.920]   the boy in his pocket, has a phone.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.400]   (laughing)
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.400]   Indian visa requirements.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.400]   'Cause the other guy's in Pakistan.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.600]   Ah.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.720]   The horror's being impacted.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.600]   Right.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:28.880]   (laughing)
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.240]   It's thinking I'm crazy right now.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.880]   Yeah, I look like a shot for putting this in the window.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.720]   That dude?
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.840]   Somebody says in the chair,
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.640]   this is the plot for nearly all Bollywood music books,
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.680]   by the way.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.320]   Ah, okay.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.760]   (laughing)
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.800]   You might as googled.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.240]   Leather and jelly.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.200]   He sees it's gonna rain, so he puts an umbrella in the bag.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.720]   Okay, very important.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.920]   Grandpa and the grandson now slowly walk off the screen.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.520]   And then drive it for a slow taxi.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.600]   It's really Indian cat taxis.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.400]   Yes.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.160]   I love those cats.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.680]   Look at her flight to Pakistan.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.160]   She looked up the flight, yes.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.000]   Dinged on, here's the payoff.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.760]   Angie?
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.640]   Oh.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.440]   She flew his own.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:13.760]   She flew his own.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.440]   She's two friends who haven't seen each other
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.200]   for decades since partition.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.240]   You've heard the other.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.720]   Now see each other brought together by Google.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.280]   Ah, and the cute girl and the cute boy.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.400]   Who have the cat?
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:24.720]   And the cute boy or the other.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.440]   That's the sequel.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.960]   (laughing)
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.800]   A little chemistry, I'm just saying.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.840]   Oh yeah, look at that look.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.040]   Oh, that's pretty sweet.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.000]   That is very sweet.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.200]   Okay, okay.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.120]   Ah, and those actors, by the way,
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.560]   you may recognize them from...
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:45.600]   Wow.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.200]   Do you think that's real?
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.040]   No.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.000]   Does it matter?
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.800]   It was a matter of...
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.760]   I thought it was touching.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.560]   Were you not touched?
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.120]   Were you so close?
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.920]   No, it's beautiful.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.440]   Your heart was not touched at all.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:55.840]   It's beautiful.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.440]   It's filled up a bit.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.480]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.200]   I wonder if that was inspired by that other story
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.280]   about that kid who got on the train.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.880]   Remember we did that one last time I was here?
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.440]   Right.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:05.840]   Yeah, we did that.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.560]   That was...
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.840]   We saved those for you, Aaron.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.560]   Oh, thank you.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.760]   It makes me want to go back to India.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.120]   I'm dying to go back to India.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:11.760]   Wow, that's neat.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.040]   No, I think that's really neat.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.440]   Is it intended probably not for the American market?
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.000]   Probably not, but you don't really need to get the language to...
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.480]   No.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.360]   Oh, I was there when it's a little bit of a mystery.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.640]   Yes, it's...
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.800]   Speaking of mysteries...
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.080]   Why did drivers put that in the rundown?
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.040]   No, the mystery is revealed.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.000]   The Google barge...
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:42.640]   is a party boat with sails that are designed to look like the fins of a fish.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.320]   Now I think they're just playing with us.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:52.320]   When completed, the barge is supposed to be,
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.640]   quote, "an unprecedented artistic structure sporting a dozen or so
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.880]   giant sails to be moored for a month at a time at sites around the bay."
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:08.560]   The 50-foot tall, 250-foot-long structure made of recycled shipping containers
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.120]   will stand out.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.080]   [laughter]
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:22.320]   By and large, LLC, the company that is submitting the approval documents refers to the vessel as
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.920]   a studio and temporary technology exhibit space.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.720]   Its goal is to drive visitation to the waterfront.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:35.200]   It will be for local organizations to engage with guests and gain visibility in a unique way.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.360]   So it's not just Google maybe that'll be using it.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:39.840]   I don't know.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.480]   Party boat.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.560]   It is a Google party boat.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.880]   They expected to draw a thousand visitors a day as it sails from spot to spot
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.080]   around the bay.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.600]   Pier 30 for Mason Angel Island, Redwood City,
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.480]   Rosie the Riveter, Historical National Park Enrichment.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.640]   You know we'll be fighting for invitations for that.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.040]   Oh yeah.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.680]   I just want to point out that you're reading this off the Walt Disney Museum website.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.920]   No, no, this is the San Francisco Gate.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.400]   Oh, there's a big ad for the Walt Disney Museum.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.280]   Oh, I see.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.160]   I was like, why are you scrolled up and I could see Walt Disney?
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:12.560]   Walt Disney.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.040]   Mickey Mouse.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:13.600]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.080]   That's a hat.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.080]   It would be imaginary in such a barge, yes.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:16.720]   But yeah.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.280]   Well, but you know it's kind of fortuitous because this is the kind of a crazy idea maybe
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.760]   Uncle Walt might have had in his day.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.920]   But no, this is material.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.200]   I want Google World.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.480]   I want Google World.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.440]   Ooh, the world.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.120]   Wait, who made that by and large?
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.760]   Is that what you just said?
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.600]   By and large, LLC.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.120]   I think I have a commercial from them.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:35.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.400]   Let's get ready.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.600]   [MUSIC]
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:48.000]   For anyone who watched Wally, this by and large was the corporation that destroyed the world.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.920]   Destroyed the world.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.960]   Because you got to buy it large.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.280]   Good.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.480]   Good reference.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:54.720]   Okay.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.720]   That means for sure it's Google, right?
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.720]   Because it's a phony name, a funny name that geeks would get.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.000]   It's an interesting idea.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:10.080]   It's from Gensler, which is a well-known San Francisco architectural firm.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.160]   Of course, now I want one in New York.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:12.560]   What do we?
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.000]   Chicken, Liva, Google.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.360]   Chicken, Liva.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.040]   There's one in Maine.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.680]   Isn't that close to New York?
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.600]   Isn't that next to New York?
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.760]   It's right up there in the map over on the other side there.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.640]   It's the same place, isn't it?
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.040]   Maine, New York, New Jersey.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:29.520]   Amazing Canada.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.320]   Anyway, you know, the mystery continues.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.600]   I'm sure you guys talked about this last week, but there is a tie in to Larry's.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.600]   Spanning range of consumer solutions.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.240]   Fred Willard.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.760]   It wasn't all was the unparalleled provider of convenience it is today.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:53.760]   Why in large got its start as a macro frozen yogurt and it acquired large industries,
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.840]   which seemed like a natural fit.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.960]   The newly combined corporate energy of by and large was formed and never stopped
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.680]   expanding its efforts to make your world easier, more comfortable and pleasant.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.120]   And that voice is what's his name?
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:07.600]   Fred Willard.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   It's Fred Willard.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.080]   It's the only CRP.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.880]   The commitment to the consumer will never fade.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.560]   With over two million sales.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.040]   Yeah, he was only sales.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:13.360]   He was the only sales.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.280]   He's government of bodies and health care.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:15.680]   Was he?
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.960]   Was he on WK?
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.720]   I thought he was the sales guy for WKRP.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.600]   One who was always hitting on maybe, I don't know.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.320]   So it's not by and large.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.480]   It's by and large, but you can't get large by and large.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.680]   Uh, righty.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.320]   Enough of that.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.120]   So this is just going to be an exhibit space, basically.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.320]   For Google to show off.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.320]   And it may be very loosely tied to Google.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:47.200]   You know, when I visited Microsoft campus years ago now, and they have this thing called the
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.560]   home of the future, it's basically this, you know, just exhibit.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.440]   It's a home, but it's a smart home and you walk through and you get to see, you know,
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.600]   what it would be like if you're a refrigerator, new what ingredients you had, and, you know,
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.080]   if your door recognized your face when you walked in or whatever.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:00.880]   And that was cool.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.960]   I mean, you know, we did a tour and it was a cool thing.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:07.600]   And I think like for a company with Google, like Google, that's, that's dealing with sort of the
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.920]   social impact of weird new technology, like, you know, glass on your head.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.960]   It makes sense for them to set up these sorts of like public exhibit spaces where it's like,
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.120]   look at, you know, the Jetsons kind of visit.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.440]   I would love to go to Google and I want to go.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:21.440]   I want to go.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.160]   Just part of it.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:22.640]   I want to go.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.200]   They could do Epcot, the city of the future.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.560]   Wouldn't you want to see Google's?
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.680]   Wouldn't you want to see Google Live?
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.320]   If they set up Google Island for real, I know there are a lot of jokes about it after
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.840]   we talked about it at Google I/O.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.920]   I go to Google Island in a second.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.560]   Come on.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.080]   I'll paddle there.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.520]   That's what I thought the tie in was.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.160]   That's what I was going to say.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.680]   I thought the tie in was with a Google Island.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.840]   Ooh, everyone goes and everyone's innovative.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.120]   Larry Page's vision of a place where no one sues Google.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:49.760]   You talk.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.720]   Get on the bar.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.840]   Get on the island.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.640]   And we're going to untether the barge.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.240]   We're going to take it off the street.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.360]   It's passage to the island.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.880]   I think that that's their grand flight.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.880]   Uh, you saw Pinocchio.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.880]   You know, don't fall for these.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.600]   Come on.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.560]   You go to the island.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.680]   You get there.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.520]   There's lots of cotton candy.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.800]   You feel a little queasy.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.920]   You never know what could happen.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.360]   Now I'm thinking about the Leonardo Caprio movie, The Beach.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.000]   The Beach.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.640]   Exactly.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.560]   Exactly.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.680]   That's how it all begins.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.720]   Come to my island.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.840]   And then suddenly people are killing you in the jungle.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.800]   Exactly.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   Oh, it was Frank Boner.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.920]   Boner.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.480]   Boner.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:26.960]   Excuse me.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.560]   Oh, there is literally the chore mark on the show.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.240]   There's something you can't--
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.120]   There's nothing you can't go on the internet and search for.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:42.400]   There is literally a Wiki answers page that answers the question.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.680]   Was Fred Willard on WKRP and Cincinnati?
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.800]   The answer is no.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:52.400]   I can't believe the internet has a page dedicated to that.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.160]   I must not be the only one.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:54.560]   Maybe.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.360]   Who gets confused?
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.560]   That's proof of that.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.240]   I am the only one.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.600]   The only one for you specifically.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.880]   And I'm going to say did we answer your question?
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.760]   Yes, you did.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.960]   You answered my question.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.560]   And did you know where WKRP and Cincinnati was filmed?
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.040]   It says right here Cincinnati.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:13.920]   Oh, really?
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.960]   Wow.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.560]   Oh, the internet.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.080]   What would we ever do with that?
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:26.000]   Google files for a patent for a neck tattoo with a microphone built in.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.200]   This is why I think they're gaming us.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.800]   I think at some point they're just going to come and laugh.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.640]   You're wearing these silly glasses.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.240]   You can't wait to get on the barge and you believe this tattoo thing.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.800]   I'd prefer this to go ass.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.080]   You're a stupider than us.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.920]   I think of this as better than glasses.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.640]   It's not permanent.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.200]   It's a temporary tattoo.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.120]   It allows you to communicate with somebody without using your phone directly.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.040]   Google suggests the electronic tattoo could be used by security personnel.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.480]   You know, instead of putting their hand to their ear or talking into their sleeve.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.440]   Or as a lie detector.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.200]   Optionally, the electronic skin tattoo 200.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.960]   They call it the electronic skin tattoo 200.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.720]   This is not now.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:12.480]   Can further include a galvanic skin response detected.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.000]   It detects skin resistance of a user.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.960]   It's contemplated a user might be nervous or engaged in speaking
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.600]   falsehoods.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.040]   Oh my god.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.760]   They could be used as a lie detector.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.000]   Holy cow.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.080]   This is something for April Fool's Day.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:26.800]   It's a joke.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.680]   It's got to be a joke.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.240]   Yeah, it's got to be.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.400]   Although it's hilarious though.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.240]   I mean, it's practical.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.040]   Not too far fast, right?
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.400]   I mean, that's what makes good.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.040]   Oh, is there a patent number or search on the patent number?
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.360]   It is.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.280]   That was we were looking at the actual patent.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.520]   Oh, you're saying that the patent number may be a giveaway.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.160]   Now search the patent search service to see whether that patent.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.520]   No, he's at the USPTO.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.160]   That's from the USPTO.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.440]   You are at USPTO?
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.000]   Yes.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.640]   Coupling electronic skin patent.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.440]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.040]   November 7th, 2013.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.080]   But that doesn't mean I think company's patent stuff all the time.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.880]   That's a real US patent, buddy boy.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.280]   That's no April Fool's joke.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.440]   What's the name on that patent?
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.040]   If it's slurp aloof, then we know.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.640]   It's Alberth, J.R.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:19.200]   Coupling an electronic skin tattoo to a mobile communication device.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.040]   By William P. Alberth Jr.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.960]   Yeah, by Mo Rohe, Illinois.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.640]   Oh, it's a Motorola mobility patent.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:32.080]   So is this the application for a patent or is this the patent or were they awarded the patent?
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.320]   Is this the actual patent?
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.520]   Ah, I don't know.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.880]   I think they were awarded a patent.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.800]   No, it's the application.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.880]   It's a publication of the application.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.840]   In case somebody else has invented this, they can contest it.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.600]   I wouldn't admit it if I were you.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.880]   Google has broken ground.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.920]   Oh, he's no longer.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.240]   William Alberth was VP and CTO, Mobile Devices at Motorola.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.360]   He's no longer there.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.360]   He is now president and founder of Innovations Technologies Consulting Inc.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.880]   So this was, who knows what this was?
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.680]   You know, that's just like Steve Jobs has patents.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.480]   You put the, you know, that's how you make nice to the president.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:13.600]   Hey, put the patent, put the guy's name on the patent.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:22.560]   Google will break ground on January on their private aviation terminal, an $82 million jet
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.120]   center at San Jose International Airport.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.200]   This is where the Google airplanes will be stored.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.600]   270,000 square feet of hanger space, 29 acres.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.840]   It is big, but then Google has a lot of planes.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:43.120]   And I guess others will be allowed to use it as well.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.320]   $2.6 million a month in rent.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.400]   Is that right?
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.200]   Can that be right?
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.080]   Gee, many.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:55.360]   They were, they weren't destroying their planes at, at,
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.600]   NASA, NASA, and then I guess,
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.160]   they got, they got kicked out.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.720]   There are.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.280]   Is this common for regular airports to have hanger,
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.320]   or to have terminals that are company specific?
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.560]   Well, this isn't company specific.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.760]   This, this, this will be Google's, but I imagine other, other private jets could be there as well.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.800]   Okay.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.760]   Because it's being run by a signature.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.360]   Okay.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.160]   Which does, which does.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.000]   It is a primary, the other primary tenant.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.560]   They've already subleased the majority of the project to a company that operates the private
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.560]   aircraft of Google executives.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.080]   That's blue city holdings.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.480]   Wow.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.680]   Now what's blue, Chad?
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.800]   What's blue city or reference?
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.560]   Well, what is that blue city holdings?
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.200]   Mm.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.560]   Well, if you watch the 19, 90, whatever, Adam.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:52.080]   I could swear at the, I'm not joking.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.240]   I could swear at the beginning of the commercial when you showed it.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.400]   I saw the words blue city go by.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.720]   Well, maybe, I don't know.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.600]   Chattram, do some research for us.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.720]   HP and Google, we were really excited about this HP Chromebook 11.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:12.400]   HP and Google have halted sales following complaints of the chargers overheating.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.360]   They've pulled the Chromebook 11.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.480]   Oh, is that it?
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.520]   From Best Buy, sales have been halted on Amazon.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.080]   HP and Google's online stores, it was a best seller on Amazon.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.800]   Customers, complaints of chargers overheating.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:30.240]   Best Buy told the Verge that urgent instructions have been sent to store managers
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.760]   to remove existing stock of the devices.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:40.240]   There was speculation on Google+, somebody I know returned one.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.400]   And the problem was it had the same problem the original Chromebook did.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.000]   It was too low in RAM.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.560]   It was only two gigs and it's going to slow down.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.080]   Everybody had people complaining about that.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.760]   How much is in your Pixel 4 gigs?
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.880]   There's four gigs in the Pixel.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.920]   What's in the Pixel's RAM?
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.640]   Four.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.120]   Four.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.600]   Two should be enough for a simple operating system.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:57.840]   Two?
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.000]   No.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.040]   No.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.560]   That's not, though, for the tabs.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.200]   When you open up tabs on my original Samsung.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.280]   It cuts luggage, huh?
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:13.200]   You remember that they announced, was it Google I/O that they announced the Google Play for Education?
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.440]   It's finally here.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.640]   Yep.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.040]   Awesome.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.760]   It ships on tablets today.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.240]   Google Play for Education, US only, sorry.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.640]   But it's been in beta for a while.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.680]   They say thousands of students in more than 50 schools have used it in beta.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.480]   It will ship on the Nexus 7 from today.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:42.160]   The 10-inch Asus transformer pad, the 8-inch HP Slade 8 Pro will be added early in 2014.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:49.040]   So you'll have to have specific hardware to use the Google Play for Education store.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.320]   Oh, really?
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.520]   Oh, that's weird.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.920]   So I guess you can download it.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.560]   Yeah, you have to get something with it on it.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.560]   Not sure what you're driving that, but I think this is great.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.800]   I mean, the fact that, you know, for education.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.080]   The fact that you can actually, there's a video that shows, you know, what you can do with it,
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:08.640]   basically.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.320]   I mean, teachers can collect all the responses from their kids simultaneously
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.640]   to see whether they're getting it or not.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.240]   I mean, there's all kinds of cool stuff teachers can--
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.800]   It's half the price, less than half the price of an iPad.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.760]   Oh, yeah, exactly.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.320]   They can push out apps to their students on the fly.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:30.000]   So in all fairness, I made fun of LA public schools getting the iPads versus Chromebooks.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.080]   And so this is another tablet.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:32.880]   There are no keyboards.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.480]   So for certain grades, one short in the commercial, I think fine.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.640]   But you get much higher at Chromebook as a better one.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.120]   Well, I think it's a one, two punch.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.640]   In fact, I think some schools might choose to have both.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:51.040]   Maybe a dozen Nexus 7s in the classroom to be handed out for specific times,
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.480]   and then the kids go home with the Chromebook.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:52.960]   You know, I see a little crazy.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.720]   It's the one to one.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.280]   I'm seeing-- I'm in the Chromebook for Education group on Google+,
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.520]   and you see these pictures, one just last week of 1,800 Chromebooks
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.680]   being prepared for the students.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.640]   It's really inspiring.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.520]   It's really kind of great.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:12.960]   Yeah, I mean, there was a news report the other day I heard that where kids from the age of like
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:19.040]   one now are able to manipulate smartphone screens.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.320]   So I mean, this is the interface that kids are used to now.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.840]   I mean, why shouldn't it be the way that they interact with education?
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.000]   Right?
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.480]   If this is what they're used to using, why are we forcing them
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.000]   to go back to older styles?
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.120]   I'm not saying there's anything wrong with books.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:31.600]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.000]   Don't take it too far, but I mean, you know,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.400]   but if this is what they're used to, if this is the easiest way for you--
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.120]   I know, I know.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:39.840]   I'm a book cater.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.600]   I won't go into the debate about listening to a book versus reading a book,
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.680]   but if this is what they're used to,
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.800]   this is what this is the interface that they should be using for education, I believe.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.040]   Well, so that's an interactive in a way a book is not.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.920]   I love books, but you gave some examples right there,
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:59.520]   tests and surveys and kid can be listening to audio or watching animation or movie.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.720]   Teacher can see the progress.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.280]   Exactly.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.200]   There was a related story--
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.640]   They had teacher worried on their neck.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.840]   A microphone.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.360]   Microphone.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.000]   Was it a microphone?
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.000]   I've seen teachers wear those before.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.720]   So sometimes when you have classes of smaller children,
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.480]   there's a lot of yelling involved.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.680]   So having an amplification system also, you might note that some of these kids are wearing--
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.560]   Wow.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.320]   Some of these kids are wearing headphones too,
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.840]   so maybe that she's using that to talk to them directly.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.400]   Whatever is convenient for them.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.920]   By the way, that's Frank Bonner, the guy who's a turb-tarr like him,
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.040]   to be curious.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.120]   You know, I'm going to look up and see if there's a wiki answers question for that guy.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.080]   Must be there.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:38.720]   You know what?
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.080]   Turkeys can fly.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.800]   I get it.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.920]   Less mess, man.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.720]   That is a very clear reference, but it is the most famous episode of that show that definitely
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.040]   has ever seen because we're all too old.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.840]   You know why we had wild turkeys in the end?
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.800]   He was just staring at us.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:59.120]   We had wild turkeys in the yard the other day in our new house.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:33:59.600]   Nice.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.080]   But it doesn't--
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:00.720]   I do it already.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.280]   Our old town.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.000]   Wild turkeys gobbling their way through the yard.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.520]   Yeah, we've got him around our house too.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.000]   I love it.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.640]   Give him some--
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.960]   Tom, take cover before, you know, come to the town.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.120]   I know.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.560]   I said, run little turkeys.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.200]   Run.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.480]   Thanks, giving is coming.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.080]   So go ahead.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.600]   It looks like the tablets with Google Play for Education,
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.240]   they're based on-- or they're built on Google Apps for Education.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.760]   So are they-- I guess my question is, are they converting these schools over to Google Apps
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.920]   for Education so every student gets their username at the school that he do?
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.120]   I mean, it makes a lot of sense for Google to do that, right?
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.960]   Because every kid you need a Google account to sign in.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.240]   Right.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.640]   And you can't necessarily assume that a kid, especially one under 13,
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:49.200]   is going to have an actual, you know, sort of public Gmail or Google account,
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:49.440]   right?
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.360]   So this is really beneficial to the students, of course,
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.120]   but it also was very beneficial to Google.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.280]   Not only are they getting kids using Google Apps very early,
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.360]   but it seems like-- it sounds like they're actually converting these schools
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.960]   over to Google Apps in the process.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.920]   And then along comes Larry Page.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.800]   He's going to have a pipe and he's going to lead them all to a barge.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.320]   Exactly.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:17.120]   I mean, they have had a specific program for Education for a while,
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:23.120]   Google Apps has where you get free access to all the apps stuff for your school.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:27.040]   And then they also have one for nonprofits as well, which is free.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.080]   Again, if you're a nonprofit, you can get free Google Apps account.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:33.520]   I don't know what the limitation is there, how many users you can add,
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.960]   but they've had these for a while.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.200]   And I guess it makes sense.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.840]   I wonder if there's any, you know, teas and sees about,
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.640]   we will not share your data since you're under 18 or, you know, all that kind of stuff.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.880]   They'd have to. There's legal-- at least under 13, there's legal issues.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.600]   Motorola G announced the Moto G.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.960]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.880]   Low priced version of the Moto X, $179, no LTE.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:05.920]   You know, people were very upset that Moto X was only available in the North America,
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.200]   right, North American market.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.880]   Motorola has a sub-200 dollar phone.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.560]   That's unsubsidized price.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.320]   Mostly based on the Moto X, there's an 8GB version for $179.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:25.440]   $199 is 16GB, both contract-free, sim unlocked, no LTE, but that's not really an issue in a lot of
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.840]   these areas. 3G is more than adequate.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.400]   I'm not sure what's missing.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:34.800]   It's got the edge-to-edge display, the curve back, the Corning Gorilla Glass.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.040]   The processor is, you know, like one of that.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.480]   A little slower, yeah.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.280]   But the screen, what's the screen res on that?
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.160]   I can't remember.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:50.320]   It's 720p, which is the same as the Moto X, 5MP rear camera, 1.3MP front camera,
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.520]   Bluetooth 4 Wi-Fi.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:55.280]   It's a Snapdragon 400, yeah, a little bit slower, 1GB of RAM.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:00.560]   But as a result, better battery life on the slower processor and the less RAM.
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:00.960]   Right.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.800]   That's pretty good for a sub-200 phone though.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.160]   That's very nice.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.120]   They're also going to support Moto Maker.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:12.000]   Well, you can't choose custom colors of the device, but you can get a shell.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.800]   Sort of.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.920]   You can get a shell and get that.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.160]   Okay.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.800]   And you get 65GB of Google Drive along with it.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.440]   Nice.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.000]   It goes on sale today in Europe and Brazil.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.600]   It will be available in the US as well as India and the Middle East.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.840]   30 countries, 60 partners.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.680]   What does that G stand for?
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.800]   Great.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.280]   Great.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.080]   This is the goal.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.000]   This is great.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.040]   I mean, they just said that Android is aiming to get the next billion people online, right?
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:45.040]   They want Android wants to run on low-cost devices and if Motorola wants to lock in,
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.320]   I mean, what's the best low-cost device out there right now?
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.520]   Well, there are Samsung ones.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.440]   There's no key to it for.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.560]   Yeah, right.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.400]   But it turns to smartphones on Android.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.120]   You can get a basic Samsung.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:05.680]   I think the S4 for closer to 100, I think.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.480]   Do we have wrong here?
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.000]   You can buy one on Amazon.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.840]   There's, if you go to Virgin Mobile, which is the carrier that my family uses,
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.440]   they actually have a couple of phones there for like 70 bucks that you can get.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:15.920]   Wow.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.400]   And these are--
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.520]   That's subsidized.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.800]   They're not running KitKat, granted, but they're ice cream and above.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.440]   These aren't running KitKat until next year, until January.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.040]   They're--
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.000]   Well, yeah, okay.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.960]   They will get--
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:27.920]   They will get KitKat.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.720]   They will get it.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.800]   And they're getting that fairly--
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.280]   I mean, the Moto X is a fairly pure Google experience.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.440]   It's not exactly Google experience, but fairly pure.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.600]   So the other interesting thing is that all these international phones,
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.440]   the standard for them is they come with FM radios.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.960]   Isn't that funny?
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.400]   It is.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:44.720]   I was--
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.080]   I can never figure out who wants FM radio, but I guess radio is still alive.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.040]   Just not here in the US.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:39:01.440]   Android has 81% of the smartphone market for the first time ever.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.760]   This is according to IDC, the analysts.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.760]   That's in the third quarter, 80% of global smart
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.040]   fund shipments in the third quarter.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:16.240]   So that's a big jump, although Windows Phone did pretty well.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.320]   It had a year over year growth of 156% in the third quarter.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.000]   Though it was Henry Blodgett did--
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.400]   I called it Slide Gasm.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.040]   At his conference, he did this 123 slide presentation,
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.080]   which was very good.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.400]   And in there, he talked about platforms.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.920]   And he said, ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner and the winner is Android.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:40.160]   The number-- I got more than one number, so this is fine to use this.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.240]   But I think I have a slide at the end.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:47.760]   60% of all new computing devices run Android.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.320]   There's a chart at the bottom of the number.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.840]   It's Victory for Linux.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.080]   Linux is everywhere.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:57.200]   iOS, Apple's iOS, 12.9%.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.880]   Samsung 39.9%.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:07.200]   So yeah, this is a very big jump for Android.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:14.080]   And Blackberry, 1.7% down for 4.5%.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:18.960]   That's that little blue stripe in the middle of--
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.600]   that sea of orange and red.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:26.080]   No.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.760]   Oh.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.240]   Oh.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:28.560]   Oh.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.360]   Oh.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:34.080]   But you may be saying, bye bye to Dalvik.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:39.600]   This is probably more appropriate for all about Android, which Gina and Aaron are regulars on.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.360]   Yeah, we discussed this at Link last night with Brian Klug.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:43.760]   Oh, good.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.480]   But on tech.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.240]   Perfect guy to talk to about this.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.960]   So what is art and why do we need to replace Dalvik?
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.240]   What is Dalvik, Gina?
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.360]   Dalvik is the runtime environment.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:00.880]   So when you build a Java application that you produce bytecode versus machine code,
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:05.360]   and Dalvik is this runtime environment that runs between the hardware of your device
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:09.920]   and your Java bytecode and translates it to run on the device.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.040]   So it's a runtime environment.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.160]   So that's what Dalvik is.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.120]   And art is the Android runtime.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:21.360]   It's basically Google rewriting the runtime that will run on all Android devices from scratch,
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.320]   from the bottom up.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.800]   They want to replace Dalvik with art.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.480]   And the reason why is basically it comes down to performance.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.800]   Better if they're saying that you get better performance out of it.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.640]   Dalvik's been around for a long time.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.480]   Android's been around for a long time.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.000]   And rather than continue to improve Dalvik,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.640]   Google wants to throw it out the window and start from scratch and start over.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:48.480]   And we talked about Chrome was a way that Google kind of started from scratch with their own browser.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.320]   They forked WebKit and went with Blink.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.200]   I mean, we've seen Google do this a couple times now.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.000]   And just start from the beginning or fork something off and say,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.160]   "Hey, we're going to leave this old technology behind and start new."
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:02.640]   And I feel like this switch to art is part of that.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.480]   This won't affect users in any way.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:10.160]   I mean, if all goes well, users will only enjoy a performance boost, a speed increase.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:15.920]   And you can switch to art on KitKat right now if you enable developer options.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.640]   But if you're thinking about doing that, you should watch the episode of all of
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.800]   it. Android, we did last night because Ron Richards, my co-host, did that.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.400]   He tapped that button right there.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:29.040]   And all went well until he tried to use one of his most important apps,
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.040]   which did not work with art and wound up having to factory reset his phone,
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.240]   you know, three days later.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.200]   What? Oh, cancel, cancel aboard aboard.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.560]   Might not quite be ready yet.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.560]   Ron ran into trouble with WhatsApp, which is an app.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.160]   Oh, I don't care about WhatsApp.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.040]   You don't care about WhatsApp.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:45.920]   A lot of people do.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.520]   Holy cow, WhatsApp is amazing.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.080]   100 million images a day on WhatsApp.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.840]   It's extremely popular.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.640]   So we're still kind of early.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:58.480]   And if you Google WhatsApp and art, you know, there's, you know, thousands of people screaming
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.440]   about how it doesn't work with art.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.920]   They're working on a fix of course, just its early days.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.960]   And art isn't quite ready.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.920]   But that's what art is.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:09.680]   It's just a new runtime for, for Android Java bytecode.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.440]   Yeah, and it's worth pointing out this is for developers.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.960]   This is a developer feature.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.560]   It's not for average users.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.640]   You're not going to get that much.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:20.160]   In fact, the ROM that I'm loading now, there was a big warning on it that said,
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.600]   you know, do not use this with art.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.000]   Stay with Dalvik for now because there are too many users with too many problems for
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.640]   this particular developer of this ROM to support art right now because there's just too much going on.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.160]   So just keep that in mind.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.120]   It's more of a real advantage to using art, right?
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:35.680]   I mean, it's not.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:40.640]   The performance improvements are not like, you know, blow your doors off right now.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:46.080]   They're not so significant that users should be clamoring to switch the developer options.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:51.360]   I think that for me, it sounds like art is about future proofing for Google,
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:57.440]   getting ready for new kinds of hardware that are coming out and optimizing for changes,
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.200]   you know, changes to Android in the future.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:04.080]   But right now, I mean, a few blogs, a few Android blogs have published side by side of running art in Dalvik
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.920]   and using the third devices.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:11.120]   There might be a slight performance improvement, but it's not that noticeable.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:15.200]   So according to the Android police still in comes writing,
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.560]   Cody Toombs, not Dylan Coombs.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.760]   I don't know who Dylan Coombs is.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:24.720]   Cody Toombs writing says that the way Dalvik is is just in time, a Java runtime,
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:32.240]   which is not uncommon where you as needed, you compile the code, the P code, the pseudo code into
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.760]   application.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.480]   By code into machine code.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.280]   Machine code.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.360]   But art apparently, in fact, if I do this thing, I'm going to do it.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:47.040]   If I do this thing, it will go through all my apps and precompile all the bytecode into machine
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:52.560]   language. And that'll be done. And that instead of just in time, it's ahead of time compilation,
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:58.160]   which means that in theory, this stuff would run faster, right? It doesn't have to interpret
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.120]   bytecode as I go.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.400]   Yeah, especially startup time.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.520]   All right. Let's see.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.480]   The application should be--
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:06.400]   I'm going to-- so this is, by the way, and this is the way you get your developer options,
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.000]   you tap what you tap the build number seven times.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.880]   Like this. And it goes, yeah.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:16.560]   By the way, did you see this? If I tap in, I get the K for KitKat.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.040]   I like this.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:17.600]   Oh.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:18.160]   Oh.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:18.800]   Oh.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.680]   And tap it again.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.240]   And tap it again.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.440]   The jelly beans.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.000]   Tap, tap.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:22.400]   Tap it again.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:22.800]   Hold it again.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:23.120]   Tap it here.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:23.120]   Here.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.160]   Here we go.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.120]   Oh.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:25.600]   Oh.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.000]   Oh.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.360]   It makes me hungry for a kid.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.160]   Not done yet.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:28.800]   There's more.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.480]   There's more.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:30.960]   Hold down the logo.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.560]   I thought Leo was going to get mad about that.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.520]   I think you--
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.080]   I think you hold it.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.200]   Tap and hold the logo.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.240]   Tap and hold the logo.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.840]   Tap the logo.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.400]   It's bad.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.200]   No.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.000]   I want candy.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:40.640]   Shoot.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:41.600]   Where's my candy?
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:46.480]   I need to just hatch an actual KitKat bar.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.040]   Right.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.680]   Pop it right out of the phone port.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.080]   Oh, here we go.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.760]   Swipe down the--
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.160]   Oh.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.120]   There you go.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:55.680]   Whoa.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:56.560]   What?
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:57.520]   Preserve the--
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.480]   Just listening.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:01.360]   Leo, don't ask the rather nonsensical bunch of little,
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.240]   nice little Android--
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:02.720]   Honeycomb.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.680]   --on the screen.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.080]   See if you can identify the version
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:06.800]   of Android.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.720]   Donut.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.280]   Donut was--
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.160]   And if you hit Pro-Yo--
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:10.640]   If you hit Pro-Yo--
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.160]   --or make a bigger one.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.680]   Can I-- is it like concentration?
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.640]   Can I like--
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.120]   Not quite.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.800]   If you hit two of the same,
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:17.680]   it'll make a bigger one for you.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.440]   Look at that.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:19.840]   And then--
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:20.720]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:21.280]   If I'm going to tap--
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.000]   I keep this at the point.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.040]   So there's the jelly bean.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.040]   I need to tap another jelly bean.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.160]   That makes a bigger jelly bean.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.840]   And look, if you get it big enough,
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.960]   here's a cup--
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.720]   Donut cupcake--
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:34.560]   Cupcake cupcake cupcake cupcake.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.920]   And then look what happens.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.320]   Wow.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.440]   You get a cupcake cupcake bar.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.880]   I got a cupcake bar.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.840]   That's fantastic.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.440]   That is amazing.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.240]   How do they do that?
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.080]   [SIGHS]
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.080]   [LAUGHS]
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:48.880]   Mm.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.880]   It's delicious, but--
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.880]   This is a just-in-time cupcake bar.
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:53.440]   Just a word of warning.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.480]   It's fine.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.080]   It will not work with art.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.520]   It's not in a head of time, Kit-Kat.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.080]   No.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:58.720]   Right.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:46:58.960]   All right.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:46:59.920]   So I'm going to--
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:00.960]   how do I get the hell out of this?
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.960]   My message was brought to you by--
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.000]   Hershey.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.240]   "Manufacture of fine snack foods."
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.680]   Exactly.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.680]   So Nestle-- this is a Nestle Kit-Kat.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.160]   Nestle.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:10.320]   All right.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.640]   I'm going to go-- well, Hershey owns it in the US.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.480]   I'm going to go to a about phone.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.280]   I'm going to go-- no, I'm sorry, developer, right?
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.640]   Developer options.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:19.920]   Select runtime.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.680]   Use art.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:27.680]   Reboot to change runtime from libdvm.so to libart.so.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.280]   OK.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.640]   All right.
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.600]   So now it's going to come for--
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.240]   Now you're going to--
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.800]   dex files over to the-- whatever the--
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.840]   And is there no going back?
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.280]   You can go back.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:39.840]   You can go back.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.120]   I had to have the fact reset because WhatsApp was broken
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.080]   even after he went back.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.240]   So I think you can go back.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.480]   Like, uncompilot?
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.880]   You'd have to-- we would switch back to using the dex files,
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.480]   the files that Dalvik produces.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:54.960]   Cool.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.160]   That was good.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.560]   I'm playing that game somewhere when it's rebooted.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:47:59.040]   Oh, man.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.280]   Are you ready for a ROM update?
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.320]   Yeah, we're loading up here.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.160]   Installing your 4.4.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:04.640]   Right.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.200]   So you two can have candy coming out of your phone?
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:07.760]   Quick update.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.240]   I hope so.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.520]   I hope I get that.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.240]   So quick update.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.560]   What we've done is we downloaded the files that I need.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:16.000]   I need the ROM file itself and the G apps,
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.600]   which is the Google Apps.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.680]   It's a zip file with all the Google Apps that I'm going to apply.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.800]   So this is typical of a ROM.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.960]   It doesn't ship with a can't ship with,
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.640]   for legal reasons, the Google Apps are--
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:24.960]   Right.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.760]   They're not open source.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:26.720]   They're not allowed to distribute it.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.760]   That's right.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.600]   So what I've done is--
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.360]   the next thing you have to do is you have to wipe--
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.600]   do a factory reset and wipe your cache.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.000]   So I've done that ahead of time here just so you can see.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.240]   So now at this point, if I was to reboot my phone,
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.800]   it would boot up like it was a brand new device, right?
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.400]   I could still reboot it at this point.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.280]   Yeah, I haven't really--
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:43.760]   So you--
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.160]   I haven't done too much--
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.000]   What you want to do is back up before you do this.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.920]   Definitely back up, which I did earlier today.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.080]   Now I'm going to go ahead and do what I was talking about
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:54.640]   before, which is installed from the SD card.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:59.280]   And I'm going to go down and find my gummy ROM.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.960]   Or you said you had to download something else.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.480]   So what is the gapps?
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.040]   The gapps.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:03.600]   That's the gapps.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.560]   Gummy is the ROM and gapps was what I forgot to download.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.440]   So now I've got gummy.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.880]   I'm going to go ahead and install it.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.000]   It's going to say, are you sure you
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.840]   want to install this cannot be undone?
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.280]   Yes, I'm going to install it.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.240]   And you'll see it'll just--
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:17.040]   Is it ask you to install the gapps at a separate time?
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:17.520]   Or when do you--
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.600]   No, it doesn't ask you to do anything after this.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.680]   So it sees the gapps and installs the monomatt.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.000]   No, you-- so after this, the next step I'll do--
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.400]   You will.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.240]   Which I will go ahead and do the same process,
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:30.800]   but also the gapps zip file to install after the ROM is done.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.400]   So that's where we are.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.560]   And we'll come back in a few minutes and see how this is going.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.400]   It's installing gummy right now.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:36.960]   It's installing.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.880]   I feel like the brownies just went in the oven.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.440]   That's right.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.720]   That's exactly right.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.680]   And meanwhile, my apps are being optimized much more slowly
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.000]   than usual.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.320]   When you install a new ROM, you do get this optimal.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.520]   What is that doing?
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.960]   Gina, you must know.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.080]   Optimizing apps.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.080]   Well, I think what that is doing right now
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:55.040]   is it's converting the dex files, the dawgic files,
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:55.920]   to the art files.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.120]   But anytime you change ROMs, you get this optimizing.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.240]   Usually goes faster than that.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.120]   Yeah, that, I don't know.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.960]   Yeah, that happens every time you install a ROM.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.360]   And I believe that came out when butter--
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.640]   do you remember butter came out with--
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.480]   I think it was ice cream sandwich or something.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.480]   That's kind of like what it does to get the app--
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.640]   Is it O-dexing them, or is it something separate from that?
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.080]   No, it's part of the O-dex process.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:15.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:15.680]   OK.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.400]   Wow, that's very--
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.680]   Gina, I think you're being showed up here.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.080]   You know that.
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:20.080]   The boys destroyed a tool each.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.360]   What are you going to destroy, huh?
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.560]   Yeah, we both bricked our phones.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.280]   What are you going to do?
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.160]   Yeah, come on.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.160]   I'm good with the working phones to stop interfering.
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:28.800]   I'm good.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.640]   They're not ricked yet.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:32.400]   They're not ricked yet.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.760]   They're standby.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:37.040]   It's the destruction derby.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.800]   You know, Ron was saying, I could have fixed it,
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.080]   but it would have taken a few more hours.
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.520]   And it's my phone, I need it to work.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.480]   And that's kind of how I feel.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.680]   It's my phone, I need it to work.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.640]   I can only do that to a test phone, or a secondary phone.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.320]   Well, it's good to know if I were a WhatsApp user.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.400]   But this is good for me to do, because then I can say
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.960]   what apps don't work with art.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:53.680]   Things like that.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.480]   So I'll play with it.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.360]   Which phone is it that you're doing that?
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:59.120]   The Nexus 5, because it's the only one that I have a Kit Kat on.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.080]   Right, of course.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.480]   I love this Nexus 5, by the way.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:02.920]   Are you happy?
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.520]   Did you get yours?
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.400]   You're too.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.600]   Yeah, I'm very happy with it.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.320]   I mean, I still take your point that I think
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:10.560]   they're the Phillips that are on the--
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.320]   MotoX.
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.880]   Our appealing, this is a raw Google phone.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:18.160]   But yes, it's very, very nice.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.680]   I have AT&T on this one.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.960]   And so I put on the AT&T International Wi-Fi thing,
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.320]   because I'm going to Europe.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:28.880]   And all that sucks down the battery.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:29.360]   Yeah, I know.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.400]   AT&T's software really is terrible.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.200]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.120]   So I killed it back off.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.360]   So the battery, other than that, works pretty well.
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.320]   I haven't used the camera a lot yet.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:38.560]   But it feels like--
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.240]   It's a better camera than the MotoX.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.240]   I think that's--
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.160]   If I could get the MotoX features on the Nexus 5,
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.080]   it would be a no-brainer for me.
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.560]   I like the screen better.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.440]   I like the camera much better.
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.040]   You know, despite what the Verge said,
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.600]   I think the Nexus 5's camera is excellent.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:53.480]   I'm very happy.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.080]   I've seen some really nice shots.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.560]   I've seen some really nice photos on Google+.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.440]   Now, some of those may have been optimized.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.480]   But most of the people that are posting photos say, hey,
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.880]   here's the automatic--
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.960]   And you're using unenhanced versions.
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.240]   And here's the unenhanced versions.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.640]   And to me, they look pretty good.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.120]   I don't know.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.400]   I'm getting good results out of it.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.200]   Very happy with that.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.400]   But the MotoX has such nice--
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.160]   It's the little things.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.200]   It's the Moto Assist.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.320]   It's the active alerts.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.840]   You know, those are the things that--
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:18.840]   Yeah, it would be nice.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:22.080]   I-- when I'm in the car, I saw--
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.000]   I'm not going to ruin Gina's tip.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   But I can talk to it.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.640]   Not quite as smoothly, but it still works.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.840]   So no, I'm very happy with it all in all.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.680]   And so people are saying--
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.760]   I've been rising nuts.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:39.440]   Every time I switch phones, I wish I could just replicate.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:42.240]   And then-- so once I've installed everything,
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.720]   the real pain in the butt is that I then
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.800]   have to go and find like a whack-a-mole game,
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:52.120]   all of the damn notifications that everybody puts back on again.
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:52.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.240]   Did you pick that me and yell at me and screech is that me?
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:55.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.560]   Oh.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.080]   It should remember your default settings
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.600]   on notifications, I agree.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.360]   You know, this phone downloaded all the apps
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:05.360]   I'd ever installed on Android.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.440]   Which was-- how did it do that?
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.680]   Well, it's a Google phone.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:10.240]   And obviously, you could see the Play Store.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:13.920]   Normally, I'm not really sure what the rules are
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.680]   about re-downloading your apps.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.960]   Because I always set my phone to back up in the store
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.480]   through my Google account.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.680]   Sometimes, a phone will download all the apps
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.600]   that I had most recently.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.400]   This is the first time a phone's ever downloaded.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.960]   Every app I'd ever installed.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.800]   Oh, not even the ones that were installed before,
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:32.760]   but even the ones that you--
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.080]   Every app I ever installed.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:35.600]   Wow.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.520]   Which is a lot of crap.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:41.800]   Chad, you should share the tip that blew all of our minds
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.680]   this night on.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.600]   Oh, Chad knows how to fix this.
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:48.560]   So yesterday, Ron had the same issue
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:54.360]   that basically what happens is if you go to the store,
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:56.760]   there's a section of the store that's all of your apps.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:57.640]   And that's what it--
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.200]   That's why I know how to eliminate apps from that.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.760]   But do you know how to batch eliminate them?
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.600]   If you do--
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.200]   Yes, I'll hold it down and you check it.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.040]   No.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:08.240]   So this is what blew everyone's mind,
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:12.800]   was that if you go to my apps and then swipe over to all--
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:13.880]   I could show it over here.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:14.380]   Right.
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:16.920]   Anything you can long press and then you
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.920]   can select multiple at a time.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.200]   I had fortunately, I had done that not so long ago.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:25.440]   So it didn't install every app ever.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.800]   But still far more, a larger set of apps
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.360]   than I actually wanted.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.560]   So as you know, you--
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.320]   And by the way, I like this new--
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.400]   they're doing-- what do you call it?
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.360]   The hamburger, Gina?
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:36.360]   The hamburger now?
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.240]   Yeah, the hamburger.
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.680]   The hamburger is really nice to use the hamburger now
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.120]   on the app store.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:41.720]   It's a lot easier.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.840]   So this is all I've ever installed.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.920]   And I'm just repeating what Chad just told us.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.320]   If you press and hold that, you can now multiple select.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.520]   Notice ones that are currently installed
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:53.600]   will not be highlighted.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:54.760]   And you can remove these.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:55.760]   Don't go to the click office.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.600]   You're going to want that.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.280]   No, I'm actually going to-- I'm not going to say yes.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.360]   But I had already done this.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.720]   Thank goodness.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.800]   Because if I had, that would have gotten a lot of crap.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.520]   And then you can delete these all at once.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.520]   Yeah, really handy.
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.120]   Isn't that nice?
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.960]   I don't understand how it downloaded any--
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:13.120]   I have to download each app individually from my play account.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.440]   How do you get it downloaded?
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.200]   Well, that's what I'm confused about.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.960]   Because sometimes that happens with the phone.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:19.600]   It doesn't download anything.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.640]   Sometimes it redownloads everything I had on my last install.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:26.440]   And then on this phone, it redownload everything I ever had.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.720]   So what are the rules?
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.920]   Does anybody know?
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:30.560]   I haven't been able to figure it out.
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.840]   It seems to be random.
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.440]   Sometimes it doesn't download anything.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:35.000]   And then this is the first time I've
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.160]   heard about downloading everything.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.120]   But usually what it does is it's supposed to do
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:41.760]   is install the apps that you had most recently installed
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.840]   on your last device.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.920]   And that's what nine--
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.760]   not what, no.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.880]   Four times out of five, it does that.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.600]   One town out of five, it does nothing.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.080]   Right.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.240]   And this is the first time ever.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:53.040]   It's just installed all of them.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:53.880]   And then--
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:55.960]   With you, you were all people.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.800]   Well, and then I made the mistake of deleting apps
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.560]   while it was still downloading them.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.680]   So I deleted a bunch of apps that I didn't want.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.200]   And it redownloaded them.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.480]   So that's another tip.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.920]   Wait till it's done before you start getting rid of stuff
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.440]   you don't want.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:10.920]   Yep.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.360]   It's like a cat breaking you a mouse.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:13.760]   Look, I want you all the apps.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:18.400]   But you know, that tip that you gave Ron Chet is a great tip.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:21.120]   Because you can't do that on the Apple App Store.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.160]   So the Apple App Store has everything you've ever bought.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.560]   And there doesn't seem to be any way to remove it.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.640]   So there's a lot of crap on my Apple.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.280]   Right.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:30.800]   Just to--
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.560]   Can you remove something from your Play Store account?
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:37.160]   You still own it.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.160]   But can you just remove it?
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:38.760]   Say I don't want this.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.080]   There's something that's dead there.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:40.600]   Yes.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.280]   Can you remove them there?
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.480]   Yes.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.040]   Oh.
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:46.520]   Well, you mean from previously installed, right?
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:46.920]   That's sick.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.880]   And I go to my Play Store and has all the apps I've ever bought.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.080]   Some of them I just want to kill.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:51.800]   That's what that does.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:52.840]   You can remove them.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:53.920]   You can do it on the App Store.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.000]   Don't use it as an entirely for your account.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.120]   No.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:57.840]   Well, yes.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.440]   It's that no longer shows up in that list of installed apps.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.560]   Or app or app.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.080]   I don't know about the app.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:04.920]   Yeah, I presume on the web.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.520]   That's a nice feature.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:13.160]   Because we all download apps like the app of Google I/O 2010.
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:14.800]   I don't want to reinstate that.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.320]   Right.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:15.800]   Ever, ever.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.400]   That's a good example.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.600]   I'm done with that.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.360]   I don't need that anymore.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.080]   Well, this has turned into all about Android.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.840]   I apologize.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.320]   We're going to move on here.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:28.280]   Unless I have enough--
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.280]   Numberly.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.600]   Well, I love Android.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.160]   I do too.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.160]   I like Android.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.320]   I'm very happy in my Nexus 5.
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.720]   I'm still unhappy with Verizon.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.320]   But I'm happy with my Nexus 5.
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:42.040]   Something to be aware of, the Google Play Services update,
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:45.400]   which I just got to date, has maybe some negative side
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:48.480]   effects according to Android police.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:52.560]   What is this, by the way, the Play Services update?
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.200]   You know, they're always updating Play Services.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.640]   But it's not an app.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:57.240]   No.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.720]   Well, it's the-- let's see.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:02.680]   It's the Google Services or Google Settings app.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:03.040]   So let's see.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:03.520]   Let's see.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.920]   Show that kind of funny in my update.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:06.720]   It didn't.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:10.080]   It was a strange update.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:11.240]   It's a gray icon.
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.880]   I'm not on KitKat.
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:14.800]   But it's a gray icon for me.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.920]   And then it's got all the apps that
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:20.760]   are connected to Play Services listed there.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.280]   But the Android device manager, if you turned that on
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:27.200]   to be able to remote wipe your device,
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:30.760]   apparently this update unchecked that box for some users.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:31.600]   It didn't for me.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:35.240]   I checked mine and it was as I left it.
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:35.560]   And I actually--
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.280]   So just check to see if it's activated.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.520]   Just check to see if it's still it.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:39.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:40.480]   Exactly.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.040]   Let's see what--
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:42.960]   Because you don't want to get your phone stolen thinking
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.720]   that that's turned on and then not have that access.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:48.080]   And then not have a turn on, exactly.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:48.640]   You know what?
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:53.000]   If I weren't installing art right now, I would check mine.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.360]   This is going to be a while.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:56.360]   Android is going to be a while.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:58.400]   91 of 210.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:02.600]   Every year of a company called Reputation Changer,
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.280]   they changed their name.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.720]   I had not.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:09.160]   I had because they bought ads on the local LA radio station
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.720]   where I work.
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:12.560]   Or they were trying--
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:14.320]   I can't remember if they bought ads or they're trying to buy ads.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:16.240]   And somebody said, would you do an ad for them?
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.480]   So I looked into them.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:23.640]   I was less than overwhelmed by the company's MO.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.640]   They've changed their name now to branded.com, which
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:27.040]   must have cost them a pretty penny.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:29.360]   There's an article about them and the companies that do this
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:30.400]   in courts.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.160]   The problem is-- and it's a big problem.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:34.720]   And I'm very well aware of it.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:37.440]   You don't control what Google search results show up.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:40.560]   And if you have not been active online,
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:43.160]   if you haven't been a busy little bee posting stuff
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:46.200]   on your blog, all of us are very active.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.200]   But tweeting and Facebooking and blogging,
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:52.240]   then if somebody else posts something about you,
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:55.320]   that's going to be one of the first results in your search.
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.600]   You don't control that.
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:58.840]   And if it's nasty stuff, that's what people are going to see
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.520]   when they Google your name.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.720]   It's one of the pieces of advice I give teenagers
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.600]   is do get active on the web.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:08.120]   Be proactive in managing your reputation online
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.720]   by putting the stuff up on the web, on Twitter, on Google
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.520]   Plus, on Facebook, on a blog.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.960]   Own, have a web page, and post stuff there,
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.480]   because that's going to be what people will find about you.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.880]   And you want to make sure it's stuff
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.080]   that you put up there that reflects you well in case of this.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.120]   So what reputation, defender, what reputation,
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.600]   changes these other companies do, their variety of things,
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.400]   it's fairly expensive.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.560]   One of the things they do is they'll
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.960]   put a lot of posts over your name,
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.640]   and eventually Google on index those.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:38.480]   And even if they have nothing to do with anything.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.120]   Which I think is the reputation.com method
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.680]   is to put all that stuff up.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.920]   The reason I put this one in was interesting about this one
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.360]   is they said, no, no, no, we'll erase it.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.120]   We're going to erase.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.560]   So it's just thrown in there.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.120]   Oh, well, they have to go to court
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.000]   and get it to be declared to be libelous.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.600]   And then Google will take it down.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.320]   Like, that's something you can do very easily.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.400]   Thank goodness in this country we have laws that don't make it
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.720]   that simple to do that.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.560]   Yeah, and of course, if it's not libelous,
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.800]   if somebody posts something that's true about you,
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.760]   however scurrilous, you're stuck.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.200]   You can't get the taken down.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:16.240]   So brand.com will sue--
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.600]   this is a big business.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.320]   According to this courts article,
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.360]   the market, which was $1.6 billion in 2011,
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.840]   maybe as much as $5 billion market by 2015,
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.040]   a lot of people have these problems, right?
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.400]   I think it's very common.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.000]   Well, or they're being scared into it.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.600]   You listen to the reputation.com ads.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.200]   And I know the CEO of the company,
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:40.480]   we've sparred about privacy and publicness.
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.560]   But they advertise that there is-- we'll put the truth up
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.080]   front.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.200]   Well, not necessarily.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.520]   Maybe your restaurant really does suck.
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:47.960]   Right.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.560]   And then what they're putting up is your PR.
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.960]   So it has to be libelous.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.800]   I guess it could be also DMCA.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.720]   They could get stuff taken down for copyright violation.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.200]   Well, for now.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.320]   And then brand.com also suppresses it.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.760]   It says, by populating results with positive information
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:13.160]   that is authoritative and truthful.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.760]   And it's true that if you can get that first page cleaned up,
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:17.280]   you're good.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:21.440]   But $7,500 a month for that fee.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.880]   And that bet you that's the starting price.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.400]   If they're going to go to court, that's
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.520]   going to cost a lot more.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.840]   Actually, I'm trying to be open-minded about this.
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.760]   I'm OK with the whole-- somebody
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.520]   exposes something to Famitorly libelous.
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.840]   And I don't want to do what the paperwork.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.760]   So I'm going to hire someone to do that for me.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:39.240]   The whole posting positive stuff about the client
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.440]   just sounds like that just sounds like spam.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.240]   What do you do?
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:42.720]   I mean--
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.240]   It sounds like SEO.
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.000]   It sounds like spam.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:44.480]   It is.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.480]   It's always total spam.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.840]   But it's the only thing you can do, isn't it?
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.240]   What can you do?
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.680]   So I mean, that's why I don't--
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.280]   You can actually post that.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.160]   No, your point was you can actually be there for real
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.600]   and do good things and add good things and say things that
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.000]   are worth linking to.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.840]   And then that's legitimately rising.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:04.880]   But there are a lot of people, adults,
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.640]   today, who never posted anything on any of them.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.880]   Totally internet.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.920]   And they're very vulnerable.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.600]   What do you do?
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.280]   Very close friend of mine.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.680]   Very close friend of mine has this problem.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.160]   And I just don't know what to do about it,
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:22.960]   except say, create a blog, post it as much as you can.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.960]   But there really isn't much you can do retroactively.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.680]   It's very hard.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.280]   You really need to be proactive and create a reputation online
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:30.960]   now.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.040]   And that's what I tell kids.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.440]   You've got to create a reputation online now.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.400]   I had a great meeting today with the CEO and founder
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:42.360]   of LexBlog, which is a lawyers blog platform.
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.320]   He owns it entirely.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:47.160]   He has 1,000 blogs, 8,000 lawyer authors.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.480]   And it's fascinating how he has to get across to them,
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.960]   the idea that if you're not out there talking about what you do,
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.840]   nobody's going to hire you from the yellow pages.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.600]   You've got to be out there saying what you do.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.000]   You've got to be showing your leadership.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.800]   You've got to be talking about stuff.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.040]   And as I was talking to him, I think
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.000]   there's huge opportunities in areas like therapists.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.320]   You look at that online.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.920]   All you get is pictures of flowers.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.160]   And you don't know what they say.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.880]   I totally agree.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.120]   Totally agree.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.040]   I just read that 31% of all schools
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.800]   are now looking at social media postings
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.560]   for their applicants of colleges,
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.760]   are looking at social media postings for their applicants.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.200]   And it came up because a young lady who
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.840]   went to a college informational college seminar
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.880]   as a high school senior--
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.840]   I came-- was it Rutgers?
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.040]   I came to her what school it was.
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:37.680]   No, it wasn't.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.680]   No, it was another college.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.680]   I can't where it was.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.920]   But she went to the thing.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.200]   And she sits in the back row and tweets.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.280]   These people are so stupid.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.600]   Oh my god, I can't believe how idiotic this is.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.760]   And just goes on and on.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.160]   Then applies to the school.
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:54.080]   The school says she didn't get in
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.760]   because your record didn't justify it.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.880]   But you got to think the school--
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:01.480]   The school also said even if her record was good--
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.520]   We wouldn't--
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:03.560]   They didn't--
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:07.160]   We wouldn't want to her in here.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.040]   So I mean, 31% of schools now look
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.200]   at your social media postings before they accept you.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.640]   Wow.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.480]   So again, another reason why teenagers
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.640]   ought to be active online and put your good stuff up.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.640]   Put the-- you know, your track record
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.880]   and your best A+ papers and--
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:23.880]   You know, just put stuff up.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.400]   When I met with high school students,
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.200]   they get so paranoid about it that they'll say the opposite.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:28.680]   Is that not all?
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.240]   And I've got to explain to my entire record.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.520]   I've got to be nothing because I've
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.520]   been trying to get into a good college.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.320]   But I agree with you, Leo.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.560]   That's the wrong way to go.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.880]   Impress people with what you are.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.240]   Well, what a lot of them do, of course,
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.880]   is they create a Facebook account under a pseudonym.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:43.440]   Yes.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.200]   And then they change it when they--
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.480]   so that you have this--
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.480]   or, you know, in a somewhat of a pseudonym.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.880]   Yeah, like purposely misspell their last name or--
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.440]   Right.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:52.760]   Right.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.520]   You know, it's good if you have--
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.640]   if your name is John Smith, you probably are right.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:02.480]   If your name is Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis, Leo Le Porte,
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:06.760]   Erin Newcomb, you probably should pay attention.
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.840]   Data Boyd also talks-- the brilliant Data Boyd
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:12.600]   talks about how young people are very good at speaking in code.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.920]   Right.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.600]   Yeah, it's a great, great story.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.400]   But we all understand the code now, right?
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.840]   Well, no, no, no.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:23.520]   This is my favorite story of Dana's.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:24.800]   And she's told it often.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.440]   A young woman, 16 years old, her mother's follower
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.080]   on Facebook.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:28.840]   And it's fine with her.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.080]   She's cool with that.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.200]   But she's having problems with her boyfriend.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.960]   And she doesn't want her mother to smother her
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:36.440]   with concern and affection and all the horrible things
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.240]   the parents do.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:37.840]   Hate that.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.200]   And so she thought about it.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.000]   And she put up-- now, I always forget this--
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.240]   the end of "Life of Brian," the song he sings
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.600]   as he being crucified is--
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.080]   Look on the bright side of life.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.040]   Yes.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.480]   I was going to say every sperm is sacred, but that's earlier.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.840]   No, no.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.600]   Look on the bright side of life.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:57.560]   So she puts up the lyrics to look on the bright side of life.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.440]   And so her mother says, oh, good dear.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.480]   I see her having a good day.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.440]   This is so nice to you.
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.440]   Oh, I think you're fine.
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.160]   Oh my god, what's wrong?
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:05.840]   Tell us what's wrong.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.360]   Something about me is wrong.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.720]   So she speaks in the code that she knows her peers--
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.640]   That's very dated.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.400]   I doubt any teenager today knows "Life of Brian."
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.920]   They wouldn't stop tweeting.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.640]   She was sub-tweeting.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.880]   So that was-- is that what it's called?
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.200]   Sub-tweeting?
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.160]   It's like sub-texting.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.760]   Something a little different.
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.240]   Sub-tweeting is when you're talking about someone
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.720]   without mentioning saying their name so that they don't know.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.160]   But everybody else knows.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.520]   Oh, I like that.
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.960]   So it's-- but it is more like speaking code.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.720]   So cultural references that family members wouldn't get.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:36.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.520]   See, Jean, we ask you guys a question.
[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:41.080]   And do me a favor and sub-tweet this.
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.320]   I know you'll know who it is.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.040]   Don't say it.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.440]   I don't want to give this guy any publicity.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:44.760]   All right.
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.200]   OK.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.960]   So there's a guy who thinks he's funny.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.000]   I wish he were, then I'd be OK with this, who
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.840]   has a fake account based around, oh, I
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:55.400]   don't know, some journals and professor you both know.
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.200]   Not saying who he is.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.200]   I'm not saying who he is.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:57.720]   Jay Rose.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.840]   OK, go ahead.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:03.960]   I get email from one of my deans on the other night saying,
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.920]   oh my god, there's this guy who has this thing.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.640]   And he's posting pictures of penises.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.560]   And he says, this horrible, ridiculous stuff.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.760]   And I said to say, yeah, I know.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.680]   But I said, if I complain about him,
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.480]   I'm going to get more crap.
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.080]   Nothing you can do.
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.520]   Nothing you can do.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.800]   She was amazed at this.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:20.920]   No, you're kidding.
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.880]   This happens on the internet.
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.600]   The internet is a terrible place.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.000]   A terrible place.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.400]   But this is why they have-- you're verified, right, Jeff?
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:30.440]   On Twitter?
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.440]   I'm verified.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:31.920]   I'm verified.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:32.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.800]   And that-- that's how it is sort of--
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.200]   it's an obvious parody set.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.600]   I mean, you know--
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.080]   None of it.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.200]   I wish you were funnier.
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.040]   I just thought you would have a parody account that's funny,
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:42.560]   isn't it?
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.060]   Yeah.
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:43.800]   It's a sense of the stuff.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.760]   I contacted the guy.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.040]   He also doesn't have the balls to talk to me.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.000]   I said, let's talk.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.040]   And he was too jic--
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.840]   oh, chicken poop.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:57.120]   Hey, Twitter owes you money.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.560]   A lot of money.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.560]   How much money is Twitter owe you, Leo?
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.760]   $42,000.
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:03.520]   Nice.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.520]   All right.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.200]   So let's do it.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.040]   I want to talk real quick.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.480]   $80,000.
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:08.320]   So here's the deal.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.760]   This is an interactive infographic from Time Magazine.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.880]   I think it's fairly accurate based on the stock--
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.800]   the valuation of the company, Twitter, which is probably higher
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.440]   by now.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:23.240]   And the number of people tweeting in the number of eyeballs
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:28.360]   each tweets sees at only 25% of people pay attention.
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:30.640]   So it's fairly conservative.
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:36.960]   Time estimates that Twitter owes you $12.45 for each daily eyeball
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:37.960]   that you reach.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:43.560]   Gina Trapani, that means they owe you $32,861.
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:44.080]   Do me.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:44.600]   Do me.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.100]   Do me.
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:45.600]   Do me.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.600]   Do me.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.600]   Do me.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:47.600]   Do me.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.600]   Do me.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.600]   Oh, Jeff.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.520]   You're the richest amongst us.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.280]   $94,316.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.280]   Nice.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.040]   Nice.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.040]   Aaron, what's your Twitter handle?
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:57.880]   Aaron, Newcomb.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.760]   All one word.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.400]   A-A-R-W-N.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.400]   A-A-R-O-N.
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.680]   Any W-U-C-O-M-B.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:07.720]   Why did you have a name that's so hard to spell?
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:08.720]   $35.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:09.720]   $25.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.720]   Wait a minute, Aaron.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:11.720]   That's not your real name.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.880]   Did I say that wrong?
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.080]   Is that really your Twitter handle?
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.080]   And that's how much?
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.080]   Yeah, that's depressing.
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.080]   That is.
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.080]   That's awful.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.360]   That tells you-- I always say this.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.720]   I don't hang out on Twitter.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.720]   I don't hang out on Facebook.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:23.720]   I'm on Google+.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.920]   You get even less money than we don't get.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:26.920]   $35, though.
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:27.920]   That is depressing.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.920]   Chad, what's your Twitter handle?
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:30.920]   OMG, Chad.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:33.120]   It's like-- I think it's like a--
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.120]   $4.23.
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.920]   I'll take it.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.920]   That's an iPad.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.920]   I'm hanging out with the wrong people.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.680]   Okay, I don't feel so bad now.
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:42.320]   Does Jeff just tweet like so much more than us?
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.320]   Is that how the--
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.320]   I have no life.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.320]   Katy Perry, $4.4 million.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.320]   Wow.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.720]   Lady Gaga, please.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:54.880]   Barack Obama, $5.2 million.
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:58.400]   Lady Gaga, $2.3 million.
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.920]   So it's not just how much of Twitter, how long you've been there.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.000]   It's all of the above.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.440]   Now of course, Twitter's going to give you absolutely zilch.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:08.440]   Zilch.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.440]   Oh well.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.120]   Oh well.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.120]   What is the--
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:17.120]   It's like saying that because I buy at Amazon, Amazon owes me money.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.120]   Right.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.680]   No, it's not like saying that.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:26.800]   It's like saying if you wrote a sentence a day for five years and somebody published
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:32.800]   those sentences and made a lot of money on that, wouldn't they owe you money?
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:36.680]   It's like saying that the phone company owes me money because they make money off me talking
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:37.680]   on it.
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.680]   No, it's not.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.680]   It's not.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.840]   It's your content that they make money on.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.560]   Yeah, but you voluntarily use the clock.
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:45.560]   Admittedly you put it there.
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.920]   Admittedly you put it there.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.760]   With the understanding that you weren't going to get.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.760]   But--
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:56.760]   So there is a difference between a company-- Facebook's kind of the same, right?
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:01.400]   Facebook, the only value in Facebook and Twitter is the value put there by people who put
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.400]   stuff on it.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.640]   Twitter more so than Facebook because Twitter is all about the content that's there.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:11.120]   See, what really occurred to me is I hope to heck that they gave Chris Messina some friends
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.120]   and family stock.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.120]   Oh, I do.
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.120]   They do.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.120]   Because he invented the hashtag.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.120]   Exactly.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.120]   I doubt very much.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.760]   He added real value.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:26.480]   The woman who drew the fail whale posted on a-- I stock photo and Twitter bought it.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.560]   It's a real tea free for like 50 bucks.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:31.360]   She didn't get any money for the fail whale.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.680]   She got some notoriety and it's gotten a lot of business since then.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:35.320]   But no money from Twitter's stock.
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.520]   Well, I mean if they-- if Noah Glass didn't get anything--
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.520]   That's shocking.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.960]   --then he invented it.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.960]   He named it.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:46.800]   I don't think Messina or the fail whale lady or we are going to get anything.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.800]   Yeah.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:48.800]   So did Noah get nothing?
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.160]   Is that what-- because Nick Bilton wouldn't tell me he was on Twitter this week and he
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.560]   said that he's written the-- hatching Twitter his new book about Twitter as a mystery and
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:59.520]   I said, well I'm reading the last page and he wouldn't let me.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:04.280]   But apparently-- because Noah Glass was written out of the history of Twitter.
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.480]   He did not exist.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:09.120]   Jack Dorsey took great pains to make sure that nobody--
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.840]   It's not a lovable company Twitter.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.920]   Wow, is it not a lovable company?
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:18.200]   The New York Times did a story this week about how dependent Twitter is on developers
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:21.600]   and they didn't mention any of the troubled history of Twitter on developers.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.840]   We've all forgotten that.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.760]   We've all forgotten it already.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.640]   I think these things are messy though.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:31.720]   Like does any company that's gotten really successful and had this kind of money?
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.720]   I mean, isn't there always--
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.720]   So Noah Glass is--
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.720]   So Noah Glass is--
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:36.720]   Yeah, no one--
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:37.720]   --is happening.
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:38.720]   Yes, there often is.
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.120]   --he's going to make a little money off the IPO.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:42.120]   He says-- according to--
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:43.120]   Oh, so?
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:47.320]   --he says Glass stands to make him out as much money as Jack Dorsey's secretary at Square.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.680]   Not at Twitter.
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.680]   At Square.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:57.000]   He hasn't updated his YouTube, his Twitter, his blog in almost two years.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.400]   He's kind of, I guess, gone under the radar.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.480]   He must be a little bit bitter watching the success of Twitter.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.840]   He named it.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.200]   Yeah, that was probably the biggest--
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.520]   I haven't read the next book yet.
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.520]   I'm going to.
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.520]   Yeah, I read the excerpt.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.520]   I have a copy of the book.
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:15.520]   It's on my nightstand.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.520]   I can't wait.
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.520]   Can't wait.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.080]   Yeah, I think it's great that he released it.
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.960]   The timing was perfect.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:24.000]   I think there are things to be learned from all of these.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   Boy does the timing provide.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   I asked Nick.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.280]   I said, did you have some sort of inside information?
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.680]   You must have.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:32.200]   The book comes out two days before the IPO.
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.200]   Wow.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.200]   You can't get rid of that.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.200]   Yeah, perfect timing.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.000]   Somebody in our chatroom, Aaron B, has just put his cat on the keyboard.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.480]   Aaron, if you could just lift the cat off the keyboard--
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:47.480]   There's all these right brackets.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.160]   According, Twitter has announced custom timelines for hashtags.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.680]   Thank you, Chris Messina.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:57.400]   Or topics on TweetDeck.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:58.800]   So I didn't quite understand this.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:03.400]   This is not-- it's kind of like store five, but a little more dynamic.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.320]   I don't understand it either.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:06.640]   Our expert is here, though.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.080]   Gina Trapani of ThinkUp.
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.400]   I thought I was waiting for it.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.560]   You should have a new segment.
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.800]   Explain it to me, Gina.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.360]   Explain it to me, Gina.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.520]   What is it?
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.560]   So you know what Andy Carvin does?
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.240]   I mean, we know what Andy Carvin does, right?
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:20.320]   He retweets.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.000]   From what I understand-- and I actually haven't had a chance to play with this a whole lot
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.880]   in TweetDeck, although I do use TweetDeck--
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:30.840]   is that this ad storeify capabilities in that you can say, all right, something big
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.000]   is happening.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.720]   All my friends are live Tweeting scandal tonight, and I want to curate the best tweets
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.960]   about the show or something else.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:42.760]   And then you can create a custom timeline where you can pick and choose an ad particular
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:43.600]   tweets.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:46.360]   I think you can also do it on a per hashtag basis.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:50.040]   So if there's a live event, if you're at a conference or whatever, and then other people
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:55.200]   can see your custom timeline around a particular event.
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:56.880]   That's my understanding of it.
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.280]   Has anyone else played with it?
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.120]   That would be very cool to have.
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:05.120]   I mean, it's very storeify-like.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.120]   So--
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:10.000]   It's a storeify works with networks beyond Twitter.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.160]   But somebody curates it.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.360]   So it's not automatically curated.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:17.960]   What I'm asking is, if you put in somebody, it says you can add tweets and delete tweets
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:18.960]   from it.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.960]   I get that.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.960]   So that's more like storeify.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.760]   But I have the sense that you can put a hashtag in there and then it will flow in.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:24.760]   Right.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.200]   So you can write a small link and retweets and stuff.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.000]   You have to use the API to control it at that point if you're doing that.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   Dragon drop in.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.800]   That's why I've just created one.
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.320]   Dragon drop tweets into this timeline.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:41.280]   So it looks like, yeah, each tweet has a little drag thing there.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.880]   And so, yeah, so you can add a tweet.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:47.480]   But you're asking, Jeff, can you add a hashtag?
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:52.480]   What if I had the impression that it was a little more dynamic than storeify?
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.400]   What if you had a tweet with a hashtag in it?
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.560]   This is not going to go well at all.
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:02.560]   It sounds like flip board's capability of creating a flip board magazine which you then
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:05.600]   put stories in and friends can subscribe to.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.600]   Is it that?
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.600]   And you can share it.
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.600]   And you can share it.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:09.600]   It's cool.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:10.600]   I like that.
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:11.600]   It is.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.600]   Although because there's an API, tweets can be added programmatically.
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.640]   That means you could use logic operators.
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.480]   You could use hashtags.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:24.840]   You could say if a tweet has this and this but not that, you can then.
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:31.520]   So for Politico, for instance, has created a tweet hub using the API to feed policy industry
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.880]   tweets into this tweet hub.
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:38.120]   This is apparently done by this API.
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.120]   There's no API.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.520]   It's Politico.
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:45.600]   It's Politico's energy insider tweet hub presented by Chevron.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:49.080]   And then I don't know if it's fully hashtag driven.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:53.880]   They have a special energy insider hashtag.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:54.880]   But that's interesting.
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:56.880]   And then more dynamic than storeify.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.920]   Storeify has a past tense record.
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:17:59.920]   Right.
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:00.920]   This is real time.
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:03.120]   It sounds like look, these are 12 minutes ago, an hour ago.
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.520]   And they also are doing it by list.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:08.960]   So they have three columns, energy reporters, energy influencers, energy lawmakers.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.280]   This looks like it could be really useful.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.280]   And it's obviously--
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.480]   Why is that just a list?
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.960]   Why is that just a list then?
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:16.080]   It's probably a list plus, right?
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.080]   A list plus--
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.080]   Plus what?
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.080]   Logic from the API.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:22.320]   The logic may be as simple as the hashtag or it could be more complicated.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.320]   It is dynamic.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.320]   If it is dynamic, it is.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.960]   It's a bit more than what good does it do to put individual tweets in?
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:31.400]   Well, this is interesting because it's dynamic but not chronological.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:35.320]   So I see a tweet from the Heartland Institute that's seven minutes old.
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:37.600]   And that's below a tweet from the salon.com.
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.600]   It's an hour old.
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:40.600]   I'm confused.
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:44.960]   I think with custom timelines, you are actually hand picking.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.840]   It is store-fi like and that you're hand picking tweets to add to the timeline.
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:55.040]   But Twitter does say that you can also do it programmatically using the API.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:02.120]   So which makes more sense because you could write if you were a good coder.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:06.840]   You could-- it says the tweets can also be added programmatically using an API that
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.360]   was announced today as well.
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:13.440]   This allows users of the API to program timelines based on logic operators or to add the custom
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.400]   timeline creation feature to their own products.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.040]   Politico is using this in their tweet hub.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:24.320]   Twitter offers a host of examples of people already using the timeline and these spell
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.960]   out-- this is from Twitter's own-- no, this TechCrunch.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:31.000]   The spell out exactly what Twitter hopes to see it used for including TV shows, live,
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.960]   Q&A sessions, Twitter playlists, and sporting events.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:34.960]   So that's kind of cool.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.480]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.320]   That's really kind of cool.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:42.560]   So in other words, like, "Survivor" could put this page up there like this and then they
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.680]   control-- we're going to say we're going to insert this tweet, we're going to insert
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.680]   this tweet.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.000]   You like what this guy said about this show and then all of a sudden you've got a whole
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   page of content.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000]   But you need to be able to control it if you're a survivor.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.560]   You don't want the weaning--
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.040]   Yeah, what this is--
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.040]   That show their penis--
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.040]   Right.
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.040]   --to get rid of the bed.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.040]   It's for brands.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.200]   That's why it's not automatically populated.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.200]   Right.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.680]   That's why you have to put the posts in manually or--
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:06.240]   You name-- you choose the tweets you want to add either by hand or programmatically using
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:07.240]   the API.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:10.280]   Okay, so you have to apply to get access to this API.
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:15.000]   So there must be an API to just add tweets where you can say, "Show me all the tweets
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.280]   from these people and containing these keywords."
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.360]   And then they stream in and you go, "Yes, include that one.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.360]   Include that one."
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:23.000]   Yeah, so here's Carson Daly's voice timeline.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.080]   A curated timeline from The Voice.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.080]   And they're different hashtags.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:31.640]   It's not always voice save.
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:32.720]   So some of these-- I don't know.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:35.720]   They might have editorial staff dragging these over here.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:37.720]   Okay, yep.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:40.160]   Politico, The Guardian.
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:42.360]   Here you go for you, Jeff.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.840]   The Guardian is using this for a Q&A.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.760]   So it curates the lead question.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:48.760]   And smart.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:49.760]   Really smart.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:53.080]   And so they're using it in a Twitter chat.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:58.520]   Yeah, it gives you some really interesting power in this.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:02.360]   So they've added this to a-- so this is a Guardian article.
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:07.200]   And then they've added at the bottom, selected questions, answers will be featured in real
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:12.160]   time on this page during the chat using Twitter's new custom timeline tool.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:16.200]   See, this is absolutely a monetization strategy, I would guess.
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:17.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.840]   Certainly, it helps brands.
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:19.840]   So it's not a silver thing.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:22.800]   No, it's from brands, right?
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.480]   It's monetization and curation.
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:30.040]   And here is the timeline toasted on Twitter itself.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.040]   Huh.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:34.680]   Well, wait a minute, it says make your own.
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:36.320]   Maybe you can do it.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.320]   Learn how to make your own.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.320]   Well, you can.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:40.320]   Yeah, you can.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.320]   It's in TweetDeck.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.960]   I have it in TweetDeck right now.
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:43.960]   Oh, TweetDeck.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.960]   So you have to use TweetDeck.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.800]   Yeah, but for now it's just TweetDeck.
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:50.320]   You do have to drag and drop individual tweets.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:53.120]   It's the API that you have to apply for beta access.
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.120]   That's in beta.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.800]   That you have to apply access-- apply for access to, which I think they've given their partners
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.800]   access to.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:03.000]   Probably people who are already curating Twitter streams or-- you've all seen TV shows and
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.960]   Q&A's where people-- there's somebody there picking out the best tweets.
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:11.120]   And this is just a tool for them to use versus DoraFi.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.120]   I like it, though.
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:17.720]   I think you could see a lot more brands using this kind of thing, right?
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:18.720]   I think this is--
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:19.720]   Yeah, smart.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:20.720]   I would like to use it.
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:23.080]   Wouldn't it be funny to use this during our shows?
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.640]   It's kind of like a curated chatroom.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.640]   Mm-hmm.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.200]   I mean, the only thing is you need somebody doing the curation.
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.680]   You need somebody doing it.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:34.680]   But yeah, I mean, there have definitely been times when things have happened on Twitter
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:39.080]   and I'm like, oh, I want to remember that or I want to group this group of tweets together
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:40.680]   and remember this thing that happened.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.320]   And I've used StorFi for that.
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.320]   But to have it built into--
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.000]   Yeah, you don't have enough to do.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000]   You can do that too, Deck.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   You can do that.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000]   Right.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   He's like octopus, eight-arm.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000]   That's what I-- he's got time.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   Hey, let's take a break.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   Change log coming up.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   What's new at Google?
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   We'll find out.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.520]   LegalZoom.com LegalZoom.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.520]   Oh, I love them.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.520]   They're not a law firm.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:07.760]   They help you do legal work with a guided online site that makes it very straightforward.
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:12.160]   You get self-help services at your specific direction, but you can also speak to a legal
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:17.040]   plan attorney at a pre-negotiative flat rate to get your questions answered and get ongoing
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.040]   advice.
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.680]   Economy is picking up.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.160]   We're seeing some heating up here.
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.760]   The longer you wait, the longer you delay your potential success.
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:26.080]   It's time to start your business.
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:30.680]   But don't do it without the protections available to you through LegalZoom.com.
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:37.720]   You can incorporate your business or form an LLC at LegalZoom.com just $99 plus the
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.160]   state filing fees.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.680]   That is a great deal.
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:41.680]   $99.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.640]   There are online process guides you step by step.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:45.840]   You get total customer support.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.240]   Couldn't be any easier.
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:52.840]   You'll also save time and money on wheels, on trusts, on trademarks.
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:56.520]   And if something comes up, you go, "I'd like to ask a question of an attorney.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:00.840]   They have attorneys in almost every state pre-negotiated fees."
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:01.840]   Very affordable.
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:04.960]   We're not talking hundreds and hundreds of dollars an hour here.
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.280]   You can look at their profiles.
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:10.880]   You can look at their unedited reviews and figure out what's the right attorney for you.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:14.280]   And you could say, "Oh, what state should I incorporate in one of the pros and cons
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:16.920]   of California versus Delaware?
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:20.360]   I want to do a will, but I want to write my daughter-in-law out.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.840]   How do I do that?"
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:22.840]   Things like that.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:27.000]   LegalZoom.com.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.560]   Self-help services at your specific direction or talk to an attorney, but they're not a
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.560]   law firm.
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:32.800]   They just save you money.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.840]   They don't cost like a law firm.
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.160]   Get an extra discount if you had a twig in the referral box or check out.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.680]   You'll get $10 off.
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:43.560]   Don't wait on the sidelines while others are taking charge of their futures.
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:48.240]   This is a great time to get in the game, launch that business of yours.
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:49.480]   I can tell you myself.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:53.600]   This is, for me, seven years ago, eight years ago, this was such a boon.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.760]   Don't put it off.
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:55.760]   Incorporate.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:56.760]   That's what we did.
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:57.760]   Actually, we did an LLC.
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.840]   Trademarks, the trademark, the twit name.
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:02.200]   We don't have any patents yet, but you can do those too.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.600]   LegalZoom.com.
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.920]   Just use the offer code TWIG to save.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.280]   And we thank LegalZoom for their support on this week in Google.
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:11.720]   Now, ladies and gentlemen, break out the trumpets.
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:15.480]   It's time for the Google change log.
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:24.320]   Here's Gita Tripani.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:28.360]   Two handy useful updates to Gmail this week.
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:32.400]   First, expansion of the capability of Gmail's quick action buttons.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:36.160]   Those are those little gray buttons that appear in the subject line or near the subject
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.160]   line in your inbox.
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:42.000]   Those allow users to press a button next to the emails with a specific call to action.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.520]   So like rating and reviewing a restaurant that you ordered from on seamless or at modifying
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:52.680]   open table reservations, saving promotions from Google offers, viewing YouTube video
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:55.760]   videos, opening Dropbox folders, and more.
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:00.320]   These quick action buttons also include support for opening Google Docs, sheets and slides,
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:03.080]   RSVPing to events, checking flight details.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.800]   This is pretty cool.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.960]   Developers-- and this is open.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:10.560]   Developers can use the schema.org markup language to add their actions to Gmail messages.
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:13.520]   So if I'm sending out-- and this is going to be great for something like think up-- like
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.960]   if we're sending out a mass mail, I can add that markup into my message.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.520]   And in Gmail, I can have a button that's like, hey, join now or watch this video.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:22.520]   So really neat.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.360]   So you're going to be seeing more of those quick action buttons in your Gmail inbox.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.800]   Same deal with attachments.
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:32.320]   Attachments to Gmail file attachments.
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.200]   Now we're more tightly integrated with Google Drive.
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:39.200]   So there's an update to Gmail rolled out today that you can skip the whole process of downloading
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.160]   a file and then re-opletting it to Google Drive.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:47.240]   You can view attachments and save files directly to Google Drive without ever leaving Gmail.
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:50.240]   So you can see them instantaneously.
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:52.200]   So Chad's got up on the screen there.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.320]   If there are images, you get this really nice slideshow.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.240]   There are like instantaneous Google Drive, save all to drive buttons.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:01.400]   You could save all the attachments on it on a particular message directly to drive.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.680]   So really nice integrations there.
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.240]   You can kind of see Gmail turning into something-- continuing to turn into something a lot more
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:10.360]   than just an email client.
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:11.360]   That's really handy.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.360]   I would use that.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:13.360]   Convenience.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:17.360]   And that slideshow is really nice for folks who email pictures around still.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.560]   And lots of people still do.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:20.920]   What else we got?
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:21.920]   Oh, an Android.
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:27.080]   Google has updated the Google keyboard in the Play Store to the KitKat keyboard and
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:32.480]   also hangouts with SMS capabilities are also now available in the Play Store.
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.760]   Now how do I get that?
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.840]   Can I force that?
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.840]   Or will it--
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.840]   You should have it installed.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:38.840]   You should have it installed.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:43.840]   So you should have Hangouts and the KitKat keyboard obviously installed the Nexus 5.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:47.840]   Well, it's on the Nexus 5, but I want to get it on my Moto X.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:49.480]   And did it update automatically?
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.480]   Or if you go to the Play Store to save it--
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:53.160]   No, I'm still on version one of Hangouts.
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:55.320]   The version two is the one that has-- let me just check.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.320]   Just see.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.320]   I bet if you go to the Play Store.
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:02.920]   It might be waiting for you to verify the new access it has.
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:03.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:04.920]   Mm-hmm.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:08.280]   Yeah, when I got the update, I got a little notification that said, "Hey, turn on SMS
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:10.560]   support," or not.
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:15.440]   So this new Hangouts has SMS integration, MMS integration, it has support for animated
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:20.120]   GIFs, and you can set your device status, you know, feeling happy or sad today.
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.240]   And you can share your location and conversations.
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:23.760]   You just tapped a little nap icon.
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:24.760]   I'll send your location.
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:27.680]   I've replaced the messages icon on my Nexus.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.680]   Love it.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.240]   And you're just straight hanging out.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:31.720]   Why?
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:32.720]   One negative.
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:33.720]   Okay.
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:34.720]   I love it.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:36.640]   And then messages, you can delete all the messages.
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.880]   Hangouts, they really want those to go forever, right?
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.960]   You can archive them, but you got it one by one.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.960]   And that's too bad.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.760]   And the KitKat keyboard now is available in the Play Store.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:47.760]   Oh, yes.
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.400]   If you're not running KitKat, you don't get the emoji.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.960]   But you do get a couple other cool features.
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.800]   So you still says build one point.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:55.600]   I don't know.
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:58.200]   So when you went to the Play Store, did it say install?
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:02.680]   I got an update, and it says it's version two, but it still says 1.2 on my Moto X.
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.680]   I'm not sure why.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:05.680]   Huh.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:06.680]   Huh.
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.560]   See, it says this is 2.0.
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:10.560]   I don't know.
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:15.720]   Maybe features come along later, because this says 2.0, right?
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:28.240]   But then when I open it and I go to settings and I look at my about hangouts, I get build
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:29.240]   version 1.2.
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:30.240]   That's strange.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:33.640]   That is weird.
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:34.640]   But I'll vouch for it.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:37.920]   I use it instead of the messaging app on the end.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:38.920]   On the next slide.
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.080]   You can't sideload it.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.280]   I just have been resisting that.
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.880]   I want to do it when it's time.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:43.880]   Yeah.
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:45.880]   Cleaner.
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:46.880]   Do like the KitKat keyboard, though.
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:47.880]   Highly recommend it.
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:48.880]   It's got swipe and everything.
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:49.880]   I love it.
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:51.880]   Yeah.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:53.920]   I've been using SwiftKey, but it looks like there's something in just your space detection.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:58.240]   Is that you can swipe over the space bar and we'll figure out you should have a space
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.240]   between your words.
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.240]   I think that's what that means.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.240]   I'm going to check that out.
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.920]   I think I'm going to switch it back over to the stock of Google keyboard and check out
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:07.920]   the KitKatness.
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:13.160]   Chrome 32, which is right now in beta, has a feature that's going to make everybody,
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:16.720]   especially people maybe who are watching a show like this in their browser right now,
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:22.360]   really, really happy when a tab is streaming audio in the Chrome 32 beta, there will be
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:26.440]   an indicator that appears next to the little X that there's a new tab.
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:28.440]   Why is coming from?
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:29.440]   So great.
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:34.920]   I mean, we've all been, and I've even during this show, I've had a tab start playing an
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:35.920]   ad or music.
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:37.920]   Just be like, whoa, what is going on?
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:39.960]   And you just have to hunt it down real quick.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:40.960]   So embarrassing.
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:41.960]   It's terrible.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:42.960]   It's terrible.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:47.480]   So there's different icons for if a tab is streaming audio, that'll be a little speaker
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:52.120]   icon, a red circle will indicate if your webcam is active on that page.
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:53.400]   It's pretty great.
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:57.440]   And if you're chromecasting a tab, you've got a little Chromecast box icon.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:01.480]   So I can't wait for this to make it into the stable, stable builds.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:04.800]   Really, really nice new feature.
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:08.160]   New Google Maps for the desktop brings back Pegman.
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:12.960]   Pegman is the little yellow guy that you can drop, drop on a map and adds ways data
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.480]   and 3D Earth tours.
[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:19.480]   So ways data showing up on the desktop for the first time, of course, ways data is already
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.680]   integrated into the mobile maps app.
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:26.360]   And the ways integration will bring information about traffic incidents, construction zones,
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:31.080]   road closures from ways, which of course Google acquired earlier this year.
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:34.240]   And this update makes it easier to find Street View imagery.
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:38.320]   It used to be kind of hidden, but now, just like the old Google Maps, you can drag and
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:41.640]   drop the Google Maps Pegman onto any road and bring up the Street View.
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:45.000]   The difference is, Pegman lives in the bottom right corner of Google Maps.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.240]   And I guess it's on the left.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:52.920]   And it's on the top left, sorry, in Google Maps for desktop.
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:59.520]   So I don't know if I understand this one because I've had like ways messages for a while.
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:04.120]   So this is Google Maps for-- right, right.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.120]   This is the Google Maps for desktop.
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:07.840]   So this isn't Google Earth.
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.120]   Or Google Maps on Android, where you've had ways.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:12.120]   Maybe that's where I've had ways on Android.
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:13.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.120]   Maybe that's what it is.
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.120]   Okay.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.120]   Yep.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:18.120]   And what else do we have?
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.440]   Oh, YouTube Capture for iOS.
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:24.600]   The iOS app has added clip splicing and iTunes sound tracking.
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:28.200]   So you can film and edit together multiple clips in order to create seamless footage
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:30.000]   before you upload.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.960]   That's that YouTube-- sorry, yeah.
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:35.240]   YouTube captures that app that lets you quickly film and then upload.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:36.680]   Now you can do some editing.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.760]   You can trim and rearrange individual clips.
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:44.040]   And you can tack on sounds from YouTube audio and your personal iTunes libraries as well.
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:47.360]   That's for YouTube Capture for iOS.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.360]   That's all I got.
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:53.920]   And that's the Google Change Log.
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:54.920]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:55.920]   Sure.
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:33:01.160]   Speaking of Maps, after the Apple Map fiasco, I think everybody thought, oh, well, on iOS,
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:02.600]   everybody's just going to go to Google Maps.
[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:11.480]   Turns out, no, while all the press, all the PR, all of us, we're saying Apple Maps loser.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:15.800]   Only Google lost 23 million users in the US in the aftermath.
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:19.080]   People did use Apple Maps, despite what they might have heard.
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:20.080]   Or maybe they didn't hear it.
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:21.560]   Fanboys will be fanboys.
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:25.400]   Yeah, it was a hit.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:34.000]   Google had 81 million Google Maps users at its peak in September last year.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.680]   It lost a quarter of them.
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:36.680]   More than a quarter.
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:37.680]   Wow.
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:38.680]   Wow.
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.680]   That's-- yeah, wow.
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:46.000]   You know why they rushed out a copy of a version of Maps to replace that.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.800]   So power the default.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:49.040]   Yeah, it is.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.360]   The tyranny of the default is other subset.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:56.080]   Google Glass now has stereo.
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:57.080]   Or soon, right?
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:58.080]   And earpieces.
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:02.520]   Yeah, the new Google Glass is getting those stereo earpieces.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.360]   And Google is announcing music and all access.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:08.680]   Now, I think that's a good sound.
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:11.280]   Now, that's starting to be more appealing to me.
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:12.280]   Mm-hmm.
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:13.840]   Yeah, so you can listen to music.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:17.120]   You say, hey, Google, listen to the Beatles.
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.360]   Or you can say, Google, what song is this?
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.640]   And it will tell you what song is playing.
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.120]   I still think they look kind of doofy.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:25.080]   Yeah, I was just going to say, they look kind of jinky.
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:27.880]   I mean, look how, like, that picture of the lady, she's like--
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:29.120]   She's got a rat back in the ear.
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:29.600]   But you know what I can't wear?
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:30.720]   I have the wacky ears.
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:32.800]   I cannot wear like Apple earbuds.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.000]   They just fall right out.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.880]   So I need that little thing that will hoop.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:41.080]   Yeah, I mean, if you're out running, or--
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:42.760]   I mean, for me, I love to listen to music.
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:43.800]   I love all access.
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:46.960]   If there was a great podcast app in Glass,
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:47.680]   I would love that.
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:50.440]   Pocket Casts, please, we're getting to the Glass.
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:52.200]   But being able to listen here--
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:54.880]   and those phone conducting speakers, good idea,
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.200]   not great implementation.
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:57.440]   Not super good audio.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.520]   It never has been.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.600]   That said, I'm not so thrilled about the idea
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.560]   of sticking those things in my head.
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:06.600]   But I guess if I've got Glass on my head anyway,
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:07.840]   it doesn't get much quicker.
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.400]   You don't want to wacky enough.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.400]   It's the beginning.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.120]   They're just going to slowly add accessories
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:13.160]   till you look like a Borg.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:14.400]   It's just natural.
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:15.320]   But I mean, when you're just--
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:18.000]   You're not putting it in your nose to check your vital signs.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:18.480]   Just a matter of--
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:19.840]   Don't you have your phone with you, though?
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:22.080]   I mean, why not just listen on your phone?
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:22.400]   Yeah.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:24.480]   Like, I don't see--
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:27.480]   I guess because you can skip tracks and see what's going on.
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:30.240]   Because you don't have to look down to skip tracks, right?
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:31.040]   I don't know.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:32.920]   You're not wearing Glass, I can tell that.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:34.600]   You could get in the program now, by the way.
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:38.800]   The SDK-- is the SDK out just yet?
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.480]   I feel like something like PocketCast
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:41.480]   would have to build--
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:41.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:45.200]   Or if Glass natively supported rich notifications.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:49.200]   So the rich notification shade, that has the pause, stop,
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:50.400]   that kind of thing.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.080]   If there was some sort of way that Glass could show you
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.640]   those notifications in a Glass-friendly interface,
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:57.920]   then maybe PocketCast wouldn't have to build something
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:58.480]   something extra.
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:01.200]   But I don't think that you can listen to podcasts
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:03.840]   and then just stream, just say, hey, just stream whatever's--
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.360]   put it in my glasses.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:06.680]   Why wouldn't you be able to do that, though?
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:07.840]   Actually, no, you would, right?
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:09.440]   Because any time a phone call comes through,
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:10.520]   you're getting its Bluetooth, right?
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.040]   Right.
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:11.240]   Right.
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:12.520]   It's just Bluetooth audio.
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:17.800]   They just have to make it whatever the higher rev Bluetooth is.
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:18.320]   Right.
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:20.360]   So you control it with your phone and listen on your--
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:20.720]   Yeah.
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:23.440]   Developers will get access to the Google Glass SDK
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.280]   later this month.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:31.720]   They're going to have a two-day hackathon in San Francisco.
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:33.800]   You have been able to use the Android SDK, I guess,
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:34.640]   in some respects.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:39.080]   But there is now a GDK, a Glass developers kit,
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.200]   that will allow you to build apps that work offline
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:44.240]   and have direct access to the hardware.
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:46.320]   So no invites.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.600]   Anybody invites yet?
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.320]   No.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:52.320]   Some people got invites to a San Francisco event,
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:54.480]   starting on the 19th.
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.920]   I'm waiting to get the notice that I can trade in my old glass
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:59.000]   for the new glass, which will allow me to put my glasses on
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:36:59.600]   the glass.
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.800]   As they do say now in the FAQ, you can sell your glass.
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:04.800]   And they say, we don't want you to, but you could,
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:07.360]   and we won't disable it, just so you know.
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:08.680]   And that's for the developer.
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:10.520]   Yeah, that's for the Explorer program.
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:13.240]   By the way, you can now get in line for the Explorer program.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:16.720]   If you weren't one of the lucky few to get glass,
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:19.720]   if you did not get invited because all the glass holes
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:22.720]   had about three or four invites each,
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:24.680]   if you couldn't get a glass hole to invite you, well, don't
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:25.880]   worry.
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:29.720]   You can now get in line, everybody get in line.
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:31.800]   The Explorer program launched earlier this year,
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:33.400]   Google says it's designed for people
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:36.560]   who want to get involved early and help shape the future of glass.
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:40.080]   We're expanding the Explorer program little by little
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.600]   and experimenting with different ways
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.280]   to bring new explorers into the program.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:46.880]   If you're a US resident and interested in joining,
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:50.600]   sign up on this page and we'll let you know if a spot opens up.
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.240]   While we'd like to invite everyone,
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:55.720]   we can't guarantee invites right now.
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:58.160]   But this is a new way to get glass.
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:00.000]   It's still $1,500.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:01.200]   It's the word of warning.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:08.880]   What is XE11?
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:09.720]   Glass XE11?
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:11.040]   Is that an update?
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:11.960]   Yeah, that's an update.
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:12.960]   That's their--
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.160]   That's the calendar, get directions, that kind of thing.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:18.680]   Mm-hmm, yep.
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:19.600]   And Google Music.
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.440]   So have you got it yet?
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:22.200]   I haven't gotten it yet.
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:23.200]   OK.
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:24.760]   But people are getting it.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:25.600]   Yes.
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.640]   It is rolling out.
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:30.880]   Wired calls it a sad, desperate plea for coolness.
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:31.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.280]   The wired, really.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.280]   Wow.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:35.280]   Nice.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:36.920]   Wow.
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:39.200]   It's sad, it's desperate.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:41.920]   I don't think that's fair at all.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:42.560]   No, it's not.
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:43.080]   This isn't.
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:47.520]   This is silly.
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.800]   I dropped that in there because I just thought it was--
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:51.000]   I thought there was--
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:51.520]   Wired was trolling.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:52.440]   And that's trolling.
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:54.800]   Why does it usually do that kind of thing?
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:55.800]   It's a little disappointing.
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:57.400]   Why are we doing it a little more lately?
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:57.920]   Have they?
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:58.840]   I'm trolling lately.
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:38:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:00.360]   Ever since Evan Hansen left.
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:02.760]   A little bit later on.
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:08.520]   Netflix and YouTube rule online video, Hulu and Amazon.
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:09.440]   Not so much.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:11.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:15.880]   This is traffic results from Sanvine.
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.160]   They seem-- I think they seem fairly reliable in terms
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:20.640]   of what's going on.
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:24.000]   According to Sanvine's latest global internet phenomena
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.000]   report, video streams from Google and Netflix makeup more--
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.000]   I'm sorry, YouTube and Netflix make up more than half
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.040]   of all residential North American downstream traffic
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:38.680]   in the month of September.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:42.200]   Hulu and Amazon together 3%.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:44.080]   Oh, let's not forget BitTorrent and that.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.000]   BitTorrent is number one.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.320]   It is as well.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:49.160]   BitTorrent is number one with 36.35%.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:50.160]   Wow.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:52.000]   That's got to irk.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.080]   That's upstream.
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:56.840]   So what's the difference in upstream and downstream?
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:00.280]   Downloading versus uploading sharing.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:02.960]   Well, I understand-- OK, that was a dumb question.
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:05.040]   Does BitTorrent even show up on downstream?
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:05.560]   No.
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:06.360]   Oh, yeah, there is.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.920]   It is 4% of downstream.
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.240]   36% of upstream.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:11.120]   Does that mean that everybody's seating,
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:12.240]   but nobody's downloading?
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:13.480]   That's what it looks like.
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:13.880]   That's awesome.
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.760]   It makes sense because you would never--
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:16.920]   That's a portion of upstream.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:17.280]   Right.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:20.240]   Well, you would never seed a Netflix movie.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.280]   No, I understand why Netflix isn't on the list at all.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:23.280]   Right.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.120]   Oh, actually, there's 4.44.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:26.800]   Why is any Netflix on the list?
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:29.840]   Is that user data going back to Netflix?
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:31.200]   Anyway, let's forget downstream.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:34.240]   Take that left column off and talk about--
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:35.040]   I mean, upstream.
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:37.600]   Let's just look at-- yeah, zoom in on-- forget aggregate.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:40.480]   Zoom in on downstream.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:45.760]   Netflix, 31% of all traffic in North America.
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:48.720]   YouTube, 18% of all traffic.
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:50.520]   The web, 9%.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:52.720]   It's beating the web.
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.200]   iTunes 3% Amazon video, scant 1.61%.
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:59.280]   Hulu 1.29%.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.120]   I'm kind of surprised.
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.320]   I watch a lot of Amazon video.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:05.600]   I'd like to, but their interfaces and things
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.920]   are so jinky it never works for me.
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:08.080]   Kind of hard to get to this.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:08.800]   Yeah, they got to make it easier.
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:09.320]   It's not like Netflix.
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:10.200]   They need to make it easier to--
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.600]   If it's so easy, you're right.
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:13.920]   There's a lot of stuff I want to watch.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:16.000]   I mean, I'm a prime subscriber, so there's
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.960]   a lot of stuff that I'd like to watch on Amazon.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:18.960]   It just doesn't--
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:19.480]   Right.
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:20.120]   It's not easy.
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:20.960]   I've got--
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:21.840]   I'm a Google TV.
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.120]   I've got an app, and it won't sync,
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:24.920]   so it won't let me watch anything.
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:26.360]   I guess that actually tells you something,
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:27.800]   that it's ease, really, that is--
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:29.120]   I mean, YouTube is very easy, too.
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.480]   Right.
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:33.240]   And YouTube's on computers, I'm sure, mostly on computers.
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:34.160]   But still--
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:36.400]   I don't understand why companies don't jump on this.
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:38.640]   Make it easy to use.
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:42.160]   I mean, I think Netflix has even proven this out
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:43.640]   for a large agreement.
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:45.120]   They don't have the best content on there.
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:47.280]   They don't have no recent releases of movies and films
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:48.760]   anymore, so it's like--
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:51.160]   they don't have the best content, but everybody watches it.
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:53.400]   Obviously, based on the statistic, everybody's using it.
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:53.760]   Why?
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:54.960]   You can hit one button.
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:56.960]   You go in, you've got your stuff at Search Plan.
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:58.760]   You do a search, you hit Play, it goes.
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.320]   That's all you have to do.
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:02.560]   What it means is me is that all these people
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:06.280]   watch Netflix pay Netflix eight bucks a month.
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:06.800]   Yeah.
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:10.160]   Like, these are all paying customers on top of their broadband
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:11.000]   provider, right?
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.520]   Like, YouTube is free, and Netflix still beat YouTube.
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:16.120]   Almost twice as much.
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:18.040]   And part of it is just great product design.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:19.160]   You can watch Netflix and anything.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:20.320]   But think about the uphill battle
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:23.000]   that is to get people to subscribe for eight bucks a month.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.040]   That's a huge accomplishment for Netflix.
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:25.680]   I agree.
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:26.080]   Yep.
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:27.960]   I agree.
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:31.600]   If you talk mobile, YouTube's number one in mobile 17.69,
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:37.480]   then Facebook, then the web, Google Market, which I guess
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:42.600]   is the Play Store and other stuff, 6%, then Pandora 5%,
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:45.560]   then Netflix on mobile 5%, Instagram
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:49.240]   3.53%.
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:54.040]   Netflix for the first time, a source of traffic in Europe.
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:58.560]   It's not huge, but it's 3.45% of all downstream traffic
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:01.200]   in Europe, even though you still can't get it in Germany
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.080]   or France.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:06.360]   They just launched it in the UK and Ireland in 2012.
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:10.640]   Scandinavia and Netherlands in September.
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:11.640]   So that's good.
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:13.480]   Netflix is on a roll.
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.120]   Yep.
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.040]   Netflix is on a roll.
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:17.360]   Consider it could have been near death.
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:18.640]   I think it's not amazing.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:20.440]   I never gave up.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:21.160]   Yep.
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:22.240]   Have you guys used--
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:22.600]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:24.280]   What was the name of that other product
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:25.240]   that they went to ship?
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:27.040]   Oh, I forgot what the name of it was.
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:28.960]   And then they just pulled it back because everyone thought
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:29.960]   that it was a terrible idea.
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:31.160]   When they separated out the businesses--
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:31.920]   So yeah.
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:34.800]   I mean, people were really bashing Reed Hastings,
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:37.240]   who I think is one of the smartest guys out there,
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:40.680]   because they basically wanted to increase your cost
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.000]   of Netflix by a significant amount.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.200]   If you watched just streaming, it was eight bucks.
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:47.480]   But if you also got DVDs, instead of--
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:49.360]   I used to get streaming and DVDs together.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:50.840]   They were going to separate those out,
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:52.880]   and you would end up almost doubling your Netflix bill
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.560]   if you wanted to continue to watch DVDs.
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:56.960]   But it was pretty clear to me what Reed was trying to do
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:59.120]   is get you off the DVDs.
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:43:59.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:00.400]   And it worked.
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:02.680]   I can't remember where the name is.
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:04.200]   Yeah, he had to apologize.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:04.760]   Quickster.
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:05.280]   Quickster.
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:05.800]   Quickster.
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:06.760]   That's what it was.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:09.600]   Yes, and remember, it was like, oh, no, don't screw this up.
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:10.680]   Netflix, don't screw this up.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:11.160]   And they didn't.
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:12.520]   They totally recovered.
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:13.520]   Yeah.
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:14.960]   No, it's hard to do.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:15.480]   It's hard to do.
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:16.320]   It's already getting cut off.
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:17.480]   No, good.
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:19.880]   I was just going to say, have you tried the Redbox Instant
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:20.960]   Streaming, anybody?
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:21.800]   No.
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:24.080]   I mean, they have-- so it's interesting.
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:27.200]   It's somewhat compelling in that Redbox is everywhere.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.600]   So they kind of combine these two things about the go
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:33.000]   get your DVD or watch it online, or you search for a DVD.
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.240]   It's not available to stream, but it says, hey,
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:37.680]   but we've got it at Redbox down the road from you.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:40.160]   You can just go pick it up right now.
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:40.440]   Really?
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:41.640]   That's compelling, huh?
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:42.440]   Well, I think it is.
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:45.240]   I mean, the thing that they have is they have that presence
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:47.240]   that Blockbuster used to have.
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:48.560]   And now it's Redbox that has it.
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.160]   Netflix doesn't have that.
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.960]   So Netflix, you can't go down with Netflix and say,
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:55.120]   I really wanted to watch this on Netflix.
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.000]   It's not available.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.120]   I can't find anywhere else.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.600]   I'm screwed.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:00.360]   But with Redbox, you can say, oh, I really
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:00.920]   wanted to watch this.
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:01.760]   It's not available online.
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:04.720]   But, oh, it's available down at 7/11.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:06.600]   I'll go grab it.
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:10.080]   I think that they have a case to be made for, again,
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:12.600]   kind of the ease of use, quick gratification.
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:14.400]   Again, this is probably US only at this point.
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:17.440]   But I mean, I think that they have kind of like the new Blockbuster.
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.720]   There's Voodoo.
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:24.720]   There's Blockbuster has online streaming still.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:27.320]   But there's always a line at the Redbox at my local grocery store.
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:28.280]   Yeah, me too.
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.760]   It's always-- it amazes me because it wouldn't occur to me.
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:34.160]   But yeah, there's always a line there.
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:37.120]   I think it's just the slow death of physical media.
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:37.960]   No.
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:40.560]   It's because you can get stuff that's not streaming on Redbox.
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:41.060]   Right.
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:41.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:42.760]   Because that's exactly how I do it.
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:44.360]   I search all the streaming channels first.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:45.200]   Can I get it on Amazon?
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.040]   Can I get it on Netflix?
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:47.640]   Can I get it on even YouTube?
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:48.680]   And then you can't find it.
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.760]   And then it's like, well, it's kind of a new release.
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:51.600]   I wonder if it's at Redbox.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.880]   Sure enough, I can get it on Blu-ray or DVD.
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:55.080]   And you go down and pick it up.
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:58.680]   So they're kind of filling that it seems like a little bit
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:45:59.680]   of a hole right now.
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:00.840]   It's a temporary--
[01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:01.960]   It's a temporary hole.
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:02.960]   But it is a hole that exists right now.
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:04.440]   I would want to be in that business right now.
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:07.200]   By the way, can I stream.it?
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:07.700]   Yes.
[01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:09.120]   And then you could just do one search
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.520]   and find out if it's streamable.
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:11.160]   Any of those platforms.
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.400]   Excellent use of Italy's top-level domain.
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:15.160]   Yes, exactly.
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:15.680]   Exactly.
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:16.960]   Including Redbox Instant.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:19.080]   Yep, I use them a lot.
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:25.400]   If you can stream it, you can find it on canistream.it.
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:27.360]   Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:28.600]   I think we can wrap it up.
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:29.520]   See more room and scenes here.
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:31.920]   We're going to be talking to him, one of the legends
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:34.880]   in the computer industry in just a few minutes on triangulation,
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:37.800]   the guy who created WordStar among many other things.
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:39.080]   And QuattroPro.
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:39.580]   Ooh.
[01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:41.920]   Let's not forget the great QuattroPro.
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:43.920]   QuattroPro.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:44.920]   Yes.
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:45.480]   Can't wait.
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:47.200]   We're going to talk to Seymour in just a little bit.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:51.040]   I'm very excited about this.
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:53.560]   T-Mobile adds one million new customers in the third quarter.
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:55.800]   Yes, not surprised.
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:57.520]   That international plan, among other things.
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:59.520]   But I think also the success of--
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:00.360]   The un-carrier.
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.880]   The success of their un-carrier is--
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:02.400]   P-I-O-D.
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:04.680]   It's showing that people really want this.
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:05.480]   Yep.
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:07.440]   So people are telling me that for the international stuff,
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:11.240]   you don't even get 3G, you get edge.
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:12.240]   That's right.
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:13.440]   It's slow.
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:14.000]   But it's free.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.080]   It's something.
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:15.680]   But it's free.
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:16.880]   But it's free.
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:18.080]   Works in a pinch.
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:20.640]   And I've been told I have to buy this app.
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:23.560]   It's called Social Rehab.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:27.480]   Every time I swear, I have to put money.
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:30.400]   My tweet on this was that I would be Effing Bankrupt.
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:34.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:36.400]   I need this because I'm starting to get the--
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:37.680]   you got to watch how it works.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:40.280]   Talk around the baby discussion that's happening in my house.
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:42.280]   But what's nice is the money goes not to just
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:44.800]   to swear a jar, but goes to a good cause.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:47.920]   So you're swearing for a good cause.
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:50.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:55.000]   Annoying Habits takes Sam, for example.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.440]   He swears every time things don't work out.
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:02.000]   Or Barbara, who blows big bubble gum bubbles all day.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.200]   Or Bob, who's biting his fingernails to the bone.
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.200]   Oh, sure.
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:08.680]   Don't you believe there's something about it?
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:10.520]   And can you do that without causing
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:12.400]   them to bear a grudge against you?
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:15.320]   And is it even possible to ever make them control
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:16.920]   these bad habits?
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:19.400]   Yes, yes, and yes.
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:22.280]   There is a fun way to deal with other people's bad habits
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:24.360]   in an easy going friendly manner.
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:27.520]   And you also get to make the world a little better.
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:29.680]   Meet Social Rehab.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:30.320]   The move on--
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:30.880]   Terrible name.
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:33.320]   It's you choose your un-havourable habit.
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:34.120]   And your favorite--
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:35.560]   But it says something about blasphemy.
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:36.320]   Play with your friends.
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:39.400]   Well, it just depends what your habit is.
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:40.000]   So--
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.640]   I want one that will automatically
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:44.320]   listen when TV people use the word actually.
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:45.880]   Oh, I hate that word.
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:47.320]   Hate that word.
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:48.320]   So it's kind of like the answer.
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:49.040]   It's a swear jar.
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:51.360]   It's a swear jar, but it goes to a good cause.
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:52.920]   Which is not-- I mean, you get to cheer.
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:55.240]   I mean, I want to work at Delphi back in the day
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:57.880]   we had to put money in if we said the paradigm shift.
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:58.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:00.760]   And rightly so.
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.800]   All right, we're going to take a break, a little shift
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:05.560]   to the action, and get your tip and your number
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:06.320]   and your tool of the week.
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:07.120]   And Aaron's thing.
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:08.240]   I guess we have a name for it.
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:09.280]   It's Aaron's thing.
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:10.280]   How's the install going?
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:10.880]   It's done.
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:11.480]   That's my thing.
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:12.880]   So after we get down with the app--
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:14.240]   All right, so we'll see what happened to Aaron's.
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:15.160]   See if I break the call.
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:15.760]   Alex, yes, four.
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:17.360]   Is it rigged?
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:18.480]   Let's see.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:21.000]   But first, a word from Shutterstock.com.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.720]   With over-- well, it's more than 28 million now.
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:24.360]   In fact, I like it.
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.280]   It's one of the games I play.
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:28.600]   I go to Shutterstock.com and say, how many images--
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:32.240]   excuse me, how many images are on Shutterstock right now?
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:38.560]   And the total is 30,978,463 royalty-free images.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:40.360]   That's because they add so many images all the time,
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:43.960]   193,953 new images.
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:48.200]   This week alone, Shutterstock is a great place
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:52.960]   to find royalty-free stock photos, illustrations, vectors,
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:54.440]   and videos as well.
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:56.520]   They have subscriptions, images on demand.
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:58.640]   You can buy packages.
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:01.000]   But the best part of all is absolutely free.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.440]   You can create a Shutterstock.com account
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:08.080]   and then start searching for great images on Shutterstock.
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:08.520]   Let's see.
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:12.160]   In honor of your-- let's search for robots,
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:14.160]   in honor of your upgrade.
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:16.280]   And when you search, of course, for robots,
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:18.920]   you can also qualify it with an adjective.
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:21.280]   So I can make sad robots.
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:24.440]   I can make happy robots.
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:25.640]   It's just sad.
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:27.040]   That's a very sad robot.
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:27.880]   It is.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:30.040]   His heart has been broken.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:34.120]   Here's a robot just doesn't know what to do with himself.
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:37.720]   Here's a robot that you could fit in, fill in the caption.
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:38.400]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:39.720]   Let's do a happy robot.
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:42.240]   That's sad to do sad robots.
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:43.640]   These are happy robots.
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:46.440]   You see, with 30 million plus images,
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:51.920]   it's no trouble fighting anything you need at Shutterstock.com.
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:53.640]   Now, you can save these images once you've created
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:57.720]   that free account to a little light box.
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:01.880]   And you can keep it for later or share it with friends.
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:04.400]   There's a happy robot that's found a new hat.
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.200]   It's a tin pot.
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:07.640]   Anyway, I love Shutterstock.
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:08.960]   Take a look at their iPad app.
[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:09.960]   It's a Webby Award winner.
[01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:11.520]   Just a fabulous place.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:13.760]   And if you decide you do want to create a membership,
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:16.240]   or we have a 25 image a day subscription,
[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:21.320]   very good for publications, you can easily do that and save
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:24.080]   25% off on your new account.
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:28.400]   Just use our offer code twig1113 on your image pack
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:32.640]   or your subscription twig1113 for November 2013.

[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:39.760]   Truly a global business.
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:41.840]   They have offices everywhere.
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:42.680]   Look at the languages.
[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:46.440]   Check German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Polish.
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:48.640]   I don't know even what's swami is.
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:51.320]   Turkish, some other language I don't know.
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:54.920]   It looks like Farsi, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Danish,
[01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:59.560]   French, Magyar, Norse, all over the world.
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:00.960]   Shutterstock.com.
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:01.720]   Give them a try today.
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:03.720]   You're going to love them.
[01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:07.480]   Now it's time for Gina Trapani, her tip of the week.
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:09.040]   Gina?
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:11.440]   You feel silly saying, OK, Google all the time?
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:12.040]   Yes.
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:15.560]   We'll actually respond to a couple of other names.
[01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:16.880]   OK, Glass Works.
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:18.600]   Even if you're talking to your phone.
[01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:20.760]   OK, Android Works.
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:22.520]   And OK, Jarvis Works.
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:23.520]   What?
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:24.560]   Because you know what?
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:26.320]   What?
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:27.240]   Yeah, OK, Jarvis.
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:27.680]   Totally works.
[01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:28.360]   Try it out, Leo.
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:29.120]   No way.
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:30.720]   Come on.
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:33.240]   OK, Jarvis.
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:34.800]   It does work.
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:37.760]   OK, Jarvis.
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:42.240]   I said, OK, Jarvis.
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:43.080]   It worked.
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:45.080]   OK, Jarvis.
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:45.760]   What the heck?
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:46.280]   Get out.
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:46.640]   Wait a minute.
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:48.960]   Let me try this.
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:51.520]   OK, Trapani.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:52.480]   That doesn't work.
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:53.520]   OK, Laport.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.720]   OK, Gina.
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:57.000]   OK, Gina.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.040]   Try OK, Barry.
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:52:59.200]   OK, Barry.
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:00.640]   I'm worth more on Twitter.
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:01.640]   OK, Barry Works.
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:02.000]   OK, Jarvis.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:02.480]   What?
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:03.120]   What is Barry?
[01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:05.000]   I don't know what Barry is.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.040]   I couldn't get it to work online.
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:08.760]   It worked for some people and not others.
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:10.560]   I don't know if it's confusing.
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:11.160]   I don't know.
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:12.640]   Android and Barry.
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:15.160]   But Barry works some of the time.
[01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:16.600]   OK, Android.
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:18.600]   OK, John.
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:20.600]   OK, computer.
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:21.600]   That works, too.
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:25.600]   Now, because I'm using a custom launcher, I don't have the Google search bar at the top.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:27.600]   I don't have that always on thing.
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:30.600]   You have to be using the default KitKat launcher.
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:31.600]   OK, Trit.
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.600]   Oh, I heard that.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:34.600]   Wait, it worked.
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:35.600]   Whoa.
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:36.600]   OK, Trit.
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:37.600]   OK, Trit.
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.600]   OK, Trit.
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:40.600]   That was just accidental.
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:41.600]   OK, Trit.
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:42.600]   OK, Trit.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:43.600]   OK, Trit.
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:44.600]   Worked.
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:45.600]   Worked.
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:47.600]   It doesn't work on mine.
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:48.600]   OK, Trit.
[01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:50.600]   Oh, yeah, that totally worked.
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:51.600]   What the heck?
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:52.600]   No way.
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:53.600]   Thank you, Google.
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:54.600]   Finally.
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:55.600]   Wow.
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:56.600]   OK, Trit.
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:57.600]   OK, Trit.
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:58.600]   Didn't work that time.
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:53:59.600]   It's hit or miss.
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:01.600]   Yeah, so just to get away with.
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:06.600]   Hey, Google, which sounds a lot like OK, Google, if you don't want to do the OK.
[01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:07.600]   You want to save a syllable.
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:10.600]   So they just have really loose matching algorithms, basically.
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:11.600]   Yeah, basically.
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:12.600]   OK.
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:15.600]   So the purpose I actually think is just an Ironman reference.
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:17.600]   You know, I think that that's just--
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:18.600]   Oh, OK.
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:22.600]   See, on the Moto X, you really have to train it with the phrase, OK, Google now.
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:24.600]   And they won't let you do anything else.
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:25.600]   I tried.
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:27.600]   Although I should try OK, Jarvis.
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:28.600]   Oh, sorry.
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:29.600]   OK, Caliconis.
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:34.600]   OK, Jason probably works.
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:36.600]   Thank you, that's Gina's tip.
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:39.600]   And by the way, if you speak Australian--
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:46.600]   Oh, yeah, Life Hacker Australia mentioned that you can set your keyboard language to be English
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:52.600]   Australian, but the voice command you need to set to English US because it only works
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:53.600]   with English US.
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:57.600]   And our Australian editors, Life Hacker, say that it works some of the time.
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:02.600]   They try really hard to sound like American English.
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:05.600]   He's trying all different things.
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:07.600]   Awesome.
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:10.600]   Do you have a number for us?
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:11.600]   Jeffrey Jarvis?
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:12.600]   OK, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:14.600]   I'll make a very quick one.
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:18.600]   The average selling price-- and this is before today's Moto G announcement.
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:26.600]   The average selling price of an iPhone versus an Android is $635 versus $268.
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:27.600]   Wow.
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:30.600]   That explains the 81% for Android.
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:31.600]   It really does a lot.
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:33.600]   Google strategy.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:35.600]   Really has paid off.
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:36.600]   Mm-hmm.
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:43.600]   And let's check in with the Galaxy S4 and see how it's doing.
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:45.600]   Yeah, let's see.
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:47.600]   I may have lost power here.
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:49.600]   Oh, it actually booted up already.
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:50.600]   All right.
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:51.600]   So look where this screen is.
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:52.600]   And that's where you have to put it.
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:53.600]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:54.600]   I'm actually going--
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:55.600]   All right.
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:56.600]   So you're now in 4.4?
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:58.600]   So I'm actually going to reboot.
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:55:59.600]   OK.
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:00.600]   So I can finish off the process.
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:01.600]   So let's just recap.
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:03.600]   So first what we did was we rooted the phone.
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:07.600]   We loaded the custom recovery.
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:08.600]   Right?
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:09.600]   So those things were done before.
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:12.600]   And then we downloaded the ROM itself and we downloaded Gapps.
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:14.600]   Then we wiped the phone.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:15.600]   Right?
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:16.600]   We did a factory reset.
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:17.600]   We wiped the cache.
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:21.880]   And then I went back in and I showed you during the last segment that I was actually
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:25.600]   able to load those zip files that I downloaded, the ROM and the Gapps.
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:26.600]   Right.
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:27.600]   So let's pick up there.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:28.600]   And so--
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:29.600]   OK, go ahead.
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.600]   Well, I was just going to say, so I'm going to go back into hopefully--
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:35.600]   Recovery.
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:38.600]   Hang on a second.
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:40.600]   Let's see.
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:43.600]   So you're rebooting into that special recovery mode.
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:44.600]   Yep.
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:45.600]   Just kind of a system.
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:46.600]   Oh, yeah, you are out of power.
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:47.600]   I'm almost out of battery.
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:48.600]   Sorry.
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:49.600]   I have John running.
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:50.600]   Get me some power.
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:51.600]   Let's see if I can do it here manually.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:52.600]   It may not like it.
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:53.600]   It may not like it.
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:54.600]   Let's see.
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:57.600]   This is why you don't do live demos, folks.
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:56:59.600]   Well, that's why you keep it plugged in while you're--
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:00.600]   That's right.
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:02.600]   You did, by the way, really have it plugged in when you do all of this.
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:03.600]   Would they usually tell you to just--
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:05.600]   Yeah, yeah, because you don't want it to die in the middle of--
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:07.600]   Yeah.
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:09.600]   So I'm just going to plug it in now.
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:10.600]   We may have missed that.
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:13.600]   Anyway, the only cool thing there was you just need to select reboot after you're done.
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:17.600]   I was going to show you that the ROMs or the zip files had actually loaded the image files.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:23.600]   So one by one, you pick the zip files first, the ROM, and then the Google Apps, you install
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:24.600]   those.
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:26.600]   Even though it says Apps, you're installing them from that zip file.
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:27.600]   That's right.
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:28.600]   And then you reboot.
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:29.600]   And you're gummy.
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:30.600]   So this is what it looks like.
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:33.600]   This is something custom that the developer put on here.
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:35.600]   All of these ROMs have the worst boot.
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:36.600]   It's called Gummy.
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:38.600]   Yeah, this is the boot loader, you know, whatever.
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:40.600]   So it came up, and that's it.
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:41.600]   So you can see how--
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:43.600]   You're now doing the KitKat.
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:44.600]   And I'm now in--
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:45.600]   Try OK Jarvis.
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:48.600]   Now, I don't know if that'll work because--
[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:51.600]   Let's try it.
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:52.600]   OK, Jarvis.
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:54.600]   You shouldn't have to touch anything, right?
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:55.600]   That's right.
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:56.600]   I shouldn't, if it's on.
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:57.600]   It did work.
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:58.600]   It did work.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:57:59.600]   Really?
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:01.400]   So there's one last step that I need to do.
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:03.120]   So I've got the G apps loaded.
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:07.720]   But one nice thing actually for most people is that more and more of the Google Apps have
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:11.560]   been moving into the Play Store and not necessarily come preloaded on the phone.
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:15.040]   That's so more and more people can load them if they have touchwiz or some other environment
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:16.040]   they want to load.
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:17.040]   Really nice to be able to do that.
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:20.320]   So to finish this up, what I would need to do is I would actually need to go in and load
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:23.800]   Chrome, for example, or Maps, Google Maps I could do.
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:26.600]   I would have to sync my account and let it download all those apps that we were talking
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:27.600]   about before.
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:30.740]   I think that's a step on purpose because I didn't want to go through that's like watching
[01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:35.240]   paint dry even more than what we've been doing here already, right?
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:37.600]   But I just want to show it to you.
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:39.000]   It is working.
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000]   The demo worked for once.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.160]   I think this is the first live demo I've done that's actually worked.
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:45.360]   All the apps are there.
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:48.120]   And should we go in and just verify that this is .4?
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:51.200]   Yeah, let's see what you got there.
[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:52.200]   Tap that.
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:54.440]   Let's see if you get the KitKat dance.
[01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:55.440]   So about phone.
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:56.440]   It says Android version 4.4.
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:58.760]   I know it's hard to see.
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:58:59.920]   So let's see the KitKat dance.
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:03.240]   If you tap Android 4.4.
[01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:05.240]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:06.240]   Oh, oh.
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:07.240]   Hey.
[01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:08.240]   There you go.
[01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:09.800]   Oh, you got it.
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:10.800]   See?
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:12.440]   So I can prove that it actually is now what I have to hold this down.
[01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:13.440]   Yeah.
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:14.440]   And there you go.
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:15.440]   You're going to get the game.
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:17.920]   And it's amazing because you in a minute you're going to get a KitKat and actual.
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:18.920]   Oh no.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:20.600]   What, you said that I'm so sorry.
[01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:21.960]   That's the whole reason I did this.
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:22.960]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:25.880]   Your custom ROM does not get you a free KitKat.
[01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:26.880]   Yeah, look at that.
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:29.040]   It's not doing the little dance.
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:31.600]   This is not unusual with these custom ROMs.
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:32.600]   Things are missing.
[01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:33.600]   That's all.
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:34.600]   Yeah, they probably just didn't load it or whatever.
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:36.040]   They tried to slim these things down.
[01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:40.040]   One of the reasons you load custom ROMs to begin with is to speed up your device or
[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:46.640]   to make the battery last longer, which is why I had the old ROM that I had the 4.3
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:50.520]   running on here because it gave me like, I don't know, three times as much battery life
[01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:54.040]   because it wasn't running all of those things that Samsung wanted me to run in the background.
[01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:56.360]   So anyway, so it does work.
[01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:03.000]   You can go down and you can find the gummy ROM if you want to on xdadevelopersforum.xdadevelopers.
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:08.160]   Go to your particular phone model and see if you have a 4.4 KitKat ROM for your device.
[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:13.880]   They're slowly coming out as people are developing these for, they're downloading the AOSP and
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:17.840]   turning these into ROMs that you can load on your phone.
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:18.840]   Go try it today.
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:19.840]   It works.
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:21.560]   Now I'm going to go play with my phone.
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:23.680]   Go brand brand new device.
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:29.240]   I want to show you because we were talking about the dissatisfying experience with the wireless
[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:30.240]   charging.
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:35.080]   Gina and I had both had with our Nexus 4s and that stupid thing that the nub that Google
[02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:36.080]   was selling.
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:38.440]   And I found something called tilt.
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:39.440]   I can't remember.
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:44.440]   I think this might have been a Kickstarter, but this actually works.
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:50.640]   They make other things as well, but they make the view wireless charger at tylt.com.
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:51.640]   It's not cheap.
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:55.120]   I think it's 70 bucks, 80 bucks.
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:01:00.080]   It wasn't cheap, but boy, does it work great because it's a stand.
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:02.200]   So now I have my phone in a nice stand.
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:03.840]   You can't really put it in wrong.
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:06.560]   Can you show the stand real quickly, Chad?
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:11.760]   So it'll actually even charge the phone sideways as well as in portrait mode.
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:16.400]   And it does a great job because it just seems to work all the time.
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:17.960]   There is a little LED on the bottom.
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:20.120]   It'll tell you it looks light red if it's not charging.
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:21.120]   But look at that.
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:25.000]   I have a nice angle for viewing the phone and it is charging.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.120]   There's a little bit of heat.
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:27.120]   It's warm.
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:30.760]   So that's one of the problems with wireless charging and ducted in space charging is not
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:33.480]   completely efficient, so some heat gets dissipated.
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:34.480]   But I love this.
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:35.480]   It comes in four different colors.
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:36.480]   I got two.
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:42.840]   I got one for the Nexus 5 and I'm hoping the Nexus 7 will charge on this one.
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:49.320]   They claim it charges as fast as a plug-in charger and it will work with all chief phones
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:51.680]   and back doors from any manufacturer.
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:54.440]   So I'm guessing it will work all right.
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:02:00.040]   They say there's no need for perfect alignment, which was one of the problems that you and
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:01.040]   I had.
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:02.040]   Yeah.
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:03.040]   Yeah.
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:04.040]   So hard.
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:05.040]   What is it?
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:06.040]   70 bucks.
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:07.040]   All right.
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:08.040]   There you go.
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:09.640]   Is that because inside the phone the conductive material is spread across the back of the phone?
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:11.400]   Is that why you can put it in there any way you want?
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:13.320]   Well, you know, I don't know.
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:14.320]   You're asking.
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:15.320]   Seems like it must be, right?
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:19.000]   Yeah, I love it that I can run it sideways so I can play plays as zombies as well as.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000]   Exactly.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.740]   You don't have to worry about turning it sideways and all of a sudden you're out of
[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:22.740]   dreams.
[02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:23.740]   Yeah, right.
[02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:24.740]   Exactly.
[02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:25.740]   Yeah.
[02:02:25.740 --> 02:02:26.740]   So you should I should have let you have oh the Galaxy is four doesn't have.
[02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:27.740]   It doesn't have it.
[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:28.740]   Yeah.
[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:29.740]   Sorry.
[02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:32.240]   Nexus 5 does most of the Lumia phones do Nexus 4 does.
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:33.240]   Nexus 7 does.
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:36.560]   And yeah, I kind of think it looks cool too.
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:38.000]   Does have a proprietary charger.
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:39.560]   Don't lose the proprietary charger.
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:44.200]   It does not use USB micro USB for the power cord.
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:47.640]   VU from TYLT.
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:50.600]   Have you reviewed that on BYB?
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:51.600]   Just got it today.
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:56.360]   You have to do a bake off like take two phones plug one in and then oh, you know, which charges
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:57.360]   I will do that.
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:02:59.440]   Yeah, because they claim it'll charge as fast as being played.
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:00.440]   Right.
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:01.440]   Test it out.
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:04.840]   And you know, I have a lot of tablet, you know, these these flat Qi chargers and it's
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:06.240]   just so hard to get it on there right.
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:10.360]   But this every time I plug I put it on there and it the little thing lights up and I know
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:11.360]   I'm charging.
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:12.360]   Awesome.
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:13.360]   Yeah.
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:16.480]   So there you go your Qi charger.
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:17.480]   That is it for this show.
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:19.400]   I want to thank you all for being here.

[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:27.880]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:31.840]   You follow me on Google+, that's where I hang out most of the time.
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:37.360]   You can find me plus Aaron Newcomb or I guess you can just type in Aaron Newcomb now.
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:38.360]   Plus.google.com.
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:39.960]   Aaron Newcomb should work.
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:41.440]   And yeah, let me know what you think.
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:42.640]   I talk about board games.
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:44.120]   I talk about making things.
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:45.680]   I talk about open source, Android.
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:50.520]   And of course I host our co-host a number of the shows here on the Twit Network just
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:55.320]   hosted floss weekly this morning talking about RDO which is Red Hat's.
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:56.760]   Yeah, I don't know if you've heard of it.
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:05:01.320]   This isn't RDO the streaming music service which is what I thought it was at first.
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:07.520]   This is a Red Hat distribution which takes open stack and wraps everything up nicely.
[02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:11.720]   It's kind of like the leading edge of their open stack distribution, their commercial
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:12.720]   open stack distribution.
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:15.120]   Kind of like Fedora is for Red Hat.
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:18.720]   So yeah, you should definitely go check it out especially if you're into open stack or
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:20.000]   cloud computing.
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.720]   Really cool stuff.
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:24.600]   We do this show as I said live on Wednesdays.
[02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:28.080]   But if you can't watch live, we have on-demand versions available after the fact audio and
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:35.320]   video always at twit.tv/twig or subscribe wherever finer podcasts are aggregated.
[02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:40.800]   And then listen in your Google Glass as you walk on the beach of life.
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:42.120]   Is there anything else I need to say?
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:43.120]   Yes, twit.tv/survey.
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:48.760]   If you want to participate in our audience survey, we're trying to find out more about
[02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:50.080]   you.
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:51.880]   Both for our own edification.
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:53.840]   Yeah, click OMG Craft is your favorite show.
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:54.840]   Very important.
[02:05:54.840 --> 02:06:00.320]   For your own edification, our own edification as well as to help us sell advertisers on
[02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:01.320]   our great audience.
[02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:02.320]   God's work.
[02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:03.320]   Yes, God's work.
[02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:06.120]   But I'm being honest.
[02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:09.760]   Also we're looking for great segments from previous shows this year for our Best of.
[02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:13.240]   We do those every year at the years in and we're starting to put those together.
[02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:17.280]   You can do if you have a memory of a great moment, whatever information you can give
[02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:18.680]   us will help us track it down.
[02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:23.120]   But all you have to do is go to twit.tv/bestof for that.
[02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:25.960]   We also are putting the other New Year's Eve as long as we're giving all the URL.

[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:30.520]   You're invited Aaron.
[02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:32.640]   Thank you.
[02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:38.760]   We start 4 AM Pacific New Year's Eve and end 4 AM Pacific New Year's Day.
[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:42.520]   In that time we will say Happy New Year in every time zone of the world.
[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:43.520]   That's awesome.
[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:45.680]   We're looking for people in all the obscure time zones.
[02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:50.000]   If you want to be with us twit.tv/nye.

[02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:52.400]   We've got West Coast time.
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:56.080]   But we're looking for people in Papua New Guinea and places like that.
[02:06:56.080 --> 02:06:58.160]   You can help us.

[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:01.400]   That's the same one actually.
[02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:02.400]   Isn't it?
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:03.400]   As a Papua?
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:04.920]   Anyway, you see all the...
[02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:08.200]   We want somebody in each and every one of those.
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:09.920]   Oh my god.
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:12.560]   Well actually, it could be Adelaide or Darwin.
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:14.160]   You know, it doesn't have to be.
[02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:15.560]   But in every time zone.
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:17.760]   Minsk or Yakutsk.

[02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:23.240]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:24.240]   I can't wait.
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:26.240]   I'm going to stay up all night.
[02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:27.240]   Wow.
[02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:28.640]   And then I hope you get a day off, Leo.
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:30.040]   Yeah, New Year's Day.
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:31.040]   OK.
