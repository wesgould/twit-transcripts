[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.160]   We couldn't do to it without it.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.280]   It's time for this week in Google
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.000]   to show the covers all things Google and Cloud-worthy.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.120]   Oh, that's so good to have the crew back.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.720]   Gina Trapani is back from her move.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.920]   I trust her all went well.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.960]   It did go well.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.400]   And in honor of talk like a pirate day, I have to say.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.800]   A hoy, mateys.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.400]   No, no, come on.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.840]   Give us a good R.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.080]   Oh, actually, Mia, I was hoping you're a pirate voice.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.520]   Arr, me, me, T. There she is, the winch Gina Trapani.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.000]   And I'm glad to see she hasn't left her bicycle behind.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.880]   No, it is behind the office.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.120]   It's a new place.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.120]   It's not on the wall, but it's still there.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.480]   It's like a hot wall yet.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.480]   It's a prisoner.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.280]   And I'm so glad to see Jeff Jarvis back from surgery.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.520]   Hi, Jeff.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.040]   Hey there.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.480]   How you feeling?
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.160]   All right.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.040]   They're doing all right.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.960]   Don't mind me, but I'm doing fine.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.600]   I'm so glad.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.120]   You know, I was following your tweets to make sure everything was OK.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.840]   And your son, Jake, I think tweeted first, saying you went through surgery with flying
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.640]   colors on Monday.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.160]   And I was so happy to hear that.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.040]   All right.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.840]   So glad to have you back.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.240]   And we have a new person on the show today from E-Week magazine.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.600]   He does the Google Watch column at googlewatch.eweek.com.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.800]   Clint Bolton, welcome to the show.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.960]   Thanks for having me on, Leo.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.000]   That's a beautiful, tumbled Connecticut.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.800]   Right?
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.640]   Yes.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.080]   Are the leaves turning and tumbled?
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.920]   I think they would be right.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.520]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.920]   We're getting red, green, gold, everything.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.440]   I'm jealous.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.960]   I'm jealous.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.840]   Beautiful.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.360]   I'm glad you're here because Gina, Jeff, and I have no idea what any of this stuff means.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.480]   Actually, Jeff probably does because he's following it.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.280]   But the Department of Justice has now weighed in on the proposed Google Books search settlement.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.800]   And Gina and I, before the show, we're both confessing that this is all way too complicated.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   We don't understand.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   It makes sense of this.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.280]   It makes sense of this.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.160]   Could you, could you, could you, could it be really useful for us if you'd at least set
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.680]   us up going back as far back as you want?
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.160]   What is the, what is going on with Google Book Search?
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.160]   What's the issue?
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.080]   Well, the thing with Google Book Search is, is obviously it's an effort for Google to
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.240]   catalog, catalog the world's books online.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.320]   They want to take millions of works, especially orphan books, books that are out of print
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.920]   and whose authors can't be found to get permission and to get clearance about this.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.200]   So it's a big deal because a lot of people are up in arms.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.120]   They're concerned with antitrust issues.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.520]   There's concern with privacy issues.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.920]   And a lot of the competitors that Google has, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, they're concerned
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.680]   that Google is going to extend their purview over the internet even more with searches and
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.120]   whatnot if this Google Book deal does go through.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.120]   Privacy issues are a big deal because it involves Google cataloging a lot of the users content.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.160]   When a user goes and does a book search, obviously it gets tracked through the IP address.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.600]   Google says it's not saving that information.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.280]   But the privacy folks, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, want to make sure that
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.360]   there are safeguards in place so that users' privacy rights are protected.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.320]   Seems like everybody has an opinion on this.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.520]   The lawsuit happened and it was a class, I believe it was a class action lawsuit from
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.760]   the publishers and the book authors.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.400]   And that was settled last year.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.760]   Google agreed to set up, there was $125 million to set up some sort of publishing thing.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.760]   Right.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.160]   A Google book writes registry.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.160]   Rights registry.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.160]   Right.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.720]   And this is October 2008 that this deal was signed.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.880]   Now a judge is going to make a decision exactly, almost exactly a year later, I think it's October
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.880]   10th.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.880]   October 7th.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.880]   7th.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.880]   Okay.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.280]   So he'll be ruling on whether this settlement can go forward or whether there'll be changes
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   to it.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.800]   And everybody's filed briefs from Amazon and Microsoft.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.480]   Gary Reebach's been hired, the attorney who got the DOJ, you know, sicked on Microsoft
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.480]   10 years ago.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.560]   He's been hired by Amazon Microsoft and some other parties, including, I think, was the
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:34.680]   EFF part of this group to kind of, I guess, derail the settlement.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.440]   Their, the biggest news this week was that the Department of Justice on Friday filed its
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:48.360]   own brief in which the kind of the bottom line was keep going, keep talking.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.400]   But this settlement isn't sufficient and doesn't rep, they, it sounded like the DOJ
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.240]   said, this is really a matter for Congress, not for a civil settlement that will effectively
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.720]   change copyright law.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   Is that said?
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.320]   But Leo too, it, it, it, the coverage of that, of that DOJ thing was amazing because
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.360]   it was kind of anti-Google and everyone said that the DOJ rejected the settlement.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.760]   DOJ in fact said, and for their own press release, I'll, I'll quote here, that a properly
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.120]   structured set agreement in this case offers the potential for important societal benefits.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.720]   The United States does not want the opportunity or momentum to be lost.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.720]   So they're saying that they want quote unquote improvements in the settlement.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.720]   They still want something to happen.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.440]   I think we have to pull back here and say, what's the good of society and the good of
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.560]   society is to have books digitized, the thoughts in them carried on and, and able to reach
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.560]   new people.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.680]   Well, especially these are, these are books that are out of print.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.680]   They're not out of copyright because copyright is now infinite, apparently, according to
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.880]   Mickey Mouse.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.560]   And so, as old as Mickey Mouse, and as long as Mickey Mouse continues to age, so, so
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.040]   the copyright law.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.720]   And so as a result, a lot of these books are going to be lost.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.080]   They're not public domain, all the public domain stuff.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.080]   There's no question there.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.480]   But, but nor are they.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.000]   And all the things that have authors and publishers associated with them, they have
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.200]   the right to determine what's what.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.080]   And in fact, some of the things people don't like aren't from Google.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.360]   They're from the authors putting, you know, DRM like requirements on, on their own work,
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.960]   which is, you know, that's, that's, that's the world we're in.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.960]   I'm kind of a huge, Jeff.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.040]   I think there's a huge public boon to having this stuff online.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:35.800]   But I'm, but I also fully understand the issues because Google is, isn't just scanning
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.600]   it and saying here, we're going to make it available to everybody.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.440]   There's a lot of restrictions on what they're doing with this material.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.440]   Right.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.440]   Right.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.240]   There's issues in terms of what libraries will be charged.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.440]   There's issues in terms of the revenue split that Google will now be able to sell these
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.960]   orphan books online or they're able to buy.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.960]   They may become a publisher themselves.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.840]   They may say, oh, we got all the orphan works and we're, and I think it was in the language.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   We're the only ones that can.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.960]   That's the issue that's going to get surely opened up here.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.520]   And that's part of the process.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   I think this is a good process.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.520]   Gina, I'm sorry.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.520]   Did you, you were saying something?
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.840]   No, I mean, I was, my dumb question is like, how is this different than the way that Google
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.840]   index is the web?
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.840]   Right.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.240]   That's a good question to be asking.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.400]   I don't think it is very different, but the fact is that there's, you know, when you're
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.440]   talking about, you know, rights holders, and when you're talking about the monopoly issue,
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.800]   you know, Amazon has a big concern about this because they're obviously scanning their own
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.400]   books online and offering them via the Kindle e-reader.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.320]   So they don't want this to happen at all because they feel that they're going to get cut
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.080]   out of a big slice of the pie, the book scanning pie.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.640]   And Tony with their new e-book readers saying we have more books in Amazon because we've
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.640]   got the Google stuff on it.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.640]   Right.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.640]   One million books.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.640]   Right.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.640]   One million books.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.640]   All from Google.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.640]   Google opened up to those other other readers.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.640]   And that's part of what they've been doing in terms of trying to get the PR going here.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.280]   Gina, I think, Bien, I think, Steve, I'm not going to have on later.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.600]   We're going to have Siva on for sure to talk about this in great detail.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   University of Virginia.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.720]   But, and he knows about, he's the author of a book called the Googleization of Everything.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.520]   And he and I clash on this, but in a friendly way.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.520]   But I think the essence of the answer to your question is this.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.880]   In the rest of the web, Google is not the host of the content.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.960]   In the case of these books, Google is scanning the content and becomes the host of it and
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:25.400]   thus gains some measure of potential control over it that concerns people and for which
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.240]   there need to be protections.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.600]   Everywhere else, Google is, yeah, they're putting on their servers so that they can index
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.560]   it, but they are not the host of the content.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.320]   I heard it's interesting because I heard, but to your point, Gina, some have said, in
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.440]   fact, some legal, a number of legal experts have said that they were puzzled that Google
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.440]   settled.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.880]   They would have liked to see Google assert a fair use defense because in fact, it is very
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.240]   much, they're not, when they scan the book, they index it.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.560]   I mean, there is this whole issue of what do they do with the scan.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.160]   They index, I mean, they store it with index, my web page and your web page, they store
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.160]   a copy of it, Gina.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.200]   I mean, on their servers, not the only copy.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.440]   It's not the canonical copy, but they do store a copy.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.320]   What the book search originally was is you search for information and you would get a
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   snippet.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.320]   You wouldn't get the whole book, right, Jeff?
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.560]   Yeah, and it's just like I can do an Amazon today.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.440]   For the books that are in Amazon's database, I can do that today and it's useful, but I
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.600]   can't get to it from the web.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.560]   The ideas are kind of trapped behind Amazon's wall and Google, as is Google's want, wants
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.840]   to open up at least the information.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.520]   When you find that snippet, that information, you then can have the opportunity to buy the
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.920]   book online and read it and Google will sell it to you if the author and publisher ever
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.080]   agreed and if they can find, set author and publisher.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.960]   So it is a different structure, but you're absolutely right.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.400]   There's a fair use issue here we have to be careful of because if Google and Daylife
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:55.200]   where I work and Bing cannot hold on to a copy of content so they can be smarter about
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   it, then there goes search.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   Wow.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.360]   Well, let me ask Clint this, actually.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.920]   Do you have a sense of why Google didn't assert a fair use defense?
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.720]   Why Google went right to the settlement?
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:19.960]   I think they thought that paying the $125 was the quickest way to solve something that
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:25.640]   could have lasted, a suit that could have lasted for years and years.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.160]   But I don't think Google for competitive reasons wanted to wait on this.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.720]   I think they want to do this as quickly and as cleanly as possible, which is why I think
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.280]   they made that payment or tried to make that payment October 2008.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:44.760]   And I think they want things to go as smoothly as possible because again, this is about competition
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.560]   here for Google and the faster that they can do this.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.480]   Look, they index the web faster than anybody.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:56.960]   And they cultivated over 11 years a search dominance by being the first to everything
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.960]   after a while.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.440]   And that's really what they want to do with Google Book Search.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.080]   They want to get in there first and they want to index as many titles as they can online.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:10.120]   It's going to increase search traffic and it's going to increase advertising revenue
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.520]   because everybody's going to get it cut.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.840]   Well, and at the time that made the settlement, I think Microsoft was still doing this.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.880]   So there was some competition for Microsoft, but Microsoft's pulled out of their book
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.880]   scanning initiative.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.880]   Right.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.000]   Microsoft pulled out in May 2008.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.560]   So and it really it's Google and nobody.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.360]   In fact, some people said, well, if Google doesn't do this, who's going to do this?
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.360]   Is there anybody?
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.360]   Right.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.360]   What is this?
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.360]   That's exactly the issue.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360]   No one's doing it.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.360]   The publishers have had digital copies for years.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.360]   They haven't done anything about this.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   They could have set up this structure.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.360]   I was wondering whether there was a cloud way to do this.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.880]   Is there a way that you could have a Gutenberg project like way with these reference books
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.880]   where we the people put it in the cloud somehow, but somebody has to do the work, which is
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.960]   very expensive and store it, which is also expensive.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.600]   And Google's the one that stepped forward.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.480]   I think the main issue is that as long as others aren't prevented from doing this, that's
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.480]   the real issue.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.400]   Why is anyone else willing to invest in this?
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.280]   There's also the issue of bad metadata.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:14.400]   Jeffrey Nunberg, who's a linguist and has a library blog says, if you've looked at the
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.400]   metadata, it's got awful.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.560]   He said, "Have the books are from 1899," even though none of them are from 1899.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.400]   And he says, "It's not useful for researchers."
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:29.400]   So some of the benefit to the public of this is it may not materialize.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.480]   Now I think Google probably feels like, "Well, this is something that we can crowdsource
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.240]   that the internet can solve."
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   I wish they'd opened it up.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.960]   That's exactly the way the reflex.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.240]   Some other great things like footnote.org, I think it's called that enables people to go
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.800]   into all kinds of databases and annotate them and link them and add stuff together, add
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.800]   data to them.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.360]   There's also the Smithsonian, I think it is, with the Library of Congress photos that are
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.160]   up on Flickr.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.600]   It's exactly what we ought to do is have this as an open project of all the people.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.480]   I think that that's what I hope from, and who knows what the judge is going to do, but
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.480]   that's what I would hope from all of this is, yeah, Google, there should be some oversight
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.480]   and needs to be opened up.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.120]   I think I would hope that Google wants to do this and make it more open and assert maybe
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.960]   not, they're not going to monetize this by selling the books.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.320]   They're going to monetize it as they monetize everything else.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.000]   It's more eyeballs, right?
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.560]   Do they need to sell these books?
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.800]   Could they not make these somehow more open and available to others?
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.360]   I think that would solve a lot of concerns.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.840]   Well, but that was the offer back was to say that we're not going to open this up so
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.840]   that we lose value.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.040]   We will help the data.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.800]   That was their response, I see.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   Right.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.720]   So privacy concerns because that's a lot of scholars are very worried that Google will,
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.040]   as you said, monitor who's reading what.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.320]   You go to a library, libraries are very careful and try very hard despite the Patriot Act
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.760]   to protect users' privacy.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.320]   Google has none of those restrictions.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.600]   Is that, do you think that's an issue, Jeff?
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.680]   Privacy is always a concern and it's always there.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.840]   The problem is I think that it becomes the default response to everything today is to
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.080]   raise privacy flags and worry about that and then to lose sight of the benefit of public
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.560]   instead of having these things in public.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.160]   It's terms of use.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.560]   It's the time the data is held and it's subpoenaable and we subpoena it.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.880]   Those are the issues the same with our web habits.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.880]   No difference, really.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.400]   I made this point to the NPR.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   Just like the web.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   Sorry.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.040]   That's what I said to the NPR producers.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.680]   Your internet service provider knows everything about you, knows a lot more than Google knows
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.680]   about you.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.000]   I don't hear everybody worried about that.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Go ahead, Jean.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.840]   Yeah, that's what I was just going to say.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.120]   Google knows all the web pages that you find.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:47.360]   If they know all the books that you look at, it's the same exact issue as web search.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.800]   Going back to what you were saying earlier about crowdsourcing this and opening it up,
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.880]   the recapture acquisition is a very tiny step toward that.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.200]   Let's talk about that because recapture, I thought, was owned by Carnegie Mellon.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.760]   I thought this was an open project, but Google just bought it.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.840]   Tell us about why recapture helps Google book.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:14.320]   Well, the way that recapture works is that there's two words.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.000]   It's basically the, you know, prove your human little form, right?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.480]   But there are two words, one that the web page knows what it should be and the other
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.320]   that it's not sure what it should be, but you don't know which one it knows.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.080]   So you type in both words.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.040]   And if you're correct on the first one, it assumes recapture is that you're correct
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.040]   on the second one.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:37.520]   The second image is a scanned piece of text that the OCR software wasn't able to determine
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.520]   was correct.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:43.160]   So in a sense, you're helping them, you know, text, you know, recognize text on books.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.200]   So now if if books or Google hasn't done this already, I'm sure they will.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.000]   The bits of text from those old books that the OCR didn't didn't work for.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.360]   They're going to chop them up and send them out via recapture, which is across, you know,
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.760]   so many sites at this point.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.920]   And, and humans will be helped.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.560]   You know, it's funny though, that as far as I could tell, Google didn't use recapture.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.360]   I just sign up for a bunch of Gmail accounts so we could have Google voice accounts for
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.680]   all the shows and it never used recapture.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.200]   Used its own capture, which wasn't as good as recapture.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.920]   So I hope they start using recapture across this across across Google.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.680]   It would be nice.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.360]   So yeah, I mean, it would be bizarre if they did.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.360]   All right.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   Well, that's good news.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:31.120]   News story that was a big news story this week and we will be talking a lot more about book
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:36.680]   search in the next over the next month as we get closer and closer to this judicial decision.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.080]   And I don't think that the judge is going to decide everything.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:46.600]   That's my sense is that the judges October 7th, the judges going to have a hearing, but
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.200]   he's not going to decide anything at that time.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.400]   Or is he?
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.880]   I'm not clear exactly.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.680]   It's a true.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.680]   It could.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.800]   He could, but there's a good chance this is going to be drawn out.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:06.160]   I expect Judge Denny Chin in the Southern District of New York to really take a hard look at
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.480]   this and especially paying attention to what the Department of Justice has said, looking
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.320]   at the antitrust concerns and concerns about monopolization of Google Book Search, the
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.920]   privacy concerns, the class action concerns.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.680]   They're not the DOJ is not happy with the way Google Book Search deals with the federal
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.800]   rights procedure rule 23.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.600]   So this is something that is going to get dragged out.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.560]   And I expect Denny Chin to ask Google to make a lot of the changes that the Department have
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.560]   just adjusted.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.680]   I actually thought the D.O.J. brief was really pretty good.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.280]   I mean, it really addressed all the issues.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.800]   It also said that some of this stuff really shouldn't be decided by anybody but Congress.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.000]   This is not the place to decide some of these copyright issues.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.400]   So maybe some of those things will be thrown out.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.720]   Anyway, as I started to say, we're going to be talking a lot more about this.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.640]   And when Siva comes on, I think we might even spend a whole show talking about the Google
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.680]   Book Search because I agree with you, Jeff, this has potential, huge potential.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.160]   We want these books scanned in.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:14.640]   We just have to do it in a fair and correct way.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.360]   And Siva understands where all those issues lie.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.280]   I don't think he'd disagree about the benefits here, but he understands, well, I can say
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.680]   it far better than I can.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.080]   We're seeing dangers.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.600]   So besides buying recapture, there was a rumor created by one single tweet, I might
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.920]   add, that Google might buy Bright Cove.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.480]   Is there any news on that?
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.000]   Or is that just that one tweet?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   And then it just disappeared.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   It seemed like something--
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.480]   I was saying that he wore a bunch of retweets.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.320]   Yeah, Clint, what have you seen?
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.320]   Everybody retweeted it.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.320]   Right, exactly.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.320]   Everybody retweeted it.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.320]   That makes it true.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.840]   And then I think somebody went out and disproved it, or at least said that there was nothing
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.440]   going on along those lines.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.320]   OK, it was Mark Leger of PBS's Media Shift who tweeted it.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.480]   And I guess that's some credibility.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.480]   Right, right.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:07.200]   Well, everybody wants to now with the acquisitions of Google trying to acquire on two technologies
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.480]   and then recapture everybody wants to take a look at what Google's going to buy next.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.480]   It's very fashionable to figure out what direction they're going in next.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.480]   Yeah, what are they up to?
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.360]   Yeah, if you get a company like Bright Cove on top of YouTube, you can make a case for
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.000]   Google owning video on the web.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Right.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.400]   Somebody get commented that they wish we had talked more about Android last week.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.720]   I'm going to let Gina-- Gina is the resident Android expert.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.560]   There were a couple of Android phones announced and very interestingly a tablet from Arcoast
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.480]   the Arcoast 9 built on the Android platform.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.880]   Did you look at any of these, Gina?
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.880]   With interest, I know.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.880]   Hey.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.880]   I didn't.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.960]   I haven't seen them yet.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.720]   I'm actually-- I'm excited about the October 11 release.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   Is it the hero?
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.080]   It's coming the 11th.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.080]   The hero, yeah.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   HTC hero, yeah.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.120]   I didn't get a chance to check out the new ones that came out, but I'm very excited.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:06.360]   There's a Motorola click which is-- the UI is completely redesigned.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:12.240]   It's Android under the hood, but it floats by tweets and Facebook postings like the screen
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:17.120]   savers floating around with all your social cloud of stuff going around, which is kind
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.120]   of--
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.720]   I can see that being irritating or groundbreaking.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.320]   But it goes back to--
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.320]   It's a fine.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.520]   Ris Meyer said-- as I quoted a few times here, that we're talking about the hyper-personal
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.520]   news stream.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.520]   Right.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.880]   Dave Weiner talks about the river of news.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:35.200]   I think that this idea that once you're ubiquitously constantly connected, then the idea that something
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.760]   rings for you is a bit odd.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.760]   Right.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.760]   Who needs a ring?
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:49.160]   Like, click does seem like a very socially oriented phone, a social networking phone that
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:54.280]   I think that it is well timed for Christmas season, for the holiday season, the buying
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.600]   season.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.720]   This is something that could really take off with teens and 20-somethings who are using
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.040]   social networks to communicate.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.040]   It could be a big deal.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.520]   It could be a big deal for Motorola who really needs a big win here.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.280]   The hero does some of the same things.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:15.520]   It's not as-- I think the click is for people under-- people Jake's age, people under 25.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.000]   And the hero is more for people Gina's age.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.560]   And I've got a razor for you and me, Jeff.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:27.240]   I think that Motorola Raze is going somewhere.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.200]   A phone, a just a phone.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.280]   The hero is going to, apparently, with a UI, going to surface-- also surface flicker
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.720]   pictures and things like that.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.760]   This seems to be a trend in Android devices.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:45.320]   That's maybe one complaint people have about Android, is that it's UI is kind of stuffy.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.960]   But you're not tied to the UI at all, it sounds like.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.600]   You can do anything you want with it.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.760]   You won't want to tie to it.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.120]   And later on, I'll talk about it in my tip.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.480]   My love for Android was renewed this week because I flashed.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.280]   I installed a custom ROM, which was very exciting.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.640]   I'll talk about that a little later.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   This isn't donut.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.640]   This is firmware.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.640]   It's a different developer.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.400]   It's a custom build of Android that actually pulls in some of donuts and features, which
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.320]   is pretty cool because you get them on the G1.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.320]   Save it.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   I should mention--
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.320]   We know it's funny.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.320]   Go ahead.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.320]   Go ahead.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.760]   I was going to say you start to save different generations on the web.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.600]   I would love to talk about the mint acquisition and some of the reaction about that.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.000]   Now, Gina has always been very clear with me on this show that it's not just Google,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.760]   it's cloud computing as well.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:41.720]   And in fact, because of you, Gina, and your blog post saying it's safe to use mint, I
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   installed mint and actually because of that and the iPhone application, fell in love with
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:51.360]   it, put every account in there, and then quickened to it bought it.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.360]   Bummer.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:58.280]   Well, first let me say at some point I said, you know, I'm just going to stop being paranoid
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.520]   and given and try out mint.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.880]   I mean, I know it's as safe as far as its privacy policy in terms of use, that kind of thing.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.880]   And I love mint.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.880]   Oh, I do too.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.880]   Oh, fantastic.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:13.280]   And I went to it because I didn't want to use quickened anymore.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.960]   So you hear about the intuit acquisition.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:20.080]   It's just like, oh, I mean, intuit had quickened online, which wasn't terrible.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.680]   And there was an iPhone app, which wasn't so bad, but mint was better.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.640]   But I thought the reaction was interesting.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:32.080]   37 Signals, Jason Freed posted a post about how mint gave in to the old generation.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.040]   The old generation is sucking up the new generation of the web.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.400]   And I thought that was such an interesting reaction because actually I think it was Derek
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.360]   Pausack who said, you know, the web, there are no generation.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.360]   Right.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.520]   We're all the web is just a stream and we're all in it together.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.520]   You know, the general.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:54.120]   Hey, you know, if somebody offers me $170 million, I don't know if I'm going to be so
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.120]   worried about generations.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.120]   What are you going to do?
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.560]   Come home and say, honey, I truly down $170 million and I'm such a good guy.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.800]   They were the wrong generation.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.880]   I just couldn't go with it.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.360]   You know, man, they were there.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.360]   That was the old school.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.360]   Well, let me ask.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:11.720]   There was always about about VCs forcing this, but Fred Wilson on his blog, ABC.com,
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:16.120]   who was obviously a VC said, you know, it doesn't really happen much that way.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:21.000]   But if the founders want to sell, you're pretty foolish to keep to force them not to
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.360]   because they're going to be pissed.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.360]   Right.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.640]   And I've been thinking about a few times, I think with delicious and places like that,
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.480]   where somebody comes home and they say, well, here's a life changing amount of money.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.840]   I'm taking it.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.880]   I think I think that that was such a huge amount of money.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.880]   I can't see how anybody could turn it down.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.880]   So maybe my friend.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.640]   Well, you know, how is this any different than, you know, a larger entrenched company
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.240]   buying a startup?
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.720]   You know, I mean, what is what is the difference?
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   This has been going on.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.720]   Exactly.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.720]   I'm out of mind.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.600]   Nobody, nobody complains when IBM goes and buys a startup, you know, or when Microsoft goes
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.680]   and buys a startup.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.960]   He did hear some outcry when Google went to acquire onto technologies.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.520]   But those are, you know, for different reasons.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.520]   So I don't know.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.080]   I don't understand what everybody's getting upset with.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.720]   Although I should clarify that I'm not an intuit or a min user.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.720]   You're right, Glenn.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.680]   It's interesting too that if you think back to other companies that have screwed up startups
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.480]   they bought, the worst, I think was AOL.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.080]   Everything it bought died or turned to crap.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.160]   Yahoo is half and half.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.480]   It really depends on what happens to the company.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.480]   Right.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:29.360]   So I should point out stealthily and sneakily AOL has snuck back in and now they have, you
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:35.440]   know, a dozen very profitable properties and all of a sudden AOL is the king of the blogs.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.280]   You know, I mean, getting web logs, Inc. and a few other things together.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.840]   AOL kind of reinvented itself.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:47.960]   So I don't know if you can say AOL, you know, certainly the time Warner thing was a bad
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.960]   idea.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   Right.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.960]   Who's done bad?
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.680]   We've done badly with a lot of its acquisitions.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.480]   In fact, we were trying to get Yuri Angstrom on and we're still trying to get him on of
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.320]   Jai Koo fame and one of the companies Google bought and didn't really seem to do anything
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.320]   with Yahoo, of course, famous.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.600]   Although again, they have a ton of properties that are incredibly successful and valuable.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.600]   AOL.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.600]   Well, there's a bad one.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.800]   In fact, the latest news on Skype is it looks who knows what's going to happen now.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.160]   Lawsuits are flying.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:23.040]   Yeah, it's absolutely all tied up in legal.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.600]   It's a huge amount of legal, legal in burlios here.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.760]   And it's not clear how that's going to shake out, but it seems as though the direction that
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.600]   it's heading in is that eBay shareholders could take a big hit from this, depending how the
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   lawsuit shakes out.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.600]   I don't care if they take a hit as long as Skype doesn't go away.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.600]   Right.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.040]   Well, yeah, that would be disastrous, but I don't see how that could happen.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.280]   I really don't expect.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:51.440]   I mean, there's almost 500 million users of Skype and that would absolutely be disastrous.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.480]   Talk about too big to fail.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.600]   I mean, I was talking about this on the radio show.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.120]   Johnson sent in the troops to keep the steel factories running.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.920]   I wonder if Obama would send in, I don't know what he'd send in, the IT guys to keep Skype
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.920]   running.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.680]   Talk about too big to fail.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.160]   We can't lose Skype.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.640]   This whole show, this is my whole network's running on Skype.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.640]   Right.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:19.280]   There's really nothing you can do about it until this copyright infringement suit is settled.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.280]   They own the IP.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.920]   They own the core source code technology, and there's nothing that can be done about that
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.960]   unless that's settled.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.600]   This is going to be tied up.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:34.440]   I expect a cash settlement of some sort, a big one coming going to the Skype guys, or
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:40.120]   the former Skype guys, I should say, now the jolted guys.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:45.440]   I expect them to get a big cash settlement, and possibly for them to try if they could
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.200]   make another run at Skype, because this is not a done deal.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:55.960]   Skype, eBay selling 65% of Skype to Silver Lake and other investors, Andreessen Horowitz.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.520]   This is far from a done deal, especially with these lawsuits.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.200]   There's a lot in the way that this is going to go.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.760]   I was trying to figure that out.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.760]   Is that one of the scenarios?
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.840]   Is that put them in their position where I couldn't figure out how this happened?
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.680]   What does it put the founders in a position to be able to take the company back over because
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.680]   of the suit?
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.760]   Is it a use around everybody else?
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.760]   How would that work?
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.760]   They own the IP.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.760]   I believe so.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.160]   They own the IP.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.080]   They have the golden snitch.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:27.480]   They can buy a lower place that's out there now because otherwise they're going to get
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.480]   paid the rest.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.080]   Whoever's got whatever else they have, all they have is a name and some a ball of useless
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.080]   technology.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.080]   Right.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.400]   It's just like Quidditch.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.080]   You can play and be leading in points for three hours and somebody gets a snitch.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.080]   It's all over.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.080]   That was very geeky.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   Without that IP, Skype doesn't have the value to the investors that are putting money into
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.080]   it.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:00.320]   The $2 million or whatever it is, there are $2 billion that they're investing into it.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.600]   Without that intellectual property, it's going to be a huge problem.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.600]   What do you got?
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   You got nothing.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   Right.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.520]   The paywall got a little higher.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.520]   This is one for Jeff Jarvis.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.560]   It's got a little higher this week when Wall Street Journal said, "Oh, by the way, those
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:20.240]   of you who use our iPhone application, we may from time to time charge you to read."
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.720]   This is what Rupert Murdoch said would happen.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.640]   The journal is the only publication ever that I know of that succeeded with a paywall.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.920]   The journal in the end, the Financial Times.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.920]   The reason is it's...
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:35.560]   Yeah, frankly, I thought it was always odd that the journal's iPhone app was free.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.600]   It was a backdoor I think somebody forgot about along the way.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.040]   Now Rupert said, "Would you close that kid?"
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.600]   Well, there's one more backdoor.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.320]   I'd be really mad if they close this.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:50.480]   If you find a Wall Street Journal article with Google News, for reasons I'll never understand,
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.680]   you can click through to that journal article and read it in full.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.400]   If you try to go it otherwise, it'll say, "Well, you're not a subscriber.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.120]   You can only read his summary."
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.120]   Hmm.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.880]   Because there are people there who understand the value of marketing and links.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.760]   I saw...
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.200]   We've got to figure that out in this.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:15.400]   I saw that the BBC, I forget the number, puts out a few 10 million links, clicks a month
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   to other news sources.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.600]   I have to look that up in a minute and I'll find that.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.520]   Whereas as I mentioned on the show before, Google News sends out a billion clicks a month.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.520]   Wow.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.000]   So you'd have to be pretty much a fool to pass that up to your competitor because your competitor
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.720]   stories are right there.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.720]   That's interesting.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.320]   You don't think it's a case of oversight as it was with the iPhone.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.480]   You think this is an intentional hole, but it's a pretty big hole.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.000]   I mean, frankly, I don't need to be a...
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.200]   I am, but I don't need to be a Wall Street Journal online subscriber because I just use
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.200]   Google.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.960]   Plus, if you come to an individual screen, that's not the value of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.600]   The value of the Wall Street Journal is to be an insubscriber.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600]   Right.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.600]   Right.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.600]   And maybe it'll become a subscriber.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.440]   It's the best way to sell online.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.240]   Your content is your ad.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.200]   And so it's the best way to sell your own assets.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.880]   So they're hoping maybe after a few times going to Google News to get the story, I'll
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.400]   just buy it and use it on it.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.160]   And don't forget their traffic is low.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.600]   And so this causes more traffic.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.800]   It causes more inventory on that traffic.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.840]   Their traffic is low because of the paywall, you think?
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.840]   Okay.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.840]   So they need...
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.340]   That's part of the reason they bought market watch back in the day is they needed open free
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.560]   traffic to get more inventory.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.840]   That's the problem with the paywall.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.880]   It's kind of this catch-22.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.880]   And if you don't get people to pay, then you're really screwed.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.880]   Right.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:34.720]   You charge $100 a year for a subscription, which no one else is doing.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.080]   But if people...
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.120]   There's many, many other sources, obviously, as everyone here knows, to go and get news.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:44.520]   Some 20-something-thousand news sources indexed by Google.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.640]   Why are people going to go to the Wall Street Journal?
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.840]   What is the impetus?
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.320]   What is the...
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.920]   What reason would they have to go there for $100?
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.800]   And a year?
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.080]   I mean, that's a lot of money when everybody's used to getting stuff for free on the web.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:03.120]   So I just read a great essay from Paul Graham of Y Combinator.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.120]   Love him.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.120]   Before I got on here here.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.120]   Oh, man.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.120]   Wonderful essay.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.280]   It's arguing that we've never bought content and publishers have never sold it.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:15.160]   But if we did buy it, then better content would cost more.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.520]   Instead, it's the form that dictates...
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.520]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.520]   ...right-tresting.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.880]   They said that selling information is different.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.200]   That's why, in fact, Wall Street Journal does do well.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.000]   That's why I'm paid because people make money on it.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.200]   That's why the Bloomberg terminal is worth a lot of money because you're buying information
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.200]   in that case.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.320]   We don't really buy content.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:40.360]   The only way to sell it in the future, he argues, is either by getting it through the
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:45.440]   side door, which is advertising, or by attaching it to a device.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.640]   Because that's the form.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.880]   Then you're buying the form.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.880]   Well, that's brilliant.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.480]   I just think he's amazing.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.680]   That's an interesting take.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:34:00.320]   Is it kind of the take of Chris Anderson and Free?
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.480]   Is it the same basic thought?
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.280]   I think so.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.080]   Graham goes through...
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.680]   I blogged about it quickly and I said, "I've got to think about it a little more, but
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   I've picked it up there with Clay Shurky's amazing essay called "Think in the Unthinkable
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.360]   About Newspapers and Why Pay Won't Work."
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:21.000]   He's looking at it in that very abstract, wonderful way, but then goes into every possible
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   kind of content and says, "Why charging won't work and why this is where we are and how
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   we have to look at it."
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.640]   Then he also says, he apologizes at the end for saying, "I'm sorry I'm writing about
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.880]   this in the context of old forms.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:39.120]   That's because I don't know what the new forms are."
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.280]   Paul always blows my mind.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:45.000]   I like to read his stuff because it just opens up all sorts of thoughts.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.800]   I want to take a break, talk a little bit about audible.com.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.120]   We have a phone number now that people can call us.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.480]   We actually have a Google Voice line.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:35:00.200]   If you want to call with feedback or questions or suggestions, 97.95 Twig VM.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.200]   That's the easy to remember.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.400]   It's sort of easy to remember.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:09.840]   97.95 Twig VM or just plus 1.979.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.000]   589.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   4486.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Leave a message.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.560]   Remember that when you leave a message, you're giving us permission to use it on the show.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.720]   Try to keep it under a minute.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:23.280]   I'm not likely to use it if it gets too much longer because Jeff has pizza night.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.360]   We can't go on and on and on.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:30.680]   We have 80 calls and I'll get to a few of them in just a little bit.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.720]   Before I do that, I want to thank our sponsor today.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.120]   Of course, audible.com.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.720]   Publishers of Jeff's great book and audio, but many other books.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:45.720]   I got in trouble last time.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.720]   Did you?
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   Too many plugs for the book.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.720]   What would Google do?
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:50.720]   I was just trying to joke about the fact that they wouldn't let me plug.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.720]   What would Google do?
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.720]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.720]   Not this week.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   If Google had an audio book on audible.com, I think they would plug it.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   That's what Google would do.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.720]   It makes perfect sense.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:09.720]   Audible.com is a great place to go.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:17.320]   If you like podcasts, this is just one more wonderful source of great literature.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.720]   Audiblepodcast.com/twig.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:24.040]   I don't know if this confirms Paul's theory or not.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:28.320]   I think it does because they're not selling the device, but they're selling the form of
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.320]   audio books.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:33.720]   Believe me, you can listen to an audio book, have your Kindle read it to you.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:41.880]   It ain't the same as having somebody who really knows how to bring a book to life read to you.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.880]   That's what they do.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.480]   They are so good about making these books jump to life, whether it's sense and sensibility
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:55.360]   and sea monsters, which is the newest Jane Austen novel, or Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:37:01.320]   I can't frankly read Dan Brown in paper with a straight face, but they make wonderful audio
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.280]   books because basically it's like you listen to the movie.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.840]   You can just see Tom Hanks running around.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.840]   Audible podcast.com/twig.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.920]   If you go there right now, you can sign up for a gold account that gives you a book
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.400]   a month and your first one's free.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.440]   In fact, even if you cancel, you get to keep that one for the rest of your life.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:28.920]   So pick wisely in business and classics, history, non-fiction and fiction, kids and young adults,
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.440]   even mysteries and thrillers, romance, science and technology, sci-fi, self-development and
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.440]   more.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.120]   They even have comedy performances, old-time radio shows.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.920]   It's just a feast of audio listening entertainment.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.640]   I don't know what I'm going to recommend today.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.920]   There's so many great books out there.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.680]   The big download, of course, The Lost Symbol.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.080]   I've been reading a lot of rave reviews.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.720]   In fact, I guess I'll recognize we were talking about performance.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.400]   I haven't read this book, but I'm told this is an amazing performance.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.760]   It's called The Help by Katherine Stockett.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:10.360]   It is the highest rated book ever on Audible.com, 4.89 out of 5 based on 1,831 ratings.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.160]   And I think it's because of the performance.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:18.560]   Cassandra Campbell, Jenna Lamia, Octavia Spencer and Bonnie Turpin, apparently a brilliant
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.840]   performance of The Help by Katherine Stockett.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.960]   May I make that our pick of the week?
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:30.680]   The point is you get to choose Audible.com, AudiblePodcasts.com/Tweg.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:35.800]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.920]   AudiblePodcast.com/twig.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:42.600]   You might be tempted to use a different code, use that code because then we get credit.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:47.160]   We want Gina and Jeff to get the credit for a job well done.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:51.360]   And whatever you do, don't listen to what would Google do.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.240]   It's too good of a book.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.000]   People have to buy it.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   And we wouldn't want that, would we, Jeff?
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.080]   I didn't say worthy.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.840]   This is an example, though.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:06.080]   I think of what Paul was talking about because it is, in a way, you're not buying the book.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.080]   You're buying the performance.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.080]   You're buying the form.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.120]   You're buying the ability to put it on your portable device.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.720]   And that kind of makes sense.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.440]   That's the value I'm getting out of that.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:21.240]   I teach a course in entrepreneurial journalism and I was out this last class for obvious reasons.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.560]   And my substitute friend told me that students were thinking about doing books.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.560]   And I said, "Well, that's not really a business."
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:31.640]   Well, no, if they rethink it in terms of an ongoing business and it's just part of the
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.640]   process.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.640]   All right.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.640]   Well, I'll consider that.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.640]   It is a business in a way.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.640]   But that's actually the challenge.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:43.480]   And actually, I think that's kind of fun because in order to understand this, you have
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:48.120]   to rethink, it's kind of a good exercise to rethink every business in this new form.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:52.760]   And what is an appropriate form going forward for any business, whether it's the record
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:57.760]   industry, the book industry, and there probably is an appropriate form for everything, I would
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.920]   imagine.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:05.960]   So you want to hear some of our feedback from our many, many callers or should actually,
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.520]   why don't we do, I'm trying to decide what order to do this.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:12.000]   Why don't we do our tip and pick and everything?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.720]   And that way, if Jeff needs to run, he can.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.840]   How about that?
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.120]   So because it is pizza night.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.720]   Is every Saturday pizza night, Jeff?
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.320]   Oh, metaphorically.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:26.000]   Let's start with Gina Trapani.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.240]   We missed you last week or tip of the week, everybody.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.240]   Cool.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.240]   Yay.
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.240]   Okay.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.080]   My food is for adventurous Android users.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:39.080]   And I got to tell you, I don't think there is any other kind if you're using Andrew.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.080]   Yes.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.080]   Probably.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.080]   You're a leader.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.040]   But yeah, an early adopter.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.760]   So I moved into a new place this weekend.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:50.280]   It's a new building and the wiring was bad and I didn't have, I did not have internet
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:53.160]   access at home, which just killed me.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.160]   It's totally killed me.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.160]   I'm serious.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.160]   I'm still recovering.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:02.080]   But so I finally took the leap and I got root access to my Android phone, which let
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.040]   me tether.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:10.360]   And so in order to get basically getting root access to your Android phone, lets you install
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.000]   a custom build of Android.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.320]   And there are lots of custom build of Android out there.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.960]   Some of them include some of the donut features.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.080]   Most of them include give you root access to the device, which opens up a little extra
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.480]   functionality.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.920]   And in order to do it, there's an application called recovery flasher, which you download
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:33.160]   the web because, you know, there's no pesky iTunes store approval process to deal with.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.720]   Of course, I had to say that.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.400]   And you download that to your phone, just through the phones web browser.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:42.840]   And it lets you boot the phone up and then install one of the custom Android build.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.440]   And so it's a few steps.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.240]   And it takes a little time and you lose some of your settings, but I have it all written
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.720]   up at smartaward.org, which we'll link in the show notes.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.520]   So I use the cyanogen.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.480]   I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.840]   And I just fell in love with Android all over again.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.080]   My G1 is so much faster.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.960]   I have a better keyboard and I also can now tether.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.200]   It's a one click tether so I can get online anywhere.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.000]   So in every other respect, it looks the same.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.560]   You just can do more stuff.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.920]   It looks very similar.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.240]   It depends on what custom build of Android you install.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.640]   I was kind of conservative and went with a stable build of cyanogen.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.240]   And it looks very similar.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.320]   But it gives you that tethering.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.320]   I downloaded that tethering app and it gives you a terminal and some other good looking
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.320]   stuff.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.320]   There's a keyboard.
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:31.560]   The keyboard is a little better, which I believe is coming in donut.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.800]   But there are other other builds that will give you applications that are coming out
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.720]   on different Android devices that not all Android devices get.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:45.720]   So there's a database of Android builds and you can choose which build you want.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.520]   Who's this guy talking on your video?
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.320]   Is that you?
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:54.520]   I'm simply doing the guy that helped me.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.520]   No, no, no.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:00.560]   This is a guy who did a video describing how to do the flashing process, which really
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.000]   helped me out.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.680]   I read a bunch of tutorials and that guy's video was the thing that got me.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.400]   It's funny now we're starting to do, you know, I always thought, oh, it'd be so much
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.400]   easier in text.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.400]   And sometimes now it is.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.120]   It's a lot easier just to watch a video.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.120]   True.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.120]   It's true.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.640]   That video is really short and easy.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.640]   Smarterwear.org.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.920]   A great place to go for lots of tips.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.840]   Gina's just cranking them out these days.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:27.800]   It's a yeah, but also a lot of spasts is when I had internet.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.320]   Well, and, you know, we should say Gina's on wireless today.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.440]   And I think that's where the coming and going is.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.760]   There's a little bit of a dropout on you.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.640]   So I will, we'll get you wired next time, but you're in and that's okay.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.640]   It's working.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.640]   Oh, sorry about.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.640]   Yeah, it's working.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.640]   It's working.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.640]   Not sorry about that.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.640]   How lovely.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.480]   And now our number of the week.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.560]   And that comes to us from the great Jeff Jarvis.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.360]   Well, in a dog ate my homework moment, my number was going to be five, which is the
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.360]   whole.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.480]   You know, I said, it's your number going to be five.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.480]   I almost said that.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:03.760]   But by the way, while we're on our robotic surgery for prostate this week, that's why
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.400]   I'm like, fast anything was just a little geek moment.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:11.400]   They put you out an hour before the surgery because people get freaked seeing the robot
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.920]   assembled above the.
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.760]   Oh, I would.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.440]   That it was I went into the room and it was like seeing a Sir Gorni Weaver enemy.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.400]   I didn't know it was robotic.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.560]   When you say robotic, it's not an autonomous robot.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.560]   There's somebody.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:29.560]   Yeah, right.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.560]   So the surgeon is five feet away from you in a monitor controlling the stuff.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.040]   And there's five little arms inside you all stop there.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.160]   But why do they do it that way?
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:43.560]   Because it's a micro surgery or yeah, it's it's orthoscopic.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.560]   I see.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.000]   So the can't they're using a camera and right.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.320]   I did write about it on my blog.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.560]   If you have the stomach for it, I've got the details.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.040]   Do you have pictures of the robot?
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.520]   Yeah, a little picture of the robot.
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:59.080]   They always try to show the robot on the website being really small.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:05.040]   I said the website, it's like a kind of robot that turns knobs on on for mini something
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:10.440]   and you walk in the room and it's this really amazing, you see Gorni Weaver thing.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.560]   But the robot was my friend.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.200]   So anyway, so I was going to not have a number but the last minute.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:20.880]   The number is 300 million, which is the number of users of course, Facebook has these days,
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:25.480]   which leads to a John Patel post saying that I love having a theme.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.240]   Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.240]   We had to have a time.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.360]   I was queuing up my I was queuing up my tip and it started playing.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.000]   I hate it when it's when when pages start playing music.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   Go ahead.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   So many points it out.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.480]   No, no, no, I am glad you did.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.240]   Otherwise, I would have had to.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:47.600]   But but tell says that the Facebook's automated ad system is getting preference from a lot
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:52.880]   of advertisers versus Google because you're targeting on a social action rather than on
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:53.880]   content.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.880]   You have that happening.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:46:01.520]   You also have the Google announcing this week that it's extending a double click into
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.120]   now a marketplace for display ads at quality sites.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:10.120]   I asked for Sean Tambakawala who is the head of strategy at Starcom, big ad agency on
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.320]   Twitter rip before the show what this means.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.520]   And he says he thinks it means there'll be a lot of new money in the marketplace as a
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.520]   result.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:22.600]   But it ain't over and there's now all kinds of new battle fronts or ad dollars.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.600]   Very interesting.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.600]   I like it.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.840]   It's good for us as new media.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:26.840]   We like to hear that.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:31.680]   There's more money that's floating around the more I can grab out of the sky.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.720]   My tool is is is is actually a terrible horrible thing.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:38.680]   But if I don't do it, nobody, you know, everybody's going to yell at me and it's this new Google
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:39.680]   fast flip.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:44.240]   And I think it actually is is is something that we could talk about because it doesn't
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.520]   make any sense.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:49.160]   It's like, what why is Google doing this?
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.880]   Google fast flip, which is from Google Labs.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:55.520]   If you go to Google Labs, you can get fast flip.google labs.com is designed to make it
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:00.320]   more reading your news more like reading a paper.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.960]   What?
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:06.480]   And, and if you see, you know, you could do it by topic.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.120]   It's not a replacement for Google reader.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.120]   You could check sources.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.080]   You could check topics.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.440]   You know, it has trending topics.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:19.600]   In fact, it's really what apparently is as far as I could tell is a search is a search
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:24.320]   engine where you'll enter in a search using the word section before it.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:30.120]   And then you'll get a variety of pages that you can then click down into.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:33.320]   And it takes two clicks to get to the original source, but you can you could scroll through
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.320]   it.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.760]   It is a very strange idea.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.840]   And some say it's a MacGuffin that it's Google's way of showing the newspapers.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:41.840]   It's all over.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:47.080]   Leo, I liken it to us when you used to scroll through the microfiche in a library.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.640]   Yeah, that's exactly what it's like.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.160]   Just go and scroll, scroll, scroll.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.920]   Do people read newspapers that way?
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.920]   I don't know.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.760]   You know, if you're doing if you're just casually reading a newspaper, you're not going to do
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.760]   that.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.880]   You're doing research and you need to look through a lot of content, you know, for a
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.920]   longer period of time, you might do that.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.440]   You might do scans like that to search for certain articles.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:10.680]   And it might be a very beneficial and efficient way to do that.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.680]   I guess you're right.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.840]   If you're looking for pictures or you're looking for scanning for concepts, you're right.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:19.000]   This might be a better way to do it, I guess.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.160]   You know, I could get a lot of the media jumped on this and absolutely, you know, slam Google
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:27.480]   and said a lot of the coverage that I had read from my peers and colleagues, they didn't
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.480]   like this at all.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.640]   They said it was a lousy service.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.840]   You know, I disagree.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.440]   I don't think it's a lousy service.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.160]   I mean, it is what it is.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.560]   It's another way to search Google.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.400]   You know, when the Wonder Wheel was announced and Google squared were announced, people
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.720]   weren't bashing those tools.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.080]   I think Google's taking a lot of heat over this.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:50.440]   I don't think they proclaimed it as being the next coming of Google News.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.640]   But don't get me wrong, I think they would love it.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:57.200]   They would absolutely love it if people were to search Google News this way and to skip
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.520]   through stuff because they would see a whole lot more ads.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.680]   You know, I did my first run through on this and I saw so many ads.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.400]   I did five minutes of testing on this.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.400]   That's a good point.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:12.200]   And, you know, clicking on an article about Patrick Swayze last week from Us Magazine
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:16.600]   when he had passed away and over on the right was an ad from the National Cancer Institute.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:20.560]   Is that morbid or is that tacky or is that ingenious?
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:21.560]   I don't know which.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.360]   You know, I'll leave that up for you to decide.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.480]   But it was certainly effective.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.480]   It caught my eye.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.160]   You know, when I'm reading about every single page for you, you know, you go through, you
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.800]   get another ad over on the right there.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.480]   I didn't even notice that.
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:39.200]   So I did that search and I found the National Cancer Institute ad, you know, next to the
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:43.640]   article about Patrick Swayze, I circled back to that article a couple minutes later and
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.800]   there was another ad there for Whitney Houston's new album.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.080]   So those ads are changing and they are recycling.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.080]   So that's pretty smart.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:56.080]   But whether or not people use it on a regular basis, enough to make it a replacement for
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:59.040]   Google News, I don't know.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.760]   You know, Leo, Shane Richmond at the Telegraph in London and I have this link up on the
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:11.840]   front feed, did a great letter from fake Eric Schmidt saying, you know, we got you suckers.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:12.840]   Happy now, bitches.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.840]   It says.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.120]   That's kind of my thinking.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:24.560]   I think it's a last week I accused Google of being cynical in offering checkout to these
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.920]   fools who want to charge for newspapers.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.800]   I tend to look at this in the same light.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:33.360]   I think it's either a cynical way to say, okay, you want this fine.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.680]   Here it is.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:40.240]   Or worse, it's a naive way to say, oh, okay, we listened to you fools who messed up the
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.240]   news industry.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:44.240]   Yeah, here's what you were asking for.
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.400]   Look, yeah, and why give it to them.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.960]   The other fear I have with this is I think that we're going down to a limited number
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.920]   of sources, the beauty of Google and even Google News and daylight for our partner is
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:59.160]   that they have thousands of sources and that's the true path to serendipity to find the
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.520]   sources you want.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:05.840]   In this, you are limited to a certain number of sources and very mainstream, very mainstream
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.840]   sources.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:07.840]   Right.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:08.840]   And Google is that other.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:12.120]   I think that's where they're trying to if they're trying to suck up the newspaper industry
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:16.680]   and they're doing it sincerely, I see danger in that because Google knows better than the
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.680]   industry does.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:21.280]   And if we end up with a very limited number of sources, there's a new aggregator out this
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:27.200]   week in Germany called knockrichton.de that has only 500 sources from major source.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.000]   Google had its featured content a few weeks ago.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.840]   Now it has this.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:32.840]   That's limiting.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.840]   We should be going the opposite way.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:34.840]   Right.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:39.120]   At the same time, by the way, note that Google now marks on Google News if content comes
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.120]   from a blog.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.640]   They didn't really explain why.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.640]   You know, Clint?
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:52.800]   No, just that it's part of Google's long standing effort to bulk up the search options.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:58.360]   Just like they do offering Google searches for past 24 hours and offering more varieties
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:05.480]   and more ways for users to search why they're having the blog designation.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.000]   I'm not quite sure.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.520]   But it's again, these are things that are experimental.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.520]   They may come and go.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.840]   There's a lot of things in Google that they start.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.760]   They roll out and eventually they fade away.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.400]   So we'll have to see what happens with that.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:23.400]   It does feel a little bit like it's deprecating it to say, well, just so you know, that's
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.040]   from a blog.
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.440]   They do it from a New York tell for a New York Times blog too.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.440]   Does anybody see?
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.440]   It doesn't look like they do.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.440]   I'm trying to.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.440]   I haven't come across.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.440]   That's a good question.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.960]   Well, I just searched for Mint, for instance, and the second entry is the Mint blog.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.360]   Doesn't say blog on it.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.920]   You know, it's mint.com/blog.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:42.920]   So I don't know.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.280]   I don't know who gets to be a blog.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.240]   Let me search for, let's see, Android.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.680]   Let me search for Android hacking.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:51.840]   That'll show up some blogs.
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:53.320]   See if I can--
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:56.320]   Mm.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.640]   I'm not seeing the designation.
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.640]   Oh, well.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.720]   Yeah, I thought that was very interesting.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:06.800]   Anyway, it's worth taking a look at Flip for what it's worth.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:11.280]   I think you make a good point that there are some searches that it might be useful for.
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.360]   Did you say it's only 39 sources?
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.160]   Yes, 39 sources.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.400]   Sources like TechCrunch, New York Times, Washington Post.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.760]   Hey, TechCrunch, that's a blog.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:22.760]   How dare they?
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   There is.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.760]   Okay.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.800]   Well, they put in a blog in there for these are the Daily Beast.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.800]   I don't even know.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:34.440]   It looks like Dave Weiner and Jay Rose and others complain about Twitter's selected users
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.440]   list.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.440]   Right.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:37.440]   And this is Google's equivalent.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.640]   And I think that's dangerous.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:44.720]   It maintains an old hierarchy rather than enabling a new one to emerge.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.920]   With you on that.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:51.440]   And I think Clint might be right that this isn't-- they haven't thought it out that much.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.920]   This is just something they threw out there.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:55.080]   It's just a lab.
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:57.000]   But the thing is they launched the TechCrunch 50.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.360]   And a lot of people were paying attention to that.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:03.040]   So it picked up a lot of buzz right along with Bing Visual Search.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.200]   Those are the two biggest announcements out of the show.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.800]   So a lot of people picked up on that.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.840]   They got a lot of coverage.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:14.240]   And when things get a lot of coverage, people tend to attach more import to the things that
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.240]   are being launched.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:16.240]   I actually--
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:17.240]   So I think that's what you saw there.
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.680]   I really do like the Bing Visual Search.
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:23.000]   I think that's kind of cool.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.160]   Because it just looks so much like it's out of the matrix.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.160]   Right.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.320]   Well, that's Silverlight in action.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.560]   That's the Silverlight plugin for you there.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:30.560]   Right.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.280]   First awhile, Flashkiller.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.080]   So you-- I've got digital cameras.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:38.720]   And then I can narrow it by the number of megapixels with a slider.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.200]   And then it kind of rearranges itself.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:45.440]   And then I can say, oh, but I want a better optical zoom.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.960]   I mean, it's a demo.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.680]   But it's a cool demo.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.560]   It's a fun demo.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:50.920]   Like it.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.160]   All right, there's a freebie.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.280]   That'll be your pick, Clint.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:56.760]   OK.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.120]   Now.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.000]   Now, do you want to take off, Jeff?
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:00.520]   We got--
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.040]   Oh, I can't.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.360]   You have some time to listen to quite a few.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.200]   I won't play them all.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.560]   Plus they're going to complain about me plugging my book.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:06.840]   No, not a one of them.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.720]   All right.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.320]   Not a one of them.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.960]   One of the nice things that Gina mentioned a couple of weeks
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:15.160]   ago is that Gmail now has a player in it for Google Voice
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:16.040]   Messages.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.000]   And this is what I'm going to use.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.120]   And it works really nicely.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.760]   It's a great way to kind of-- when you have a big full mailbox
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:22.560]   review them.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:28.240]   So again, our Google Voice Mail number is 97.95 Twig VM.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.480]   Let's listen to some of the voice mails that we got from
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.480]   people, quite a few of them.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:32.320]   Any comments you have?
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.640]   Just let me know after we hear it.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.560]   Hi, Leo.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:36.720]   My name is Daniel Horton.
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.480]   I'm in Huntsville, Alabama.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.760]   Hey, listen, I'm loving this week in Google.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.560]   You guys are doing an awesome job.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:44.640]   I have a question for you guys related to Google services
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.280]   for businesses and universities.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.200]   I'm a web and graphic designer at the University of Alabama
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.200]   in Huntsville.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:54.320]   And some of our administration has looked into getting Gmail
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:57.640]   and Google Docs and some of the other services from Google
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:00.160]   as a service for our faculty and students.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.480]   However, the trick is some of the detect positions at the
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.320]   University have had a hard time detailing why this is so
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.960]   beneficial for everyone as opposed to the kind of
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:12.040]   archaic stuff that we've been using for over 10 years now.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.640]   Some of those who've had objections to Google services
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.520]   have cited that Google would have access to sensitive
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.920]   information within our university.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.280]   Sometimes we deal with research projects with government
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.880]   contracts in a lot.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:26.120]   Some others have also, unfortunately, cited the fact
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.320]   that Gmail was down for a little while a couple weeks ago.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:32.280]   So my question for you guys is, what would you point out to
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.680]   those people in the administration who are having
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:35.960]   these concerns?
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:39.000]   How can we address those concerns about privacy and uptime?
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.160]   Thanks again.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:42.840]   People who are switching to Google Docs, and I know a lot
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.520]   of universities are starting to use Google Mail.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.720]   Gina, is there a response to that?
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:52.920]   Is it possible to be private and secure with Google Mail?
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:56.600]   Well, the privacy issue is a good--
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:57.600]   Uh-oh.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.360]   Good question.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:01.560]   I know, especially with state universities, email--
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.440]   do you have me?
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.560]   Yeah, you're coming and going.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.680]   You're coming and going.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.040]   Oh, sorry about that.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:07.520]   Sorry about that.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.280]   Silly Wi-Fi.
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:08.920]   We'll bear with it.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:10.920]   It's all right.
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:14.640]   I was going to say that the privacy question is a tough one,
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.360]   especially with universities often email
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.760]   as a matter of public record.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.560]   But there's also private information,
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:21.800]   sensitive information.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.600]   And I think the best thing to do is
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.200]   in terms of evaluating whether or not
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.640]   that's the right choice is to look at the Google Apps
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:32.280]   for universities and corporations material
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:35.040]   and look at the privacy policy.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.040]   The best way to convince people--
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.240]   if you want to convince people that Gmail's a good choice
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:43.080]   is to tell them, imagine having email without any space
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:43.880]   restrictions.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:46.040]   Imagine never getting that message that says your mailbox
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.320]   is full of every--
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:48.480]   That's so nice.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.600]   And imagine being able to get to your email from your phone,
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.880]   from your home computer, from anywhere.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:57.320]   And not have to worry about Outlook's web interface
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.840]   or VPN as well.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:00.600]   Any--
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.400]   Yeah, because it's HTTPS.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.680]   It's secure HTTP.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.720]   HTTP.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:07.200]   But I think that the evaluation process is definitely
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.080]   important.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:09.040]   Right.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.400]   I love the-- in the transcription--
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:10.920]   Right.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:11.400]   Exactly.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:11.400]   Exactly.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.560]   In the transcription, they transcribed administrators
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.480]   as Mr. Asians.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:22.000]   The faculty and students was transcribed as freckly states.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.280]   And government contract came out as army contract.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.600]   So that was pretty good.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.440]   I see an audio capture coming soon.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:31.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.960]   Leo, just one more point.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.800]   In last week's list on Friend Feed,
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.240]   there was a link that I put in there about the 5 million
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.200]   students who was the number of the week last week who are now
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.840]   using Google Apps.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.520]   There's also a map there at university.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:46.560]   So I suggest that our caller, as we say on radio,
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.880]   can go and find a lot of the administrators there
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:50.440]   and find out their rationale.
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.040]   Also note that Google last week, I
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:58.480]   think for the government 2.0 conference, released a view
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:02.040]   of Google Apps for government.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:03.960]   And part of what they're going to offer there
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.200]   is higher security.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:06.720]   Right.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.560]   People with clearance use it, only be in the US,
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.320]   and so on and so forth.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:13.360]   So they are moving to more mission critical, even government
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.080]   things.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.400]   And that link is also on the Friend Feed.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.280]   These are things they're going to have
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.720]   to address anyway from everybody,
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:23.040]   if they're going to make inroads into those areas
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:25.960]   that they want to be, and like government, like universities.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:29.000]   Here's another caller from South Africa.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.440]   Hi Leo, this is Andre from South Africa.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.480]   Being in the traffic on the way back from the tech call,
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:36.240]   listening to your quick podcast,
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:38.200]   preaching from South Africa.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.960]   Just a hello from South Africa.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:42.560]   And here's one from Australia.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.080]   Hi Leo, danger in even.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.840]   He's calling from Australia.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:48.920]   I just want to leave the voice message on your Google voice.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:51.640]   So this is, sorry Leo, you're talking as I speak.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.120]   Just going to pause you.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.400]   Just want to say I have been a big fan of your show
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:58.160]   for a number of years, and I am one of the 1%
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:02.680]   that pays not $2.00 but $5.00 a month for the show.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:05.280]   It's just a change for entertainment
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.280]   that you give me every day of the week.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.560]   It's probably the case of the work.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.240]   Oh yeah, that's right.
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.400]   It's not a wall, is it?
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.440]   I'm relying you for my daily trip to the office.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.800]   Thank you very much.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.560]   Very nice calls.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:20.240]   Again, it's 97.95 Twig VM.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.640]   Here's one for you Gina.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.080]   Hello Twig crew.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.600]   I had a quick question about Google voice.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.200]   I wanted to know if Google voice is treated as a mobile number
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.840]   or is it treated as a landline number?
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.800]   So for instance, if I'm calling on my cell phone
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.280]   and my cell phone plan has free mobile to mobile calls,
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.760]   how is that treated by the carrier?
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.960]   Just wondering if you had an answer to that.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.560]   Have a great day.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.800]   I think it's a landline, isn't it?
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:51.160]   That's a good question, actually.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.880]   When you make a phone call on Google voice,
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.600]   it calls a Google internal number.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.640]   And I think that it is a landline.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.840]   I believe that that is a landline, but I could be wrong.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.360]   I'd be very surprised if carriers
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:04.200]   treated that as part of your mobile to mobile minutes.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:08.040]   That's the last thing they wanted to do.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.640]   I'm going to get one more in here.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.400]   Let me see.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.080]   I've got so many good ones and I had one I wanted to put aside.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:20.360]   We should have the call from farthest with best accent contest.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.320]   Well, we've got two good ones from South Africa
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.760]   and in Australia so far.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.200]   But please do.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.880]   And that's one of the beauties of this,
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.240]   is you can do it from anywhere.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.120]   I can't find the one I was going to play.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.120]   But he mentioned that we were asking for Google voice invites.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.680]   And he said, I don't know if I should say this,
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.360]   but you can buy him on eBay for two bucks.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.800]   There are people there.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:41.920]   And so I tried it.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.360]   And you know what?
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.480]   I got seven invites.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.080]   Caution.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:46.840]   Nice.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.640]   But there's a caution.
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.280]   You can't use the same phone number twice or the same Gmail
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.880]   address twice.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:55.960]   They really try to limit.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.080]   It looks like they're trying to limit you to one.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.920]   So you have to create a new Gmail address for everyone
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.040]   you want to use.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.920]   And you have to find friends with cell phones
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.720]   that will allow you to attach your Google voice
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.560]   to their cell phone.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.640]   I ran out of numbers.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.880]   I have seven invites, but I don't have seven phone lines.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.380]   And actually--
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:15.000]   I thought you did the--
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:15.400]   Well--
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.160]   Yeah, I thought you did.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.280]   No, no, it's all virtual.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.920]   What I figured out finally is you can assign it to one
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:21.800]   and then revoke it.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.600]   And you'll still have the account,
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.600]   but you just won't have it attached to any phone line.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.600]   So there's a little tip.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:29.640]   And I have one other Google voice tip.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.040]   I think Black Week Adam described
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.360]   that you can have Google voice SMS messages
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.200]   forwarded to your email, which is great.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.720]   But if you also have a cell phone
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.720]   and you don't want your text messages
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.200]   forwarded to your cell phone, I think a caller that Leo played
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.800]   before we started taping is asking about this.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.880]   I was trying to find that one.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.080]   Yep.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.280]   Yeah, if you go into Google voice settings under phones
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.360]   where your cell phone is listed,
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.360]   if you hit the edit button, there
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.480]   is a checkbox that says receive SMS on this phone.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.920]   If you uncheck that box, your Google voice SMS messages
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.480]   do not get forwarded to your phone,
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.600]   which is a really good way to save money on your text
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.560]   messaging if you--
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.360]   SMS a lot.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.600]   And they'll still show up in your email.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.920]   And they'll still show up in your email.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.320]   Yes.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.320]   Great tip.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.280]   Thank you for answering that.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.760]   Yeah, I was trying to find that one.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.080]   I have so many in this inbox.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.200]   I have to go through.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.120]   Hey, what a great show.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.960]   Thank you so much, Clint Bolton for joining us.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.880]   We really appreciate it.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:31.680]   Clint's column is Google Watch at googlewatch.eweek.com.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.240]   And we hope to have you back soon, Clint.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:34.680]   Great.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.440]   It was great being on.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.040]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.920]   Really, really nice to have you.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.400]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis is back, baby.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.960]   Five holes or not, he's operating--
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.240]   well, at least his brain is operating at 100%.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.760]   Morphine does work for me.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.280]   And you're not on morphine, are you?
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:49.720]   No.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.520]   Little Vicodin, perhaps.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.120]   I could sell some on eBay.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.800]   You know, now, now.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:01.600]   You know, I found frozen peas make a wonderful ice bag
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.760]   that will conform to almost--
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.600]   I just want to know how you're learning that.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.760]   Almost any shape.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.320]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.120]   It's great to have you back at buzzmachine.com.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.040]   Jeff proves that there is life after People Magazine.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:18.720]   So we're glad to have him on board.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:22.040]   And of course, the great Gina Trapani, founder of LifeHacker
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.320]   still a regular columnist there.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.520]   And I saw it at the Harvard Business Review.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.600]   Oh, yes.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.760]   Love that.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.480]   And smarterware.org is the home site.
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.920]   It's just a blog, but OK.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.280]   Thank you for being here, Gina.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.160]   It's just a blog.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.080]   Thanks for having me.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.840]   And sorry about my wonky connection this week.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.520]   I'll get this just out for next week.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.000]   She's going to plug in next time.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.800]   Actually, we have microphones and all sorts of cool gear.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.160]   We're boxing up to send out to both of you.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:50.800]   Look at that.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:51.400]   All right.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.840]   Thanks, everybody, for joining us again.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.760]   Our number, if you want a call with a suggestion,
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.760]   I can't get them all on the air.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.360]   We get so many.
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.960]   But I'd love to hear from you.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:01.200]   The best calls on the show is 97.95.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.880]   Twig VM, I'm Leo LePort.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:06.240]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.540]   (upbeat music)
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:18.180]   ( off-key music)
