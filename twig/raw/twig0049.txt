[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, the lovely Gina Tripani from San Diego,
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.360]   California.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.200]   Good afternoon.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.680]   Blogger@lifehacker.com on her website, of course,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.240]   smarterware.org, and the author of the complete guide
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.120]   to googlewave, completewaveguide.com.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.840]   Good howdy.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.880]   Good howdy.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.480]   And from the bowels of Sony, where it is pitch black.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.720]   That's the view outside.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.000]   I thought I'd show you the view outside the window way up at Sony
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.160]   HQ in New York.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.880]   Oh, neat.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.440]   Where is Sony HQ in New York?
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.120]   55th and Madison.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.720]   Right there in the business center.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.760]   Next to the Nike store.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.320]   I bought myself some shoes.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.040]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.640]   Journalist extraordinaire, a professor of journalism
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.160]   at the City University of New York,
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.240]   the blogger at buzzmachine.com and the author.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.680]   What would Google do working on his new book, Public Parts?
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.880]   Good to have you both.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.880]   Lots of Google news.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.800]   A big story.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.200]   One of the big stories-- I don't even-- there
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.480]   isn't one big story.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.960]   I guess China is a big story.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.920]   Google-- did Google blink Jeff Jarvis?
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.160]   What happened?
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.440]   Well, it's a game of criminology wrong country
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.120]   in terms of China objecting to Google, just redirecting.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.400]   So Google then brought back the Google.cn page,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.200]   but then put a link on it to Google Hong Kong.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.040]   What it all means, I don't know.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.560]   I think they're trying to find some middle ground there.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.920]   If they pull out, is the worst thing,
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.520]   no, if they stay, is it the worst thing?
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.000]   No.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.120]   Not much to say, I think, at this point.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.440]   I gather that the deal was that their internet content
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.080]   provider license is up for renewal soon.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.320]   Right.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.720]   Sorry.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.520]   Yes.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.240]   So they need tomorrow.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.080]   So I would imagine that there are some behind the scenes
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.280]   negotiations going on.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.760]   And there's games going on exactly.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.000]   And there's games going on on both sides.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.360]   So Google just said that certain web searches are blocked
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.880]   in China.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.760]   This is fairly new here.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.360]   So there are disruptions to China.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.360]   So they're playing games with each other.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.760]   I'm not sure what the win-win is here for anybody.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.440]   I think they both just need to find some face saving.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.800]   Right.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.840]   And I'll add to that.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.920]   The last thing Google should do is once again,
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.720]   do the tyrant's bidding.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.600]   Well, yeah, this is the interesting thing,
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.720]   is I think even within Google, there
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.120]   is differences among Eric Schmidt, for instance,
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.240]   and Larry Page.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.720]   Larry says, we don't want to do this.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.520]   We don't want to be in Google.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.200]   Eric says, this is a billion person market.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.240]   So there's some compromises, not just between China and Google,
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.600]   but within Google itself that have to happen.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.960]   It sounds like-- so Google stopped redirecting.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.920]   That was a problem.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.560]   China had a big problem with redirecting.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.680]   Google.cended@google.hk.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.240]   So they stopped doing that.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.000]   Are you saying that they're not censoring results at Google.c
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.360]   and or that they are?
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.120]   Google is not.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.840]   Google stopped that.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.320]   Google's policy was we don't do the bidding in the government.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.760]   If you want to censor us, or you want to stop us and block us,
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.480]   well, we can't stop that.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.040]   But Google's mistake in China was that they did the bidding
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.600]   of the government in censoring results.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.840]   In the first place.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.340]   Right.
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.160]   So they're not doing that.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.000]   They're not basically running Google China.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.840]   They are still pushing you to Google Hong Kong,
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.440]   where they don't censor.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.240]   So they did put a link on Google.cn
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.240]   that leads to uncensored results.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.240]   So that implies that Google.cn is censored,
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.480]   but there is a link to uncensored results.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.000]   Is that-- am I misnesting that?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.200]   Now, Google said that the search service in mainland China
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.600]   was partially blocked Wednesday, this
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.440]   according to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.920]   Let's face after announce this.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.680]   Effects queries from mainland China of users of Google
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.440]   suggest why that no one knows.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.760]   But I think it's not--
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.800]   What is Google suggest?
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.200]   I don't even know what that is.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.000]   I start typing in Falun, and it says, oh.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.440]   OK.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.880]   OK.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.880]   So you have to know you're looking for Falun Gong to find it.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.920]   Gmail, news, and images, fully or mostly accessible.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.440]   I don't know.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.680]   See, mostly worries me.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.520]   That's a little fudge word that worries me.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.200]   Like, image is mostly accessible unless it's
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.640]   a picture of the guy in front of the tank at Tiananmen Square.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.200]   Or what?
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.640]   Or is it nude women?
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.440]   What is it exactly that China doesn't want us to see?
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.560]   What are their people to see?
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.320]   That alone would be news we want to know.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.000]   So there's some sort-- I would presume there's
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.720]   some sort of negotiation right now going on.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.960]   So there's not much to say right now.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.000]   Right.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It's interesting, though.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.320]   Google kind of blinked.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.160]   Google sent a strong message that they
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.880]   want to stay in China somehow.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.560]   Assuming they don't want to compromise themselves too much,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.800]   maybe just a little bit pregnant.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.360]   Well, you get back in that argument.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.600]   I was having this argument with Siva in Twitter, Siva
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.400]   Watanathian.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.160]   And Ryan's not really sure what it is he wants Google to do.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.840]   He wants to complain about them, but a little unfair of me.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.680]   But he's--
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.440]   when I say that they shouldn't censor,
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.400]   he says, well, they shouldn't pull away from a billion Chinese.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.040]   That's the argument you're going to have now.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.480]   And I dislike that kind of working within the system.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.280]   Gray argument just bothers me a little bit.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.880]   Those me too.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.200]   You got to have principles and stand on them.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.200]   The other big Google story-- and it's really just a gossipy
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.160]   rumor--
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.680]   started by my friend Kevin Rose.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.880]   In fact, he repeated it on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.040]   He tweeted on Saturday.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.080]   He says he was a little inebriated when he tweeted it.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.440]   But he said he had an on good authority that--
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.360]   Not Kevin.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.000]   Oh, that was another tweet he was drunk.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.760]   I can't remember anyway.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.360]   Sorry, Kevin.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.280]   He was completely sober when he tweeted.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:06.000]   Google was going to start a Facebook clone called Google Me.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.280]   And then we've heard some confirming details.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.000]   In fact, from a former Facebook CTO on his service Quora,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.480]   he says, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.480]   I've heard about it.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.440]   He says Google's putting their every effort behind it.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.000]   Now, Kevin told me that he had to take his tweet down.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.880]   So he did pull his tweet.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.840]   That tells me he was right.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.600]   You don't have to take down something that's wrong.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.520]   Who would make a good tell?
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.680]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.440]   You just said there should have forgotten sex.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.000]   Well, you know, Kevin is--
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.680]   besides-- Kevin's in an interesting position
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.720]   because he's an entrepreneur.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.440]   He works with all these companies very closely.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.600]   You know, he's the guy behind dig.com.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.040]   He's both a journalist and a CEO.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.960]   So he has interesting walk.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.680]   He has to line.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.280]   He has to walk.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.960]   See me, I never take anything down.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.360]   Unless it's libel, and they're going to sue me or something.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.760]   But I don't think there's anything liable.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.600]   It sounds like his source asked him to take it down.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.280]   I mean, the tweet is off.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.160]   That's what it sounds like.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.480]   The tweet is definitely gone.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.160]   I mean, this makes a lot of sense, right?
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.680]   I mean, this doesn't surprise me.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.000]   I'm a little concerned that they're
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.840]   like, we're going to build a Facebook clone,
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.440]   that they're going to model this after Facebook.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.200]   I mean, let's try a little innovation.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.720]   Let's try something new.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.000]   Also, I mean, I don't know, Google hasn't been very successful
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.560]   in the social space so far.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.120]   And I just feel like, I don't know, Facebook has
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.280]   some attraction.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.560]   It'd be interesting to see how they
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.040]   try incentivize people to move from Facebook.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.360]   People beyond the people who are concerned about privacy
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.240]   and feel more comfortable with the Google brand
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.760]   than the Facebook brand.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.360]   People beyond us.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.320]   I think you're raging.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.080]   They've got a fun, entirely new opportunity here.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.280]   And it goes back to what you guys brainstormed on a few shows
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:44.960]   ago.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.520]   I think it comes to identity.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.240]   And there's new services that Google
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.360]   can provide that are uniquely Googly.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.440]   But creating a Facebook clone is the path to disaster.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.880]   Do you build it around profiles, Google profiles?
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.840]   That's what the kind of rumor is.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.480]   I think that was your idea.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.360]   I think I would.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.400]   At the same time, you have the White House
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.040]   now coming out and proposing an official identity,
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.240]   kind of an internet identity card, verified identity.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.480]   Is that an interesting position?
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.480]   Well, what do you think of that?
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.160]   Is that scary or is that good?
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.560]   I'm getting the GBZ guy.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.640]   I can't necessarily say completely why.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.280]   I don't want to sound like I'm wearing the tin hat now.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.400]   Well, identity cards are traditionally a bad scary thing.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.160]   You think back--
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.800]   Well, the argument here is that you need a verified identity
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.760]   to do so much stuff.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.280]   And if you could have this verified identity,
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.600]   you could make transactions and use it at any cost.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.120]   That's fine.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.440]   I'm not sure if governments, the agency, do it.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.760]   Well, I don't know if the independent corporate is--
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.080]   this is the kind of the conversation we had last week,
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.240]   which I'm sorry you weren't here for with Chris Messina.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:42.960]   Or were you here?
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.840]   You were here with Chris.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.240]   No.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.160]   Yeah, Jeff was on with Chris.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.040]   Well, yes, I was doing Chris.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.640]   Yeah, well, we talked about this whole OAuth notion.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.120]   And--
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.280]   Yeah, I did write the OAuth thing here.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.720]   And then the idea of providing independent third party
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.160]   and a choice of third party verification of identity,
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.120]   that does seem safer somehow than having the government.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:01.680]   The budget gets better.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.640]   What you don't want is somebody coming down the train
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.560]   saying, "Papers, please?"
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.600]   Yeah, for real.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.440]   Especially in Arizona.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.080]   You're a born in America, are you?
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.640]   Let's see your papers.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.200]   Now, Google yesterday said something that kind of does
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.440]   lead me to think there's something going on.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.240]   Google added links, or is going to add links in Google Buzz,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.160]   to its social search service.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:30.800]   Interesting.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.960]   So this is going to knit together Buzz profiles
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.120]   and social search, it sounds like.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.480]   I've finally seen Buzz popping up in new ways, too, Gene.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.120]   I think-- do you see some improvement there?
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.400]   Yeah, I've actually been kind of getting into Buzz
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:43.920]   a little more.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.640]   And I am seeing some improvement.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.240]   I definitely see the value and the threaded conversations
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.640]   and it being totally public.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.680]   So Twitter doesn't really have threaded conversations.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.960]   Friend Feed never really took off.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.000]   Facebook still feels very kind of closed.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.160]   So I do see some value in Buzz.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.360]   And I have been actually starting to use it a little bit
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.320]   for Google-specific posts.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.080]   Actually, I've stopped using it as just a broadcast
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.040]   on my tweets and started using it more as a conversational tool.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.280]   The conversation's been improving in quality, in your view?
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.440]   There, in the beginning, it seemed like I got a lot more
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.040]   comments and things have seemed to have tapered off
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.640]   a little bit.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.200]   But the people who are still on are kind of diehards
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.440]   and really love it.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.160]   So the conversations are pretty good, actually.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.640]   I love it.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.760]   But I loved Friend Feed.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.840]   I love Jai Ku.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.080]   I'm a loser.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:40.440]   I am not in any way a barometer of success in social media.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.080]   But to me, I like threaded conversations.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.080]   And I think the quality of the content on Buzz--
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.360]   I mean, it's always variable because it's a variable audience.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.000]   But we now post--
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.640]   I used to post on Friend Feed every time we started a show.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.560]   I stopped doing that.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.960]   I now post on Buzz.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.720]   And Buzz tweets it automatically for me when we start a show.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.120]   And I think the conversations that ensue are often very good.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.640]   Oh, Buzz, does that now?
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.480]   No, Buzz doesn't.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.040]   I use a service called BuzzCan tweet that's very fast.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.640]   I think it uses something like Pub/Sub/Hub/Bub
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.400]   to do it in real time.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.920]   Twitter's always a question whether Twitter's
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.880]   going to respond or not.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.200]   But I think that Twitter's pretty fast now picking up
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.320]   these tweets.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:24.620]   Let's see.
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.640]   Yeah, it's already on Twitter.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.040]   I just did it a minute ago.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.560]   There was a story I put up on the feed that was about--
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.400]   what do you call it?
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.320]   It's like a four square.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.200]   But just arguing that you see this progression.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.160]   Somebody comes up with something new, like Twitter.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.160]   And then you see the clones.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.320]   And the next thing you see is the aggregators.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.440]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:42.960]   Right.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.920]   It's absolutely true.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.280]   And so post once, post everywhere.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.920]   I want that for Buzz and Twitter and Facebook
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.360]   in a way that I can control better.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:51.840]   You do.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.280]   But at the same time, what you don't
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.120]   want is for people to dump content on Buzz.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.920]   Because then there's no conversation.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.120]   And that's what's different about Buzz and Twitter.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.640]   You can dump content on Twitter.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:06.360]   Most people, I would say, almost everybody does on Twitter.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.760]   Because Twitter's not so much about conversation.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.400]   But Buzz is all about conversation.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.120]   So the culture at Buzz says, if you dump your tweets here,
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.640]   we're not going to follow you.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.960]   And I think that that's something that's
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.480]   pretty important that a service have its own culture.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.040]   Definitely.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.120]   And that's why I actually stopped broadcasting my tweets
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.600]   because I had a lot of people saying, hey,
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.680]   if you're not going to use Buzz for what it is,
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.880]   then don't broadcast your tweets.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.280]   Then the great experience I had on Buzz
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.320]   is that a lot of Googlers pay attention to Buzz.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.400]   And because of the show, that's kind of great.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.680]   I ran into a bug with Google Groups last week
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.680]   where I was hitting this infinite redirect loop.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.920]   And I posted on Buzz, like, hey, is this happening to anyone else?
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.240]   And I had three Googlers.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.680]   Like Rick Cloud, Mac, Matt Cutts.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.680]   We're like, hey, we'll check this out for you.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.640]   Yes, it's confirmed.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.880]   Yes, it'll be fixed.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.480]   Isn't that great?
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.200]   It's just kind of fantastic.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.440]   I mean, not everyone has that kind of thing.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.840]   Don't everybody use Buzz.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.960]   We want it for ourselves.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.720]   It's our channel.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.240]   It's Google.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.280]   That's the Google equivalent of an email to Steve Jobs.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:01.960]   Exactly.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.480]   Exactly.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.160]   Buzz is our tool.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.440]   Stay away.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.160]   Don't use Buzz.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:07.640]   Well, it's funny.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.960]   I was at food camp last weekend.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.080]   And Matt-- so I'm Matt.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.840]   And I feel like I kind of got to know him.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.600]   And Bradley Horowitz, who I never met.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.480]   But because he's a buzzer, he's an active buzzer,
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.600]   it was great.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.960]   I felt like we knew each other, you know?
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.440]   Far more people, unfortunately.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.440]   Far more people on Twitter.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.000]   Well, what I'm asking about the reverse
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.560]   is that I would find it useful to make Buzz by main home.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.040]   And then feed the other--
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:30.680]   That's what I do.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.560]   Because I don't want--
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.160]   I would like that.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.760]   Yeah, I don't want-- well, Buzz can tweet really works.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.720]   It works very well.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.920]   I would like to live somewhere and have--
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.480]   and somewhere where I can easily have
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.560]   threaded conversations.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.840]   Right.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.680]   But I also want to make sure that I don't--
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.440]   I mean, I have 200,000 followers on Buzz.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.680]   I mean, on Twitter, I don't want to leave them in the dust,
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.480]   either.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.120]   And I think the Twitter culture doesn't mind that so much.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.240]   I tweet sometimes.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.040]   I think we'll put the black--
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.440]   but I also find it on Facebook.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.120]   I think I'm getting penalized on Facebook
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.440]   for not doing stuff natively there.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.000]   And my response on Facebook is gone to nil.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.240]   I'm also stuck in--
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.240]   So has mine, by the way.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.520]   Shocking.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.880]   I have no page.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.400]   No results.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.720]   Fakeyoo isn't getting an uptick in activity.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.640]   Is there fakelyoo?
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.160]   You know what?
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.000]   I would join a Google Me pretty quickly providing
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.480]   they didn't make the same privacy mistakes that Facebook
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:24.880]   has made.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.360]   I don't anticipate that they would.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.760]   What would it be, though?
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.080]   What it would take for people to--
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.360]   that's why I got to go to Gina.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.080]   I don't see any sense of recreating Facebook,
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.640]   because the machine cost is just too high.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.960]   Is it?
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   500 million people?
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.320]   But how many do you need to make it work?
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.800]   It's pretty big, Buzz.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.760]   It's funny, because Google is in the position
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.040]   that Microsoft is in kind of.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.600]   So Microsoft-- position Microsoft's in with Google.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.400]   So Microsoft really beefs up Bing,
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.760]   spends a lot of energy.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.960]   I met Chilu, by the way, one of the scientists over there
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.440]   who'd moved from Yahoo.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.800]   Who was a fan, by the way.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.040]   H.E., he listens.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.280]   You know, it's kind of neat how many smart people actually
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.200]   listen to this show.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.000]   I can only think it's because of you and Gina, Jeff.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.400]   Hey, because of me.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.400]   That's a lot of pressure.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.400]   I'm suddenly feeling very pressured to say something
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:19.760]   profound.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.520]   Actually, it's you, Gina.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.000]   It's all you.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   They're just listening to it.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:22.440]   It is all, Gina.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:22.920]   It is all.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.680]   Gina.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:29.000]   So Bing doesn't need to beat Google.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.080]   It just needs 5%, 10%, to be highly profitable.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.400]   A Google Meet doesn't have to beat Facebook, does it?
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.960]   Well, but is that truly?
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.040]   Because if your friends aren't there,
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.080]   then it's kind of worthless.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.280]   It's like the phone book.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.720]   The phone book that has only 5% of city isn't very useful.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.920]   Interesting.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.680]   So it's not nearly the network effect,
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.240]   because if all my friends are there, then I'm happy.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.760]   But you're saying it needs to be a phone book.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.720]   It needs to have everybody to work.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.760]   Right, because it's about connections that come across.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.320]   Oh, so-and-so is now our friend with so-and-so.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.120]   And they said this about that.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.200]   That's where the value is.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.000]   Interesting.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.960]   The thing is Google has so much data
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.800]   about our contacts and our relationships
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.080]   and our activity online to begin with.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.080]   So I feel like getting those users and getting those connections
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.680]   pretty quickly won't be that difficult.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.960]   I mean, all they need is a hook and a Gmail.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.160]   So profiles knows all the places where you publish online,
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.920]   if you've added links.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.000]   If they could make Google Me and do something that's not a new site,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.320]   you have to register for and set up a profile,
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.560]   just something that you opt in.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.920]   Uh-oh.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.880]   Genis-frozen.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.960]   Never happens.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.560]   To it.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.960]   I mean, the name, I think, is brilliant.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.460]   Right?
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.760]   I mean, I say this to people all the time.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.960]   People ask for my business card.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.480]   I'm just like, hey, just Google Me.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.480]   You'll find me, you know, because that's right.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.160]   Right.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.200]   So maybe it is profiles, Gina.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.400]   I mean, I thought of that.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.440]   Maybe that's all it is.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.880]   They're already there.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.800]   And what you suggested--
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.600]   And we've been trying to tell everybody, start using--
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.960]   I tell everybody, set up a Google profile.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.240]   You will be glad.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.000]   So now is the-- now maybe the--
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.920]   That would make sense.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.080]   If we'll become infrastructure or top Facebook, Twitter,
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.160]   YouTube, everything, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.640]   Because that they could do.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.720]   But how-- but I mean, come on.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.760]   How many people use Google profiles?
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.160]   Tiny, tiny swatchy people.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.160]   Yeah, but it goes back to Leo.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.080]   Your suggestion there was, if suddenly your profile ended up
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.960]   as your canonical page at the top of search about you,
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.520]   then you're using your motivation to use it.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.400]   Google could flip a switch and make that happen.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.320]   That stands in their power to do.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.680]   And everybody Googles themselves.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.200]   Come on.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.280]   Everyone Googles their own.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.160]   That's why, by the way, the name, Google Me, is brilliant.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:43.920]   It's brilliant.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.600]   It's great.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.560]   I love it.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.360]   I didn't-- you're at that way until just now,
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.800]   when you use it in a sentence, Gina.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.600]   Yeah, Google Me.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.240]   You're done.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:50.720]   Yeah, I get it.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.240]   Right.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:51.240]   Right.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.320]   Google Me.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.000]   It's just brilliant.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.480]   So OK, so they have a shot is what you're saying,
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.160]   at being what really-- and it's funny, because Facebook
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.960]   had to change its model to make this work.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.800]   Facebook was private.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.680]   And they realized that really the value in Facebook
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.200]   is being the internet phone book.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.560]   And so Google's already in this position
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.120]   where they can do that, because they've always
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:16.920]   been kind of that way.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.760]   If you put something--
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.760]   They're complementary, isn't it?
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.880]   Facebook allows you to create your public.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.520]   Well, maybe Facebook goes back to its original model.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.840]   I think they have to.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.120]   I think that Facebook is in conflict
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.120]   with the idea of publishing to the world.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.400]   That's what gets them in trouble,
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.400]   because I'm speaking to this public that I created,
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.280]   the society I created, and I control.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.000]   And if I'm now publishing to the world,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.440]   don't know what I'm doing, which, that's
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.960]   when they got in trouble.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.760]   I think Facebook has to go back to that idea of creating
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.840]   a public, and Google is about the whole world.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.560]   I started-- we got new business cards printed.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.920]   And for a long time, I've been using Google Profiles
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.880]   as my email signature.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.040]   And I thought, what am I doing?
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.160]   I'll just have twit.tv/leo go to my Google profile.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.000]   And that's on my cards.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.560]   That's it.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.200]   And in a way, that's even better than Google me.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.440]   It's-- if you Google the airport,
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.280]   yeah, you're going to find me.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.880]   But if you go to my profile, you're
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.920]   going to find everything.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.480]   You're going to find exactly what I say my universe it consists of.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.360]   We just-- the only way this succeeds, though,
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:24.120]   is if mom and pop in middle America and everybody say, OK,
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.840]   yeah.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.280]   You know where I felt this?
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.200]   And I really miss Facebook in one area.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.440]   I just got all my childhood pictures digitized.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.640]   All the slides, we have something like 20 carousels of slides.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.280]   Oh, I want to see that.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.320]   Wow.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.160]   And I mean, 1,000 pictures.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.320]   And I wanted to put--
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.200]   Little Leo.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:44.960]   --widdle Leo.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.960]   And where would you want to put those when you get those?
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.400]   Where's the first place you want to put them?
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.600]   Facebook.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.600]   There's no one else that I could put.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:51.940]   Exactly.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.080]   I got Jake's graduation picture.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:53.640]   Oh, oh, yes.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.160]   Good question.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.360]   So Jake has his graduation picture up.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.600]   Is it OK for me to share that?
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.320]   Well, if you ask Jake--
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.320]   I got to ask him, yeah.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.160]   I would just do it anyway, which is why my children hate me.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.040]   I made you.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.360]   Therefore, I shall put this picture.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.160]   I own your image.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.560]   You want to go to college?
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.480]   Well, by the way, Jeff, that does not work.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.880]   I know it does not work.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.000]   For Jake's in pain today, you have four wisdom teeth on it.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:26.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.000]   I remember doing that right before I went to college, too.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.680]   It's kind of part of-- it's a right--
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.800]   Leo, back to your point.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.640]   Go to the way that place pages have come to work
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.040]   is that if we're any given restaurant or establishment,
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.120]   those are starting to rise up in Google Search
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.800]   who got on purpose from their end.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.160]   And they are useful because they are links to maps
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.560]   and the original site and reviews elsewhere and all that stuff.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.880]   So it's becoming a competence of Google's
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.280]   to create a canonical page for somebody.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:01.900]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.840]   And in fact, I guess I could upload those pictures
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.480]   on Picasa.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.880]   Picasa has face recognition.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.640]   So do you do tagging, I guess, which is the strength of Facebook?
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.240]   It doesn't--
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.440]   But do you really want to send them to the whole world
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.640]   or do you want to share them with your society on Facebook?
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:16.480]   You're right.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.480]   I want to have my-- OK.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.480]   So Facebook has to do this.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.600]   Facebook has to go back to being--
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.720]   But that's for their complimentary.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.960]   If Google is your presence to the world and Facebook,
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.120]   it's your tool to create your little world.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.360]   They're never going back, though.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.280]   That's not where the money is.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.960]   Or is it?
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.480]   It should be because the more data they get about you,
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.000]   that's why they should buy, I think, 4-square,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.560]   because if they have geo data and relationship data,
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.400]   and if they find ways that friends can truly recommend
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.840]   products to each other, there is value.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.920]   So here's what Google does.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.640]   I hope we lost Gina.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.600]   Let me call her up.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.200]   Here's what Google does.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:59.680]   Google starts, flips a switch, so that the Google profile
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.920]   shows up at the top of the page when you search for my name
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.520]   and my Facebook page, side by side.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.040]   Exactly.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:07.840]   Google says--
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.680]   Your option, by the way.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.200]   Your option.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:10.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.840]   Or whatever private social network I want to use.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.200]   Right.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:13.680]   Yes.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.120]   Yes.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.560]   So I linked it.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.440]   And your YouTube--
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.280]   That should be at the top of the page.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.480]   And it says, OK, you want Leo's private stuff?
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.560]   Are you friendly, Leo's?
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.760]   Here's his Facebook page.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.160]   You want his public stuff?
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.040]   Are you a co-worker or a fan or whatever?
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.480]   Here's his public stuff.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.880]   Are you a business partner?
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.920]   Here's LinkedIn.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.320]   That's a great idea.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:36.800]   That's what they should do.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.680]   That's what they can do.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.720]   And it says they're already doing it for restaurants and bars.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.440]   They could do it for people.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.040]   Is there another layer of control
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.240]   they could put on top of that too, where they can't control
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.280]   gating to Flickr, but they could control gating to Picasa.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.160]   And you could choose to publish to certain people.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.040]   I would certainly say that with Google Docs now,
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.560]   where you can publish and document to a group
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.640]   or to the whole world.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.040]   So this is really--
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.360]   And this is really recognizing the truth of it, which
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.680]   is we have stuff we want public.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.800]   We have stuff we want private.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.920]   And it sounds like Eric Schmidt needs to sit down
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.720]   with Mark Zuckerberg and say, look, dude, just like Spain
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.440]   and Portugal.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.600]   Let's split the world.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.960]   You get the Northern Hemisphere.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.760]   We'll get the Southern Hemisphere.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.040]   Interesting.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.920]   Hello, FTC.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.600]   They're probably not allowed to do that, are they?
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.280]   That's collusion.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.760]   Oh.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.280]   They could.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.960]   But I think it could de facto have that way.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.440]   Well, look it.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.400]   Let's do that for the mark.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.760]   Eric, we know you can't talk.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.320]   But just send a signal.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.520]   Tug your ear.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.520]   Send a signal.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.520]   Tileo, you said people watched the show.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.200]   I think that what was it a month ago, this discussion was there.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.860]   I think that maybe this week in Google invented the product
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:52.480]   line for them.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.440]   We did it.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.600]   It's only give us credit.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.400]   I already have a show.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:55.900]   You use it.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.400]   You use it.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   That's my idea.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   Now I'm going to have one that says Google Me was my idea.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.400]   Google Me is my idea.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.720]   You know, the privacy issues and settings are definitely an issue.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.240]   The other question for me, which kind of came up because of this interesting column,
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.520]   a technical incorrect, is CNET News, is, you know, can Google's sort of engineering
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.240]   culture create a compelling social experience?
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.240]   Right.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.240]   That was great.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.800]   Can robots do-- Can robots make you want to connect with people?
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.120]   Now, I mean, think about all the cutesy kind of stuff that Facebook started with.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.120]   It's like speaking, and it's complicated.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.120]   You've never seen that.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.640]   And some of these like cultural, you know, little things about Facebook that made it
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.640]   kind of fun.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.440]   Now, I think Google has a pretty playful spirit.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.640]   I mean, they're hackers, right?
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.360]   So they have this kind of playful spirit.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.240]   And sometimes they do have great, you know, the "Wubazella" button on YouTube.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.240]   That was hysterical.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.600]   I just read Pac-Man logo.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:48.280]   I mean, they do some fun compelling playful stuff, geeky often, but really fun.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.480]   But this piece called is Google far too much in love with engineering.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.800]   It kind of really takes Google to task for-- I guess they require every single manager.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.960]   Everybody there has an engineering degree, right?
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.640]   And even just to get an interview, I applied to work at Google years and years ago.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.640]   And like, I couldn't even get an interview because it was like--
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.640]   The fools!
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.640]   Yeah, boy.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.160]   You know, they may be loosening that up because Colleen Kelly, our VP of engineering
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.680]   who went to Google, has a degree in sociology.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.680]   OK.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.760]   And she's got an engineering job.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.400]   She's a streaming video engineer.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.240]   Well, that's good to know.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:26.000]   Because you really don't want silons making this software that you really love to use.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.400]   And there are those stories about them testing 43 colors, shades of blue to see which made
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.400]   the most traffic.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.400]   I really like that idea.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.080]   That idea, relying on data, is very attractive to me.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.560]   But you can't engineer everything.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.560]   So--
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.560]   Yeah, it's absolutely hard.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.960]   --to-- if you think about-- I think you're right about the serendipity and right about
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.960]   all that.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.000]   But if you're in this closed rule of Facebook, people you know and love and trust, then
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.960]   you can do cute silly little stuff.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.640]   Where again, if Google is about your presence to the whole world, you probably don't want
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.640]   the cute silly stuff there.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.640]   Right.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.640]   You're going to do that elsewhere.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.080]   Where you're more faith and trust.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.120]   You want to present to something that's presentable.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.120]   Right.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.760]   We're going to take a break.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.840]   We're going to talk more about this.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.040]   And there's a lot more news too.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.160]   You're listening to this week in Google with Jeff Jarvis, Gina Tarpani.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.720]   This is the kind of thing I love the best on the show.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.600]   And we kind of try to suss out the way to go.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.600]   And who can Google do it?
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.880]   But when we were doing this, I thought that Buzz was going to be a big success.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:20.880]   It was really important.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.160]   See how well they do.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.400]   Well, and wave and buzz and a lot of things.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.680]   And I guess the question is-- it's not us.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.640]   It must be them.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.160]   Because we're brilliant.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.160]   It's got to be Google.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.600]   They just don't have what it takes or something.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.120]   I don't know.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.720]   We're going to talk more in just a bit.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.440]   You're listening to this week in Google right now though.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.240]   I want to tell you about our friends at Citrix.

[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.360]   Travel less.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.080]   And by the way, make your meetings so much more engaging.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.760]   Once you've got it installed, are you done yet?
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.400]   You've got a few more seconds.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.880]   Once you've got it installed, the next time you want to get a conference call, you're
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.320]   thinking, "Oh, I got to get a plane ticket to go to Dallas."
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   Stop.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.720]   Go to go to meeting.com.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.720]   Start the meeting.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.720]   Tell your con furry.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.360]   Hey, go to go to meeting.com himself.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.600]   He doesn't have to have anything installed ahead of time.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.720]   30 seconds later, she'll be seeing your screen on her computer and you can show her the
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.800]   powerpoint, the keynote, the spreadsheets.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   You can collaborate on documents.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.200]   You can have something open and say, "Okay, what do you think?"
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.200]   And she can type.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   And then you can type.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.760]   Up to 15 people at the same time, it really is effective.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.760]   It's great.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.760]   I want you to try it free.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.880]   Go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.800]   We thank Citrix, the folks who do go to meeting for their support of all of our shows, especially
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.600]   this week in Google.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.200]   By the way, I don't know if this is true.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.480]   Just came across that Amazon just bought Woot.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.480]   Oh.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.080]   Talk about, see there, when you're talking about corporate culture where Google's rush
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:36.360]   or can't do a poke, but Amazon, Woot, Zappos, these are companies where they kind of have
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.360]   fun.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.400]   Google needs to have more fun.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.000]   It's not that Google engineers don't have fun.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.480]   There was a Google engineer at the food camp who brought a Tesla coil and was toasting marshmallows.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.480]   That's fantastic.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.480]   That's fantastic.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.480]   How did you get?
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.480]   How did you get?
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:56.720]   I started getting closer with my camera phone to take a picture and they would get back
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.080]   and back and it's going to kill you because apparently it will jump over to the phone.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.880]   If you get too close.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.120]   Leo, glad you made it back.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.120]   It's only 500,000 volts.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.960]   That's not really great.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.360]   This week in Google host killed my Google.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.600]   They say wrong.
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.080]   It was just an accident.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.880]   I actually, it was so much fun.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.120]   I talked to a lot of people at Google, including people in the communications department and
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:25.720]   many engineers and many are fans and listen to the show and those who didn't now will.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.600]   I can promise you.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.640]   I was doing an informal survey of Android and iPhones because iPhone had just come out
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.640]   a couple of days ago.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.080]   There were a lot of iPhone 4s, but it looked like Nexus 1 was the phone of choice.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.480]   There were a lot of Nexus 1 phones at food camp.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.480]   These are smart people.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.080]   I know I'm late to this, but I got a ask.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.080]   Oh boy.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.320]   Of course, I bought an iPhone 4 and you know what?
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.200]   It is beautiful.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.000]   It's a really spectacular screen.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.440]   You cannot imagine how good the screen is.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.720]   Is that purple thing?
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.720]   You're a bumper?
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.400]   Well, here's the big problem.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.920]   That antenna thing they're talking about, it's very real.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:09.880]   If I take this case off, the five bars will go to no bars in 30 seconds.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:10.880]   Absolutely.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.880]   In fact, I didn't want to--
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.880]   Even when you're not holding it?
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.880]   No, you have to hold it.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.880]   But yeah, so oh good.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.960]   It's a phone you can use when you don't hold it.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.960]   Right.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.880]   That's a way to get past the radiation.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.760]   It's just leave it on the desk.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.240]   It's such a beautiful design.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.880]   I hate to put it in a case, but I swear.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.000]   I mean, it does take long.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   It dies every time.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   So you've got five bars in the office right now.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.240]   And by the way, this is exactly how you would hold it.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   It's how everybody holds it in the Apple commercials.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.240]   It's 20 cans to put it out.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.240]   Yeah, it just shorts it.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.400]   My big question to you is, forget the fact that you're someone who buys every phone
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.400]   that ever comes out.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.800]   Oh, I have to, yeah.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.680]   But if you were using spare resources like Real People, would you be pissed now about
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.680]   Verizon?
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.840]   Oh, yeah, I would be pissed about it.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.120]   Rumors and rumors from Bloomberg, but Verizon's getting it.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.680]   We've been hurting this rumor for ages.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.680]   Yes, I know they should have sources.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:08.120]   I don't, you know, there's one drawback to have Verizon or any CDMA version of the iPhone.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.880]   You cannot get data while you're in a call.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.880]   I like GSM.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.880]   I travel as you do.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.880]   I travel a lot.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.880]   I need a GSM phone.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.040]   I'm not going to buy a Verizon anything.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.720]   In fact, that was why I didn't get a Spring Evo in the long run.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.040]   The Droid X-Add and the Times that ran.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.040]   Isn't that funny?
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.600]   You can hold it any way you want and you'll get a crystal clear signal.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.600]   Brilliant.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.280]   We've got two antennas.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.640]   I guess you got to go if you got to advertise whatever you can.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.520]   But you know, first of all, I think the Droid X is a very compelling phone.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.720]   I cannot wait to see it.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.800]   I think the Nexus One is still equal to the iPhone, although that this screen is really
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.800]   good.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.800]   Oh, really?
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:50.480]   You know where the iPhone 4 really wins, I think, is it's got the best camera phone
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.960]   I've used now.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.520]   And even it's five megapixels, but the color and everything is very, very good.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.400]   I saw some videos that were edited on the iPad and the iPhone.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.400]   And it's pretty room.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.400]   Apple knows how to do beautiful.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.840]   I mean, let's just face it.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.840]   They do.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.840]   It's a beautiful screen.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.520]   I mean, it's rock solid.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.520]   The detail is incredible.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.960]   It's going to be your main phone now, Leo.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.960]   Well, I'm going to use it.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.120]   You know, the only way I think you can use it, you can try a phone is by using it.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.560]   I mean, I have to say I wouldn't have noticed how bad this antenna problem if it was if
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:24.600]   I hadn't been using it all weekend and been frustrated by the dropped calls and by the
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.360]   zero, you know, signal.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.360]   So I did get a case.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.400]   I think it's kind of annoying that you have to spend a $30 premium, but anybody who buys
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.480]   an iPhone 4 should remember you get a case with it.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:39.240]   Even though my packer posted a tip, you can take one of those rubber bracelets like the
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:43.720]   Lance Armstrong Live Strong and wrap it around the outside of the iPhone.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.080]   So you don't have to pay the $30 for the case.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.880]   Oh, and that's good looking.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.880]   Well, all right.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.880]   So it's not the most good looking thing, but it is kind of like the cheap way to get
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.880]   man.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.200]   Like you said, Scotch tape does it too.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.200]   It's just an instant.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.400]   You need an insulator on that little.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.400]   It's, you know what?
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.400]   It's crappy design.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.200]   It's stunning to me that Apple got that let this through.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.520]   This is not the way you do it.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.160]   But anyway, setting that aside.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.560]   That's why I wanted people with sweaty hands to use with the bars, but we know where that
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.720]   went.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:16.920]   You know, gray, you should have taken it out of the case before you left it behind.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.840]   On the other hand, no, I think I probably will go back to the next one.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.840]   I'm going to give it a month.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.840]   I probably will.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.280]   I'd love to say having a great five megapixel camera in your pocket all the time is really
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.080]   nice.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.200]   I don't miss the app so much.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.680]   You know, the Android app marketplace.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.280]   Well, let's talk a little bit about Android because the Android app marketplace is really
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.480]   taking off.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.560]   We heard last week at the Droid X announcement that a hundred sixty thousand.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.040]   This was our number of the week last week, Jeff, when you were here.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:48.760]   160,000 Android installs a day puts him really right up there with the iPhone.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:53.200]   I think even when you said you sell 1.7 million iPhones the first three days, he's still are
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.560]   you going to sell five million in the first month?
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.920]   Because that's how many Android phones are being sold.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.680]   85,000 apps.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.000]   And you know, now there's a Kindle.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.280]   The Kindle app is great.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.400]   Mint recall, which is my to do list.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.320]   There are very few apps now that aren't available on Android.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.560]   In fact, Android beats everybody with the audible application.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.480]   It's much better than the iPhone implementation.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.480]   So.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.960]   Kindle app was a big one this week for me.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.960]   Huge.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.960]   I kind of showed it in.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.400]   But there's been some kind of interesting critiques of the market recently.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.440]   Well, there's one BS one and there's one good one.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.440]   Go ahead.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.520]   So DVD John, who's the guy behind Double Twist, who, you know, by all accounts is absolutely
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.040]   an Android fan.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.120]   He wrote a pretty long piece called Google's Mismanagement of the Android market talking
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:45.240]   about how much the Android market really sucks that there are spammy apps that it's
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.840]   difficult to purchase apps that it makes it difficult for developers to charge for their
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.000]   apps.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.840]   And there are a lot of screenshots here that made me very sad Panda.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.120]   It was a very, you know, legitimate, I think critique.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.120]   Really?
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.880]   You think so?
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.160]   I, you know, I thought so.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.160]   I did think so.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.840]   I mean, if you look at some of these screenshots, you know, of course he is interested in what
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.080]   the top multimedia apps are, right?
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.760]   And he pointed that he said, if you look at the top multimedia apps, there are 144 spam
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.080]   ringtone apps in fringing and fringing.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.480]   What's the solution?
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.560]   You want Google to kill these?
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:26.480]   Well, you know, I think that's why it was just that they should do a little more curation.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.640]   Google does have a tear.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.880]   But Google does have a tear.
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.080]   The featured apps.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.720]   So it's in the middle.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.480]   I want to be able to have, you know, again, I don't think Google should be the curator.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.640]   I think that we, the people can be the curator.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.640]   Well done.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.600]   But that's where Google should, should, again, what it did for content in the whole world
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.680]   I should do for its own damn app store.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.720]   There's not enough filters and signals of quality.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.760]   Yeah, it's not like they haven't solved this problem.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.520]   That's a really good point, Jeff.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.480]   Matt Cutts get to work, Matt.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.840]   I just, I don't want, I like, I really like and I really celebrate an open marketplace.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.440]   I think that that's very, that's the strength of Google.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:10.600]   And, and, and, and you know, this is, goes back to Virginia Heffernan's article.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:17.080]   And the New York Times that if you want a gated suburb, if you want safety, yeah, you've
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.280]   got the Apple App Store where everything is polished and beautiful and pretty.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.880]   But I know, I like the free form marketplace.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.000]   And yeah, it's kind of like downtown.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.480]   There's some, some, some, you know, rats behind the garbage cans, but.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:36.520]   Well, the opportunity there is if, if, if Google put out a better API, then could someone
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.400]   create a high quality marketplace on top there?
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.800]   That'd be great.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   Maybe that's the solution.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   Like an editorial.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.800]   Like a featured, featured apps.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.000]   Well, they have, I mean, that's one of the first, why wouldn't Best Buy do that?
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Right?
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.920]   Why wouldn't Best Buy come along and put the investment in full disclosures?
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.600]   I've gone there and talked, but, but that's the kind of thing that they could really add
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:58.880]   value their brand could say, we're going to find the 10,000 best apps out of the hundred
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.880]   thousand.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   And there's no reason they couldn't.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.880]   Right?
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.600]   I mean, that's the beauty of the open is that anyone could say, okay, he'd come to our app
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.600]   store.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.880]   You don't have to go to the, the, the Android marketplace.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.880]   You can go anywhere.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.680]   That's, that's what I want.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.080]   I do need that quality layer.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.240]   I, I, is it Google's fault?
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.040]   Well, yeah, because they're the only ones doing it now, but they could enable others
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.080]   to do what I think.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.520]   And then the value in that is if Best Buy did that, just to play with this for a second,
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.880]   it's a great advertising opportunity.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.560]   You know what apps were downloading.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.720]   You could add value to it on top by saying, here are your apps.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:30.720]   Here's new apps.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.720]   Here's new stuff and recommend things to you.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.440]   I mean, it could be a very high value.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.360]   I think Amazon should do it for God's sakes.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   They've solved the problem too.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.360]   I mean, I think it's a great thing to you.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   Amazon would be great.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.200]   So maybe that's what's going to do on this, right?
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   App brain is.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.480]   In fact, if you just wanted to use stick with that brain, I think you'd be safe.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.120]   There's not any spam ringtones in that brain.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.840]   If you go to the recommended or hot, well, hot apps might, but recommended doesn't.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.120]   So was that the BS criticism, Leo, then?
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.600]   The, to me, this feels like BS Chris.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.600]   And, and by the way, I have a huge respect for DVD, John.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:05.120]   And he's done an immense amount of good for the Android marketplace.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:09.160]   And he has the web based interface right to the market.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.160]   Double, double twist.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.160]   So why doesn't he curated?
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.160]   It's a big job.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.040]   Why don't you do it, John?
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:22.280]   I mean, so, so I think that the, what, what is the alternative?
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.280]   The alternative?
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.760]   I think you want open and yes, this is the side effective open.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.520]   You want to open with quality layers on top of the screen.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.840]   It's just like somebody saying, oh, the web, it's full of pornography.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.840]   Well, yeah.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:32.840]   So.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.480]   Or, or book publishing.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.360]   There's a lot of really crappy books published.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:41.120]   But libraries and bookstores and, you know, find the best ones.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.280]   So maybe that's, look at this is, this is early days yet.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.160]   I know, I know, you know, we feel like Android's mature.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.680]   It's not that old.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.320]   It's matured very rapidly.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.480]   It's gotten better very quickly.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.400]   I mean, what, how long, when did the G1 came out in Gnet?
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.400]   A couple of years ago.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.400]   Two years.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.400]   Two years.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:06.120]   They've gone from, you know, really subpar hardware and a kind of rocky operating system
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:10.800]   with just a few thousand apps to 58,000 apps in a rock solid operating system.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:16.440]   But in many ways, Apple's playing catch up with in the iPhone 4.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:21.040]   And the other thing that I really want out of them badly is other devices.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.320]   You know, I'm, I'm, we're waiting for the Dell device, but I want the Cisco just announced
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:30.120]   it says in the list, a tablet, an Android tablet for businesses, which is smart.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:35.440]   But I think that, that Android has to push Apple is going to be trapped in its definitions
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.200]   of its devices and the advantage of Android is it can work across many devices.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.360]   So I want to see more of them.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:45.280]   And as part of the other problem is that you'll most wonder whether Google should invest in
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.800]   some really good apps and some really good devices.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:52.920]   Well, and that leads us to the conversation about gingerbread Android 3.0, which if you
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:58.520]   ask me is the next level and where we're going to start seeing some pretty amazing hardware,
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.880]   but we're going to talk about that in a minute because I want to take a little break and
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.480]   talk about carbonite pro.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.640]   We've, we've been talking about carbonite for some time.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:10.880]   Carbonite is that great solution for people who need backup.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.280]   Everybody does need backup in their home.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.320]   Carbonite is the kind of backup you want.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.320]   It's automatic.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:23.840]   Remember to back it up and secure encrypted and it's in the cloud.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.840]   It's off site.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.520]   So if the worst happens, you know, you've got a backup on your hard drive sitting next
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.520]   to your main computer.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:32.480]   What if there's a fire, a flood, what if somebody comes and steals it?
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:37.400]   Carbonite pro is the backup you want, especially if you're in a small business, do a little
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.560]   thought experiment with me.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:44.520]   Just imagine what would happen to your small business if you lost your computers in the
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.640]   backups next to them.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.280]   Would you be able to get back online?
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.640]   Would you be able to run your business?
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:53.080]   How would you recreate all that data by hand?
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:58.000]   If you're not backing up off site, your business is hanging by a thread and the best way to
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.560]   do it, carbonite pro, it's free right now for 30 days.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.160]   There's no reason not to try it.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.120]   It's, and you may object, well, I can't afford that.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.120]   No, no, no, no.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.600]   Let me tell you this is the most affordable backup system.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:12.000]   It's actually more affordable using carbonite pro for a number of seats than it is to use
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.560]   carbonite consumer for those same number of seats.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.920]   Prices started $10 a month.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:21.400]   If you go to carbonite pro.com, you'll see some example scenarios of how affordable it
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.760]   can be.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:28.920]   The beauty of this is there's a central dashboard, a centralized place where you can see how the
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.920]   backups, make sure all the systems are backed up that everybody's doing their thing.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.640]   People can restore for themselves.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:41.040]   I can go on and on, but really the best thing to do is just try it free for 30 days.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.040]   And the prices.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.800]   You need eight computers, each of them with five gigabytes of data.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.840]   That's 25 bucks a month for the whole office.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.920]   Eighteen computers, five gigabytes, 50 bucks a month.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.400]   You're not going to find a more affordable, more effective solution.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:59.560]   Carbonite pro for Windows right now, max coming soon, carbonite pro.com, try it free
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.560]   right now.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.800]   I beg of you.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.240]   I beg of you.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.360]   Carbonite pro.notforme for you.com.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.440]   I just added a Google.me.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.440]   You know who's going to be the big loser on Google.me?
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.440]   Is the Croatian Google?
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.440]   Uh oh.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.800]   Google.me is Croatia.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.280]   Ooh.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.760]   Ooh.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.280]   What is me?
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.640]   Is me a Croatian?
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:25.640]   Huh.
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:28.440]   I don't know what.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.720]   Google me.com is not resolving for me.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.600]   Yeah, no, it's Google.me.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.600]   That's what it should be, right?
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   And they just take it away from Croatia.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.040]   Let's take it away from them.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.000]   So let's talk about gingerbread.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.120]   We're right now starting at 2.2 on the Nexus One.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.120]   I haven't gotten it yet.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.120]   Gina, did you get it?
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.920]   I haven't gotten it yet, but they're saying they said end of the week.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.480]   By the end of the week, we should get the update.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.880]   This is FRF58.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.720]   Is that the number 78?
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.720]   Not sure.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.760]   So we have, so when I got my new Nexus One, you know, I got the replacement Nexus One,
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.200]   I put FRF50 on it, which is the one.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.960]   By the way, I found out what these numbers mean.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.000]   It's the number of the days in the quarter that it came out.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   Really?
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.440]   So you can tell exactly when it came out based on the number.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.880]   Right, I've got FRF50.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.880]   50 is like the first one, and it's buggy.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.240]   It's got a lot of little bugs in it.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.840]   Not that I've noticed, but I've been told.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:25.360]   And so I think it's, what's the next, what's the one that they're pushing?
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.680]   78, FRF78, something like that.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.760]   85.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.240]   So it's practically the end of the quarter, right?
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.240]   April, May, June.
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.240]   That makes sense.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.840]   This system is currently up to date.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:35.840]   I hate that.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.840]   I hate that.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.840]   I hate that.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:38.840]   [YELLING]
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.840]   It's like, eh.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.840]   [YELLING]
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.480]   And you keep tapping, maybe hoping it's --
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   It's not going to --
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.320]   That's how geeky I am.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.840]   They should set that in, so if you tap on it, it puts you in Q.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:49.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.400]   They need to put like, I don't know, orchards or something there.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.920]   Just something to make you happy, a game, or something Tetris, something to make you
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.200]   happy because it's so depressing.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.520]   It's the big black screen.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.520]   Right.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.640]   So now you know you can download the zip file.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.680]   Yeah, but then I'm afraid I'm not going to get automatic updates after that.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.680]   It's not a jailbreak, but it's a --
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.120]   Ah, I asked the Google engineers about that.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.360]   They said, no, we look at the version number.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.800]   So if you have F or F-50, which you and I do, Gina, it will update to 85.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.320]   It'll say, oh, no, you don't have the latest.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:24.560]   And if you put 85 now on, you'll get 86 or whatever the next one is.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.560]   Now --
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:26.560]   Good to know.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.560]   Good to know.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.040]   And you know who I met?
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.200]   I met Soric, by the way.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   He was there, the guy who does Sidia.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.200]   Very smart guy.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.640]   And it's Sidia, you said.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   Not Sidia.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.640]   Yes.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.640]   Me too.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.640]   I asked him.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:45.640]   He said, no, no, in Latin, it's the penultimate syllable that gets the emphasis.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.280]   I wasn't going to argue with a guy named Soric.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.280]   You know what he showed?
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.280]   Gina, you would have flipped your lid.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:57.000]   He showed -- Soric is a iPhone hacker extraordinaire, and he showed how you could inject code into
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.800]   a running, un-jail broken -- well, it must have been jailbroken.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   iPhone.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:08.240]   And inject code into the running app, and it will execute it because of the -- I guess
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:12.160]   it's because of the object-oriented nature of the framework.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.000]   It's because it's late binding, right?
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.040]   So because of the late binding, you can just do a great JavaScript code and inject it.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.040]   Really?
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.680]   So he had the phone -- did he demo this?
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.640]   Did he have phone connected to a machine?
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:30.120]   So he, for instance, you hold the icons down and normally goes jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.120]   This is on iPhone only.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.120]   I'm just talking about Android.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.360]   Instead, he made it go transparent.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:35.360]   Oh.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.360]   Huh.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.360]   Huh.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.360]   That is cool.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.200]   That is really cool, but also kind of frightening.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.960]   Because it doesn't have to be jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:44.960]   It could be something else.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.120]   Yeah, but you have to be wired to a machine in order for that.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.000]   I mean, can this happen over the air?
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.800]   I don't -- Could a malicious hacker do this over the air?
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:52.800]   Or was this --
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.800]   That's what's scary, yeah.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:55.800]   I didn't ask him.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.800]   I didn't want him to know.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.800]   Or malicious app.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.920]   I didn't have enough time with Soric.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.440]   I would have had a lot more -- I would have had a lot to ask him.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.440]   But I did find out at Sidia.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.440]   Sidia, that was worth it.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.440]   It was worth it for that.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.960]   I was finding that out.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.480]   As I pointed out to him, really, I mean, there aren't many people in a position to actually
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.640]   say how things are pronounced.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.640]   Almost all of us get all this by reading.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:18.240]   How would you know how it's pronounced?
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:24.120]   And we have this enviable privilege of deciding how words are pronounced.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:30.200]   For the first time ever being said out loud.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.600]   Jimmy, by the way, is Martin Negro.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.600]   I have been told.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.400]   So gingerbread.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.400]   3.0.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:41.760]   Gingerbread is going to require some hefty hardware, it seems.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.200]   Yeah, there's a set of hardware requirements.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:48.200]   So we're looking at beefier handsets and not looking back.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.920]   1.0 gigahertz, 512 megs ram.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.160]   By the way, the Nexus 1 is all of this, right?
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.240]   Minimum display size of 3.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.240]   I don't know.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.240]   Is it 3.5 inches?
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.240]   I guess it is.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.240]   Mm-hmm.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.920]   It's the Nexus 1, but it isn't the G1 or the touch.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.280]   Some of these older devices won't work.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.280]   Android B-Saf.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.280]   That is going to be a problem for them, for them.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.280]   But I guess Apple the same way.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.720]   Apple, you know, the original iPhones.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.080]   iOS 4, right?
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.720]   Doesn't run on the older iPhones.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.720]   Right.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.200]   And you need to do this.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.520]   I'm thinking for tablets.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.960]   I think this is where you start paying attention to tablets, right?
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.320]   But most importantly, they're updating the UI, right?
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:30.720]   So there's been reports that they want to disincentivize carriers from having to create
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.400]   this custom UI, like the sense UI.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:35.800]   They want the native Android UI to be fantastic.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.640]   And I'm really happy about that.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.240]   Because I think that Android could be a lot prettier.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.600]   I wish it was a lot prettier, actually.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:43.600]   And I guess they're saying--
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.600]   I was thinking about that stage.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.600]   Go ahead.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:49.760]   I think that they're saying you're going to see more like the gallery UI that you see
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.040]   in 2.2 right now.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.040]   What does that mean?
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.040]   They said that.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.640]   They have these folders come up and it's 3D and it twirly.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.640]   You have the stacks of photos, right?
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:01.640]   That you can kind of spread out.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.640]   Right.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.760]   And then when you move the phone, it kind of-- I don't know.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:07.160]   I don't know how that's going to apply to the rest of the phone.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.800]   It'll be interesting to see.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.160]   But it is kind of a neat UI.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:19.240]   The problem I think with the UI that Apple solved with one button is with four buttons,
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:24.000]   the buttons-- you end up with an exponential growth because a given button can do 10 different
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.480]   things given on the circumstances.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   And I have to think.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:34.040]   When I hit the little-- I'm in an application and I hit the little whatever you call it,
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.040]   the four lines button.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.040]   Yeah, the menu button.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.040]   Thank you.
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:43.600]   You know, at some point in Gmail, it refers to that.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.200]   And logically, I get this.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.280]   But I just want to be able to hit the button and know what's going to happen.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.520]   And to get back to setting sometimes takes three different steps and I've got to go back
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.320]   in the application to get to a place where the button changes its functionality.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.320]   Well worse.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:00.000]   That's a-- the handset manufacturers haven't decided what order the buttons are in.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   So--
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   So--
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.280]   And you get so used to it being a certain way on the Nexus One and then you use an Evo
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.280]   and it's flipped.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:08.680]   And this is the advantage, right?
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:11.040]   So the iPhone having one button, right?
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.040]   Well--
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.040]   Right?
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.040]   It always does the same.
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:18.360]   You know, when you only have one company making everything, it can all look the same.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.360]   Right.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:25.800]   And I watch this on like best Android practices video that one of the developers put out from
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.080]   Google I/O actually.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:32.640]   And kind of one of the things they ask developers to do is to not make buttons do something that
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   it shouldn't do.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.720]   You know, the back button shouldn't go forward.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.360]   You know, the search button should launch a search box.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:42.920]   And like these things seem really obvious, but they're not enforced by the software.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:47.160]   Like the app developer can do whatever he or she wants.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.520]   So it gets-- you know, this is the cost.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.520]   Like this is the cost that you can't--
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.520]   Freedom.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.520]   --have to have choices.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:58.720]   Freedom and choices means, you know, that you can make bad choices maybe for the user.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.520]   Is it really binary?
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.360]   Is it really open versus closed?
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.760]   Freedom versus restricted?
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.120]   Or is there more of a middle road?
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:13.400]   I mean, do we have to have a situation where it's either Apple's way or the highway or
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.400]   whoo, whatever you want?
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.000]   So are you really asking if Steve--
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.440]   or just a little bit less controlling, would it be a happier world?
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.440]   He used to be.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.440]   I mean, really, let's think about it.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.240]   The Macintosh really was a very open platform.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:29.600]   I think that's-- you know, it's what I think is the Ariana Huffington-- I mean, I'm sorry,
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.840]   the Martha Stewart phenomenon.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.600]   You know, I've been in jail screw you.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.600]   I'm not going to listen to you.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.320]   I've almost died screw you.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.920]   You know, he has a strong vision.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.800]   It's a brilliant vision.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.800]   We love it.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   He knows that.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.440]   He's trying to get things done.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.600]   But I think he has got--
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:51.360]   I think it changed his personality and affected his company.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.000]   I'm delighted he's here.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   When you were--
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.200]   Oh, Tur, when you're an artist, which I think we have to grant Steve.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.000]   Yes.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.200]   You probably should just follow your muse and not listen to anybody.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.800]   But you also have a relationship with people that matters.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:10.760]   And if you kind of don't respect them and respect your marketplace efficiently to be
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:16.160]   able to do smart things on your own, that I think at some point gets you in trouble.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.480]   It's certainly a question every artist asks his or herself.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:24.360]   I mean, him or herself, you have to ask, how much do I pay attention to my customers,
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.680]   my audience, to my patron?
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:27.680]   It's very different.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.680]   Commerce.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:29.680]   I mean, commerce, it's about selling products.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.280]   And certainly Steve knows that.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:33.280]   But he gets reinforced.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.840]   Look, they sold 1.7 million iPhones.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:35.840]   Oh, well.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.440]   And he can say, nah, to everybody, to complain.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:40.440]   And they get that.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.240]   And you don't like it?
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:47.720]   As my friend, Chris Tibona, Google tweeted, Apple's gone from think different to hold
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:52.160]   it different.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.920]   You don't like it?
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:54.920]   Too bad.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.080]   Go buy an Android phone.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:00.200]   At least, and this is the good news, there is a choice.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.520]   We aren't really in a situation where there isn't a choice.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.520]   We have a choice.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.440]   We have many choices.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:10.800]   And the good news is it was Apple iPhone from 2007 to 2008 or 9.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.320]   It was iPhone or Nutton.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.320]   Now there's some choice.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.800]   There's great choices out there.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.440]   By the way, and I don't know if this is true.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.920]   This is coming from Gizmodo today.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.320]   And it's a huge story, if it is true.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:25.600]   According to Gizmodo, Microsoft has killed its kin phone.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.040]   That was fast.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.040]   Six weeks.
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:29.600]   What?
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:36.320]   After two years and millions of dollars of development, according to Gizmodo.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:40.640]   Now Gizmodo, for all its faults, doesn't normally run with a story like this if it's
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.760]   been wrong, wrong, wrong.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.440]   Only 500 kinds were sold.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.440]   Jesus.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.440]   What?
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.440]   500?
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.440]   Did you say 500?
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.840]   Yeah, that's what it says.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:55.240]   I sold more copies of my book.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.240]   Is that possible?
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.360]   I don't think that that's possible.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.040]   I think you're in an environment now.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.040]   Well, a couple of things.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:03.000]   First of all, it looked like a smartphone, but you couldn't buy apps.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   There were no apps.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.160]   There was no app store.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.680]   It was the way it was or nothing.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.680]   Problem one.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:09.680]   Oh, Microsoft.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:16.640]   It was aimed at a younger audience, but it still had that $100 a month smartphone tag.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.640]   The people who could afford a kin, which was fairly affordable, in fact, they cut the
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:20.640]   prices a lot.
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:23.800]   I don't know if you noticed, which was one reason I believe this story.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.840]   Prices were plummeting.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:30.200]   But the people who would buy this phone couldn't afford $100 a month for a smartphone.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:34.600]   And really, more importantly, all the attention is going to the iPhone.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:39.400]   You got to say this is the success of Android, to the incredible, the Nexus One, the EVO.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.720]   The Droid X, the Droid 2.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:46.680]   This new Galaxy Samsung Galaxy S line, which looks very strong.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.720]   I mean, these are great phones.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.760]   And if somebody's in the market for a smartphone, are they going to buy something that you
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.280]   can't add apps to?
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:58.120]   My favorite part about this Gizmodo story is that the ad that is running on the page
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.120]   is for the kin.
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:01.280]   Oh my God, you're right.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.600]   You're a new Windows phone.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.600]   So, oh my God.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.600]   Wow.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.600]   Wow.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:12.000]   You're never going to accuse Gizmodo or any of the Gonkursites for cow-towing, you know,
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.400]   of cow-towing advertisers.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.400]   That's the issue.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.400]   Look at that.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:20.000]   You know, this story crossed literally 10 minutes ago.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.640]   I have no confirmation.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.280]   I have no idea if it's real.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:27.920]   By the time you hear this, it'll either be, you'll obviously true or will look like idiots.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:31.760]   So I just want to be clear that that's the only source right now is Gizmodo.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.560]   They had a really good ad campaign.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.080]   I really like the Kin's commercials, which I only saw in the movie theaters before the
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:41.280]   movie, but it's like that that young girl takes out her phone and says, I'm going to
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.280]   find out how many of my friends were really my friends.
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.280]   It was all about social.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:49.960]   It was a little depressing because the people who are her friends on social networks were
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.760]   sort of like, I don't know if I know you.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:58.440]   Well, and they got trouble, remember, because there was a one point in a guy takes the
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:03.360]   Kin, sticks it up under his shirt, takes a picture and then texts it to a girl.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:07.880]   And they actually cut that part out because it was, I don't know, an up shirt.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:08.880]   I don't know what that is.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:09.880]   I don't know if it's-
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:14.360]   Do I see on information week on the 29th of this month that Verizon cut the price of
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.360]   the Kin considerably?
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.360]   Substantially, yeah.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.880]   At the lower end from $49.99 to $29.99.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:20.880]   Yep.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:25.080]   What they couldn't cut is that expensive smartphone monthly bill.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:29.440]   And I think that if it is indeed dead, and if it is, by the way, a shock, remember now
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.440]   Microsoft still has Windows Phone 7 coming up in November.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.240]   But still, wow.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.960]   Leo, are you going to buy a Microsoft phone?
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.760]   I might run out and get a Kin.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:41.760]   Last chance.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:44.320]   It was the most decent value.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:49.760]   In the fresh in the box, never touched.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.760]   Computer History Museum, five years or about 20 years ago.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:57.760]   I got an original iPhone, I got an original iPod, I've got an OLPC, they got to put something
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.760]   else in there.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:01.360]   The fastest smartphone death in the West.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.000]   I mean, six weeks.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:03.920]   Oh, that's awful.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:08.560]   So go back to the control question that we talked about a little bit before.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:09.560]   You guys saw the story.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.640]   It's on the front feed about the remote kill switch.
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:13.360]   Yeah, this is another big story.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.360]   Yes.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:16.920]   Remote kill and install switch on Android.
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.400]   So this is new to me.
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:19.400]   I knew information to me.
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:21.280]   I'm still kind of a newbie Android developer.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:25.240]   But if you look at the running processes on your Android phone, you can see this process,
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.040]   this service called GTOC service.
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:31.920]   No, I stupidly assume that that was associated with Google talk, like the chat app.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:32.920]   It's not.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:33.920]   It's not.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.920]   It's a heartbeat, right?
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.680]   So when you're connected to the network on your Android phone, the GTOC service is constantly
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:41.120]   kind of sending out this ping, "Hey, I'm here, I'm online, hey, I'm here."
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:47.160]   And when you install an app from the Android market, you're not just downloading the APK
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.160]   directly.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.000]   You're saying to the market, "I want this app."
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.200]   And then this GTOC service gets pushed a message, which is install this app.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:57.640]   So actually, Google is pushing down apps to you.
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:02.240]   So they can install apps on your phone, and they can also delete apps remotely that you
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.680]   have installed on your phone, which they've deemed to be malicious, right?
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:10.240]   So they've never exercised the remote kill functionality until this past week.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:18.320]   A guy, John Oberheit, I hope I'm pronouncing his name right, he created an app called Rootstrap,
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:23.040]   and he put the Twilight Eclipse movie imagery on it.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.080]   And it really had nothing to do with the movie.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:31.000]   And actually, it was an innocent app, but it got access to your phone and could do malicious
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   things.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.680]   And this is just kind of a proof of concept thing.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:36.400]   And the Android team exercised their remote kill switch.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:40.480]   They deleted the app from the market, and they uninstalled it from all the phones that
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.480]   it had.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.200]   I think he removed the app from the market.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.040]   He was asked to and did it himself.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:49.280]   But he says later that day, he knows a couple of notifications on his phone.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:55.600]   Like Quips Preview removed from your phone, Rootstrap removed from your phone.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.760]   So Android pulled the trigger.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:01.640]   I got to say, Apple has acknowledged that they have kill as well.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:03.800]   That Kindle has it, we found out.
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:04.800]   Right.
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:09.080]   You have to in something that's attached to a network, like a telephone network, because
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:13.120]   if a malicious app gets out there, you need to have a way to protect the network, right?
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.120]   Well, I think you're right.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.200]   The discovery in it this way is not a good thing.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:20.600]   You know, put about it and say, hey, God, behave or we can kill an app.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:21.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.360]   It would be more transparent.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:27.240]   Probably knowing Google's engineering background, they said, well, it's in the API.
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:35.360]   If you had just checked, everyone knows that the remove asset intent is for removing assets.
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:37.920]   What did you think it was for?
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:38.920]   Please.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.160]   I don't have a problem with this.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.520]   I don't have a problem with this at all.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:43.760]   I mean, you got to do it.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:45.120]   But I don't either.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:50.000]   And I think that I know people who do have a problem, but this is the reverse side of
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.760]   DVD John's article.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:56.160]   Well, maybe you let everything, you have a completely open, you can check that box that
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.600]   says install apps from third parties.
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.320]   I'll put anything on my phone I want.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.920]   But you got at some point, I'm sure the carriers are going to insist there's got to be some
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:08.000]   way to reach into that phone and stop something that's damaging to the network.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.160]   I want it.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:13.280]   If I screw up and put something in my phone and they rescue me from it, that's fine.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.280]   If they use it for bad purposes, that's no good.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.360]   But that's the same as all thing life.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.360]   Right.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.360]   Right.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.360]   That is.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.680]   That's the same as all things in life.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.680]   Thank you.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.680]   All things must.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.680]   Well, that kind of says it all down.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.520]   What else do you have to say?
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.240]   So it is good for us to know.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.760]   I love the technical explanation that you gave Gina.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:38.760]   I didn't, you know, it's good to know what that this cheat talk is not a cheat talk.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.760]   It's not a cheat talk.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.880]   Well, I mean, the interesting part that the John Oh, the point that he made was that they
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.680]   can remotely install things on your phone.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.680]   That's kind of weird.
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:53.280]   What is weird and interesting, you know, like an OS update or an app, I don't know.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.480]   It'll be interesting to say.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.800]   I don't know of any case when they have exercised the remote install.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.960]   Yeah, because there's a, there's a remote install asset intent as well as a remove asset
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.960]   intent.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.960]   Mm hmm.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:05.960]   Mm hmm.
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.200]   And that actually is invoked every time you install from the market.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.480]   You're not just downloading from the market.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.080]   It's actually pushing that message down, but they could do it.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.400]   I think it's kind of elegant actually.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.400]   It is kind of nice.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.400]   I think so.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.760]   Well, the good news is John, I wish we were on the show.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.760]   Go ahead.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.720]   John is saying he's taking a careful look at these code paths.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.120]   So they're, you know, it's open source.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.320]   That's you got to love that.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.320]   You look through it.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.320]   It's all published.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.880]   So you can look and see what it's done.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.880]   I love that.
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:34.880]   Go ahead.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.880]   Jeff, I'm sorry.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:39.920]   I was just going to say, what would be cool for all of the show hint hint Google downloaded
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.840]   for you to all of our phone.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:47.000]   Use your install asset intent Google right now.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   It's just for good.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:56.280]   No, I think it's my, it's my, it's my memory that they will give you a notification and
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.920]   says there's a new update you want to install.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:01:59.920]   I know I keep looking.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.920]   It has to reboot your system.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.080]   It's a pretty, it's, it's like the girl who doesn't call.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:07.560]   Oh, he keeps checking his phone looking for a message.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:11.040]   Let's see.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.840]   The droid X coming soon.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.240]   There's some really nice Android phones coming.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.240]   I have to say, as nice as the iPhone is, I don't, I think in many ways is playing catch
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.320]   up.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.000]   And I think, yeah.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.920]   Folders multitasking, both kind of mediocre implementations of something that's existed
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.200]   on Android for a while.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.680]   I have the screen is beautiful.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.440]   It's the highest res screen I've ever used.
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.720]   I did love the Nexus one AMOLED screens.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.520]   We're going to see a really nice one in that galaxy S from Samsung.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.080]   They make AMOLED screens.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.280]   I think it's just a matter of time.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.760]   I mean, this is an LG screen.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.760]   It's not an Apple screen.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:50.400]   It's just a matter of time before we see high res screens like this on Android.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.920]   Kigahertz processor, catch up, 512 megs of RAM, catch up.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.120]   Face time is in the EVO.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.560]   You can, you can do this though.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.360]   Here's where Google could just kill Apple instantly in the FaceTime realm.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:08.520]   And now you have to have an iPhone 4 to FaceTime and you have to do over Wi-Fi.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:13.280]   Google could put a hook in Google talk because they've already got video, right?
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:18.680]   That anybody who has Google talk can FaceTime or whatever they'll call it, video chat with
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.760]   anybody with an EVO or any other Android phone that has video chat built in.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.800]   Be easy.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.560]   And you could even, and by the way, you can use the EVO to video chat over 3G.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.160]   You don't have to have Wi-Fi.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:35.560]   The problem is that somebody else, there's so little software support right now.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.320]   Love the Vuvuzela button on YouTube.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.560]   It's not on all videos though, is it?
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.040]   It's just on the, and it's not just soccer videos.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.200]   It's just kind of random.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:45.600]   Yeah, it's just sort of random.
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:53.800]   Google has said an interesting thing actually about HTML5 and Flash.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:59.320]   YouTube has announced that it's going to continue to use Flash for the foreseeable future.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:06.720]   So despite Google's commitment to Flash, according to the register, not my favorite
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:10.280]   source in the world, but Kaid Metz writing in the register, Google has confirmed that
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:15.360]   Adobe Flash will continue to quote, "play a critical role" end quote on YouTube, saying
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:20.080]   HTML5 video does not meet the site's needs.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:25.040]   This is a Tuesday blog post from John Harding, who's a YouTube software engineer on the
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.920]   YouTube API blog.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.160]   Don't forgive me for not having read this ahead of time.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:34.720]   I missed, I try to read the YouTube API blog as often as possible.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.640]   Yeah, and kind of another thing.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.640]   It's in there.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.640]   It's in there.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.120]   And we need to know when life is in there.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.120]   Yeah, it's all here.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:46.040]   If you were just ringing it, you wouldn't be showing your prize.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.080]   The new version of Chrome.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.880]   Speaking of YouTube.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.360]   Okay, I'll give you Jeff.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.680]   You win that race condition.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.680]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.680]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.680]   I'm speaking of YouTube.
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.480]   They're not even doing something brilliant when they came up with a new ad model, which
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:06.720]   is that just like AdSense, they'll do pre-roll ads and only if it's watched, does the advertiser
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.120]   pay.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:14.320]   And so Google's head of advertising for YouTube basically lectured advertisers and said,
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:18.120]   "Now it all comes down to you, make stuff people want to watch."
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.120]   Right.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.600]   Don't just make a message, it's not going to work.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.920]   See, as a content creator, I mixed feelings about this.
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.920]   I hate that idea.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:28.120]   It paid regardless of whether somebody watched it.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.120]   But...
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.240]   Well, the problem is that it's out of your hands.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.520]   You can make a great show, but the advertiser makes a crappy ad.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.520]   Exactly.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.520]   And you don't get paid.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.520]   Right.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.160]   So, but maybe that goes to a point where you start making the commercials for them.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:44.680]   Well, we're actually looking at doing that because most of the people who advertise it.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.680]   Exactly.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.440]   Yeah, don't have assets, video assets.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.440]   So that's exactly what...
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.960]   Well, the strength, I'm sure the strength of your advertising on this show, which of
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:55.640]   course leads to, you've got more to read, I know, is that you do read them.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.640]   Right.
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:59.240]   And I'm sure there's very high recall of what your advertisers are on Twitch show.
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.240]   That's really true.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.680]   Versus just something to play.
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.720]   Yeah, interstitial ads, those ads are just thrown at.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:08.000]   You really don't have the same value.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.200]   But if we have to have some video ads too, we can't.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:17.760]   So, I'm willing to concede this one and say good because normally I don't like a paper
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.760]   click.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.080]   I prefer paper impression.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.440]   But this isn't exactly paper click.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:24.120]   This is you get paid if they see the ad.
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.400]   And if they don't see the ad, I guess they didn't watch your video either.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.400]   So...
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.560]   I think there's probably a more accurate way to do it, which maybe that the more people
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.560]   watch your ad.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:35.760]   And it's like, the interesting thing about AdSense is you rise to the top on the right
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:40.600]   rail, not because you pay more, but because people click on your ad more.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.920]   Maybe there's a similar thing to be doing with video is the more people actually watch
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.800]   your whole commercial, you get rewarded in some way.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.800]   You get discounts.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.480]   You get better placement.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.480]   You get other things.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:57.360]   And that quality and entertainment are rewarded.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:03.960]   Speaking of the cloud, apparently Amazon was down for a significant amount of time yesterday,
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:10.960]   a three hour crash leading to a 7.8% drop in its share price on the market.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.960]   Oh.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:12.960]   Wow.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.960]   Based on revenue.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:14.960]   Everything was going down yesterday.
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.440]   Yeah, I don't know if you can blame it being down.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.440]   Who knows though?
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.280]   The market's so crazy.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:20.280]   That's from the Huffpo.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.720]   What were you going to say, Jean?
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:24.720]   We had a--
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.200]   We were talking about Flash earlier.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:30.040]   You know, Google Chrome now, the latest stable release of Google Chrome comes with Flash
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.240]   built in and will update it for you.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.240]   Yes?
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.720]   Yeah, they announced this on the official Google blog today.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:40.320]   And in fact, they released a little Flash game that you could play kind of in celebration
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.320]   and it went down.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:46.720]   Like, they're just doing it like, they couldn't keep it up.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.720]   Wow.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.800]   And the first finish line in a Flash is the name of the story.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.800]   Wow.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.240]   So I tried to click on it earlier, so here I am.
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:56.680]   It's youtube.com/chromefastball.
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:00.880]   And I haven't actually seen the game because it wouldn't load for me, but they updated
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.720]   the post and said, "Do you know an overwhelming response to the game?
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:06.840]   Some things aren't quite working as we'd hoped."
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.760]   So all automatically as a Chrome user, get this thing?
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.360]   So you get-- it's just a Adobe Flash plugin, right?
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.360]   So it comes--
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:16.360]   No, I see.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:18.240]   I probably bet it's not.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:19.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:23.000]   But the good thing about it is that the user doesn't have to interact with it at all to
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.880]   update security updates or always kind of the issue, right, with Flash?
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.920]   Flash has a huge security flaw.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.080]   Huge security problem.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.720]   So now Chrome manages that for you.
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.840]   So you always have the latest kind of most secure update.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.680]   So this is interesting and it makes a lot of sense with Chrome OS, right?
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.520]   Dropping the end of the year, the last quarter of the year.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.520]   Right.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.520]   So it's kind of a pretty strong--
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.680]   And Firefox has kind of done this for a while.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:46.320]   Firefox has notified you if a plugin is out of date.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:48.160]   But it doesn't-- it's not quite the same.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.160]   It's just fixing it.
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.160]   It's just fixing it.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.960]   Yeah, I can't load that Chrome Fastball page at all.
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:55.960]   Damn.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:56.960]   Me neither.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.960]   So what's on that?
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:58.960]   What do I--
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:08:59.960]   It's a Flash game.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:03.940]   To celebrate, we teamed up with a few creative folks to make Chrome Fastball a Flash-based
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:05.720]   game built for YouTube.
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.080]   So much for Flash being scalable.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.080]   Uh, gee.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.560]   Uh, server-side overloading.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.960]   I mean, it's kind of awesome that Google took its own--
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:21.080]   you know, took its own site down.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.080]   Interesting.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.040]   Yeah, it can play various games to get the shiny Chrome ball to the finish line.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.600]   I want the Chrome ball.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.400]   I know.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.600]   I want to play Chrome ball.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.760]   All right.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:33.400]   We-- we're going to move on here because we're running out of time.
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:37.000]   We're going to get to our tip number and pick of the week in just a second.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.400]   Before we do that, though, I want to remind everybody to run out, do not walk, run out
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:47.680]   to an iStock photo and get your images.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:52.120]   You know, a blog post without a picture is like a day without sunshine.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.960]   Every good blogger knows that-- you're smiling, Gina.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.120]   The me-- what you do this, right?
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.120]   I'm sure.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.120]   Let me just go to smarter where.
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.120]   I bet you there's not one post without a picture on it.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.120]   Picture every guy.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.520]   I actually look for photos all the time and I don't do a good job of it.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:05.520]   So this is good news.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.520]   Yeah, this is what you need.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.160]   TechCrunch always has good, good, funny images.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.160]   Well, they do a good job, don't they?
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.400]   They have crazy images.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:17.000]   They illustrate these-- Dave Weiner does that too.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.400]   Yeah, Blogger-- Blogger lesson zero is you need an image.
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.960]   Blogger lesson one is don't just take an image from Google Image Search results if you don't
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.120]   have the rights to use those images.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.120]   Right.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:31.160]   But the beauty of iStock photo is it's very affordable and they're great images and not
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.240]   just images, by the way.
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:37.800]   They now do-- besides photos and illustrations, they do video and audio, they sound effects.
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.320]   I think every blog post should have a sound effect.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:43.760]   What would yours be, Leo?
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.480]   I got a vousséla right here and I'm not afraid to use it.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.480]   Actually, I won't blow it because somebody said I'm no longer listening to the Twit
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.800]   Network because he keeps blowing his vousséla.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:58.800]   I have two official South African voussélas that were sent to me by listeners from the
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.800]   World Cup.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.400]   Not just an iPhone app.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:05.280]   And believe me, they're just as annoying in person as they are on TV.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.760]   I don't doubt that.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:12.280]   There is no iStock vousséla, but there is an iStock photo.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.920]   When they first started in 2000, they just were offering photos.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:18.080]   Now they've got illustrations, vector images, videos, music and sound effects.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.360]   There is Flash.
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.560]   There are 3D renders and they're going to do logos soon.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:27.960]   It works very easily because it's really designed for the blogger, the podcaster, somebody
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:34.480]   who just wants it to be easy and affordable to get these royalty-free images or sounds
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.320]   into their productions.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.600]   You buy a bundle of credits and then you just browse around an iStock photo.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.600]   Pick what you want.
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:42.880]   It's so easy.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.600]   There are even iStock photo apps.
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:49.560]   There's one coming for the iPhone soon that will make it very easy to add content to any
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.560]   site.
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.560]   I just think iStock photo is fantastic.
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.920]   I've been using it for years.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:57.520]   From $1 and up, very affordable.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.080]   You can get subscriptions, services and so forth.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:07.440]   And right now, 15% off bundles of 50 credits or more, if you go to iStockPhoto.com/twig.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.440]   It's royalty-free.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.200]   That means you buy it once and use it forever.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.720]   That's really important.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:18.600]   Also, if you're, by the way, if you're a photographer or you have stock photos or images or illustrations,
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.400]   you might want to take a look at iStock photo to sell your stuff.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.640]   Get ready for this.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:34.960]   Open million royalty-free stock files right now available for you at iStockPhoto.com/twig
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.200]   to get that 15% discount.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.960]   We thank you for their support.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:44.200]   Of this weekend, Google Time for Jean Trapani's tip of the week.
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.640]   This is an easy one for Gmail users.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:54.040]   You can now view Word documents, dot doc or dot doc X files in a new Google Docs viewer.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:57.440]   So instead of opening it up in Google Docs and going through the spinning thing or it
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.560]   has to convert it, it's just a viewer.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:03.040]   You can just quickly open up a Microsoft Word document.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:08.400]   So if you go into Gmail and you search for has colon attachment, doc X or doc, you'll
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:12.440]   see there's a view link next to your Word attachment.
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:15.720]   And if you click on that, it opens up the viewer and then you can click on edit online
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.920]   to edit it in Google Docs or just see it.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:24.880]   So for emailing around Microsoft Word documents, a little less annoying.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:27.720]   Have they made the Google Apps better for you?
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:31.360]   Have they solved that email issue, the single email?
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.360]   They haven't.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:35.000]   And they're still kind of promising a solution, right?
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.480]   The Google account issue, right?
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.640]   That's kind of vanilla Google account versus apps.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:43.200]   They haven't gotten there yet, but they're working on it.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.200]   They released Wave for Google Apps, which is great.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:48.600]   There's still a lot of services like Google Voice and Google Reader, which aren't apps
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:49.600]   for apps accounts yet.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:52.960]   So I'm still rocking the two Google accounts.
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:53.960]   So frustrating.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:58.440]   Yeah, yeah, that's going to be a happy day when they work that out.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:02.320]   And I hope they're thinking the ability to merge the accounts, you know?
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:07.640]   Yeah, because otherwise you'd have to just start over or something.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.160]   Yeah, that'd be awful.
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:14.960]   Well, especially now my phone is tied to an email account that's not my main email account.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.960]   Right.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.040]   Because it's my email account is a good last case.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:22.480]   They need a way to merge accounts in general because all of us have multiple email accounts
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.480]   now.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:26.720]   Yeah, they don't fight it, but they don't acknowledge it in any way.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.840]   There should be simply an app switcher.
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.240]   I shouldn't have to sign out a Gmail and sign back in.
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.240]   Right.
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.240]   Simple level.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:37.720]   Yeah, I should just be able to say, hey, this is where these are my accounts.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:41.280]   Claim them and then use Gmail to go back and forth.
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.280]   Right.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:44.880]   Another great idea from the show we've given them.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.880]   Gosh, you know, if they would just listen to us, I want Froyo and return.
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:49.880]   We give you all these ideas.
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:50.880]   I just can be Froyo.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:51.880]   Push me Froyo.
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:52.880]   Please.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.880]   Please, I beg of you.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:00.520]   Jeff Jarvis, time for our number of the week.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.600]   Well, thanks to a Twitter listener.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:07.560]   I'm going to use what he suggested, which is 443,000, which is the number of lines of
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.040]   JavaScript handwritten code in Gmail.
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.040]   Oh boy.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.040]   Wow.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.040]   That's right.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.920]   They're more to the point that Gmail is going to use more and more HTML5 features, saying
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.160]   that their goal is to get it to load in less than a second and to do new features like
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.600]   letting us drag documents to the desktop and all kinds of fun stuff like that.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.960]   I never felt like Gmail was slow in the least.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.760]   I did either.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.120]   You know, they have that labs feature, which is the preview.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:35.480]   So like while your Gmail is loading, it shows you kind of just like a preview of your list
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.480]   of messages.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:42.000]   I actually have that enabled because it does take a couple of seconds to load your inbox.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.240]   But you can sort of get a peek in.
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.240]   You are one busy lady.
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:48.480]   You got to make sure every second is filled.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:51.080]   I don't have three seconds to spare here, people.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.080]   I need to see.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.080]   I don't know.
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:56.160]   I mean, I've never seen a I've never even thought of Gmail as being slow.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.760]   It loads so fast for me.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:02.120]   It seems faster than my death certainly much faster than my desktop mail application, which
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.040]   is Apple mail.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:06.800]   You just spoiled Gina.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.800]   Spiled.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.360]   I actually have a couple of tools for you.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.640]   Picasa just got updated.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:20.120]   If you haven't yet tried the free Picasa program from Google, it's spectacular and
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.840]   face recognition and a lot of nice features.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:25.400]   And the update just seems to be a minor bug fix, maybe a security update.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.800]   But just reminded me, we haven't messaged Picasa lately.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.760]   And we also mentioned my other pick, which I do think you should try if you're on an
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:33.760]   Android phone.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.080]   Kindle for Android, it's great.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:40.160]   It's a little bit, I think, behind the Apple and iPad version because they've added audio
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.160]   and video.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.160]   Yeah, that's a bummer.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:46.200]   However, I don't think there's a lot of content that uses audio and video yet.
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:50.040]   So maybe they'll catch up quickly, but at least we've got it now.
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.920]   And it does sync up.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:58.880]   So wherever you are on Kindle, iPad, iPhone or our Android phone, you'll jump to that
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.240]   point on all the other devices if you want.
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:02.240]   And I love that.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.840]   Can I tell you a secret, my wife got the Kindle when I got the iPad.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:10.320]   And I just said, well, keep it on my Amazon account.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:15.120]   And now when she buys a book, if she likes it, I can read it on my devices too.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.600]   So it's kind of fun.
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:17.760]   Don't tell them.
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.000]   I think you're allowed to do that.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.600]   I think you're allowed to do that.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.680]   Jeff Jarvis is the greatest buzz machine.com.
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:29.440]   Thanks to the folks at Sony for letting us use the conference room.
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.440]   I'm not going to tell you something.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:36.480]   I'm in an old just fair office, but I'm on the executive floor.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:39.800]   So there's a gigantic old tranetron.
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.360]   Where are my tranetron TV?
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:42.360]   Look at that.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.360]   Right?
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:44.360]   I love those.
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.960]   And my favorite is though, there is.
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:47.960]   Let's see.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:48.960]   Is that a select?
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:49.960]   You know what that is?
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:50.960]   You ever seen one of those?
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:51.960]   Is that a typewriter?
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:56.400]   I can't read something about those ones on paper.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.400]   I love it.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.800]   Jeff, if I were you, I'd look for dead bodies.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:03.240]   Under the behind the modesty panel, I think you found a ghost room.
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.240]   Yes.
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.440]   Yes, I think so.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.440]   Jeez.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.680]   There's a typewriter and a tranetron.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:09.680]   Wow.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.680]   Actually, you know what?
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:14.400]   I miss my typewriter.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.800]   I wish I had one.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.240]   And my tranetron.
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.280]   And my tranetron.
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.280]   Go to buzzmachine.com and read Jeff's blog.
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.280]   And the new book is coming soon.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:29.000]   I just make it up.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   But he's got to read his public parts.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.120]   And of course his current book, What Would Google Do?
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.480]   And Stephen Levy was at Food Camp.
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.720]   And I guess he's doing a book on Google now.
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.360]   So it's a crowded space.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.200]   All these late covers.
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:52.000]   Ah, you will have first the Christopher Columbus of Google Books.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.840]   Now, but tell me.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:59.160]   Well, yeah, he's the Vikings of Google Books.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.400]   Gina Trapani at smarter where.org.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.680]   That's her blog.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:09.800]   And of course, the complete guide to Google Wave is available at completewaveguide.com.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.040]   Cindy, thanks for having me.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.040]   Fun Joe today.
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.040]   Always fun.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.040]   Always a great pleasure.
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:17.760]   As Jeff and I concur, one of my favorites.
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.960]   I like to do highlight of my week.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:20.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.920]   See Gina there on the across the screens.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:23.400]   I know.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:24.720]   It's so nice.
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:25.400]   We'll get a guest.
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:30.000]   I wanted to reunite the three for this episode.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.160]   We'll get a guest for next week.
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:33.880]   I met so many great Google folks at Food Camp.
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:34.880]   They all want to be on the show.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.120]   So it'll be easy to get people on.
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:37.600]   I think Rick Clow is first in line.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.080]   He's been dying again on the show before.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:39.960]   We should get him on you.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:40.960]   Absolutely.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:47.760]   And Rick can talk to all these questions we have about profile pages.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.320]   Well, he did feed burner.
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.520]   Feed burner was acquired by Google.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:51.520]   What's he working on now?
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.120]   He's working on the profile pages.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:54.880]   He's the product manager, I believe.
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:55.880]   He took over.
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:56.880]   Oh, great.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:57.880]   Okay.
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:58.880]   Good.
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:19:59.880]   He's the guy.
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:01.880]   Rick Clow or good in play.
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.680]   Or find out what Google media.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.680]   We will find out.
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.720]   Maybe he'll have some announcement to make next week.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.720]   You never know.
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.120]   Let me call him an announcement on this show.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.120]   Wouldn't that be nice, Google?
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.120]   Don't you think you'd like to do that?
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.400]   Either that or give me Froyo.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.400]   Give me Froyo.
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:16.400]   Give me Froyo.
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.400]   Give me death.
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.400]   No.
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:21.640]   Join us every week on Wednesdays.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:22.640]   We do it at 1 p.m.
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.640]   Pacific time.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.640]   That's 4 p.m.
