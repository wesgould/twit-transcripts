[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.820]   This week on This Week in Google our last show of the year. Stacey's here, Jeff's here,
[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.920]   and it's here, the whole gang's here. There's a lot of random stuff to talk about. We're
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.040]   going to give Jeff some good news about the new Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2. We'll talk
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.560]   about another podcast network this time being sold to Amazon for hundreds of millions of
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.840]   dollars and is sub-stack the future of media. It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.760]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.600]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.640]   From people you trust.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.840]   This is Twig.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.440]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:51.520]   This is Twig, this week in Google. Episode 592 recorded December 30th, 2020. Hats on sticks.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:01:00.120]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. We'll eat last show of the year everybody. Episode
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.000]   592, it's the 30th day of December. Stacey Higginbotham is all bundled up because she's
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.960]   the closest to the North Pole here. Stacey on IOT.com. Hi Stacey.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960]   I feel like Jeff might be close.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.960]   I'm white birdie.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:25.200]   Jeff's in Jersey. Jersey, as they said in Hamilton, everything's legal in Jersey. I don't think
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.000]   you could ever say that Jersey's close to the North Pole. Could you really say that?
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.200]   But you're saying latitudinally he might be.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.080]   How do I find this out? What do we do? Map to Google, Map should tell us.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.280]   I think in Google, what is my latitude?
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.960]   Google's really good on that. And see if it does it. Maybe not. No, it doesn't.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.320]   In auto. Oh no, it does.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.440]   It does. Okay, so my latitude is 47.6062 degrees.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.240]   She's at the 47th parallel. Mr. Jive is wearing you. 47th.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.000]   Oh, yeah. Didn't do it for me.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.260]   What's city in New Jersey?
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.720]   I'm at latitude of 40.76 degrees.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.120]   Oh, yeah. He's in the 40s. He's not even close.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.680]   Nothing. All right. Hunter.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.440]   And also with this, a man whose heart is deep in the South, but whose body and mind we have
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.840]   brought north, Mr. Ant Pruitt from Hands-Off Doggific. Hello, Antony Pruitt.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.120]   Hello, Mr. LaPorte. You said you're gonna say y'all a bunch on the show today.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:41.280]   Yeah, I plan on saying that a few times because awesome listeners and followers on Twitter
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.040]   tend to enjoy little tidbits like that for the drink. Drink up y'all.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.680]   Is that what I saw this going on on Twitter?
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.680]   Jeff said his drinking game would be Gutenberg, but I think moral panic would really get you
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.680]   a little higher. Get just longer.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.880]   That's when I drink.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.360]   Yeah. What would we say for Stacy?
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.560]   That's the third on us.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.720]   Just ooh. No, it was y'all for Stacy.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.840]   Oh, yes, she says y'all too.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.440]   But I'm a southern of too. Yeah, and I'm gonna have to say y'all.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.400]   I think that's twice the drinking. I think that's just fine.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.320]   I just say yo.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:27.080]   Yo, yo. I'm just gonna have to do this to Stacy because we should start the show with
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.880]   a nightmare. Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.600]   Well, hold on. Hold on.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.120]   Can I mention something?
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.960]   We intro the show this week in Google and we actually use the Google service to start
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.960]   the show.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.960]   Oh, that's our hit.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.960]   Oh, good boy.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.960]   We set a record.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.520]   So there we go. Our work is done.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.760]   We don't have to do any more Google for the rest of the show.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the dancing robots.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.240]   This makes Stacy so happy. Oh, I'm sure I'm not.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.320]   This will get us taken down for sure. Let me turn on my audio though, just in case because
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.640]   I think you really should hear it. I mean, not. You may be more interesting without the
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:22.720]   music. Imagine if you will a robot dancing to do you love me.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.240]   Well, Leo, you second. Do you love me? Somebody said this is what the robots are gonna look
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.680]   like when they dance on our graves.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.480]   That is an appropriate comment. Yeah.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.360]   No, they're lovable now.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.880]   So how could you not love? Oh my goodness. You and your.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.840]   Oh, notice though. Do you see how limber that robot is?
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.720]   Notice the angles of motion it has.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.840]   There is also a wall between them and the humans.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.800]   I don't think that's by accident.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.880]   I think it's a real litmus test for how people feel about robots and technology because
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.640]   it might date at the prom.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.040]   Some people look at this and go, oh, isn't that cute? The robots are dancing. They're
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.600]   still dancing. And other people look at it and go, oh my God, imagine that coming bounding
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.560]   out of the forest with armor running at you.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.760]   Just imagine, I mean, think about this. You, let's say you're a dissident and the police
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.760]   use these robots. Yes.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.320]   But it doesn't matter how well they dance with they can use those same moves like the
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.080]   actual karate kid you. Exactly.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.160]   Their agile is the point.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.480]   And really that's the Charlie Hoover sent that to me. He's a fan of the show as well.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.560]   And at the he sent it to me, I asked him, I said, does this humanize it more for you?
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.520]   Because that was the first thing that kind of my mind is everybody just being all like
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:58.800]   mistacy and afraid of them. But I think this is just another leap, if you will, and bound
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.280]   for just how far this tech has come and what it could potentially be for us. We've all
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.040]   wanted robots, right?
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.120]   Should it, would it, does it concern any of you that now it's owned by a South Korean
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.120]   firm Hyundai?
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.560]   No, that's probably actually better.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.560]   It doesn't concern me.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.560]   Yeah, when Google had it, I was a little worried.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.560]   Yeah, Google sold it in soft bank had it.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.320]   And now Hyundai, which makes sense because Hyundai makes, you know, everything else.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.920]   You see, what strikes me is if the first thing they had done was not the scariest stuff,
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.240]   but they had done this. So they've done, if they'd done a robot ballet, I think we'd
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   look at it. There was a little ballet.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.840]   It really was. If they enclosed them with a different, they didn't look so mechanical.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:52.680]   It gives a nutcracker kind of a whole new meaning, though.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.200]   Not exactly a Christmas festivity.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   Only you.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:02.320]   Anyway, I would tell you, even if they danced first for me, I would still be terrified of
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:11.000]   them because they represent an agile, scary device that could be used against people.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.120]   It's the same reason, like, if you're dancing with a gun, I still think, dude, that person
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120]   has to do this.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.120]   Same with cars.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:26.560]   It's nice that he dances, but I just don't dance over here, buddy boy.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.000]   Well, here's the Google angle on that. You'll now be able to, if they do a TikTok video,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.800]   find it on Google search because they're now going to put TikTok and Instagram and other
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:46.120]   short form video at the top, not just YouTube.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.560]   Carousel in the carousel of Google love.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.960]   Okay. I got the Google angle on there.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.960]   I don't know.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.840]   How are they going to? What's the taxonomic structure they're going to use to search
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.840]   and categorize and prioritize them? How the heck do you know what it's about?
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.320]   Do you tag your TikToks?
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.760]   I'm sure you tag them.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.960]   Well, but that's not reliable.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:21.400]   No. Can you put robot text in your TikToks?
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   Robots.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.400]   Robots. Did you say robots?
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   Sorry.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.640]   Hold on. Let me ask one of the kids because they would know I don't.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:35.240]   I mean, Google has AI that can say like broadly this person is dancing.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.600]   This person is happy.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.400]   If you use Google photos, you know that they can, they can, they don't need any tags.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.400]   They can categorize.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.480]   How would they get, how would they guess Sarah Cooper's videos?
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.480]   What the heck?
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.920]   Well, I don't know.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.080]   Does Google never use any human input?
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.440]   Do they ever have any like categorizers and judging?
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.480]   They're going to hire a bunch of teenagers to, uh,
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.480]   we call this videos.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.480]   I don't know.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.480]   It's kind of lip syncing.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.480]   I don't know.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.480]   It's a comedy.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.480]   That's how it will work though.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.120]   It's not funny, man.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.320]   That would be awesome.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.320]   My daughter would be like, oh, this is another stupid, this type of, you know, because there's
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.800]   the whole, I tried to convince, okay, I'm still working on this y'all, but I tried to convince
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   my family to learn it.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   TikToks.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   Oh, Drake.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.800]   It's something to do over the holidays.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   What?
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   Y'all.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   We had a y'all.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   Oh.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   Everybody.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.480]   Um, but no one will do it with me.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.280]   And I'm really sad because we don't have to put it on the internet, but I thought, what
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.720]   better way to celebrate the holidays when you're cooped up inside than learning a TikTok
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.720]   dance?
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.720]   Let me, I know.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:47.320]   In fact, it's such a big, it's such a, um, phenomenon now, cultural phenomenon now that
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:54.360]   I see more and more advertisers doing either's TikTok style advertising.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.400]   I watch a lot of, watch the awful lot of football over the past week.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.040]   I couldn't do much else.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.040]   Awesome.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.000]   And there was, yeah, well, I watched NFL.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.320]   I'm sorry to watch college football, but there was a lot of TikTok like ads and then
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.880]   Jack in the box.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:15.120]   Actually, they didn't say TikTok, but they actually said we have a new version of the
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.600]   chicken dance and they did TikTok style.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.600]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   You saw that, right?
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.000]   If you look at it, that was clearly hoping TikTok influencers would pick it up and this
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.600]   is such a phenomenon now.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:34.840]   And yet, and by the way, among the ads on the NFL, a lot of ads by paid for by TikTok.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:42.480]   The NFL also used TikTok in its ads and I wasn't clear which were which to be honest
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.920]   with you.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.160]   That was unclear.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:51.240]   So isn't TikTok status in hanging in the by a thread?
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.880]   What's going on?
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.160]   Is it over?
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.320]   What did your president say about it?
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:04.720]   No, it's going to, they're going to hang on for 21 days and then never mind.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.120]   Yeah, right.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:16.320]   And by the way, we do have just for you the story behind how Ratatouille, the TikTok musical
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.320]   was made.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.320]   Oh boy.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.320]   I did this to you.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.320]   Did I find it already?
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.520]   Did I find the Easter egg already?
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.520]   Nope, nope.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.520]   That's not it.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.520]   That's not it.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.520]   But you know what I am?
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.520]   I failed here.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:35.600]   I have been trying for the last hour to buy a ticket for you and their ticketing is down.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.080]   To see that Ratatouille?
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.240]   I was trying to surprise them.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:46.720]   It's online and it says we're fighting your seat for you.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   Oh, I hate that.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.080]   I hate that.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.600]   Tickets are on sale now at Ratatouille.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.600]   Keep it.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.600]   It does.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   Look, it's for a good cause.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.160]   The Anti-Actors Fund.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.880]   Two days, one hour, 20 minutes.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.040]   I heard when Brady is doing it.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.040]   Who, what person is it?
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.040]   You know, so this is part of the story.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.040]   Look at the cast.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.040]   The cast is unbelievable.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.320]   That's where all the stories are put on.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.440]   I don't know if Wayne Brady is unbelievable, but okay.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.440]   Let me first...
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.560]   Well, I like Wayne Brady, okay.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.560]   For a pandemic.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   I too.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.560]   I mean...
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.560]   Who's line is it?
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.560]   Anything.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.560]   It's five bucks.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.720]   I love how they put like the whole month of January, like there's going to be a lot of
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.720]   tickets available.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.720]   It's one day.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.800]   Oh, they're doing it in cities.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.760]   Is this a physical thing you go see?
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.960]   So this is a platform for buying tickets.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.960]   Oh, I see.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.960]   I get it.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.960]   I get it.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.520]   So they don't know that all the shows are closed.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.520]   All right.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.520]   Rat-tit.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.520]   Go through the cast.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.160]   The story is up there.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.160]   I will.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.680]   I can't go click off of it.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.680]   There we go.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.680]   Oh, I see.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.680]   This is why it's not a democracy.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.320]   I don't know if I have to explain this to you.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.920]   No, Leo.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.240]   It's a revolution.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.920]   Only I know what's going on.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.920]   No, no, no.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.720]   The authoritarian Mr. Report.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.560]   Oh, I love Titus Burgess.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.960]   And let's see who else is Adam Lambert.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.960]   Adam Lambert?
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.200]   Isn't that that dude on the voice?
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.800]   He's like one of them.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.120]   What's that annoying singer?
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.800]   It's either the voice or the...
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   Masked singer.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   No.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.440]   Wayne Brett, Kevin Chamberlain, Mary Testa, Priscilla Lopez.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.880]   You know, he won either the American Idol or the voice side of camera, which one.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.880]   And who's going to be Remy?
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.880]   Who's going to be Remy?
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.880]   I don't know if you've heard about American Idol.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.880]   Who's going to be Remy?
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.880]   That's the question.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.400]   You want to watch just a little?
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.400]   Just a little?
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   Yes.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.400]   We've seen this.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.400]   Oh, you've already seen this.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   I wasn't here.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.400]   Remy is Titus Burgess.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.600]   Oh, perfect, perfect.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.600]   Love Titus Burgess.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.600]   $5.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.880]   I'll just send him to $5 and not watch it.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.280]   Yeah, you don't have to watch it.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.280]   No, no.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.760]   We're going to do a thing where the more minutes you watch it, the more people will give to
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   the cause.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.200]   You'll be duty-bound, morally bound because you're a nice, good man to watch the whole
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.200]   thing.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   It's the twig.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   And we're going to put it on the twig.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   Watch it.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:23.800]   So Reddit bought a TikTok rival called DubSmash hoping to add their kind of TikTok style creation
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.600]   tools to Reddit.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.040]   I don't associate Reddit with fun teenagers hanging out doing dance moves.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.920]   Well, clearly you don't follow the right subreddits.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:42.920]   Reddit really, even more than Twitter, has its own personality depending on which subreddits
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:43.920]   you follow.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.560]   I only follow programming and geek stuff and it's completely bland.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.160]   I follow the smart home stuff.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.160]   Yeah, it's perfect for that.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.200]   Oh, the sourdough one's pretty good.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.320]   Yeah, no, I used to follow that one too.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.840]   Another reason for Leo to be depressed today.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:07.000]   Apparently, I didn't know this, but Wondery, you knew already, didn't you?
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.120]   Wondery was one of the last great independent podcast companies.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.920]   Did you know that?
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.920]   There's one more.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.920]   There's one left.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.200]   It's official now.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.440]   Amazon got them for 300 million.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:26.080]   When we talked about it last September, most of what we were saying was Apple declined, Spotify
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.720]   declined because it was so much money.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.480]   Wondery is only four years old.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:35.120]   We don't know the exact price, but the speculation is 300.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.800]   Their best shows are true crime series like, and I'm sure you've all listened to Dirty
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:48.520]   John, Dr. Death, and Who Can Forget the heartwarming Over My Dead Body.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.440]   Now, here's the good news.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.240]   They have 10 million unique some months, which is only about twice what we have.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.080]   So I figure 150 million--
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.760]   Can you take 150?
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.760]   That's fair.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.760]   Take Leo out.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.760]   Take me out, man.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.760]   It's Bezos.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.760]   Yeah, it's Bezos.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:12.040]   The real deal is Wondery has a lot of Hollywood deals, TV shows, and works, things like that.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.400]   Because true crime makes for good TV.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.760]   Yeah, but I worked for Connie and I asked, and they worked for Time Inc when they thought
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.360]   and TV God, they all thought they were going to have Hollywood deals.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.160]   They hired executives to do this, and it never worked.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.160]   Never.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.400]   I remember one year we had the work if you have connections.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:37.840]   Still, these are huge media companies, and even when Time Inc became part of Time Warner,
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.840]   it didn't work.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:44.280]   I'll always remember we had the year end, most intriguing people, and they had dancers
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.080]   coming out singing the names.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.080]   Like, whoa, let's all--
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.080]   OK, you just got your answer, Anna.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.080]   That's why it didn't work.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.080]   Thank you very much.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.080]   Oh, wow.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.080]   Maybe if they had Titus Burgess doing it.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:09.360]   No, I think all these deals are hard to do in the first place.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:17.480]   And Hollywood, I don't care, still looks at scans at tech and tech looks at scans at Hollywood.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.680]   This whole thing of convergence, we've been talking about this now for almost 20 years.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:29.040]   It is-- Quibi is the latest, greatest example of tech Hollywood convergence.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.480]   It's an impedance, I call it an impedance mismatch, but that's a pretty geeky way to
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.480]   do it.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.480]   That's why you're not going to get bought at college.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.480]   That's exactly why I have this.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.160]   Yeah, I was about to say, well, now we know why we're not getting bought.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.440]   In mind, it's an impedance mismatch.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.440]   That's the problem.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.440]   Is it fair to say that it's--
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.440]   We talk about spectral efficiency and see how--
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.440]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.440]   --how we can go.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:56.520]   At Big Andy in architectures versus Little Andy in architectures, they don't like tech.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.240]   They think they don't know.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.720]   But "Bondory" was founded by a guy from Hollywood.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.320]   It's only a couple of years old, and they made the right decisions, the right deals.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.160]   If your goal is to get acquired, you tell me, Jeff, because you've been in and on a lot
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.120]   of these.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.680]   There's a different way you build a company if your goal is to get acquired than if you
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.560]   want to just build a company that makes a product that you think is pretty good, right?
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:29.080]   Well, I don't know that I know any more than you or anybody else, but yeah, you're right.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.840]   And it goes back to the 2000 crash.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.560]   You use the money to put a lot of hats on sticks over the Fort Wall and make it look
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.560]   like you're gigantic.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.560]   You have traction.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.200]   I need to be able to say things like that.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   What an analogy.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:49.120]   A lot of hats on sticks over the Fort Wall.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.200]   Honestly, that's what most podcast networks are, is hats on sticks.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.000]   Show title.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.600]   I love that.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.600]   And probably we're fezzes on sticks.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.920]   Yeah, it doesn't work as well.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:13.840]   Is it safe to say that it seems like it would be in the best interest for the likes of Amazon
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:20.760]   Netflix to just continue to roll as if they're independent and just keep scraping the people
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.960]   from Hollywood here and there for a particular project and just ship it, get it done, and
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.800]   then move on to the next about what they've been doing now?
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.600]   I don't think that's how they've shown it rhymes.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.400]   I don't think that's how they've partnered as opposed to what?
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.680]   Well, looking at this acquisition and saying, hey, we want to be the next Hollywood studio,
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.320]   if you will, why not just say, hey, let's just continue to be Amazon.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.520]   No, that's not how you get to be Amazon.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.520]   I'd say, let's just be Amazon.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.720]   You don't get to be Amazon by saying we're Amazon.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.160]   You get to be Amazon by saying, what else can we eat?
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.600]   What else can we engulf, devour, consume, and spit out as a product?
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.400]   That's how you get to be Amazon.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:08.320]   Well, but to Anne's point, at what point did Amazon become a maker to a buyer?
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.320]   Right?
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.680]   Oh, it has always been a...
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.200]   They Amazon, no, Amazon is very clear on how it works.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.640]   It looks at data.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.920]   It says, can I do this better in house?
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.400]   And it makes it itself.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.600]   And Amazon still makes lots of things.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.960]   Think about its brands, think about its devices it makes, think about all the services it
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.080]   launches over AWS or as part of AWS.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.800]   And then if for some reason it looks at it and is like, people are clearly interested
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.680]   in this, but it's just not going to work for us, they buy it.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.680]   Right.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.080]   Yeah, they're super savvy.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.240]   So oh yeah.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:52.960]   Amazon says we're going to make one three part of Amazon music, which is interesting.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.160]   So Amazon has music.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.160]   People has music.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.160]   Google has music.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.080]   Spotify has music.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.160]   Spotify is a pure play.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:05.720]   Everybody else has music as a secondary business for other...
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.800]   I don't know why they have music, but they do.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:13.280]   One thing that all of them were right about, and there were a lot of, by the way, smaller
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:18.240]   companies that kind of stumbled along the way like I guess Pandora is still around, but
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.480]   these are entitled.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:25.160]   There were a lot of small music businesses that are maybe still around, but not doing
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.800]   great.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:33.920]   What they saw was the shift in listening habits from buying CDs, buying records, buying cassettes
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.080]   to streaming everything.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.320]   And they thought if we build a business, but it's a synergy.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.680]   I don't think any of them are...
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.480]   That's why Spotify is really in the tough position because...
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.880]   And that's why they've been most impressive about buying content.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.080]   Was that something the market did or was that something that companies forced because of
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.080]   all the companies?
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.080]   No, the market did it.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.080]   We used to buy our songs.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.080]   We can't buy them anymore.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.840]   Yeah, I think the company saw it.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   Apple did it.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.040]   If anybody did it, Apple did it when they said...
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:09.960]   People often point to this as the demarcation when they said to record companies...
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.840]   Spotify was the first streamer before.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.600]   Yeah, no, but this is when it began as before streaming.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.360]   People said to the record labels, "You can't sell albums anymore.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.160]   You got to sell every record as a 99-cent single."
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.320]   And the record company said, "We can't do that.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:31.720]   All the money is in albums, mostly because their artists weren't capable of 10 great
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:36.880]   songs, but they could do three, surround them with seven, fill their songs and sell it as
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.880]   an album."
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.120]   And that was their music model.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:46.920]   When Apple broke it back in the late '90s, early 2000s with iTunes and with the 99-cent
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.200]   single, they forced that.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.320]   At that point, people stopped buying physical media.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.760]   iTunes quickly became the number one sort place to buy music.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.600]   And Apple was slow to the streaming music.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.960]   Even buying music wasn't enough.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.120]   It turned out, and that's when Spotify came along.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.280]   You're right, Stacey.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.600]   They said, "Why buy it?
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.040]   Rent it.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.040]   You don't like it enough to buy it."
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:15.040]   So instead of buying an album from Taylor Swift or even buying a single, they further
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.560]   disaggregated it.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.360]   They said, "Instead of buying a 99-cent single, you pay us $15 a month.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.440]   You get it all as long as you keep paying us."
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.160]   And I think consumers jumped on that.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.880]   That's when the market said, "Okay, that's a good deal."
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.880]   Geeks complained.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.320]   Geeks sold all my song forever.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.320]   People still complain.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.320]   People still complain.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.320]   You can't do it.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.320]   It's where I need it to be.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.120]   I need it to not take a long time for people just to say, "I don't need to own it anymore."
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.120]   You're right.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.840]   They still say that about books occasionally.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:51.160]   By the way, book sales and CD sales are through the roof in 2020.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.560]   We can get to that in a little bit.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.480]   But that's a pandemic blip.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.600]   Streaming clearly dominated.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:04.600]   But then Spotify had a problem because they don't make their music.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.800]   They just sell it.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.360]   And all the record companies are putting the...
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.920]   People like Taylor Swift are saying, "You can't give away my music anymore.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.160]   I'm not making enough money."
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.280]   The big stars are putting the record labels, putting the screw to them.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.000]   That's when Spotify said, "All right, we need our own content."
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.520]   That's when they say it saw a podcast as a savior.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:33.440]   I don't honestly think any of these guys think podcasts are an alternative or an equally
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.840]   valuable business to music, not even close.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.920]   They're spending a lot of money on it, but not close to what...
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.560]   It's so confusing.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.240]   I don't understand what the obsession with podcast is.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.080]   I don't either.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.080]   I know a little bit about podcast.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:25:00.320]   I'm like, what percentage of the population of people who listen to podcasts is still relatively
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   small, isn't it?
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.040]   It's growing very rapidly.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.680]   It was 2% and then it was 5%.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.280]   It's also as a defensive tactic, at least from Spotify's point of view, against the record
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.280]   labels.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.280]   That's true.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.800]   And if you think about podcasts also as the new talk radio, then it makes a little bit
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.880]   more sense too.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.160]   By the way, so there are a few big players now.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.160]   There's Spotify.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.120]   Amazon, suddenly, is a big player in this.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.280]   By the way, Audible had been adding podcasts too.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:35.080]   So Amazon has spoken word in both audiobooks and podcasts already, but now they're wondering.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:42.000]   And then there's Apple, which doesn't currently own podcasts, but is widely rumored to be
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.320]   building up a podcast library of stuff and content library of stuff.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.440]   But that's been rumors that was going on for a long time.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.280]   So like, they're like studios?
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.640]   I mean, Apple's where everyone goes to.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.640]   It's a studio model.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.840]   They already have a library of podcasts.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.840]   Yes.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.160]   No, but they don't own them and they don't make money on them.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.120]   They just, they're just how you get them.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.120]   They're the pipe.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.120]   Come on, I need a living, people.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.120]   The very dumb pipe.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.960]   Just give it, let me have it.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.160]   But there are a lot of other companies that are looking this.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.720]   And one of them is the big radio company, which employs me for the radio show, which
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.120]   is iHeart.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:26.440]   iHeart Media is the largest radio company in the United States.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:31.960]   And for years, radio has said, "Oh, we'll always, we'll always be here.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.000]   People always listen to radio."
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   And I've even said on this show and others, radio is dying.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.840]   And people say, "No, I love radio.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.200]   Listen to radio all the time.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.240]   Everybody I know listens to radio.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.240]   Folks, trust me.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.080]   Radio is not dead is dying."
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.440]   And who's listening to the radio?
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.840]   That was my question.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.360]   But our chat room says, "We do.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.360]   We do.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.360]   We listen all the time."
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   So I don't know if people would tell me.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.360]   My dad listens to the radio.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.720]   Yeah, it's a, my daughter can't conceive of the radio.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.560]   She like, she's like, "I don't understand why you would..."
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.560]   Well, that's what happens.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.280]   It's on when it's on.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:11.720]   This is the big shift in media in general is your daughter, everybody under 20, they
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:16.760]   don't watch TV, they don't listen to the radio, they don't consume media, anything like
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.760]   we do.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.760]   Nope.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.280]   My kids listen to serious, but they often listen to them.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.600]   They don't make phone calls.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.200]   The reruns.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.560]   So why do your kids listen to serious?
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.560]   They must be in the car.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.800]   It's in the car and they're listening to Howard Stern or...
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.520]   Yeah, that's because of you.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.240]   That's because of you.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.440]   My kids don't listen to serious.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:43.720]   When I had serious, serious description a couple of years ago, my kids, they enjoyed
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:49.960]   it because it made more sense to them to be able to hire them and listen to on-demand
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.960]   content, if you will.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.960]   Right.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.600]   Because you had the radio and the car and we flipped it over to the radio and they realized
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.960]   how good the radio was for us as our experience.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.920]   Radio killed itself with 19 minutes of commercials an hour.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.920]   Oh, it's fast.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.920]   Yeah, Europe radio was still...
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.160]   Well, that's what happened with television.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.000]   Yeah, same thing.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.760]   So I mean, these companies did not embrace the opportunity.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.760]   That's for sure.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.760]   When I tried to...
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.920]   It's like talking to the radio and the car at all.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.920]   Go ahead, Stacey.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.920]   Stacey.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.000]   Oh, I was just going to say it's NPR because there's not...
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   No commercials.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Just straight content.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   But go Germany.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.200]   No, I was just saying that people there say radio, they love radio still.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.320]   Yeah, but they still have government radio, right?
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.000]   But it also influences the commercial.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Okay.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Well, wait.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   And your old soft, so the fun is...
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.720]   I think radio is hanging on by a thread still even though it's dying because some people
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.280]   still just don't quite get the concept of podcast.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:59.480]   I can look at just my small circle in general when I mention coming out to California to
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.560]   work at a podcast network.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.560]   They first question what...
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.560]   What the hell you doing?
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.560]   What is a podcast?
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.560]   What is a podcast?
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.560]   What is a podcast?
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.560]   What is a podcast?
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:15.280]   And when I finally figured out the best explanation was to tell them it was like having talk radio,
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:20.040]   you know, on a regular basis when you want it kind of thing, not just because...
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:26.220]   But to keep Jeff on at that particular hour, but the problem was the disconnect of how do
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.960]   I access that?
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:33.320]   You tell a 20-year-old to get to a podcast through their favorite app on their phone,
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:37.720]   that's no big deal, but you tell someone that's slightly older than me to do such a thing.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.720]   And they're like, "I got to do what on my phone?
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.560]   Why can't I just put it on the radio and the living room?"
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:51.200]   And it just seems like those are the things that they still hold onto radio.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.200]   Think about it.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.200]   There's still a market for mainframes, y'all.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.200]   And so...
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   No, yeah.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.200]   There is...
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.200]   Just a full frame of content.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.680]   Just a full-style Jeff Gutenberg moment here.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.680]   No new media has...
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:07.680]   No new media has ever replaced the old media.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:13.760]   No, radio didn't replace newspapers, TV didn't replace radio, movies didn't...
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.680]   They just diminish them and become the next thing.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.680]   But there's...
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.680]   The clue in.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.680]   Oh, that's a stuffing moment.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.760]   The clue in says that the content...
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.120]   That the old medium becomes the content of the new medium.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.120]   Oh, I like it.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.200]   It's like a snake eating its tail.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   Right.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.200]   Right.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   And it doesn't really have anything yet.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.760]   Of course, that changes over time.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.320]   But Gutenberg, print was manuscript at first, right?
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.840]   For the first 50 years of it.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.520]   Maclun, that's quite an insight.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.520]   I agree with that.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.520]   Well, it's Maclun's not mine.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.200]   Well, if you look at the internet, what was the internet when it first started?
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.160]   It was brochures and magazines and TV shows.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.560]   It's probably recognizable as...
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.560]   Exactly.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.560]   Exactly.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.560]   So we haven't yet...
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.560]   Maybe podcasting is the first new medium.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.560]   But it's like radio.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.560]   No, like radio.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.560]   No, no.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.360]   You know what it is?
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.360]   TikTok.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.360]   TikTok.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.360]   Yes.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.360]   Because Ratatouille, the musical...
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.360]   Five times.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.360]   Five times.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.360]   Show is the future.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.360]   This is the future you're stuck in, Ant.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.360]   Oh, wait.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.360]   Don't roll away Stacy.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.360]   This way.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.480]   You know, I'm looking at Ray Gunn and Mr. Howell in our chat rooms.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.880]   There are plenty of people who aren't interested in on-demand media.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.880]   They really want...
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   I agree.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.320]   They don't really want that much control.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.360]   That's what Spotify's for.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.360]   They listen to Spotify.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:34.680]   I listen to my daily mix on Spotify or one of my six daily mixes on Spotify all the time
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.520]   because I don't want to like constantly be like, "Oh."
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.520]   There's a...
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.600]   That doesn't preclude that by any means.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.600]   There's all sorts of ways to do it without having to think about it.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.920]   In fact, NPR has its own podcast app.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.920]   It's interesting.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.000]   This probably was the insight that created NPR One.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.880]   I said, "Well, just start it.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.720]   We'll just put stuff in there and you just keep listening."
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.720]   That's right.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.240]   It's like the internet.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.800]   You can scroll all the way down and you'll never get to the bottom.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:09.320]   Well, what's interesting there too, I know the guy who started at Kinsey Wilson.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.680]   And name drop.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.080]   The political struggles within the NPR network.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.840]   Well, they have a very complicated...
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.840]   The stations were not happy.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.440]   Yeah, they have a very complicated financial structure.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.440]   Right.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.080]   And then they can't piss off the funders, which are the stations.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.080]   But at the same time...
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.680]   Well, at the same time, I think the funders are the customers in a sense.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.520]   But this is exactly why radio stations have had a hard time with podcasts.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:40.840]   And it's why, in a way, iHeartMedia is surprisingly smart because they are building a massive podcast
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:47.880]   empire, very, very successful podcast empire on a parallel track to their radio business,
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:51.720]   knowing that at some point the train's going to change over.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.680]   Ooh, that's how Verizon handled its wire line and its mobile networks.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.040]   And finally, the revenue switched.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.040]   Okay, sorry.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.040]   That's why the newspapers don't have that.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.840]   They didn't have a second paper.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.840]   They could have had that.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:12.520]   They could have had a viable business online that they did not.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.520]   Yes.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.520]   Nope.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.520]   Actually, I want to...
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.720]   Okay, can we change the subject?
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.920]   Well, it's not a democracy.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.920]   So I guess you can.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.320]   I did have one more question for you, but you can change the process.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:32.400]   A good dictator knows when to pretend he's interested in the opinion of his subject.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.400]   Go ahead, Ian.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.400]   What did you want to ask?
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:40.600]   Well, you mentioned how these different platforms or mediums, they don't necessarily
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.840]   wipe out the original one.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.640]   They just sort of eat away at it.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.280]   And it made me think about that dub smash, whatever you just talked about.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.600]   Yeah, the Reddit just bought.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:56.280]   Just the point of what do you think their play is, is it to really try to take out TikTok?
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.320]   Or is it just a nibble here and there?
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:03.080]   Because I personally think that's pointless.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.560]   Because we have too many options already out there.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:10.720]   And TikTok seems to have a really strong hold on that type of content.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.920]   Don't you remember that we had about three weeks ago where every service is now getting
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.920]   every service.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.240]   Everybody's just mimicking each other just because.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.600]   And I mostly think that the companies that do real original thought are few and far between.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.360]   And maybe they're the most successful.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.160]   But most companies go, "Oh, what's the other guy doing?
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.160]   Uh oh, we better.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.920]   We don't want to, oh, we're in trouble.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.520]   We got to keep up."
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.920]   And so a lot of what you see is just me too is them.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.920]   The other kind of me too is them.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.560]   Well, they have an original start when they start.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.560]   But then, you know, Facebook and the real world started.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.560]   Well, Reddit actually was not original.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.200]   It was a complete copy of the big.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:55.400]   You know, but it's like, Reddit by the way is interesting because that's owned by Conde
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.400]   Nast.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:01.240]   So Reddit is in fact, and the money behind Reddit that bought Dubs Smash, I presume, directed
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.560]   by Conde Nast Money, which is old school publisher, right, Jeff?
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.760]   And that is as old as you get.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.920]   That was my boss.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.840]   My boss wanted Steve Newhouse.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.920]   He really loved Dick.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.000]   And Steve, go farther back.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   He's the only Steve or Si.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Si's son.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   He's the size nephew.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   He's now basically in charge of the car.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.280]   Uh oh.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.360]   Jeff is frozen.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   He's lost to this.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.160]   I didn't make the contact with the wrong guy.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.160]   There was a break.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.160]   There was a break.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.160]   I don't know what I've got.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.160]   On Facebook.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.160]   Oh, hold on.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.160]   Dick.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.160]   Oh my God.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.160]   Hold on, Jeff.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.160]   Okay.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.320]   Wait till your line becomes stable.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.560]   All right, let me see if Jeff is there.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.320]   Jeff, are you there?
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.320]   Am I back?
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.320]   Yes.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.320]   Am I?
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.320]   Is this 2021 yet?
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.120]   Yeah, no, sorry.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.120]   Still in 2020.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.120]   So close.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.120]   Oh, darn.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.040]   You know, I just want to warn people it's possible 2021 could be worse.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.040]   This is Leo's mood.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.040]   No, no.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.320]   It's not just my mood.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.800]   The CDC just said, you know, this isn't the big one.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.640]   It's like, what?
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:20.880]   Yeah, the CDC also thought this last year's health, big health issue was mosquitoes.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.880]   Yeah, what?
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.560]   That was the strangest thing ever.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:32.040]   The CDC put out a list of the top health issues of 2020 and mosquitoes were number one.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.520]   And number two was something also not COVID.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.520]   I think COVID.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.520]   3.5 worth of it.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.520]   I think, yeah, it's like, huh?
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:46.960]   Okay, but Jeff was making a point about Reddit and Conde Nast and his boss, Steve Newhouse,
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.960]   who loved Digg.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:52.240]   So I'll try to get back to that story, please.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.760]   So I'll try back to 2020.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.760]   Yes.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:37:00.720]   So my boss, originally he loved Facebook, but it was just at Harvard and he was a yay-lee
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.080]   and he saw what it was.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   He understood what it was.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.080]   He understood.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:09.200]   He really, he's the one who taught me interactivity and I made a contact with Facebook, but it
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.760]   was with, what's his name?
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:17.040]   The guy who went to Brazil, wanted to sell ads and Glenn Greenwald?
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.080]   No, the guy on Facebook.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.080]   Eduardo Severin?
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.080]   Oh, Eduardo.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.080]   And what was the name?
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.080]   Eduardo, yes.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.880]   So that was the wrong person to go to because he was out of favor.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.880]   He was so unfair.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.880]   Who knew?
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.880]   He didn't know.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.880]   So next the boss, he hadn't seen the movie.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.680]   He wanted, right, he wanted Digg.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.680]   Thought Digg was great.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.680]   You know, we had relationships with Digg.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.680]   They were wonderful.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.680]   Digg was doing great.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.680]   Digg didn't do anything.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:43.960]   So he then kind of cleverly just said, well, hmm, Reddit kind of wants to be Digg.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.960]   I got it.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.960]   He got it.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.960]   He got Reddit.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:52.720]   And then he bought, he got it for a song or nothing.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.640]   But then wisely saw that to motivate the staff, he had to create equity.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:02.600]   So they basically spun it off to create the equity in the company so that they could do
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.600]   all the things they do.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.280]   So they could buy this company now.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.280]   Right.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.040]   And they've done a good job.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.600]   I think a good steward of Reddit.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:14.480]   By the way, they were lucky they didn't buy Digg as it turns out because Digg immediately
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.920]   cratered, augred in.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.200]   And Reddit's done quite well for itself.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:26.360]   In fact, in the face of pretty daunting headwinds from the Donald channel and white supremacy
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:30.560]   and Nazi channels and all sorts of issues, they've managed to come out of.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.560]   Oh, did Red.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.160]   Let me ask you this question.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.800]   I have an answer to, but I'm curious to hear yours for once.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.800]   Sorry.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.760]   Reddit had worse stuff.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.080]   God, I think I just got shot.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.920]   Oh my God.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.440]   Reddit had worse stuff than Facebook.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.720]   Reddit had bad stuff.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.800]   And it had a reputation for that at the very beginning of it.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.560]   It managed to get out of that while that bad stuff was still there.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.200]   But this idea that no two people see the same Facebook.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.480]   No, people think everybody sees the same Facebook.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.600]   No people seem to say Reddit people get that.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.480]   Oh, yeah, there's a seller and there's some.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.080]   Well, you're a little bit more in control of that on Reddit.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.080]   They don't insert stuff into your feed.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.080]   So is that it?
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   Is that it?
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:21.680]   I think that's the biggest thing is on Reddit, it's divided into what they call subreddit,
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:26.480]   which is subject matter based basically forums, internet forums.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.400]   And we were talking before the show.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.680]   My Reddit is a very bland because there's a lot of programming sub-redits and technology
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.680]   sub-redits.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.200]   But those are what I follow.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.520]   Reddit neither inserts content into that nor changes.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.560]   It's all chronological.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.080]   In fact, you have complete control of it.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.080]   It's not all chronological.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:49.160]   You could say I want to see the top stuff, the newest stuff, the most controversial stuff.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:54.680]   You get to choose how it's sorted, but new sort by new is always and available as a choice.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.640]   And so it isn't algorithmic.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.240]   It's the biggest difference of all.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.040]   Reddit is not algorithmic.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.720]   Facebook is entirely algorithmic.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:09.720]   And the reason I stopped using it is even if I turn on the chronological feed on Facebook,
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:14.920]   it eventually turns it off because it knows that's not what it really wants you to see.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.920]   It wants you to see the algorithm.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.560]   Well, let me try another way on you, Leo.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.880]   I've been spending the last two days to get ready for you.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:25.480]   I've been spending the last two days, actually for the book, reading up on third person effect.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:29.680]   And for folks out there, that's the belief that I'm not affected by stuff.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.120]   Maybe you're not, but other people are.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.880]   And I know better.
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:39.440]   And so this is what I argue that Leo engages in when it comes to Facebook.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.960]   And one of the papers I read, it says this, "Basically people tend to believe that others
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:49.880]   are more negatively affected by media messages or Facebook as a way of enhancing self-image."
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.480]   So part of the reason behind this is I make myself look smarter.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.360]   It's like watching Jeopardy and getting the answers, right?
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.160]   Well, more like we love fortune.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:02.680]   Because I'm the smart one and well, they're double on TV and yeah, not on the pressure,
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.960]   but screw it.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:09.040]   The comparison between self and other then constitutes a form of unrealistic and biased
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.560]   optimism.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.920]   So I'm optimistic about myself.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:17.080]   And that's motivated by the need for ego and has to, as this paper says.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:21.440]   But what I say about others is, well, surely they see a lot more stuff.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:28.240]   So one of the papers I read, recent ones about Facebook, "Those who use Facebook less look
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:34.080]   down on those who use it more and presume they are all worse off."
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:39.320]   It also says that when it came to television versus the internet, that people say, "Well,
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.560]   I've got control over television.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.560]   I turn it off."
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.600]   Well, actually you have a lot less control over television, but you have more of a sense
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.200]   of control over it, which is where you're headed, I think, here.
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.800]   Whereas in Facebook, you don't know what's happening.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.800]   You actually do have control.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.080]   You can unfollow somebody.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.840]   You can do all kinds of things, but you don't feel like you're in control the way you do
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   with best.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.560]   Well, Facebook also implements dark patterns and allows you that dopamine hit when you
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.560]   see things.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:07.600]   So I think there's an extra layer to what you're talking about, Jeff, which is Facebook.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.960]   Also they drag you in and they keep you there.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.280]   Whereas television, and I mean, you could argue that a cliffhanger is in front of you
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.280]   in the series.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.280]   Right.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.280]   Just like Leo was trying to do a minute ago, we're trying to get on first.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.280]   The difference is the way--
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.320]   Facebook does it with your friends.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:28.640]   The difference is television does it en masse, and Facebook's doing it particularly specifically
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.400]   targeted at you.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.400]   And my--
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.400]   You had problems with--
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.840]   I am not unaware of that effect, Jeff, at all.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.840]   I understand it completely.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.560]   It's kind of a version of the Dunning-Kruger effect, and I completely understand that.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:43.880]   My entire argument against Facebook is the algorithm, and the algorithm is targeted at
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.840]   you, and you think you're seeing what you want to see, you're seeing what Facebook wants
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.840]   you to see.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.840]   It's a period.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:55.920]   But that's also-- but I can say the same thing about a network programmer or an editor in
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.280]   chief of a newspaper.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.520]   You're not in control of that at all.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.520]   No, no.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.520]   They're telling you what you want to see.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.520]   But they're doing it en masse.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.520]   They're not targeting you.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.520]   They're targeting--
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.520]   So what's the difference?
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.520]   So it's worse.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.520]   No, it's not worse.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.880]   Part of it is also getting people to become aware of it.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.040]   This targeted thing at you is wonderful.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.800]   It's exactly not wonderful.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.400]   It's much better to have en masse meeting you.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.600]   So you have this view that everybody else is--
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.600]   No.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   --a lemon.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.600]   I'm not saying that at all.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.760]   I'm well aware of that effect.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.120]   I'm not saying that at all.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.560]   I'm saying Facebook is nefarious.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.720]   Period.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.200]   So this is the Easter egg, Leo.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.600]   I looked-- and I tried to find any Facebook stories this week.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.600]   I didn't find any.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   So when I wanted the TikTok stories, I just put them in the Facebook box.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.600]   So there's no Facebook in the bottom of all.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.600]   It's not that.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.600]   You're hysterical.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.600]   No, I was wondering--
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.600]   You're hysterical.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.360]   I was wondering if you're Easter egg.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:49.880]   Easter egg was this guy who started a Spotify album since we were talking about Spotify
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.480]   earlier called OK-- well, I can't say it-- OKG, play music.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.080]   Go ahead and say it.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.040]   And then-- OK, y'all.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:02.680]   Play music is the name of his album.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.680]   Album.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:08.240]   And the songs are "Hagey, Play Christmas Music," "Hagey, Play Cooking Music."
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.240]   It's a better--
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.240]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.840]   Let me play it, because it does a play music.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.840]   It's brilliant.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:18.400]   If you say "Hagey, Play Christmas Music," Drum Koon, who is the guy who did this, is
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.640]   going to get a hit.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:25.920]   In fact, this is a long-standing problem on Spotify, which-- because anybody could put
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:32.040]   anything on Spotify, which is stuff designed to get plays by accident, in effect.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.040]   Oh, really?
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.960]   Oh, this has been going on for years.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.040]   I have never encountered that.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.760]   This is not new at all.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.960]   That's pretty funny.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.200]   Drum Koon's album cover is him in a car.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:53.640]   On the side it says, "Hook--" I'm playing music.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:45:03.000]   He didn't put a lot of effort into this page, but this is a very common thing on Spotify.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.560]   In fact, it's one of the reasons I kind of lost interest in Spotify.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:14.520]   Pandora, too, is because you would get a lot of covers instead of the real thing.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:18.640]   So that was only-- Google had a real issue with that, and they've gotten better.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.720]   But one of the reasons I did not like using the Google Assistant and the Google smart
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:30.560]   speaker was because its API app with Spotify was terrible, and it would always give me
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.560]   the karaoke version of the song.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.200]   But there was a lot of gaming going on.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.080]   Just by the way, what Kill did-- gaming will kill a site like this.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:42.120]   By the way, if you love Drum Koon's play music, you're going to really like, "Hey,
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.320]   I'm going to be playing music."
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:44.320]   His follow-up.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.800]   Oh, jeez.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:51.800]   So Leo, were you going to change your subject a while ago?
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.800]   Yeah, it was.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   It's OK.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.800]   Yeah, you were going to--
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.800]   I don't care.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.480]   No, I've been thinking a little bit.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.400]   It actually follows along with what we've been thinking about.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.000]   I thought I'd throw this out to you guys.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.960]   Let me see if I can get my head working and put this together in some sort of logical
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.360]   way.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:16.560]   Clearly, there's a problem, and it's not entirely on Facebook.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.920]   Although I think a little bit, Jeff, you can flate Facebook with the internet.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.360]   Oh, if you don't like Facebook, you mustn't like the internet.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.360]   No, really.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.880]   If you're going to do something to Facebook, you might have an impact with the internet.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:32.520]   Yeah, and look, section 230 is heavily under attack right now for all the long reasons.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.400]   So terrifying.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.800]   Yeah, right.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:42.640]   Right now, we're being told not to trust stuff we see on the internet.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.840]   But there's this other thing that's going on, and it really concerns me even more, because
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:54.600]   increasingly, journalists and even respectable journalistic entities have started to kind
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:59.880]   of follow the same patterns that-- probably for economic reasons-- the internet sites
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:04.320]   follow with linkbait, BS stories.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.320]   This came to me--
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.320]   It's sensationalism.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:10.520]   It's not new, but it came to me when I was listening to Jonathan Alter's excellent biography
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.440]   of Jimmy Carter, his very best.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.640]   And he's talking about the Bert Lance affair.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.640]   Remember that, Jeff?
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:18.640]   You guys are too young.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.240]   We're old enough to remember that.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:27.760]   Bert Lance, who was a Carter-- well, I would say crony, of course, but he wasn't a crony.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.760]   He was an advisor.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.120]   He was director of OMB under Jimmy Carter in 1977.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.920]   Oh, crony has been redefined.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   That's--
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:39.880]   Well, but what's interesting is he was-- William Sapphire decided, in the New York Times, to
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.880]   take him down, to say he's a crony.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:47.360]   He was being investigated by the SEC for kind of Lucy Gucci banking standards.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:52.600]   He had a small town bank in Georgia, and he would lend money to friends and stuff.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:59.480]   And in fact, he had to resign at OMB during his first year in office.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:04.320]   And Sapphire, after he resigned, said, "Yeah, maybe I was a little hard on the guy."
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.600]   Bert Lance was cleared of all charges.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:14.680]   There were never any successful criminal charges against him, but he was hounded out of office
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:19.960]   by innuendo, essentially from mainstream press, including the New York Times.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.120]   Now that was a long time ago.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.880]   That was 50 years ago.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:30.560]   But I think it has-- and it was also unique in that, I think, somewhat unique in that
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.640]   time.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.120]   But I think it's happening all the time now.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:38.080]   And there's so much gotcha journalism.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:42.440]   And it's gotten so bad, it's almost a war back and forth between the internet.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:46.400]   And I can top that, says the New York Times.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.280]   But here's the reason I bring it up.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:55.960]   Because it really concerns me, because I feel like there is no trustworthy source of information
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:04.080]   anymore, that we are now in a situation where nothing-- you don't-- where do you go for answers
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.680]   to anything?
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.440]   Everybody seems to have an axe to grind.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.320]   Everybody's trying to get more clicks and links.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:15.880]   And it seems to be, there's so much BS out there that even the stuff that's not BS, you
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.120]   can't tell anymore.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.120]   That worries me.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:22.840]   So get your cups ready, get your martinis ready, get your scotch ready, get your bourbon ready.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:28.400]   Going back to Gutenberg's time, nobody trusted print for the first 50 years.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.400]   What do we trust?
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.400]   We trusted the people we knew.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:37.320]   We trusted the innkeeper who talked to the post delivery guy who came through town and
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.800]   said things.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.560]   And I think it says in the show, I think, last week, rumor was what we trusted.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.640]   Literally, rumor was better than print.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.960]   Print was not trusted.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:53.920]   It took time to invent the institutions that gave print trust.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:59.160]   A lot of print was garbage, fake news, which trials, junk.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.960]   A lot of it was just an error.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.440]   It was worse than the scribes.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.800]   They'd make mistakes and things that get out.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:07.120]   You weren't guaranteed of who really made this.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.880]   You didn't really know who made it.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.560]   And if you did know who made it, then it was probably the end of the thumb of government
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:19.640]   because they insisted that you put your name on it so they could cut your hands off literally.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.800]   So there was no trust in print.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.600]   But we invented the publishing house.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.080]   We invented the editor.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:31.280]   We invented institutions that brought us some measure of trust in that new structure.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.720]   It took about 200 years.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.200]   Literally 200 years.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.200]   I was getting ready to ask you this.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.280]   I was going to say, how long is it going to take?
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:45.080]   Because I can think back to at least 10 years of seeing in listicles and just buzzword,
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:49.040]   the buzzword, laid in headlines on just about everything I read.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.920]   And I'm still seeing that stuff now.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:54.120]   Well, the problem there is you're absolutely right.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.000]   And that's a business model problem.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.560]   And the business model that we created in media, which is an attention-based business
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:04.480]   model, either for advertising or for subscription, rules the internet now.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.480]   That includes Google.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.480]   That includes Facebook.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.480]   It includes everything.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:08.720]   It's programmatic, right?
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.360]   And the next advance has been, did I freeze again?
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.360]   No.
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:18.000]   And the next advance has been targeting, but that's basically the last death gasp of old
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.240]   advertising in my view.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:25.520]   When do we get to a business of some new thing we eventually call media that's based on the
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:28.160]   value in my life and your life?
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:34.200]   But if it took two centuries to create that reputation, we've tossed it away in a decade,
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.320]   how long is it going to take to get it back?
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.320]   Or does it matter?
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:41.280]   I've got to get through the 30 years' war, first few peasants war and some reformation.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.760]   And maybe on the side.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:44.640]   But maybe it doesn't matter.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.040]   So that's my real question.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.040]   That's the opportunity.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.040]   What's the business opportunity?
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.040]   What's the opportunity?
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.040]   That's the opportunity.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:56.440]   What's the future of, is there going to be, I remember we were talking 20 years ago, maybe
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:01.720]   about the future because there's so much information out will be in curation.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:08.000]   But the curator will be the person we will have a trusted curator.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.200]   Is that the solution?
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.680]   What is the future of information?
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:17.320]   The problem with curation is it starts with, we're still making media like it was in the
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:18.820]   old.
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:26.400]   And so we have to get past this idea that the story, Uber all, that content is everything,
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.920]   that we have more content and more content.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.920]   There's too much content.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.920]   There's not too much speech.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.240]   I think what we do here is curation.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.320]   We choose stories that we think are important.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.840]   We analyze and we break it down.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:45.000]   We argue about them and we try to come to some sense of what is so, what is true.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.640]   That seems like a decent model.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.640]   No?
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.640]   I think it is.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.640]   That's why I'm doing it.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:54.240]   I'm only get to or Vox says we're going to condense things.
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.560]   So maybe, okay, well here's the thing.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:01.760]   This model doesn't always work for mass and mainstream.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:06.120]   There's the people who want to information, like curated real information.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.560]   And then there's people who look at the news to entertain themselves.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:11.800]   It takes too much work to vet content.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.160]   Well, two things there.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.600]   One, a little bit of third person in that, right?
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.800]   People in their own lives get what they need to get, I think.
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:24.920]   And second, Matt, I just finished the chapter on this in the book I'm working on.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:30.360]   Mass is a myth that was born of the French Revolution and that the internet finally
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.360]   kills.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:35.240]   It is fundamentally an insult to the public that people are all the same and the same
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.240]   product can serve them all.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.400]   I'm not getting into targeting here.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.600]   No, I'm just getting into relevance.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.600]   You're absolutely true.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:45.400]   That's if you're going to pick one thread throughout all of this is the fragmentation of
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.080]   all of these mass markets.
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:50.680]   But that was the worst fragmentation that the mass is the norm.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.360]   Well, it was the norm until my use.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.360]   In the 50s.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.360]   Well, okay.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.360]   So we grew up in mass media.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.960]   Well, the business models are built.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:04.880]   So the business models, especially for the internet, but even for many publications, not
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:09.520]   trade publications, actually, in most cases, but many publications is mass because you need
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:14.040]   to reach a large number of people to make your seat in that old business ball.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.040]   Your rights, Stacy.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.040]   Yes.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:22.680]   And that's where, I mean, and we're still in this big mindset.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:25.200]   Like, I'm making decent living.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.280]   I'm never going to be like a millionaire, but I can, I can.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.280]   It's fine.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.280]   I believe my children and feed them.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:36.000]   And you provide a service vetting content in a specific area and people learn to trust
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   you, right?
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Yes.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.200]   And so you become that curator for them.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.560]   No, you become that curator.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.000]   But that's it.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   That's it.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   That's the thing that our business world, like the business world denigrates or doesn't.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Yes.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   They don't denigrate.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   They just don't see it.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   They don't see it.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   They have a lifestyle business.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   But I'm like, it's my lifestyle.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   I like it.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.320]   And I think my readers, listeners, those people care, but it's.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:03.680]   Well, Stacy, we believe that you're the future, right?
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.680]   The school.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.040]   No one actually believes that.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.040]   That's why we see Amazon.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.800]   No, but the people who are doing it.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.080]   But you're doing it, right?
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:14.200]   If your goal is to get bought for 300 million, then you're going to, then you're going to
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:19.760]   create a tower of BS, a house that I built and you're going to put some hats on to wait.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.960]   I was like, here's my tower.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:22.960]   I'm a tower of BS.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:26.880]   Just make money for some hats on sticks on top of that tower of BS.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:27.880]   Your goal.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:28.880]   Exactly.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:29.880]   Bingo.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:33.560]   Whereas if you're actually building value, so what you're both saying is you build value
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.680]   and Mr. Ant builds value when he has his expertise.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:39.800]   This is what this is why I started doing what I do.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:45.760]   The notion was technology is so complex and difficult and people are overwhelmed by it.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:51.880]   And I have a belief that you need to understand it in order to not be the victim of it.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:55.920]   And so what I'd said is let's start something where we get intelligent people discussing
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.400]   this in a way that people can understand.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:02.720]   It's our mission statement in order to give you information you need to understand what
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:07.320]   what technology is playing in the world and what your role is and how you can use it.
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.080]   And that's all I ever wanted to do.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:12.240]   And Stacy, yeah, what I like 300 million dollars sure.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:15.760]   But I knew that this was a lifestyle business the minute I started it.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:16.760]   And I was very.
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:17.760]   I would not like 300 million.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.760]   Oh, come on, you would.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.560]   No, what do you do with that?
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:22.560]   I don't know.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.160]   Well, you don't have to ever worry about money.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.160]   Let me show you.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.520]   You have a very comfortable lifestyle business.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.400]   You don't have to change anything.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.080]   Actually, that's exactly the problem.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:32.880]   You want Stacy?
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:34.880]   I can get anything.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.880]   I mean, you don't have anything.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:38.920]   No, I'm with you 100% Stacy.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.120]   You and I are doing the same thing exactly.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.120]   Yes.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:46.400]   Like, if someone wanted to hit me 10 million, then I'd probably be like, oh, I'm done.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.400]   I can just curl up.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:51.000]   Well, I presume after a commercial break, we'll come back to talk about substack where everybody
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   is dreaming this.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.120]   So, Stacy, we changed our entrepreneurial program.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:58.680]   As you know, when I talk to you about this, and my colleague talked to you about this,
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:03.640]   we have a community of practice started around the independent, resilient content creator,
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:06.040]   journalist, call them what you will.
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.640]   Rather than, hey, kids, let's make a company.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.760]   I can serve a community, a market.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.240]   I can do it with probably five different kind of revenue streams as you do.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.240]   I got subscriptions.
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.240]   I got events.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:18.240]   I got sponsors.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:22.960]   I do everything I can to make this work and serve that audience really well.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.880]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:34.440]   Are you concerned that without some form of mass media, it'll be difficult to build consensus?
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.440]   We never had it.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:36.440]   That was a myth.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.440]   Walter Cronkite.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:40.480]   That's the way it is, was always a lie.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:41.480]   Always.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:46.480]   So, how does one, how do you build political consensus unless you have communities?
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.360]   Here's the thing we do.
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:55.880]   The book, as I wrote and researched the book, and by the way, I don't have an editor who's
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:58.840]   bought it yet, so it's not a book yet.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:57:59.840]   But what I've been working on--
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:00.840]   So call your friends.
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:04.880]   You may know Jeff, this is your chance to build a lifestyle book.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.880]   Well, I've always sent it to the US, Senator.
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:07.880]   Could be.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.120]   If the editor doesn't take it, that could be what it is.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:17.560]   What I realized, Leo, is the essence of the book is this, is that we are right now relearning
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.960]   how to have a conversation with ourselves as a society.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:25.320]   If you go to the early days of print, Luther had a conversation with the Pope and Erasmus
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:26.320]   through print.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:31.120]   Erasmus had a conversation with Sir Thomas Moore through books.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.520]   Media was conversational.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:36.560]   Richardson's first novels were about letters.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:38.760]   Media was tremendously conversational.
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.920]   We lost that somewhere along the way.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:40.920]   I think we lost it.
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:47.040]   My theory is we lost that with steam and with mass and the penny press and so on.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:51.680]   You could argue that we lost it at other points with radio or TV, but we lost it.
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.800]   We don't know how to have a conversation.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:59.280]   And so actually, there's an essay I read recently that said that our problem in society
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.280]   is we don't argue enough.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.280]   You think, well, that's insane.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.280]   All we do is argue.
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:03.840]   Listen to this twig show.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.840]   There are argument all the time.
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:06.840]   What the?
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:07.840]   But we don't know how to argue.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.600]   We don't know how to have a discussion.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.600]   We've lost that ability.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:14.600]   No, I think that we're leads to cancellations.
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:21.560]   I think here the discussions we have, which sometimes can get heated, are all about getting
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:23.560]   to the core truth of it.
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:27.600]   And that's a model of behavior within this little group.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:34.360]   And just as Stacy within her group and with her podcast and with her newsletter, we're
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:39.080]   bringing in people to get this mini consensus.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:43.040]   I just worry that a larger political consensus is the goal.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.760]   Well it is in politics.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.760]   It is in politics.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:46.760]   It is in politics.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.560]   But I'm a point, even then, is negotiation.
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:50.000]   You're never in consensus.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.240]   Consensus is a false goal.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:53.080]   Okay, so let's not use consensus.
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:59.920]   But if we operate from different facts, it becomes difficult to negotiate.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.920]   Maybe not.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.040]   Maybe it doesn't matter if we have the same facts.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.040]   It's not facts either.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.240]   I don't think.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:08.000]   And I was going to find another one of these papers I read today.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.880]   Which talked about the myth of objectivity.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:11.880]   Here's my concern.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:17.080]   Although I have to say, so for instance in the tech sphere, which is the only sphere
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:24.440]   I really know, there are a lot of different groups like Twit that bring people together
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:28.760]   and there's Marquez Brownlee and there's magazines and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.600]   stuff that bring people together and try to reach a consensus.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.560]   And then there is a somewhat larger consensus of them all.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:41.240]   So for instance, when a new Android phone comes out, there's different reviews, different
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.240]   thoughts.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:47.960]   But it kind of all eventually kind of works its way to a generalized consensus, which
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:55.240]   then users kind of say, okay, we all kind of agree the Pixel 4a is a good phone.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:00.680]   We all kind of agree that the Samsung kind of has, that don't get a fold.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:05.280]   There's a certain sense of, I think, I mean, there's of course dissent.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.280]   But we work its way, it works its way to consensus.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.960]   You see, this is the proof of writing the problem is that media gave you that idea that
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:12.960]   that was the goal.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.360]   So what are the papers I read by?
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:20.560]   It is the goal because if you're an end user to buy a, looking to buy a product, your goal
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.120]   is to get a consensus opinion on whether it's a good product period.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.880]   Then we'd have two phones that we'd be easily.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.040]   No, I don't think so.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.320]   What is your goal?
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.760]   You don't think what?
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.760]   What is your goal?
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:37.040]   I don't think that you might have to understand if something will work for me.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:44.040]   So I know that when we do our reviews, I really focus, I mean, yes, if a product is a total
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:50.440]   dog, but I used to tease Kevin about his equivocal reviews.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.000]   And I was like, Kevin, you're like, if you're a lobster fisherman in Northern Canada, this
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.600]   particular device is to be great.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.240]   But you're getting the information you need for you to make that decision.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.240]   That makes sense.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.240]   Yeah, no, that makes sense.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.240]   You're right.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:09.960]   So there's an argument that is called, I'm forget what I was calling it, but this writer
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.280]   talks about the naive realism and objectivity.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.960]   And I want to talk about this real quickly.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.440]   So he says, there's three points of this notion of objectivity.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.720]   Number one is my own perceptions are realistic and objective and therefore reasonable others
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:23.720]   will share them.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:27.840]   Number two, I'll be able to persuade them who disagree with me if we are reasonable and
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.840]   open minded.
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:31.840]   And once I explain the real facts, number three, those are the things that we're going
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:36.480]   to change, especially those who challenge these important beliefs are irrational.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.960]   But if I can't get there.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:42.000]   And so we have this myth in journalism of objectivity.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.600]   And there's a really good piece in the New York Times about two and a half months ago
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:51.200]   by Wesley Lowry, former Washington Post reporter and Pulitzer Prize winner, who talked about
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:57.560]   the structural racism of the notion of objectivity because the person decides in journalism what
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.040]   is objective looks like me and all white men.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.040]   Right.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.960]   And he decides what's bias and says, no, you, Lewis Raven Wallace, who got fired from NPR
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:12.040]   because you wouldn't get along because you're transgender and you believed you had a lived
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.040]   experience that was valuable.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.440]   And NPR told you, no, that's a bias.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.440]   Right.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.440]   Right.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:21.720]   So this notion of objectivity becomes a myth that it's the wrong myth.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.520]   We're striving for the wrong thing.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:28.320]   What we need instead is a sense that we are in constant communication, constant disagreement.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.840]   We need the skills of understanding how to negotiate with each other.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.560]   And the end product is not consensus.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.560]   It's negotiation.
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.560]   I like it.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.680]   I like it.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:41.360]   I think that's, that sounds reasonable.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:45.600]   And Facebook, we have to get used to the notion that we're going to be in a fragmented,
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.320]   factually fragmented world.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.320]   No, it's good.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.320]   It's okay.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.320]   We do this.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.320]   We used to have 20 newspapers.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:55.040]   The problem with Facebook, this is why I criticize Facebook, Mark this.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.400]   Facebook is not built for building communities.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.600]   It is not built for negotiating ideas.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.880]   It is not built for those kind of connections.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.840]   It's built for people you already know to share stuff with you.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.840]   Right.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.120]   And news came to it accidentally and it's not built for it.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.120]   Right.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.760]   But we, the opportunity here is it's only 15, 1475 and Gutenberg years drink.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:22.640]   The opportunity is to say, can I build something where people can share their lived experiences,
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:25.960]   where we can do that in a safe space and understand each other a little better, where
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.200]   I can ask them questions and they can answer them.
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:33.960]   Can we build a place like this where more people can, can discuss phones and come to
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:34.960]   conclusions?
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.080]   You know, that's what the internet does and does pretty well.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.080]   Read it.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.080]   Right.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:44.080]   We're starting to build a new structure for conversation in society, but 30 years war
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.080]   is coming, but that's okay.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.080]   So we're almost there.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.080]   This is what you're saying.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.080]   What would a.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.080]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.920]   Austria is going to come back.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.720]   What would it look like?
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:02.720]   Is it possible to conceive of what it would look like to build a space where this negotiation
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:07.480]   was prized and fostered?
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.480]   What would Facebook look like?
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.080]   I think culturally even in the.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.080]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.080]   No, no, you go.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.080]   You go.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.080]   You go.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.080]   You go.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.080]   I just did my school.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:21.280]   I think in the US, we're, we're actually kind of afraid of these conversations.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:26.240]   We don't tend to want them, embrace them or engage in them, especially with people who
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.680]   don't think like we do.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.360]   It's really interesting when I'm with my friends from like Germany.
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.360]   Right.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.680]   Because disagreements can't happen anymore.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.360]   Disagreements now lead to being dangerous.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.360]   That's it.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.360]   Or worse.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.360]   Yeah.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:43.280]   So I was just going to, yeah.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.080]   So finish your thoughts, Stacy.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.080]   Go.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.080]   Go.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.080]   Go.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.080]   Go.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.080]   Go.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.080]   Go.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:54.820]   to be a business model? I'm just wondering what it would look like. There's a company
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:59.460]   called, it's right near you called Spaceship Media, run by a woman named Eve Perlman,
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:04.440]   it's small, you know, and I think I've said before, because I have tenure I could do obnoxious
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:08.740]   things like redefine journalism. So my definition of journalism is to convene communities into
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:13.480]   respectful and core and productive conversations. Spaceship does that, they bring in communities
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:18.240]   that are somewhat in conflict, African American teens in high school and their teachers,
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:25.440]   people around guns. The first project was Clinton voters versus Trump voters. What they
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:29.440]   do is the journalist gets to know them, they put them in a Facebook group, doesn't
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:33.760]   that be Facebook. And the goal is just to understand each other a little better. Now
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:38.440]   what happens then is people say, we're getting in trouble over here, we're starting to fight,
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:42.400]   can you help us out? Can you look up some stuff for us? Well the angels sang in the heavens
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:49.880]   open because they said we want an informed conversation, we want facts and we want you
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:53.040]   to go get them for us journalists. What are the outcomes that we're like?
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:57.320]   Do they don't they just all end up being, well let's just agree to disagree or they're
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:02.080]   they understand they come out saying, okay, I still disagree, but I understand you better.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:05.640]   I understand your perspective better. I didn't get that piece of it or now I now I get it
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:09.400]   better. When Spaceship sees this, when they come to Spaceship, they don't they don't do
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:13.960]   a narrative about it. They deliver what they call fact stacks. They say here are the things
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.280]   that you asked for, that you're wrong about, that you're confused about, that you should
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:23.680]   know and you come to a better understanding so that you can at least have that negotiation
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:28.600]   not based on emotion and hate. You know my view is that people don't really believe
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:33.120]   in Q except for some really Dutch jobs, but they want us to believe that they believe
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.600]   it. There's there's a performative emotion involved. You don't understand my circumstances.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:43.620]   You don't understand my life and I don't want to understand yours either. And it is as Dana
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:48.760]   Boyd says, an epistemological war. I don't trust you. I don't trust your experts. You're
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:54.240]   all elites. I don't like your facts. F you. This is what I'm doing. If it irritates you,
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:57.920]   good. And that's where we are as ant was to say to me to go. That's that's what if you
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:03.880]   disagree, that's what it rises to. Yeah, and Spaceship has a methodology by graduates
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:07.720]   have worked for the company where they understand how to get people together. This isn't really
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:11.760]   interesting business. You and I yell at each other and we love each other. Well, yeah,
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:17.160]   but we're a lot closer than we are apart. We're never we're never going to agree with
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:23.480]   everyone on everything. Yeah, there are more moral and cultural differences between people
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:30.000]   where I'm I mean, biggest thing you can think of just broadest brush America individualism.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.400]   Okay, China, the collective good. Yeah, I mean, those are those are contrasting. They're not.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:43.640]   There's I mean, we put it, you know, we each have moral thoughts about it. But at the same
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:48.080]   time, this is we each are going to come down on different sides. And that's okay. And I
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:52.360]   do agree, Jeff, I like how you call it an negotiation when you're trying to build laws.
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:57.840]   And if we as journalists, one of the hardest things I think to write about and to talk
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:02.840]   to our audience for politicians to talk to their constituents about is this idea that
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:10.800]   every law comes with trade offs and we're making them, you know, like we can fund children
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:15.440]   going to preschool or we can fund programs that, you know, help people when they get
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.800]   out of jail. And maybe we don't have enough money to do all of those. And we don't talk
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:30.120]   like that becomes fund community community help, right? Fund mental mental health. But
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:36.040]   it gets turned into rhetoric. And who's the fault for that oftentimes? My business media
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:41.000]   journalism, right, it's our business. And we screw that up. We don't we don't try to
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:50.320]   find a run post some weeks ago about Hannah around and totalitarianism. I reread major
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:55.320]   portions of the roots of totalitarianism. And she expressed it brilliantly in there where
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:10:00.320]   she said people give up their day to day concerns and then they grab on to these abstract notions.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:05.960]   I don't believe that for 30% of America, the single most important thing every single day
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:10.400]   of their lives is guns and abortion. I believe the most important thing in their lives is
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.960]   the health and well being of their families and their children. And that's the same for
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:20.080]   me and the same for all of us. There's a commonality there which media never deals
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:27.560]   with at that level because it's boring and it's not conflict and it's not new. It's life.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:33.760]   What were the outcomes with the spaceship media? Do you do? So I'll we'll take the example
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:39.160]   that you one of the examples was the Alabama, California conversation between Clinton and
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.960]   Trump supporters. Was there an outcome? There were a couple outcomes. By the way, they have
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:48.720]   a brand new book out. So we should we should plug that. So we should media on guns. They
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:55.720]   did a nationwide project on guns. Boy, they're courageous. They don't mind taking on the
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:02.040]   big topics. Exactly. Guns and American conversation, Simon and Schuster, my former publisher, my
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:12.280]   own publisher. I hope my current publisher. So on the Clinton versus Trump, that you know,
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:16.200]   there was a by the way, they did a thing. They did it in a moderated Facebook group. I have
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:22.160]   to. Yes. Yes. But it was very modern. They would open it up occasionally and so they
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.160]   would do stories for the paper and say this is what's going on here and so you could model
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.520]   a behavior. What this is about is modeling the behavior but how people can discuss and
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:34.640]   so the my students who worked with this when they saw somebody was going to say something
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.720]   hostile, they'd say, maybe you want to think about saying that in a different way. Why
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:41.560]   don't you ask that as a question and see what happens if you do that and they'd do that
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.760]   and they'd say, oh, well, you know, I got farther. This is interesting. Right. And so
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.040]   at the end of it, at the end of the period, most of the people said we're going to stick
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.600]   around and we're going to keep going because we're interested in each other. They actually
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:12:00.720]   enjoyed it. Well, joy might even be strong, but they recognize the value in it. It's like
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:05.080]   eating broccoli. You may not enjoy it, but you know, it's good for you. You got to burn
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.800]   it. Stacy, you got to if you burn the broccoli, I can I can bear it, but that's it. Throw
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.560]   some Oh, yeah, you roast that broccoli. It's amazing. Broasted is a lot better. No,
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:18.360]   Holland is coming. I'm joking. I don't know. Hollandaise. I'm very well. You answered my
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:24.400]   question, actually, because I was I was I was a little concerned about the profit motive
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:29.680]   and journalism and what it's brought us to. And and I don't have a problem with mass media
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:35.440]   collapsing at all, but I just I just had a conversation today yesterday with a two hour
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:39.920]   conversation with a brilliant anthropologist at Northwestern. This is I'm trying to do
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:45.120]   a new project here. And and I said at some point, imagine the journalism was died. It's
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.560]   collapsed. Yeah. And as anthropologists, how would you approach the problems in society?
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:54.000]   You know, what would you do? And then anthropologists start by listening by understanding communities
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.360]   by by understanding what their connections are by speaking their language back by giving
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:02.920]   them the respect of listening, making them feel heard and learning about them on their
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:09.640]   terms. What if what if journalism started from that base? Everybody go watch TMZ.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:16.200]   See this is the problem. You wouldn't do the third person.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:21.240]   In bifurcation. All right. Let's go. New subject. I want to do the change log. How
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:27.760]   about that? How about them apples? Yeah. Yeah. This is it's time for play the drums.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:38.640]   The trumpets or whatever the hell they are. The Google change log. Trumpets and drums,
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:45.960]   trumpets and drums. Goodbye cloud print. When we knew that was going away, here's its replacement
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:51.600]   on January 1st cloud print. Turns into a pumpkin. This was the I thought a really cool feature
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:57.120]   allowed you to print initially from a Chromebook, but eventually from almost anything to almost
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:03.640]   any printer over the internet without a wired connection. Google sat in between as a kind
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:12.840]   of host. They say, you know, now you got to got to do native printing. I thought there
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:16.720]   was a replacement. I guess. No, there's well, there's there's three or four private things
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:21.680]   mobile and things like that. Yeah. The beauty of cloud print was I could be in Germany and
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:26.560]   Prince was home printer. Yeah. It was great. And I don't know what was the cost to them.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:31.520]   It solved a lot of problems. People had huge problems printing is one of the biggest thorniest
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:36.000]   problems in personal computing. And it just solved it. But I guess you and I are old enough
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.400]   to remember having to get. Yeah, but how many people are printing all the drivers? People
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.840]   still print, don't they? They think they still print really? Yeah. I don't. You and I don't
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:53.840]   know. Really? Well, this is this is for one chapter. See that you know, Prince writers print.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:59.520]   Okay, I'm pretty enough. Paper so I can mark them up. But you know,
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:06.240]   just thinking today, we talked for years about the paperless office and we never got there.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:10.960]   I think COVID just got us there. Maybe. Yeah, because you're not passing around memos.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.960]   It's right. You don't want to touch anything. Google's.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:18.400]   Having remote forever. Yeah, you did. I've been at a paperless office.
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:22.000]   You don't do you have a printer? You have a printer that you're so organized.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.920]   I have a printer. I print probably once a week and it's usually written labels.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:32.080]   All right. Yeah. I print sparingly. Most of the time it's more so for scanning.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:36.000]   That's what that thing is. Oh, I know I use my scanner. Oh, scanning is. Yeah, scanning.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:42.640]   Getting stuff into digital instead of out. Google store has added a nav bar.
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:47.200]   Their online store that features a subscriptions landing page, which includes
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:53.680]   information about your subscriptions. Who to thunk it? What a clever idea. Do you remember
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:58.720]   that you subscribe to YouTube, TV, YouTube, premium, YouTube, music, premium, all at the same time?
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:07.360]   Also completely unnecessarily. Well, store.google.com/subscriptions. Get to know Google subscriptions
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:14.080]   and services and find out where you're wasting your money or maybe find out new ways to waste
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:19.520]   money. How about that? They also are offering a la Apple packages, video entertainment,
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:25.680]   audio entertainment and home security packages. So a new a new tab.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:31.200]   I love the ISPs. This is yeah. Bundling. Bundling baby.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:36.720]   Android smart selection feature now lets you convert to other units.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:44.960]   So you can select something like 60 miles an hour on your phone. And if you wish,
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:51.680]   you can convert it to kilometers. Oh, that's actually kind of wait. Is it
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:57.040]   Oh, converted. Oh, does it do it for currency? I bet it does. Why wouldn't it?
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:01.760]   But don't enjoy it too much because it's already been deprecated. No, I'm just
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:09.680]   going away. Just give it. I'm just kidding. You need to write device with smart selection enable.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:19.440]   Google camera 8.1 for reasons no one understands has disabled the ultra wide lens for astrophotography
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:25.680]   on the Pixel 5 and 4a. Have you heard from your photography buff fans and about this one?
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:32.080]   Most people that was using that didn't particularly care for it. They weren't using why.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:38.720]   Right. The ultra wide is good for the field of view, but it's pretty soft. Yeah.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:42.720]   It's clarity. It wouldn't be a good choice. Okay.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:49.520]   Is soft code for blurry? Yes. Okay. No, I genuinely I was like,
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:56.160]   soft. What does that mean? It's not as Chris. Sorry. Got it. Okay.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:05.440]   Google photos. But but having an ultra wide for Astro makes sense because you want to see
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.040]   all of the right sky is very big. Why though not ultra wide because the ultra wide was like 16
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:15.760]   millimeters. I was super wide. Right. It was also distorted a little bit. You get curvature in
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.360]   there and things like that. Then it burr. Yeah. Then it bows a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:25.200]   No, I think Google's just trying to point in the right direction. I haven't looked yet,
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:32.000]   but you might want to check your Google photos because they are starting to generate year in review
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:42.320]   stories. Just looking my stories here and a 2020 photo book. Oh, so I've I always enjoy that carousel.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:46.480]   Oh, you mean the thing that I didn't buy last year? Yeah. Yeah. Right. That one. You can buy that
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:53.120]   one not buy that one again this year. Yeah. Well done. Photobooks, photo prints, print series.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:58.560]   Yep. It's all in there. Well, you have it? No, I don't have it yet. But I'm actually not looking
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:04.480]   at my Android. I should look at my Android. Not my iPhone. Yeah. What am I using an iPhone for?
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:12.160]   Just checking real quickly. Yeah, I don't have it. I have recent highlights, but I do. Yeah.
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:17.760]   Recent highlights a year ago, two years ago, three years ago. I like that. Apple actually
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:22.720]   starting to do a better job of that with their photos than Google. Despite all of the.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:32.080]   Well, I was just like, Apple doing that. Apple doing better. What will Google have left?
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:37.520]   It's not available, I guess, yet. Once it's available, maybe it'll be after the years over
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:41.920]   because something important could happen in the next two days. It'll appear first in the memories,
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:48.720]   carousel and iOS. Oh, it'll appear on iOS and Android with the web excluded instead of the usual,
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:54.160]   what you're getting right now. Look back at this day, week or year. It's a recap from the past 12
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:59.440]   months. As before you tap the edges to navigate backward and forward,
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:05.040]   a press and hold pauses, the date and locations at the top. There's a preview book that lets you
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:12.560]   create an annual book. I would like to do that, actually. Do you I mean, they never go ahead.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:18.800]   I was going to ask if anyone's ever bought a canvas from Google, like a photo. I was just
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:22.640]   going to ask the same if and had done that. Yeah. I know someone that has and they did look quite
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:28.560]   nice. Yeah. Okay. Apple used to do really nice prints. And I've printed from a number of people.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:33.040]   We do shutter stock now. In fact, our shutter stocks. Good. Our Christmas cards are pretty good.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:37.760]   And my back was in my old backyard. Oh, in Northern Carolina.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:42.880]   They were just across the border from Charlotte in Fort Nils,
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:51.600]   South Carolina. I just printed from a site called Artifacts Uprising for I had taken one of Ohm's prints.
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:56.880]   Oh, nice. And printed on metal. Oh, because he does black and white. He did a really good job.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:01.120]   Yeah. Oh, that would be nice. They were doing it really stunning. I love metal prints, especially
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:08.000]   from monochrome. Yeah. And now I'm going to have Jeff Jarvis, because he's always good at this.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:13.760]   Get his Google Assistant to sing the New Year's song, if you would, Jeff.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:17.920]   Sing the New Year's song.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:24.640]   Sing a song for the New Year. I hope that we all thrive.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:31.040]   Kindness, love, and love. Oh, my goodness. May that be our guide. I'm here to look after.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:37.760]   Disney's made a shift. They're actually is animation on his screen right now. We just don't get to see it.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:43.680]   If you want to hear that. Okay. Stop and never do that again. If you want to hear that song again,
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:51.200]   just ask me. Please ask me. I think that's it sounds like glados from the the portal,
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:57.600]   but portal games are still alive, right? Interestingly, if you ask for it in England,
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:04.960]   it'll have an English accent. One Twitter. It's best. The user also mentioned in Spanish.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.360]   And the same thing happens in French.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:12.880]   What if I said it in Spanish?
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.120]   Let's see.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.440]   I can't. I don't know.
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.360]   We're back with more as.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:25.440]   We call her hilarious.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.920]   Hilaria Higginbotham attempts to speak Spanish next.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:33.200]   And that's the Google change log.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.040]   I don't speak Spanish.
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.680]   Y'all to be fair. My language is French.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.440]   He's my daughter who speaks Spanish.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.840]   Oh, I really think I'm calling you hilarious.
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:44.800]   Hilaria Higginbotham.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:48.800]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.240]   I just couldn't remember.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.840]   Yeah, I don't think it speaks.
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:52.400]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.680]   New years in French.
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:01.520]   I could say a noise lead that said I heard singing does noise.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.000]   Yes.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:09.840]   Okay. Good. It's always fun to confound the Google Assistant.
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:17.920]   Jeff, are you excited about the new Chromebook 2 from Galaxy's Amazon?
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.680]   I hope so. I hope so.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.640]   I hope so.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.840]   This is from Kevin Tofel and about Chromebooks.com.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:24.240]   Leacon.
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:27.680]   Hewlett display for $9,9,6,9.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:28.400]   Good price.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:29.040]   You go ahead. You do.
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:30.800]   Still got that beautiful red body.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.600]   We saw it CES last January.
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:36.000]   Little more square edges.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.800]   Not the wedge shape anymore.
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:44.320]   Walking cat had the rumor.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.960]   Kevin says he's been, he says,
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.120]   "I haven't been able to validate the latest leaks,
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:55.600]   but he says it all kind of makes sense."
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.280]   And a QLED display is nice.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:06.640]   So that's a step down from what they have now, right?
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.600]   Well, it's not OLED.
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:08.080]   I'm not saying.
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:08.880]   No, no, no, no.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:12.000]   QLED is better than probably, I don't know what they have now.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:12.960]   Do they have OLED now?
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:13.440]   No.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.480]   Well, they do.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:14.960]   Oh, they do.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.560]   Oh, it is a step down.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.040]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:17.840]   It is a step down.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:18.880]   They went to an LCD camera.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.520]   That's how they saved it.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.160]   But I also wonder, Leo, does it suck less power?
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:24.640]   It does.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.440]   It's a problem with this machine.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.320]   OLED is notorious for bad second.
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.440]   I think that's the reason here.
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.120]   I think I'm trying to come up with a new model
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.680]   that doesn't lose its battery in three hours.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.360]   Is that what you're using as the Samsung?
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.880]   No.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:37.840]   I was going to get it.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:40.320]   But it's not.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.960]   You're waiting.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:43.600]   You still have that.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.320]   I'm dying.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.440]   Well, I'm afraid I'm going to buy it,
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.040]   then Google's going to announce something new.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.960]   Really?
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:53.280]   The battery power turned me off on that one.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.880]   You really think that's going to happen?
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.040]   A guy can hope, Kenny.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.000]   Still haven't given that up.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000]   From Yahoo.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.560]   I don't understand this story at all.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.840]   From Yahoo Finance, the year interview of Google.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:12.640]   For Google.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.840]   From Yahoo.
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:14.800]   This is the bad business model.
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.480]   We got to fill space online.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.480]   Online is never full of content.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.880]   Honestly, I normally do not do a show this
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:23.040]   close to the end of the year because there's no news.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:28.880]   Which means anything in the news is by definition bogus.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:29.360]   Yes.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:30.240]   Yeah.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:30.720]   There's a.
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:31.360]   I hate lists.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:32.160]   I despise this.
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.760]   There's a ton of this stuff.
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:37.280]   How?
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.240]   You talk about substack.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.840]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.040]   You wanted to talk about substack.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:44.720]   So, substack is the hot thing right now.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:48.880]   It is a newsletter platform, I guess.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:49.200]   Yes?
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:52.160]   Do you have a substack?
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.240]   No, I don't.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.360]   I have a substack, but I only made one just because
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.320]   I thought I should know about it.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:02.320]   I was just looking at it.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:03.920]   And but some people subscribe to it,
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.840]   which makes me laugh because there's no.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.480]   There's no in content on it.
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.840]   But it's interesting.
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.200]   No, people subscribe to individual things.
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:14.480]   So Ben Smith and The New York Times did a puff piece on,
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:16.320]   I'm forgetting her name, something.
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:17.600]   Heather Robinson.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:18.560]   Oh, she's the hottest.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:20.000]   Yeah, I saw that puff piece.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:20.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:26.480]   And so she is pulling in, Ben said, a million dollars a year.
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:26.720]   No.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:28.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.200]   And he says the secret to her success is what?
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:32.800]   People just want facts.
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.960]   Yeah, well, she doesn't.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.960]   I've read it.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:37.360]   It's fine.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:37.680]   It's good.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.200]   It's a summary of a new curator.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.640]   She's a slightly historical view.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.680]   You know, it's fine, but it's five bucks
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:44.880]   since she gets enough people.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:45.760]   Five bucks a month.
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:46.000]   And.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.120]   And how much does substack take of that five bucks?
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:50.400]   Uh, 10%.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:53.040]   Now, in some cases,
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.600]   Matt Iglesias left Fox to go to substack,
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:59.920]   and they gave him an advance of a reported $250,000.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:01.760]   So he has to earn back that advance
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:02.960]   before he starts making money.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.360]   She chose not to take an advance.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.200]   Others did not.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:10.080]   But you have, it's where the people are going.
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:11.920]   So I was just talking today with some of my colleagues,
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:12.880]   the school and saying,
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:13.760]   I wonder if you're a,
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:17.520]   if you're a publisher of a major publication,
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.280]   and you have star names on,
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.200]   you know, the Washington Post, New York Times,
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.480]   Time Magazine, wherever,
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.000]   and they see this million bucks.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.760]   What do you do?
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:28.880]   Are they all going to leave you and try to do this?
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:29.920]   Of course, what's going to happen is,
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:31.120]   there's going to be too many newsletters on there.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.160]   And then it'll be the same.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:35.280]   So she's a professor of history, right?
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.720]   At Boston University.
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:37.440]   Boston College.
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.080]   Boston College.
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:41.040]   Heather, you, uh, Heather.
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:42.640]   I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:43.440]   Hilaria.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:44.160]   You.
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.680]   You published.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.920]   I published a newsletter, but do you,
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.840]   what platform, do you use a platform for that or?
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.160]   Oh, she's muted.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:56.080]   Is that us?
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.920]   Nope, it's me.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:58.240]   Sorry.
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:27:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.360]   I'm in the midst of switching platforms, but,
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.320]   um,
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.040]   Would you consider?
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.080]   I use MailChimp.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:04.560]   MailChimp, which is.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:05.520]   I consider it sub stack.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.440]   I actually met with Hamish Hamish.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:08.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:08.720]   Hey, yeah.
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:14.320]   And he, he made the case that I probably could make
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.560]   as much as I do now.
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:19.280]   Without doing quite as much work,
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.720]   which just kind of was like,
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.080]   "Of course, that's what I want to hear."
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:25.760]   But I have a hard time.
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:29.280]   I still toy with the idea,
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.240]   but I just have a,
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:32.720]   I don't believe anyone would pay for my stuff.
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.920]   Ah, because your newsletter is free right now.
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.320]   Well, it's free, but it's also,
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.280]   the other thing that is different about my model is
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:44.160]   my people are more,
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.600]   they're an audience that you want to reach,
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.840]   that cannot be reached easily.
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:50.960]   They're a niche audience.
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:54.240]   And so people will pay a lot more to reach them.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:58.720]   So I can make a decision like I said.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:01.200]   I love Ben Evans.
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:06.320]   He sends out the paid one on Sunday night
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:08.960]   with an extra piece that he writes just for subscribers.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:11.680]   And then he sends out a free version
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.600]   without those bonuses on Tuesday.
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.960]   Tell you, it beats writing a book.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.640]   You make more money than writing a book.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:19.440]   If you're going to write,
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.800]   figure out a way to make money at it, right?
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:25.840]   I couldn't do Gutenberg every single week.
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:26.400]   And I was saying, yeah.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.240]   I, having, when I was at Fortune,
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.440]   they paid me very well.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.640]   Like I was, I was well,
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:33.600]   well, remunerated,
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:34.320]   probably not like,
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.960]   like, fancy person,
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.840]   well, remunerated,
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:38.880]   but it was fine for me.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:40.800]   You could, you could afford fingers on your gloves
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.680]   when you worked there,
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:42.880]   but now you can't.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.160]   Yeah, when I worked there.
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:45.200]   You didn't even have the seat up.
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:48.000]   But, yeah, sorry.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.520]   I turned off the heat,
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:53.040]   so now I need my like little warming things.
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:55.680]   What was I going to say?
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:56.720]   Oh, but when I left,
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:58.400]   I actually made more.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.720]   And this was something I argued with Fortune
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.640]   when I was trying to get them to do the podcast.
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:03.520]   And they wouldn't, I was like,
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:05.040]   I made more on the podcast
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:10.800]   than I made from them.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:13.520]   So like, I was like, dude,
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.120]   all of that could have been graving.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.240]   You could have charged even more,
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:16.880]   because you're Fortune.
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:18.560]   Anyway.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.320]   So I would be terrified
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:22.080]   if I were a publisher
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.680]   that has a name,
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.760]   because your stars are going to go there,
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.200]   find their audience,
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:27.840]   do well,
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:31.200]   and then wander off to a sub-stack.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:33.840]   I often, as Ellen Peterson,
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.920]   I often, as Andrew Sullivan,
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:36.880]   they've all gone there.
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.440]   I often wonder why our hosts
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:42.000]   don't use this platform
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.960]   as a launching point for a newsletter,
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:46.720]   because you know--
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:47.840]   Because we love you.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:49.440]   No, no, but I wouldn't stop you.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.240]   You could do that.
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:50.880]   Because it's really easy.
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:51.600]   That's what we use.
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.720]   That's why I don't do it.
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:55.920]   But because you'd have this opportunity every week
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:57.200]   to promote your newsletter.
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:01.440]   And you know, the whole trick is generating.
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.600]   She must have 20,000 subscribers
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.680]   paying five bucks a month,
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:07.120]   a hundred thousand dollars a month
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:11.040]   in order to make that million dollars a year.
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.160]   Which isn't a lot of people.
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.600]   That's actually not a lot of people.
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.280]   You'd certainly,
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:18.480]   it's probably a tenth of the number of people
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:19.520]   you'd reach every month
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:21.280]   on the podcast.
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.440]   So if you could get one in 10 to subscribe,
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:25.440]   you could make a million dollars additional a month.
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.280]   And actually, I think all she charges for
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:28.880]   is access to her comments.
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:30.240]   I think the newsletter is free.
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.200]   Oh, interesting.
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:34.400]   It is a lot of your--
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:35.200]   You'll be able to have--
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.400]   And I also still--
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:36.880]   It stills.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:38.160]   I often wonder,
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.240]   do really people want more email,
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.720]   A, because I know I don't?
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:44.800]   You'd be surprised.
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.720]   Everybody always says,
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:47.920]   newsletters are so good,
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:48.480]   so powerful.
[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.440]   I don't.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.400]   I feel like,
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.320]   I think maybe people subscribe
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.920]   and then they end up in the bin
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:54.880]   and they don't read them.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.320]   I think they--
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.560]   There's some newsletters that I subscribe to
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:31:59.200]   and I open--
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.400]   You read them every single time?
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.360]   High open rate, okay.
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.360]   Even the--
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:06.080]   So you don't have to send it every day.
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:06.480]   Right.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.240]   No, weekly would be enough, right?
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:11.600]   How many do you say you do that with them?
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:12.560]   How many are you loyal to?
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:17.280]   I'm thinking at least six or seven
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.640]   that I go through each week.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.240]   Yeah, I'm maybe two or three.
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:22.000]   I have about four.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:22.320]   Stacy?
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:23.840]   Four.
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:26.000]   Leo?
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:26.400]   Zero.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:29.040]   And it's funny because I know that
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:31.520]   that it's the auto-generated mailchimp.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:32.560]   Yada, yada, yada.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.600]   But it still usually has
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:36.720]   interesting information
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:38.000]   or something useful for me.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:43.280]   And it warrants me clicking and actually opening that email.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.240]   Wait, those aren't people?
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:45.680]   Those aren't newsletters.
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:46.560]   Like, people give you?
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.880]   These are like random company newsletters?
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.160]   No, no, no.
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:52.320]   It's people, but I know they're using mailchimp
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.400]   and even though you open it up and it says,
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.120]   "Hi, aunt!"
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:56.240]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:56.720]   Oh, I see.
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:57.840]   You don't take it as personal.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:58.400]   Mailchimp.
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:58.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:32:59.200]   Right.
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:01.680]   Mailchimp tries to personalize it and says,
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:03.360]   "Hey, I don't expect it to be personal."
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:05.200]   I read the New Yorker.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.320]   I don't expect them to say,
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:07.920]   "Hey, Leo, here's your new art."
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:08.640]   Article.
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:12.400]   You can choose not to personalize it.
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:13.680]   I mean, like, that is a choice.
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:15.840]   Like, I always forget to personalize it.
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.160]   But like, my husband goes in behind me and is like,
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:20.560]   "First name, click."
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:20.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.720]   I feel like there's way too much content.
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.800]   So much content.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.600]   And I would love to consume more content.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:32.320]   There's a full issue of the New Yorker
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.880]   that's just about COVID-19 that I'm trying to read.
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:39.040]   But that gets placed in the back burner with a--
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.160]   It's a pile of guilt.
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:41.200]   It's a pile of guilt.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:42.080]   There's so much content.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.360]   And then there's the podcasts.
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:48.320]   And I worry that we're making so much content
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:51.600]   that, yeah, you can make money if you hit the right
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:54.480]   new thing sub-stack now.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.520]   Next year, I don't know what the next big thing will be.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:00.720]   But it's got to be a moving target.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.960]   And I don't--
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:04.160]   There's such a--
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.520]   It feels like there's a glut, which is going to reduce the value.
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:13.120]   Can you get enough people to let you do what you love doing?
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.080]   And you do that by serving somebody well and bringing them value.
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:16.880]   God, I hope so.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:17.840]   That's what we try to do.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:19.280]   It's what you do.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.000]   You did that.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.040]   What do I do?
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:23.760]   Matt Keiser started something called what the F spelled out.
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:24.560]   Just happened today.
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:26.560]   That's the full URL.
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.480]   And he does a newsletter and he went on to Patreon
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:29.920]   and he got enough money.
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:35.760]   And he makes it Pete Dominic was a comic and he was on Sirius.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:38.720]   They left Sirius and now he has a podcast and he goes on Patreon.
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:39.600]   And enough people give me--
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.800]   We hear all these stories.
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:41.280]   There's a lot of people who was.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:44.400]   But then I want follow-ups because a year from now and two years from now
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:45.600]   are they still making it.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.080]   Don't know.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:50.240]   And Matt, because this was a Trump thing, right?
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.360]   He started by accident.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.880]   He was doing it and it came out.
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:55.680]   Well, a lot of people made money on Trump for sure.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:57.840]   But I thought he was going to have to give it up.
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:00.800]   He said, no, his readers tell him, no, keep going.
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:01.760]   Well, they tell him now.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.720]   That's the adjustment.
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:03.760]   We'll see.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:06.720]   I think it hurts us.
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:12.000]   I mean, when we started 15 years ago, there weren't a lot of podcasts.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.440]   And we were very successful for a long time because there wasn't any competition.
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:19.760]   But there is now so much competition.
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:22.720]   There's more than 100,000 new podcasts every week that--
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:24.880]   Everybody can do that.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.840]   It's not just competition, by the way, for listenership.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.840]   Because I feel like our listenership is pretty solid.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:32.320]   It doesn't go down much.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.440]   It doesn't go up much.
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.000]   It's not everyone.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.280]   Thank you, all of you.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:37.360]   People, you know, and they're in the habit of it.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:42.560]   You're also competing for ad dollars and that's gotten much more brutal,
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:44.560]   much more brutal over the years.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:48.400]   And I just feel like it's going to be harder and harder.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:52.480]   Because pretty soon everybody's going to have a podcast or a new sweater.
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.480]   This is the too much content problem.
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.200]   And I think that's where we are is we're still--
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.600]   we had a scarcity based model where you had a publication
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.000]   and it had a beginning and an end and you filled it.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.920]   This is Gutenberg parenthesis.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:06.960]   And that's what you did.
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.280]   Well, now we're still trying to fill the internet.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.800]   I can't go to bed, dear.
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:12.240]   There's still an empty spot on the internet.
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:18.880]   And so I think that we haven't figured out how to get down to value.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.960]   Wasn't media in the background a sub-stack?
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:24.480]   Of three years ago and I go to medium now.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:26.160]   It's Linkbait City.
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.920]   It's terrible.
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:30.320]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:31.840]   And they don't even have advertising.
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:35.600]   They make money from harassing you till you sign up.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:36.800]   Right.
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:37.600]   Five bucks a month.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.000]   Well, it's like bait.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.040]   I mean, sign up like read this particular article.
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.800]   In a sense--
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:43.600]   No, I'm looking--
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:44.080]   No, I'm looking--
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.560]   Here's the stories that I'm looking at right now on my front page.
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:52.320]   I'm going to tell you the biggest secret about competing on dot, dot, dot,
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:53.840]   you probably suspected it all along.
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:59.040]   There are two types of genius and one doesn't reveal itself to middle age.
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.120]   The red slime lawsuit that could--
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.000]   Eight magazine.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:02.240]   Yeah.
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:02.560]   This is--
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:03.280]   New York Times.
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:06.960]   We hired a guy off Craigslist.
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:12.080]   I stopped reading it because the value went way down.
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.760]   So this is interesting.
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:16.880]   Sub-stack does not promote things.
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:19.600]   Now, so when you go to medium, part of the argument is--
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.840]   and I post on medium and my blog both,
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:25.040]   I get some social bump from it.
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:26.000]   People might discover it.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.920]   Sub-stack doesn't do that, which is interesting.
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:30.320]   I'm not sure--
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:31.280]   No, they leave it to you.
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.080]   That's your job.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.480]   Yeah, they do.
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.960]   But should they add value in that way?
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.960]   I don't know.
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:41.760]   They have a leaderboard, but that's kind of nasty.
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.920]   I never thought nudity was a big deal.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:46.000]   Then my hotel room door opened.
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:47.600]   Oh, geez.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:50.880]   How I burn fat and build muscle without going to the gym.
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:54.160]   Six habits of profoundly lonely people.
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:54.880]   I mean, I'm just--
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:55.520]   Yeah, this is--
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:56.720]   Is this just me?
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.720]   Maybe it's because of what I've read in the past.
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.080]   I've ruined my medium.
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.840]   In a world run by algorithm, I think that's just what people--
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:04.960]   This is our best friend too.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:07.760]   I think that's just--
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:11.200]   Why am I getting the articles of first signs of alcoholic liver damage
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:12.080]   are not in the liver?
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:13.200]   Why am I getting that?
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.200]   Do you believe in your redness?
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:15.680]   What better?
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:17.200]   The websites of alcoholic liver damage are--
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:20.160]   I'm not going to lie.
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:21.200]   I'm intrigued.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:23.120]   All right, let me click on that.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:23.680]   What do you--
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:25.120]   Now tell me what you're getting, Jeff.
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:25.680]   So maybe--
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:26.160]   So am I--
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:28.880]   Did you see it watching what I read and then giving me more?
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:29.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:30.160]   And I saw--
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:31.360]   I saw follow some--
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:32.080]   I don't like algorithms.
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:32.480]   I don't like algorithms.
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:33.200]   We're a dug rush cough.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:34.400]   We love--
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:36.000]   We disagree with what we love.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.400]   In a world run by algorithms, weirdness is our best weapon.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:42.800]   Then we have John Meidef, formerly head of the Rochester
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:43.520]   School of Design.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.520]   So I--
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:45.520]   But these are people you follow.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:46.080]   I wrote an--
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:46.640]   That's the difference.
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:47.760]   No, not all of them.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:51.120]   Peter D. Amondis, AI and shopping, the new retail era.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:52.160]   I don't follow him.
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.400]   They're Spanish.
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:55.520]   They don't know me that well.
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:58.880]   One zero, which is one of their publications,
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:01.760]   X, Googler, Meredith, Whitaker on political power and tech
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.680]   and the flaws of something that goes off.
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:05.920]   Meanwhile--
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:08.160]   No, my first signs of alcoholic liver damage.
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:11.120]   Just like my Facebook is good because I--
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:14.560]   I care and I give it a little bit of attention
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:17.280]   and good things happen if you just give it a chance for--
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.960]   Stacey, the subtitle on this,
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:21.920]   I've had not enough alcoholics are educated about this.
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:25.520]   I'm struggling on it.
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.040]   And they don't want to be either.
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:27.600]   That's the point.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:34.880]   Digestive, cognitive, neuromuscular and vascular.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:37.120]   I'll just leave the rest.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.480]   That's a lot of other things.
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:38.960]   Good Lord.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:45.280]   I open medium probably once or twice a quarter if that.
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:49.920]   Well, I'm always looking for news sources.
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:54.560]   So last year, medium turned out to be a useful source of news for us.
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:56.480]   So I added it to my beat check.
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.880]   And the reason this comes up is about two months ago,
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:02.160]   I took it off my beat check because it was such a wasteland.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:03.680]   So--
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:06.720]   Yeah, I may go there and through links.
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:08.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:12.160]   I'm here now and I see people that I adore.
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:16.640]   I see Veritunde, I see Roberto Blake, I could bake a joy.
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:20.800]   Oh, that's because medium things are black.
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:24.640]   I wonder why.
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:28.640]   But then I scroll through and all of the different--
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:31.760]   Medium things, I'm a page or just a bunch of listicles.
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.760]   Yeah, it's too many listicles.
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:34.400]   I don't like it.
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:36.800]   And I'm like, I don't read any of this stuff.
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:38.560]   It would make it suggest it to me.
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:43.120]   Yeah, well, I have an idea.
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:45.600]   I was going to say Leo, I think medium things.
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:48.880]   She're a, I don't know, 40 or 50 year old woman.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:53.680]   Nailed it.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.720]   But you know what, you know what,
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:55.360]   substact you--
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:56.800]   I can't tell you.
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.720]   What's substact you want?
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:01.040]   Substact you want to hear them to a lot of people.
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:02.960]   They have an RSS reader.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.560]   They're building RSS.
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:05.200]   Yay.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.840]   OK, hey, let's--
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.560]   Let's find the showdown.
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:11.120]   Hilaria.
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:14.080]   Let's go when we get to the archives.
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:14.720]   That's great.
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:18.560]   Did Hamish Mackenzie have a great school accent?
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:20.560]   He did not know.
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:20.960]   Oh, man.
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:22.720]   He was not that kind of Hamish.
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:25.520]   Well, the name like Hamish, it should sound like this.
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.320]   She says--
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:27.760]   He does have red hair, doesn't he?
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:30.240]   He said, "Lassie, you need to come over here
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.480]   and join us over here in substock."
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:35.680]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:38.800]   And no, there's nowhere to go.
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:39.840]   We're stuck here together.
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.120]   We'll play with you.
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:42.960]   You and me together.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.400]   Sorry.
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:48.480]   Let us get the picks of the week.
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.440]   We'll start with--
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:50.400]   Oh, that should be first.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.760]   Have just a moment of silence.
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:53.680]   No, you blew it.
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:54.560]   You blew it.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:55.120]   I did it.
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:56.800]   Oh, you did it.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:59.600]   There doesn't have to be an actual pause.
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:01.680]   The editors, they're razor blades.
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:03.040]   They're this thin.
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:03.760]   No, I didn't mean that.
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:04.960]   No, I was just going to a story.
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:05.680]   I was going to talk to him.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:06.160]   Oh, go to a story.
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:08.720]   Oh, you want to have a moment of silence for Flash?
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:10.240]   Yes.
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:15.760]   Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:20.080]   So, 1995 was when Flash began.
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.040]   God.
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.520]   Took a long time to kill that sucker.
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.600]   Little did we know what we were getting into.
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:27.200]   Oh, yay, yay.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:32.000]   Same thing can be said about the internet.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.520]   Yeah, I guess you're right.
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:35.520]   That's right.
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:36.320]   You're on the think of it.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:37.440]   That's legal, man.
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:37.680]   Yeah.
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:45.600]   The Flash from Adobe is gone as of the end of this month in two days.
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:48.880]   However, there are emulators.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.880]   There are other ways to do it.
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:52.880]   And as we mentioned a couple of weeks ago,
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:55.280]   Internet Archive has a Flash Archive,
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:57.840]   where they're using a Rust-based emulator
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:01.840]   to give people a chance to experience peanut butter jelly time,
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:02.880]   one more time.
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:05.200]   Bless their heart.
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:06.240]   Bless their hearts.
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:10.640]   But, you know what, I thought actually,
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:14.320]   at first I was starting to get calls on the radio show from people saying,
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.960]   "Oh, what am I going to do?"
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:20.640]   And I thought this was going to be a problem,
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:21.760]   and then it just stopped.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:24.400]   People go, "Oh, I actually don't need flesh."
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:26.720]   What's not going to work?
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:27.120]   Nothing.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.720]   What sites are still dependent upon it?
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:34.240]   If a site's still using Flash, they deserve to die at this point.
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:34.400]   Yeah.
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:37.360]   Well, it actually still requires Flash
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:40.320]   for taking a picture and sending it into that chat.
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.760]   But they're killing chat, so it's done.
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:42.240]   Oh, that's--
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:45.760]   They thought it'd be easy to kill Flash, and they're a place Flash.
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:50.080]   Skype for me, and they said, "No, I know what it was.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.120]   Watching MSNBC."
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:54.000]   Yeah, there used to be some content sites,
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.440]   but I think that's long gone.
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:56.480]   They've gotten rid of it, I think.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:59.600]   They've seen this coming for years.
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.920]   And the biggest problem was starting in 2010,
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:05.600]   if you had an iOS device, you couldn't use Flash.
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:09.520]   And I would assume any site on the web that carried anything
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:12.480]   about what it's doing was hoping that people with iPhones
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:13.920]   might be able to visit it, right?
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:18.160]   So, there is a site.
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:22.160]   Is Flash dead yet?
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:24.480]   Let's just see real quickly.
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:27.280]   Is Flash dead yet?
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:29.120]   A funeral has been scheduled.
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:31.920]   [chuckles]
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:34.160]   That plugin really tied the room together.
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:35.920]   It was the plugin for its place in time.
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:39.600]   Flash is being retired.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:41.440]   Well, there you go.
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:42.960]   There's really no debate.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:43.680]   This is a good--
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:45.040]   If you want to read about it,
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:46.880]   you can read about it here at--
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.080]   He's Flash dead yet,
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:50.080]   which apparently was created in 2010.
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:52.080]   [chuckles]
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:53.120]   Ah, she's--
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.080]   [chuckles]
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:54.560]   Wow.
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:55.920]   She's grief.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:56.400]   Now!
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:00.240]   Let's get the picks of the weeks,
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:02.480]   starting with Stacey's thing.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:06.160]   Stacey's thing is hoobs.
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:06.640]   Hoobs!
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:07.760]   [chuckles]
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:08.160]   Hoobs.
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:10.160]   Y'all may have heard of this already,
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:12.080]   because Micah probably told you about it,
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.520]   because I know he's a HomeBridge fan.
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:14.080]   Uh-huh.
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.200]   I think he's a HomeBridge fan.
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:19.520]   Okay, so there's this open source home automation software
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:22.720]   called HomeBridge that lets you tie other devices
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:25.360]   into the Apple HomeKit ecosystem.
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.440]   So, if you are all in on Apple's HomeKit,
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.200]   and you have a couple devices,
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:30.720]   and you want to get Syria to control it,
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:32.240]   and you want to use the HomeMap,
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:35.840]   Hoobs is the way to do that.
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:37.600]   And it has existed for a long time,
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.600]   but it's hardly--
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:40.800]   It existed like--
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:43.920]   Well, it existed initially as software that you put--
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:46.640]   You would have to buy a Pi Flash and SD card and run it.
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:48.160]   Oh, but they now sell it as a kit.
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:50.000]   And then they launched Hoobs,
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.760]   which was HomeBridge out of the box.
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:55.760]   And it's basically an enclosure for a Pi,
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:58.240]   and they've installed HomeBridge on it.
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:00.720]   So, it's kind of expensive for what it is,
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:02.160]   but I had Kevin try it out,
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:05.120]   because he's been playing with HomeKit for a while.
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:12.880]   And his verdict was that if you're all in on HomeKit,
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:14.880]   this is an option,
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:17.680]   and you don't want to flash your own card and download it,
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:20.080]   which most people watching this show are probably okay doing.
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:25.200]   But it's a neat alternative that's out there,
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:29.680]   especially if you want to bring your ring doorbell
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:31.040]   into your HomeKit setup.
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:33.760]   It's all made be obsolete in a few months
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:36.800]   after Project Chip comes to fruition, but we're going to--
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:39.600]   So it's 170 bucks.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.280]   Are you holding your breath on Project Chip?
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:46.160]   Oh, I have a story coming out this week in the newsletter.
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:47.520]   Y'all should sign up.
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:49.280]   I've got news for you.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.120]   All right.
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:54.400]   Look at me not breaking my own scoop.
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:55.280]   Stay tuned.
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:55.840]   I've not.
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:56.560]   Talk about it on the show too.
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:58.720]   Go to StaceyOnIOT.com
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:46:59.840]   and sign up for that newsletter.
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:01.600]   We could try to go for another hour on the show,
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:02.560]   unless she tells us what it is.
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:03.600]   It is freezing.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:06.240]   I feel like her fingertips might fall off if we do that.
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:08.080]   So you have a choice.
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:08.240]   I know.
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:10.480]   You can get hoops if it's for easy for you,
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:12.080]   170 bucks in Scott Hall,
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:14.880]   or if you have a Raspberry Pi or willing to buy one,
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:16.240]   the Humbrich software is free.
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.720]   So you could download the image,
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:20.080]   put that on your Raspberry Pi,
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:22.400]   and do exactly the same thing, I presume.
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:22.800]   Right?
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:23.600]   Exactly.
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:25.040]   There is literally nothing.
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:29.280]   Yeah, there is nothing that would make.
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:30.960]   But there are a lot of people who,
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.800]   I mean, when I tell someone,
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:35.200]   okay, you're going to go to the site,
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:38.320]   and you're going to flash an SD card with this software.
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:39.200]   Right. Oh no, I understand.
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:40.320]   Stop everything.
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:43.760]   I try to tell those people, do it.
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:44.480]   Do it!
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:45.040]   Do it!
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:49.200]   But they still go out and spend a hundred, 70 bucks.
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.960]   Oh, there's Micah telling.
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:53.760]   He ended up leaving Hoobs for Humbrich UI.
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:54.880]   He prefers the Humbrich UI.
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:57.040]   But he is happy to hear us talk about Hoobs.
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:59.520]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:01.440]   Okay, there you go, Micah.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:06.560]   Hoobs in a box, it's at HoobsHOOBS.org.
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:07.600]   Thank you, Hilaria.
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.680]   And now...
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:13.760]   I don't know why I'm calling you Hilaria.
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:14.160]   Why?
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:15.120]   Actually, I do know why.
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:15.120]   Why?
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:16.080]   I know exactly why.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:16.640]   If we...
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:18.080]   Because she attempted Spanish.
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:18.640]   We were...
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:19.120]   Spanish.
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:20.320]   You attempted Spanish.
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:24.000]   Hilaria or Hillary Baldwin actually speaks Spanish.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:24.560]   Yes.
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:25.040]   So, you know...
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:25.680]   There's the difference.
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:26.880]   It's a little different, but yes.
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.960]   But she's not actually from Spain,
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:30.800]   which kind of confused everybody.
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:34.480]   But you know what?
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:35.600]   I'm not going to dog on people.
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:36.640]   No, I'm not either.
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:38.960]   That's a perfect example of a story that wouldn't exist,
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:40.800]   except this is the last week of the year,
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:42.400]   and there's nothing else to talk about.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:43.360]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:46.000]   Jeff Jarvis, number of the week.
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:52.480]   So, everybody thought that Silicon Valley was moving to Austin.
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:54.480]   Not so, says the big technology.
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:55.120]   Just Elon.
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:55.680]   Just Elon.
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:56.320]   That's not the news letter.
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:57.600]   Where are they moving?
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:00.560]   So, the places that have...
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:03.040]   Madison, Wisconsin, Richmond, Virginia,
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:05.200]   Sacto, Sacramento, California.
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:06.160]   Oh.
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:07.360]   They'll be back.
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.040]   Now, Austin, in the numbers,
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:10.640]   they did an analysis of LinkedIn,
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:12.800]   and they said that...
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:18.080]   Madison, for example, was gaining 1.2
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:20.640]   tech workers for each one left last year.
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:23.680]   Now, it's up to 1.77, a 74% jump.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:28.400]   Now, meanwhile, Austin still net ahead.
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:31.840]   They were gaining 2.6 tech workers for everyone in life.
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:33.120]   People from San Francisco.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:36.000]   Oh, this is just broad.
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:36.640]   Okay.
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:38.720]   So, people are leaving San Francisco and New York.
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:43.040]   So, biggest gains in inflow outflow ratio.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.440]   Madison, 74% Cleveland, Sacramento,
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:49.760]   Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Hartford.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:51.280]   It sounds like they're...
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:52.640]   With that's a ratio, Jeff.
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:54.400]   That's not like a total numbers.
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:54.960]   No.
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:55.600]   That's a little bit.
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:56.400]   That's like percentages versus...
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:57.200]   Where's the trending?
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:57.760]   Where's the growth?
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:58.320]   It's trending.
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:00.560]   But it has to do with home pricing, obviously.
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:01.120]   Right?
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:01.680]   That's what I'm gonna say.
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:02.720]   It's a lot cheaper.
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:03.200]   It's also freedom.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.400]   I don't know where the sky is going.
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:04.880]   Yeah.
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:05.680]   Yeah.
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:06.560]   Madison's nice.
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:07.920]   It's cold.
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:09.280]   They're sorry they went out.
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:13.440]   San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, I'm sorry to say,
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:15.440]   Boston, Chicago, and Cincinnati.
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:18.720]   It's so sad because the people who ruined San Francisco
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:20.960]   are precisely the people who are now leaving
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:22.640]   because San Francisco has been ruined.
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:23.120]   Yes.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:23.760]   Ha!
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:24.240]   Yes.
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:26.080]   It drives me nuts.
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:27.040]   Because that is a...
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.360]   I loved living in San Francisco.
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:32.080]   We moved here in the early '90s.
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:34.480]   But it used to be this charming...
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:36.320]   You lived there too, Jeff.
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:37.840]   Wonderful city by the way.
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:38.960]   Yeah, but you know what?
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:41.360]   So I left, I came into New York and I said,
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:43.040]   "What the f did you just do you idiot?
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:45.040]   You left the easiest, nicest place on earth."
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:45.920]   "Wow."
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:47.040]   I tried to go back.
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:47.520]   I didn't.
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:49.280]   And then I realized my home was in New York.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:49.680]   And then you know what?
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:52.320]   San Francisco came to feel very small to me.
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:53.520]   It is very small.
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:55.600]   It's a sleepy fishing village.
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:56.640]   People think it's a city.
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:59.360]   It's 400,000 people in seven square miles.
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:00.400]   Seven by seven miles.
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:02.720]   It's not a big city at all.
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:04.000]   It's charming.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.520]   It has some wonderful restaurants.
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:07.520]   I love it.
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.040]   But it's been ruined.
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:12.160]   And I just hope that all these people leave
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:14.640]   and they fix it because...
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:16.960]   Your huge hands, I've been able to see San Francisco.
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:20.000]   It's nice, but I haven't been able to see it much since I've been here.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.120]   Oh, that's right.
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:22.800]   You shouldn't go right now.
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:24.800]   It's not a good place.
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:25.600]   Needle Park.
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:26.800]   It's not nice.
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:28.160]   I'm sad to say.
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:32.800]   It was a lovely, wonderful place.
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:33.680]   I love living there.
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:34.320]   I loved it.
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:35.120]   I loved working there.
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:37.440]   But it was the right time in life to...
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:39.680]   I was 23 years old when I left.
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:40.720]   You were that young?
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:42.160]   I like San Francisco.
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:43.520]   Well, no, I was a little over at the net.
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:46.000]   So I arrived there at age 22.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.400]   When you were ready for the examiner, you were in your 20s?
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:49.600]   I was 23.
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:50.400]   You were your kid.
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:51.920]   Wow.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:53.040]   I was definitely a kid.
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:54.720]   That was a lot richer.
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:55.280]   That was a lot richer.
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:57.120]   And still cranky.
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:00.400]   He was a cranky kid.
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:01.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:02.080]   Yeah, it was.
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:06.160]   But my hair wasn't white there.
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:07.360]   A cranky kid.
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:08.320]   Aunt, what's your thing?
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:13.360]   My thing is called Canvas.
[01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:18.880]   And what this is, is a film on Netflix that I had no idea about.
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:23.840]   It's led by a black creative artist.
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:24.240]   It's short.
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:25.200]   It's a nine minute film.
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:25.840]   It's a short film.
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:27.440]   And it's a nine minute film.
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:29.520]   And I had no idea about this thing.
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:32.880]   When I searched for it on Netflix and pulled it up,
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:36.640]   the algorithm said it was a 67% match for me.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:38.400]   That's why Netflix never showed it to me.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:41.280]   Because I typically don't watch stuff like this.
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:43.600]   But it was rather charming.
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:46.560]   And it's only nine minutes of your time.
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.360]   So go over there, watch it, show it to me.
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:50.080]   It's like an animated shirt.
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:55.440]   This is something that's happening lately on Netflix
[01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:56.640]   that I'm really encouraged by.
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:57.760]   They have a lot of shorts.
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:00.880]   This one was really good.
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:03.200]   It definitely will totally get the heart.
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:06.240]   So go give it nine minutes of your time and give it a nice rate.
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:07.600]   And so these people can get some more.
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:08.560]   And sure, Hank, yeah.
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:09.280]   Yeah, nice.
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:14.720]   Netflix is recommending death to 2020 to me.
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:17.120]   Oh no.
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:19.120]   Yeah, it recommended that one to me too.
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:24.800]   If you watch Canvas, it recommends a film called If Anything Happens,
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:30.000]   I Love You, which is a 12 minute animation of grieving parents after the death of a child.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.200]   Oh no, no, no, no, no.
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:33.200]   Nobody who's a parent can watch that.
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:33.920]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:34.640]   I can't.
[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:35.040]   I can't.
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:37.280]   The only people who watch that kind of thing are people who have no kids.
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:38.720]   Yeah.
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:39.840]   It's too painful.
[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:40.800]   Too painful.
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:42.240]   Yeah, I never never never never.
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.800]   Are you watching Bridgerton?
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:45.680]   Is it good?
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:46.720]   I want to watch Bridgerton.
[01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:47.360]   What do you think?
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:50.160]   I like period dramas.
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:51.680]   I like period dramas.
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:53.840]   Did she like it?
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:58.960]   Queen Pruitt started watching it last night and had to make herself stop.
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:00.320]   I was like, I wanted to watch it too.
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:01.360]   Oh, she was binging it.
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:02.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:02.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:03.840]   So good.
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:04.960]   I might be watching that tonight.
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:05.440]   It's very easy.
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:07.200]   I love period dramas like that.
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:13.760]   By the way, speaking of the royal household, your family picture aunt was just spectacular.
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:14.320]   I loved it.
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:15.360]   It's perfect.
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:16.720]   Thank you.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:18.080]   Where can we see that?
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:19.600]   The dog's expression.
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:24.960]   I think that's a, um, becoming a Christmas norm now.
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:27.280]   Just taking a family picture here.
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:30.960]   Just set up a tripod and we sit down and snap a photo.
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:32.240]   It's somewhere on Twitter.
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:32.880]   I don't know.
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:38.080]   You don't answer T-shirts says nap, nap, but the geeks among us thought it said, "Wap."
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:41.120]   Yes, something else.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:43.920]   It didn't say, "Why are these eggs?"
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:45.680]   So you didn't put it on your Insta?
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:47.200]   No, it's like, like, nicer.
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:51.200]   The mobile, the mobile standard.
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:51.680]   Yeah.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:52.000]   Wap.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:52.400]   Oh man.
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:54.080]   Wow.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:56.320]   Oh, I was, I didn't think geeks.
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:57.360]   I thought, "Oh."
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:58.240]   Oh, I know.
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:00.160]   He doesn't, I, she.
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:00.640]   Jeff?
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:01.280]   Geek.
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:04.320]   Jeff doesn't know about Cardi B as I found it.
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:05.920]   Megan, V.
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:06.800]   Oh.
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:07.280]   Oh.
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:07.680]   Oh.
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:07.680]   Oh.
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:08.800]   I put it in the IRC.
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:09.280]   Oh.
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:09.840]   Oh.
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.120]   Oh, I forgot that.
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:11.600]   Oh.
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:12.640]   Oh.
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:13.120]   Oh.
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:13.200]   Oh.
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:13.840]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:14.160]   Oh.
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:14.800]   Okay.
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:15.840]   Oh.
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:18.960]   Yeah, I was thinking I'm so geeky.
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:21.280]   Oh, it would be so geeky.
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:25.360]   He thought it was a 20-year-old wireless standard instead of--
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:25.440]   Oh.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:27.280]   Because it was a geek who pointed it out.
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:28.720]   All right.
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:29.280]   No one.
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:31.280]   He was just testing you, I think.
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:34.320]   And it's like, please do not talk about my family photo this way, y'all.
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:35.440]   Although, no.
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:35.920]   No.
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:36.880]   Please don't.
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:38.800]   Why do you have Wap on your t-shirt?
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:39.440]   I don't know.
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:40.160]   No, it's not.
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:43.680]   That is adorable.
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:44.640]   Do you mind if I show that?
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:45.920]   I guess that is on Twitter, right?
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:47.840]   It's on Twitter, right?
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:50.080]   And I just put it in the chat room, so we're going.
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:50.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:52.000]   Yeah, I go on Twitter.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:52.960]   That's why I figured it was OK.
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:53.120]   That's the girl.
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:53.680]   They are it.
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:55.920]   I love the dogs.
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:56.480]   It's hard here.
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:57.680]   It's Queen Prudence.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:59.520]   Kylo and Biscuit.
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:00.480]   I love your family.
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:02.160]   Kylo's expression is just the best.
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:04.800]   I haven't met Biscuit yet, but I love your family.
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:07.440]   Yeah, we've only had Biscuit about a month now.
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:11.920]   Because we had to put our other dog down a couple months ago,
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:12.880]   so we got a new dog.
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:12.880]   Oh, hi.
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:14.320]   What a cute little Biscuit.
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:15.360]   How long is Biscuit getting along?
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:17.280]   Oh, it's perfect.
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:17.920]   How are they getting along?
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:19.280]   They play all the time.
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:19.680]   You know what?
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:21.680]   Your boys have the nicest smiles.
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:23.200]   They look very--
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:24.880]   There, it just looks so sweet.
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:26.240]   Is that me?
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:28.000]   Everyone in that family has a nice smile.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.120]   Good jeans is right.
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:30.960]   Good jeans.
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:33.440]   They're all photogenic.
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:34.880]   Like, can you take a picture of my family?
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:36.000]   I look weird.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.120]   My husband looks fine.
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:39.040]   My daughter looks either weird or fine,
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:41.760]   depending on if she's channeling me or my husband that day.
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:42.960]   She got 50/50.
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:43.680]   Not good.
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:45.520]   All right, we're going to let Stacy go
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:48.160]   because she has her Spanish touch in the get-to.
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:50.560]   She's got a turn on the heat.
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:54.080]   She was trying to look like Bob Cratchit.
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:57.360]   And no more coal on the fire, Hagan Batham.
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:02.560]   I just added the gloves.
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:02.960]   Come on here.
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:04.960]   Merry Christmas to us all.
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:08.560]   What are you doing for New Year's Eve, Stacy?
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:10.480]   I don't have--
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:12.080]   I'm trying to think of something.
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:14.480]   Learn to TikTok dance if I can convince my family.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:15.680]   Get your family to do that.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:16.400]   Come on now.
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:18.320]   I mean, y'all won't know.
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:20.160]   But wait, didn't Jeff have a number or something?
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:21.360]   Yeah, he did.
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:21.920]   I did it.
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:23.440]   People leave me--
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:23.840]   He did it.
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:25.360]   Oh, right.
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:26.000]   People leave me in the--
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:26.400]   Oh, right.
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:26.800]   So it was a--
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:26.800]   So it was a--
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:27.360]   So it was a--
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:27.360]   So it was a--
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:27.840]   So it was a--
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:28.960]   I have more, Stacy.
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:29.600]   If you want more--
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:29.840]   No, no, no.
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:30.320]   No, no.
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:30.640]   We should go--
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:31.120]   No, we're good.
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:31.600]   No, we're good.
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:35.440]   Stacy, on Amazon's 1.5 billion packages.
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:37.280]   I can do more in the third person effect.
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:39.840]   We got lots of numbers, Stacy.
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:40.240]   Numbers?
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:41.440]   I got an office.
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:42.560]   I got all your numbers.
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:46.720]   Stacy on IoT is her website, her podcast,
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:48.560]   the IoT podcast with Kevin Tofel.
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:49.520]   You could find it there.
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:53.680]   Her newsletter is free for reasons no one understands.
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:55.680]   But here's the thing.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:56.720]   I get paid.
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:58.400]   She gets paid because--
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:02.080]   She's got a deal.
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:03.840]   She's living on tribal lands,
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:05.840]   or I don't know what it is, or something.
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:06.400]   Something--
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:07.120]   We have deep--
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:11.040]   I don't know where that came from.
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:11.680]   What?
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:12.480]   Oh, man.
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:14.240]   If people got to watch the video.
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:14.480]   OK.
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:16.240]   OK.
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:18.960]   So I'm going to do my exit talk.
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:21.200]   Stacy, Hagenbotham.
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:22.400]   So glad to have been here.
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:24.960]   You can check it at StacyOnIOT.com,
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:26.400]   the Internet of Things podcast,
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:28.080]   or you can subscribe to my newsletter,
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:29.680]   which is free.
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:30.720]   Didn't I just say no?
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:32.240]   Yeah.
[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:34.480]   Without any weird editorializing.
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:35.520]   I didn't even editorial it.
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:35.840]   What about hand?
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:39.760]   And, Brody, he's the host of Hands On Photography.
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:41.600]   Twit.tv/hop.
[01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:44.000]   He is a gentleman and a scholar,
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.720]   and a just darn fine person to have around.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:47.760]   It's nice to see you.
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:48.800]   You have my moments.
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:50.160]   He has his moments.
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:51.360]   He's just too sweet.
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:52.240]   That's the problem.
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:56.640]   And, of course, this grumpy guy in my--
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:58:58.800]   I have a letter to help Professor of Journalism Innovation
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:00.080]   and Director of the Town and Night Center
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:02.000]   for Automotive Journalism at the Craig Knock
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.240]   Newmark Graduate School of Journalism
[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:05.680]   at the City University of New York.
[01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:07.280]   And he's at buzzmachine.com
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:09.120]   and at Jeff Jarvis.
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:12.320]   And Simon Orshuster, if you're listening.
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:13.120]   He's got a book.
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:16.000]   Either Simon Orshuster.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.120]   I like Simon and Garfucker myself,
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:20.800]   but I don't think they put books out.
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:22.480]   You know, so I tried to mention--
[01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:24.720]   I tried to do a discussion with somebody at the school
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:27.200]   this week, and something complicated was going on.
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:28.080]   I said, "You know, it's a big circle.
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:28.960]   It's a great Mandela."
[01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:34.400]   Does that mean anything to use these here, Rant?
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:34.880]   Anything?
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:36.960]   A mandala?
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:38.240]   He meant mandala.
[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:41.360]   Mandela's the former leader of South Africa.
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:42.560]   Yeah, I was like, "Yeah."
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:45.360]   Do you know the song?
[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:47.600]   It's a great mandala.
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:48.640]   I don't know the song.
[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:50.240]   No, it doesn't mean anything to me.
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:51.600]   And I love Simon and Garfucker.
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:54.160]   No, I don't know the song.
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:55.120]   It's the same era.
[01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:56.800]   I'm old-ish, not old.
[01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:00.480]   It's our friend Peter Yarrow, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:03.840]   And I hope you're all riding the great--
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:06.720]   I actually heard the great mandala one day when I walked out.
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:07.280]   Mandela.
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:08.480]   I'll be Grossman's office.
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:12.400]   He said mandala.
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:14.320]   That's Richie Havens.
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:16.080]   He can say whatever he wants.
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:22.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have just completed the last this week in Google of 2020.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.520]   Finally!
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:26.720]   Thank you.
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:27.280]   Thank you.
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:28.880]   You know why we should have one of those little--
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:36.240]   We will be back on January 6th, 2021.
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:39.200]   With an all-new year and an all-new show.
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:40.800]   We do the show.
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:42.800]   The show thinks it's going to be as bad as 2020,
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.880]   because Leo is in that mood.
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:46.560]   I think it's going to be the best.
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:48.080]   Oh, good.
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:49.840]   Best year ever.
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:50.960]   Sibley the best.
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:53.600]   Oh, biscuit!
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:54.160]   Biscuit!
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:54.560]   There's that.
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:55.120]   Biscuit!
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:56.800]   Oh, look, you little bitch.
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:00:59.280]   Is he full grown or is biscuit going to get bigger?
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:03.040]   No, he's going to grow a little bit more.
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:03.680]   Not much though.
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:04.560]   Oh, he's the jacket.
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:05.040]   Great.
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:06.800]   Look at his patchy eye.
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:07.840]   Oh, he's so cute.
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:08.240]   Yeah.
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:10.400]   Oh, god, I want a biscuit right now.
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:10.800]   Oh.
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:11.360]   Badly.
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:16.240]   If I were you, I would get another dog named butter.
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:19.280]   No, biscuit's in gravy.
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:20.160]   We're honey.
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:20.960]   How about honey?
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:23.760]   If I were you.
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:25.040]   Maybe you'd be the next one.
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:27.040]   Thank you, aunt.
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:28.080]   Fellow Southerner here.
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:29.280]   Maybe you'd be the next one.
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:34.160]   We will be back next Wednesday, 2 p.m. Pacific 5 p.m.
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:36.480]   Eastern 2200 UTC.
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:37.920]   You can watch us do it live.
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:40.080]   As with all our shows, we stream a live stream
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:44.720]   behind the scenes production at twit.tv/liveaudio and videos there.
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:46.640]   Chat with us if you're doing it live.
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:48.800]   I-R-C.twit.tv.
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:53.680]   After the fact, our forums are at www.twit.community.
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:55.200]   And it's a great place to hang there.
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:57.360]   Oh, look at that.
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:01:59.760]   I haven't seen that in a long time.
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:01.600]   It's beautiful.
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:02.640]   We also have a-
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:04.080]   As you were just in there yesterday.
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:05.520]   I know I go in there every day.
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:06.000]   I have to.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:11.040]   We have a YouTube channel devoted entirely to this show.
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:13.520]   And all of our shows each show has its own channel.
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:17.680]   You can also get the latest episode at our website, twit.tv/twig.
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:20.880]   But the best thing to do would be find yourself a wonderful.
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:23.920]   That's my page.
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:26.080]   That's the great mandala.
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:28.240]   I didn't know Richie Havens wrote it though.
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:29.920]   That's what's cool about that.
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:30.960]   What he did?
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:31.280]   Yeah.
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:32.640]   He wrote it.
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:34.080]   That was the greatest Richie Havens fan.
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:36.800]   I-I huge just torturing me into the show already.
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:38.800]   And uh...
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:41.600]   It's the Wheel of Life, baby.
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:45.120]   You know, my- one of my highlights of my radio show.
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:46.320]   Oh, Richie Havens.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:47.760]   Now, highlights of my radio show.
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:50.640]   Richie Havens came in, sat right across me,
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:52.400]   played all along the watchtower.
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:54.560]   And on his guitar.
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:56.480]   And he really ripped into it.
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:57.520]   It was the greatest moment.
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:02:58.960]   One of the greatest moments.
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:02:59.600]   Uh...
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:02.000]   And take his fake- his- his false teeth out.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.120]   Because he got irritated with them.
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:04.080]   He would throw them into the-
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:05.120]   Geez, I don't remember that.
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:06.400]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:07.200]   Real talent.
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:08.400]   Really, really, really talented.
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:09.200]   Oh, oh, really.
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:09.840]   Thanks, everybody.
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:10.640]   Stacy, go ahead.
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:12.160]   Have a great New Year's.
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:13.440]   Have a- you're gonna do, I think,
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:14.720]   fun ant for New Year's Eve.
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:16.720]   Maybe have-
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:17.280]   I have a ball.
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:18.560]   Yeah, watch football, of course.
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:20.480]   That's about all I do.
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:21.600]   New Year's Day's about football.
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:23.360]   Yeah, have scotch.
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:25.440]   I told Lisa when we- if we retire,
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:27.840]   we're moving to a college town with a good football team.
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:29.280]   And we're just-
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:30.640]   Oh, you're moving to Austin.
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:31.040]   Oh, no.
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:33.440]   Not a good football team.
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:35.440]   Who's- who's- not right now, anyway.
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:36.880]   I know you'd say Clemson,
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:38.080]   but seriously,
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:41.200]   there's a lot of places with good college football teams,
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:42.080]   but not one that's so-
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:42.640]   Yeah, there's a lot.
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:44.480]   Clemson you probably can't get tickets to.
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:46.080]   So it has to be something a little smaller than that.
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:48.000]   Well, I can sell with you.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:48.640]   No, you can.
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:49.360]   I can sell with you.
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:49.760]   You can.
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:51.040]   You- you're Leo LaPorre.
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:52.480]   They'll- they'll give you some tickets.
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:53.440]   People like you.
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:54.000]   No.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.440]   [laughter]
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:56.720]   Thanks, everybody.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:57.920]   Happy New Year, Jeff.
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:03:59.120]   Have a wonderful-
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:00.080]   Happy New Year.
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:01.520]   Evening tomorrow.
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:02.800]   Stay safe, everybody.
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:03.840]   Wear your masks.
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:05.520]   We're not out of this yet,
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:07.440]   but the light is at the end of the tunnel.
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:08.800]   Stay, stay, stay healthy.
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:11.520]   We'll see you next year on This Week in Google.
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:12.480]   Bye-bye.
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:26.720]   [music]
