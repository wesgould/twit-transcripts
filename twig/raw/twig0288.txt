[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.840]   I

[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:48.080]   I was actually I want to circle back to you about television criticism because that's the other thing Jeff's very famous for
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.160]   many years of TV critic founder of
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.040]   Entertainment with a weekly
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.520]   And I was just thinking the other day about you
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.680]   While I was critiquing a TV show I was thinking about criticism in general
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.120]   But we'll get to that in a moment because we have more important business first
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.480]   We have to introduce a new guest on this weekend
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.480]   Lindy Johnson
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.280]   Hello, Lynn welcome
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.920]   Lynn comes highly recommended a friend of Gina, Japan. He's she is a
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.920]   Content and community consultant developing content and community strategies for brands, but she's also worked at Fast Company
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.640]   vibes bin
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.080]   Vibe Vixen Wow
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.760]   Are you she is a vibe Vixen ladies and gentlemen, we're so glad to have her
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.520]   Yes, I was a bad
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.160]   They don't even want to ask what that was
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:50.680]   It's okay. What was it a magazine? Yeah, it was it was a magazine and an online component as well. Oh, okay
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.200]   Linden would ride aimed at women or
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.040]   So vibe magazine is a pop culture
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.840]   Multi-cultural oh, but Vixen was aimed at women. It's the new style of sexy
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.560]   Basically there you go. Oh, you found it. Oh, honey. We find everything fast here
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.900]   We are fast kittens on the keyboard ladies and gentlemen
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.920]   I
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.920]   warned Lynn not to go in the chat room because
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.100]   Well, just because it's distracting, but uh
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.480]   She's in there. So if you want it, what is your what is your chat handle?
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.400]   I didn't even pick one yet because I thought I was I was trying to do it on
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.040]   Yeah, I didn't yeah, I have to get a client right now. Yeah, I'll do that you know
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   We'd love it if you do you don't have to do it right now
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.160]   Right now might not be the right time
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.240]   So speaking of right time timing is everything if you're selling shares of your company
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.680]   Larry Page's Sergei Brin have decided to according to a filing with the SEC
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.640]   sell off some shares
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.000]   Sets nice as of January 30th of this year
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.040]   They had a total of 44.6 million shares of class B and 44.6 million shares of class
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.520]   C stock they're gonna sell two million each of the class B common stock and
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.120]   Of course only Google founders and Googlers can have class B
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.520]   So it'll convert to class A upon sale and then another two million shares each of the non voting class C
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.920]   Which I presume will also convert for a total of
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.280]   Ching 4.4 billion dollars
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.360]   Wow
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.760]   But you're only selling 10% of their holding right?
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.600]   I mean, there's still in there still the major controllers of the company. It doesn't you know, it's yeah
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.280]   Well, they'll own 11.9 percent, but they have 52 percent of the voting power
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.360]   They really when Google went public this was considered at the time
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.360]   They did some really interesting things when they went public
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.800]   Including that was a Dutch auction they did but they also made sure that they kept a lot of the voting power so well in the split
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.240]   Aimed even more controls. I remember right. Yes, that's right. They converted some shares
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.100]   So 52 percent of the voting power now nobody's gonna change the plans at Google anytime
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.280]   Soon
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.240]   Class B shares mostly owned by Bryn page and Eric Schmidt have 10 times the voting power
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.600]   I like this picture. This is from business insider
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.200]   That's Larry
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.960]   That's 2006. They're a little older than that greater. Yeah
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.520]   Yeah, then that picture but I
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:30.080]   Don't think there's anything wrong with that and I don't think anybody in the mark, you know stockholders should worry that they're selling it
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.520]   You know
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.760]   It's 10% cash in a little stock. I wish I could cash in 4.4 billion dollars with something
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.360]   I wonder what that leads to these two things like philanthropy and estate planning and
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.240]   Probably buy another plane or something, you know
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.480]   Investing gets to be a point that we have so much money that you don't even really
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.920]   It's absurd. It's a different. It's got to be a different world where you don't even have to I mean
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.680]   I don't I can't even imagine
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.440]   It's just a different world
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.800]   There is a burden though, and I don't know how how philanthropic is are they and how philanthropic is Google?
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   Here's a point where it gets to be so
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:15.840]   Google does a lot do they yeah, yeah Google or don't forget they they pledged
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.400]   portion of equity portion of revenue, you know
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.640]   Benny office the leader of that in so in San Francisco of pushing companies to write pledge
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:31.680]   Portions of revenue and portions portions of revenue portions of equity and portions of employee time each year Google.org
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.240]   Donates a hundred million dollars in grants a
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.800]   Billion dollars in products and 80,000 hours in Googler time. That's pretty good
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.680]   Yeah, yeah, but to Larry and Sergey have their own is there a you know a page foundation or a
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:53.800]   I think one of them does related to health stuff. That's right. I think it's Larry. That would be Larry right stuff
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   He'll ever fix up. Yeah
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.400]   You know the other thing is
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.000]   There's nothing to say that they have to be public about it right and and you don't know what they give
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.840]   In fact, I think that's the way to do it the left hand should not know what the right hand is
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.840]   You know, but I was thinking about that
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:14.320]   I was gonna I was almost gonna call into the stern show for some reason I forgot what the peg was and ask Howard because
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.360]   He's very public about his wife's charity, which is the Long Island
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:26.720]   Animal shelter that she's building for cage free cats. So so he does stuff. He does a calendar
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.360]   He takes the photos so and so forth. You know that he does other flanth where he mentions it very discreetly good
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.040]   But doesn't talk about it, but you know, I was but I was wondering about this and I wanted to ask him
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.320]   And I guess I understand why it's a matter of humility
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:47.400]   But it also is an opportunity to promote a cause or charity that you care about and by not saying I give to blank
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:53.000]   Then you give up that opportunity. I understand where you don't both from from, you know
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.240]   Let's not trumpet my charity says rich person and also because once I mention one charity. They're all gonna come running
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:06.320]   Like universities like this one. Well, you'd also want to be a role model, right? Yeah, I think so
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:14.160]   Right, but I think part of why you don't disclose is because it could look like you give preference to certain groups over others
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.400]   Yeah, yeah, wouldn't it wouldn't the right kind of disclosure be something like I give 10% of all my
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.240]   income to charity
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.240]   period and
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:30.440]   then you know choose the charity of your choice and but but do I mean it this all comes from this
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.440]   Perception, I don't know if it's real anymore
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:38.680]   But for a long time there's this perception that Silicon Valley was minting millionaires, but they were not very
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:44.280]   Progressive in their charitable contributions. I don't know if that's still the case
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.720]   Yeah, I don't know I don't know either
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:55.000]   But if you're if you're a millionaire and you have a really good accountant and account is gonna advise you yeah, that's a good point
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   You know to do that, you know?
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.840]   actually it actually I should be because I have an accountant and
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:08.480]   And the truth is that they keep the federal government keeps raising the threshold
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:16.720]   Of your AGI for what you could deduct and so and in fact they are not incentive giving as much as they should
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.120]   They're disincenting it all the time. I can't remember what the threshold is now
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.840]   But I think it's over it was 4% I think it's gone up
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:31.320]   And that's wrong that means that you have to give more than 4% of your income before you could start deducting it that first 4% is
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.040]   Tax on you. Yeah
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:40.720]   Just the same thing they do with medical expenses, and I that doesn't seem like the right way to promote philanthropy
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.480]   What we I don't know if I should talk about this
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:51.720]   It turns out that you can deduct from from dollar one if you do something called community development
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.120]   so when we and we give Twit gives a lot a lot of my charities low all my charity almost is local and
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.680]   That's one of the reasons because then you can deduct it
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.000]   From zero from dollar one if it's called community development as opposed to charity
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.600]   Anyway, there's ways in ways. That's why you have an account. I have two major charities Tufts University and the next one and
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:20.680]   The next one oh my daughters my daughter. Oh the next university. Yeah, tell me about that
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.160]   Yeah, tell me that I have two kids in college. That's a charity
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.640]   Yeah, they're both nonprofits
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.880]   Yeah
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.920]   Hey, hey
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:39.080]   Yeah, no kids Lynn. Yeah kids not in college yet not in college the teenagers yet
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.920]   one teenager one toddler oh my oh
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:49.240]   My that's what that's why we lost Gina she had a toddler yeah, and a startup. I
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.720]   Don't know which is more which is a toddler
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.600]   Challenging exactly Google was getting it got a little heat
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:02.040]   Because it revealed flaws and OS 10 two flaws and OS 10 one flaw in Windows
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.200]   Before the companies had a chance to patch it Google said hey
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.520]   We give you 90 days if you don't patch it 90 days on day 91
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:16.360]   We're gonna reveal it to the world to put some pressure on you this really irritated Microsoft
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:24.040]   Uh Microsoft said we asked for a little more time because it was off off our normal patch cycle and Google said no
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.640]   Uh in fact then reveal three more bugs
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:34.280]   Google now says well, okay, maybe we were a little harsh. I feel like they're still pretty harsh because now they're saying
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.520]   Okay, we'll give you a 14 day grace period. So if we go to you the 90 day expert
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.480]   So what happens with it says Google has a large team
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.120]   looking for
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:51.240]   Exploits vulnerabilities in operating system software and other software when they find something they call the company Microsoft in this case
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.560]   And say hey fix it and in 90 days we're gonna reveal it
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.200]   Um
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:04.280]   If a 90 day Google now says if a 90 day deadline will expire but a vendor lets us know before the deadline a patch is scheduled
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.480]   on a specific day within 14 days
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.840]   Then we'll delay public disclosure
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   Fair and we're gonna only count
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.600]   This is a weird one. We will not reveal a vulnerability on weekends or us public holidays
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:25.160]   Oh that yeah, I don't know, you know, it's Ramadan. I guess they don't care. I don't understand why it's us public. But anyway
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.640]   um
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.640]   I think there are being a
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:36.440]   I have mixed feelings about that we talked about this yesterday on security now on the one hand
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:41.000]   I understand that if you don't have any pressure on these companies to fix these flaws
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.680]   um
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.680]   The company sometimes put it off
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.040]   And then hackers find the flaws and now you've got a real problem
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:54.280]   On the other hand, this is google kind of acting like oh, well, we care about your users, but obviously you don't
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.200]   Well, but if you if if you wait
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.680]   104 days to fix the vulnerability that affects users then isn't that true?
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:08.360]   Well, maybe there's good reasons maybe there maybe it's hard to make the patch or there's side effects or
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.840]   Uh, I mean, there's there can be a lot of legitimate reasons for holding on to a patch
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:18.440]   I think implying that microsfter apple don't care about security flaws is a little arrogant
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.200]   What google arrogant
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.240]   I mean, why does google even have this power to do to do this in the first place? That's that's kind of
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.040]   Might be with it. They've assumed it. Nobody gave them the right. They just decided
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.720]   I for one have no problem by new masters
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.440]   Good. This is not google does this all the time and this is another issue that we've talked about on securing out with steve
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.720]   and it's kind of a
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.440]   Uh in the weeds, but it has to do with certificate signing
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:54.200]   Uh most uh ssl certificates, you know for secure browsing are signed with a an encryption technique that is
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.720]   Can is secure has not been cracked has not been broken
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.720]   But as computers get more and more powerful
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.360]   One can predict that at some point
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:11.640]   In a year five years ten years, but at some point computers will be powerful enough to crack this hash there is a stronger
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.440]   encryption technique available
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.200]   You can get certificate signed with this google has decided that
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:25.400]   Any day now, I think they're going to start warning people in chrome if this older technique is used for the signing
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.120]   It's not that it's insecure. They they want to thrust people forward
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.440]   Into a new way of signing certificates and this can cost a lot of money
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:41.800]   It can also uh take a lot of time and if you are issuer of these certificates, it could be a significant
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.760]   um
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.760]   burden
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:52.360]   So and google by the way, um doesn't have to worry about they they use the old hash, but they don't worry about it because they
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.440]   Expire their certificates
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.760]   Every three months. It's kind of a complicated subject, but it's another case. I think of google
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.880]   It's like the united states foreign policy
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.520]   You know
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.920]   uh the old white man's burden well
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.000]   We know better. We got to make sure that everybody in the internet is protected from
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.960]   People like apple and microsoft. They're just too dumb
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.840]   to protect people
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.800]   I don't think this is google. I think this is google needs to be a little bit more collegial on this. That's just my
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:31.320]   I I I agree with that. I mean, I don't I don't feel like they're partnering with people they're you know, partnering with apple and microsoft
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.320]   It's it's kind of being um
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.040]   You know police, right? Uh
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.120]   Yeah, it's it's it's kind of
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.120]   I don't know. I kind of see it as like, you know when when people call google sky net
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.760]   This is another example of that, right? What is it? But it's protecting
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.120]   Users in the end, but it's but it's but it's it's on its own term
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:56.360]   So for instance microsoft has agreed that they're going to retire these shaw one certificates
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.800]   And start warning people in internet explorer, but in 18 months
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.520]   uh
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.960]   and uh
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.960]   google has decided no, that's not soon enough
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.840]   We're going to move along bershenire has done some calculations and says it
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.200]   uh
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.480]   bershenire the security guru and my personal savior
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.480]   Uh says that based on the cost of amazon computing
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.560]   a collision attacked well with that isn't using uh
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:29.880]   A brute force collision attack is well within the range of an organized crime certificate could practically budget by
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.880]   2018
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.360]   And a university research project by 2021
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.400]   So
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.640]   Yes, we need to move from shaw one to shot two
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.840]   But do we need to do it tomorrow?
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.240]   And google says well, it's dangerously weak, but it's not that there's a problem
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:47.880]   So
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.480]   If you use chrome you're going to start seeing these warnings and this is what's interesting
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.080]   Um
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.160]   You see this third warning so the first warning is just a yellow triangle
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.640]   Over the htps say maybe you know
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.800]   Watch out man, but but in if if soon
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.880]   Uh in six months you're going to get a x over the padlock
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.760]   The htps will be red and struck out
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:18.200]   Not because the site is insecure or or the certificates not good, but because it's using a technique that
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.040]   Won't be so good in a couple of years
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.600]   So basically you won't you won't be able to visit the page unless you you'll have to
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.680]   Write it. Well, I don't know it's not clear whether it'll say don't go there
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.400]   Or it'll just give you this weird warning
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:39.560]   But but google feels responsible because google is the search engine that sends you to all these places google feels responsibility
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.200]   But what this screams for I think is a standards body
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:48.120]   Isn't there one to to isn't that there's there a collegial place where you get together and have a really boring meeting talking about this
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:55.640]   You think so I don't know I probably shouldn't be talking we should get steve gibson on if we're going to talk about this because
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.200]   um
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.400]   God I can't imagine anything worse
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.680]   That meeting yeah
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.840]   You know I'm I feel bad because I'm so
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.240]   I can't I can't even go like I was on the city councils
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:16.280]   In petalomas digital advisory board. I couldn't even take that
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.000]   I had a quit after three weeks. It's like
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.200]   You guys are driving me crazy. I just want to do something. No. No. No. I can't do anything
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:31.640]   I was on the auto bureau go ahead. Let no, I was just gonna say those are the kind of meetings where everybody has to vote on everything
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.760]   Yeah
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.760]   And it's wake me up
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.640]   I am not big. I'm not good with process
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:45.240]   Which is too bad because I think this is probably not uncommon support that this really smart technical people who they you need on these kinds of committees
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.160]   Probably in general are not the people who want to sit on a committee
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:54.360]   That's true. I would guess I don't know the worst one I was on was the auto bureau of circulations
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.560]   What's on its the circulation the publications. Yeah, they're
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:05.720]   Task force to decide digital standards. So we had meeting after meeting after meeting asking the earth shattering question
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.520]   What's a page view?
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.080]   Right. What's what's an ad impression? Oh my god. What's it? What's in a mode of con?
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.000]   Shoot me. Oh, well, this is this is way before that. This is stone ages
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.240]   Anyway, this
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:27.080]   Eric mill has written a good blog post to which he says this is at kon klone.com
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:32.520]   This shaw one push should have started years ago any annoyance at google for amping up the pressure should be channeled
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.920]   toward the certificate authorities instead
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.560]   For allowing nothing to happen for so long
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.240]   uh, so
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.800]   I and i'm not technical enough to learn this steve steve has said and he is technical enough to
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.320]   Have an opinion. He said he feels that google is pushing this
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:54.120]   Microsoft said we'll do it with an ad explorer, but they gave everybody a little more time
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.760]   it's the same thing where
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.120]   You say well just more time just means you're gonna put it off so
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.400]   It's like a school teacher
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:09.160]   It's a little school marmi saying if I don't give a deadline for your homework. You're just not gonna do it
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:17.800]   All right, but but google needs to protect its users right from now where from other things
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.440]   All right, so there's no there's no actual threat here
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.640]   I I got you but but so really what you're quibbly
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.040]   I don't think you would argue that google needs to protect users from sudden people to places with malware, right?
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:33.720]   No, in fact, we've had we've had uh that you know malware alert on our site some years ago because we did it
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.720]   I have malware on it and I was grateful to google
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:41.400]   Exactly. So what you're asking for is I think two things one a more reasonable line and two
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.960]   A little sconch of collaboration in discussing where that line is right?
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.280]   If there is no body that does this there really isn't I think
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.560]   Yeah, yeah, so so maybe that's what it is needed
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:59.000]   So microsoft what microsoft should be doing. I think is saying let's let's get a committee right committee solved everything
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.640]   Well in the in the chatroom
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.280]   Web 87 47 says what's crazy to me is that steven leo believe microsoft is right to set the deadline in
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.400]   2017 but google's not right to put it in 2016
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.520]   Yeah, I mean, I guess you're right
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.640]   You say tomato. I say tomato right?
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:23.640]   Yeah, it definitely seems like there should be some standards here. Yeah, maybe that's it without standards
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.040]   It's like anyone's gonna do whatever they want to do whenever they want to do it
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.680]   Well, you know, let me ask you this
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.080]   When a bad exploit happens when something bad happens suddenly like sony
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:40.360]   I presume there is a back channel from all the security guys and all these top companies
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.920]   that that
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.320]   Connect and and compare notes and and see what it matters to them. Oh
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.600]   Well, I think that's what the president's actually
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:55.240]   Trying to get that's true on friday. He spoke to silicon valley
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.600]   Uh saying promoting information sharing
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:05.960]   Um also with government, which is yeah, shoot, but yeah, yeah, he said you got to work more with us
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:12.440]   Um, and there has been some conversation about that as well
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.080]   I
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:20.200]   Just I feel like i'm not probably as technical as I need to be to talk about it. Shaw. Oh, no, I'm not
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.920]   So we'll just
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:29.640]   So did you see that dancing that animated gift for the cat through the that's I could talk about that I can I can talk about that
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.560]   The president did sign
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.480]   He was at Stanford University with cyber executives eric schmitt did not go by the way
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.000]   He was invited but sent somebody from google that knew about technology
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.800]   Uh, uh, that was a slap same thing with the ceos of facebook
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:52.600]   I think it would have a good if mark went but he didn't and he's busy. He's got other stuff to do and mursam. Ired him go either
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:59.560]   Uh, he at the event on friday. He announced he was going to sign an executive order to encourage the sharing of information
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:05.160]   Regarding cyber threats between private sector and the government and uh, he did
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.600]   You order was signed he said the internet or how do you how does an order encourage?
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:20.360]   I think it's probably only affects the government, right? So he's telling I don't know. Okay. He said the internet is like the wild west
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.160]   Yeah, I didn't like that. I I got pissed me off
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.520]   Everybody is online and everybody is vulnerable
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.400]   Yeah, that's that's this is that the the technopanic man
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:38.040]   Not good. He also called cyber attacks one of the greatest threats to national security safety and economic issues
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:45.640]   Business leaders here he's speaking to the assembled silicon valley leaders want their privacy and their children protected
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:50.760]   Just like consumer and privacy advocates here want america to keep leading the world in technology and be safe from attack
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:58.200]   See the the president is walking a very narrow line here because on the one hand he absolutely is encouraging the nsa to gather all that information
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.880]   He's refused to to block the mass collection of uh information
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:07.000]   But on their hand he told kara swisher in an interview at recode, but I want encryption
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.720]   I understand why you want encryption. You should be able to be private
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.080]   He can't have it both ways and maybe you can't can you have it both ways?
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:19.160]   Well, if they can have encryption back doors, which means you can't have encryption. He's never said back doors
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:23.240]   But people in his administration have floated that balloon, right?
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.160]   And the Brits have certainly floated a flotilla of those balloons
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.800]   Cameron has
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:37.000]   Ben de jardin who is the director of security solutions with radware a cyber security firm said the new proposals
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.960]   He's he's quoted in this uh, this article
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.320]   And ben swan calm
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.200]   The new proposals face significant headwinds
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:51.240]   Both legislatively from congress and cooperatively from heverweights in the tech sector
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:56.040]   Many companies and I think this is the case feel burned by the government after the snoweden leaks
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:02.200]   and are very reluctant to uh let the federal government continue what they see as a takeover
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.320]   of uh the internet
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.440]   White house says executive order is only a framework
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.680]   And with it the white house aims to allow private companies access to otherwise
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.400]   classified cyber threat information
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.040]   Well, that's all right. I mean
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.600]   As long as that sharing is in that direction
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:25.960]   Private they're also calling for a voluntary
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.920]   creation of a common set of standards here so
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.160]   um
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:37.000]   Which I think is a good thing, but then the problem with that is they're not really giving the companies any incentives to participate
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.960]   Um, and companies feel burned already by uh all of these, you know, the national security letters
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:46.760]   They're getting and they feel like uh, nobody outside of the united states is going to buy
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:53.640]   Cisco products or microsoft products or apple products or facebook or google because they don't they think that they're all
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.320]   Tools of the us government, right?
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:02.200]   There's another one. I don't I think we should just move on I guess
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.440]   Just depressed

[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:21.000]   Oh, yeah, a lot of universities use linda and it puzzles me because
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.760]   I guess it's just an adjunct to learning you can learning your own speed and stuff, right? Yeah, exactly
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:31.880]   Yeah, and specific tools and needs and yeah, oh, yeah. Oh, it's great. I got to do they have lots of programming courses. I'm really
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:38.600]   I really want to write this android app. I just I'm a little bit stuck and I think linda will be the place to go
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.920]   Hey, so yeah last week remember we talked and we called up that guy on
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:49.880]   The google help thing. Yeah, tell me we didn't even get fired dogless. No. No, no. No, I haven't heard from him
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:55.240]   So you missed this linda was kind of fun if you go to the play store
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:00.520]   And you go into the devices section and then click help
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.200]   They have this new kind of help. It's a live chat. I won't do it right now
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:09.560]   But you can I'm sorry a video call won't do it right now, but you can do it and you get a guy or gal at google
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:16.680]   Um, they're very googly looking and they have a google set and everything and I thought it must be helpouts. We even asked him remember
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:22.440]   Yeah, yeah, it's just not oh, yeah, I thought it's so amused. Oh, no, that's not helpouts. No, no
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.840]   And then two days later we find out google's killing helpouts whoops
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:35.080]   Um, I'm surprised. I thought this was such a great thing. I guess nobody used it helpouts. Well, it was a firma hangout
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.000]   I did I don't think you googled it a little bit of advertising
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.200]   But I don't think it ever gave it the level of support it needed to launch something new it thinks all word google will come out
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:50.760]   Whether people will run to it. Um, you know, it disappeared from public consciousness and it requires
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:56.360]   Helpers and help ease to make it work and it never got to critical mass because I don't think google
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.080]   I think it was an orphan child
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:05.880]   God it was such a good idea. It was a great idea and remains a great idea and you know, you start something like that and then just dump it
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.360]   It's it's one matter to put on a beta and say what do you think about this? But you launch a product?
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.120]   I think
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:17.960]   A lot of companies including google are too cavalier about killing things that they start the people some people are depending upon
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:23.080]   Well, I mean doesn't really depend on how high the adoption is
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:28.200]   I mean and but with google, I guess that doesn't matter because they had high adoption rates for google reader
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.560]   And they still yeah, we were all heaved about that
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:39.720]   14 is wave wave wave right I mean at the scale google's that high adoption. What does that mean millions, right?
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   Yeah
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:47.480]   If you were to start up and you had hang out or helpouts and you had you know, a hundred thousand people using it. You'd be pretty happy
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.640]   of course
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.640]   and I got to feel bad for the people who
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:57.160]   Like mitchell dillman who's teaching sheet metal art for beginners on a google help out
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:03.480]   He uh and his first help outs free charges five dollars for 15 minute. So this guy's given classes
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:09.720]   And that's that an april come april 20th. That's it. You got to find some other way of doing this because no more
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.600]   sheet metal art breastfeeding or help
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:18.520]   Here's a psychotherapist. I think there were quite a few people there were there were quite a few I think doing a psychotherapy
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.760]   coaching counseling therapy session
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:25.720]   Arizona health care pet wellness information anxiety management
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.000]   a lot of breastfeeding help
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.920]   It ate easily. Oh try it. No latching on. That's the challenge. Yeah
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.000]   um
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   yoga wait this
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.680]   Secondly, I think the number one category is breastfeeding help
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:47.400]   There's a lot of uh sports nutrition. There are a lot of therapy
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.560]   I feel like somebody who is either too shy can't afford
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:59.400]   Psychotherapy, but wants to try it out. This is such a great platform for that. It is. It's pretty realistic
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:04.760]   It's it's basically it's hangouts with money
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.360]   Right
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:12.680]   And and the uses could be amazing. It could be a journalistic help. Yeah. I I was very sad about about this
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:17.400]   cooking. There's a lot of good. I'd forgotten that it existed. Well, that's the problem
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:23.240]   We talked about it. We we were real excited about it. Then when did I ever use it? No, no well because Leo, you know everything
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.800]   You don't need to well. I could have probably learned a few things. JavaScript tutoring
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.920]   Excel spreadsheet customization
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.280]   Um, I bet you henry
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.200]   Could have taken courses in logic pro here for instance. Yeah
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:42.600]   Digital audio recording and editing I mostly just feel bad for the people who
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.200]   Did through through themselves into it and really took the time to do it
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:50.840]   And I bet you people got cameras and mics and you know, spent some energy making this work
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:56.680]   And I think there is a risk if if you kill things too, uh, brushly and uh abruptly because
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.960]   Then people are less likely to adopt the next thing you google yes
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.440]   You know, maybe there be you know, you know
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.880]   Killing reader. I think it was a real
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:14.200]   I understand they're a business and they they can't maintain something they don't make money on
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:19.480]   Damn it now. We have to watch a cat video because i'm just depressed again
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:23.480]   This is worth it Leo's a cat in the snow
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:27.400]   She's opened her door and apparently whoa
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:36.760]   All right for those of you listening you understand the vast majority of people who uh, who consume the show aren't seeing this
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.680]   So i'll describe it
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.160]   Obviously somewhere in probably Syracuse
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:45.880]   She opens her door and then halfway up to the halfway up the door is just a wall of
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:51.240]   Snow she's putting a little dish for her cat to have some food because and the cat just burst through
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:58.120]   Into in the the cat knows how to get in. Uh, excuse me. I uh, there's some snow in the way
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.600]   Uh out of the way snow
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.320]   boom
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.520]   Okay, that's a good cat. That's a good cat. That's a great cat gift
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.920]   gift for jiff
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.000]   So lens is what we do
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.200]   Cat chips. Oh, jiff. No, no, no, no
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.400]   It's gift it's giff
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.360]   You call it whatever you want
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.840]   She's losing the womb
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.000]   All right, we've repeated this enough actually the chat room came up with a bunch of
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.920]   Uh cat gifts gifs. Yeah, of course they did
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:41.160]   Let's see here snow cat attack. Is this the same one? Yeah, this is same one great minds think alike
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.960]   Um
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:50.840]   What else
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.120]   Sparrow
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:58.840]   There's another something that's going away. I really liked sparrow was in at mac and ios app that was a really good email app
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.600]   google bottom
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:05.000]   And uh, we knew I think the end was near uh, they kept it going for a while the folks who
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.080]   Developed, uh sparrow french startup said they would continue to support sparrow
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:15.720]   Uh users and but they weren't making a lot of improvements on it
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:24.680]   Uh, it was too again. I only feel bad for people who bought it was $2.99 on uh, ios. It was $10 on mac
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.960]   Uh, there was a free app sparrow light
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.240]   But it's been incorporated and I think some of this must be in
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:35.000]   The inbox app the google inbox app, which I really like
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.640]   Yeah, I was about to say I mean
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.080]   This uh sparrow sun setting comes as no surprise
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.120]   I mean
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:48.200]   We we all expected once they bought them that they were gonna just you know use their developers to to learn new things
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.800]   Right product designer Jean-Marc deni went to work on inbox
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.160]   Um
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.720]   So I imagine much of that this was an aquire
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.280]   aqua higher
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.640]   Fire
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.200]   And uh, the app is gone, but the people live on
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.360]   Making inbox better doesn't feel like do you use inbox lint?
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.480]   I have used it. Um
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.680]   Well, I just felt like um
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.680]   For me it took a lot of uh
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.880]   Adjustments to get it to work right most people I know feel the same way, but
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:28.440]   I just really liked it and I just feel like they haven't done a lot of new things in it and I'm
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:33.560]   See this is what happens when you kill things that I'm worried now
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.440]   They're gonna kill this you're gonna kill this
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.200]   If they did just just still use gmail, you don't lose you
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:45.720]   Just gmail, right? I just lose you lose a nice addition whereas with with reader and and help out
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:49.000]   That's a good point. You lose the functionality. That's right. All right
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:54.280]   And what will happen with gmail probably is they'll they'll put some of the functionality into gmail, right?
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:59.480]   Well, as jina has pointed out on the show poor jina may weigh breast in peace, you know
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:03.720]   For her she wrote a book on it the poor woman. Oh geez a hell of a lot of the waves
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:08.600]   Thinking is is now elsewhere in google and and has value
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.680]   Right
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:16.200]   And that's the same with I mean I edited a book on google voice
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:21.960]   You know and though voice still exists. It's really part of hangouts now, right?
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.160]   So you know what the dummies guy to google voice was a good book
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:32.520]   That's the one I edited it was a good book and it needed to be written because google voice is one of those really great things that
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:37.800]   Uh, are of I think huge value to normal people but a little intimidating
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.160]   So and google doesn't document stuff very well
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.000]   So that I think that was a book that was well well worth it and anybody who
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.280]   Invested in google voice isn't losing anything. I still use google voice
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:52.680]   Non-stop you just migrate some of the features to hangouts eventually maybe all of it
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:57.240]   No, I don't that's an example of something if they killed voice
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.840]   Uh, I think we would storm the gates of mountain view
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.280]   Unless they put everything in the hangouts
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:09.160]   So what is this obama defends google against euro techno panic
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:14.280]   This must be I detect a jeff charvus's fingerprints all over this there you go
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.680]   Uh in his interview with with recode and by the way, I saw some great tweets
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:24.200]   I said the greatest branding exercise you can imagine is getting the president of the united states in your red chair in the red chair
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.200]   I noticed they did that
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:33.720]   Yeah, uh, he defended google against uh companies in europe that are going after google at all and company
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.760]   because they're competitors yeah and
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:44.440]   And a little defense of american technology. Yeah in defense of google and facebook said the president sometimes the european response
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.080]   Here is more commercially driven
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:52.040]   Than anything else. I don't know if that's fair. I think it's very fair in certain cases
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.600]   The get ready for it folks
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.600]   Leistung Schutrecht
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:03.480]   That's commercial you're right is entirely commercial it's publishers saying protect us but not the right to be forgotten. That's not a commercial
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:09.080]   He I think he made a good point here's the attitude
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:14.360]   the attitude that leads to the right to be forgotten and leads to killing street view in germany
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.040]   and
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.440]   And those have any corporate roots you're saying it's anti-corporate. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:28.360]   He said there are some countries like germany given its history with the stazzy the east german secret police that are very sensitive to these issues
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.320]   That's nice. That's fair
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.680]   But sometimes they're vendors their service providers who can't compete with ours
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.240]   Are essentially trying to set up some roblox for our companies to operate effectively there
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.440]   We have owned the internet said the president
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.960]   Our companies have
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:52.120]   Companies have created it expanded it perfected it in ways they can't compete. This is this is
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.760]   That's red blooded
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.840]   Americana. Yeah, but that's that but the problem is that's that's that's a that's a red not a red chair
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:02.120]   But a red cape in front of europe. We have owned the internet
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.560]   Man and Iran. Yeah, all of those say america's too much to do with the internet
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.600]   Well, yeah, because we did it, but you might not want to put it that way
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:18.520]   When it came to privacy president obama said, I think you own your data. I think I own my data. I think I think oh no
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:23.960]   You own all of our data president. I think we own our health care data. We own our financial data
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:31.400]   Uh, I think this is an area where ironically sometimes I also have tensions with silicon valley folks are quite keen on talking about government intrusion
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:38.200]   But some of the commercial models people have set up are fairly intrusive as well. There's a big difference. We've talked about this before
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.880]   The president has tanks. Google does not
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.480]   Yes
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:50.600]   And you can be arrested by the federal government for the things they think they know about you google's not gonna arrest you
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.440]   The worst they're gonna do is sell your name and you're gonna get diaper commercials
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:43:00.760]   Part of the answer here is people knowing ahead of time what's going on. I agree with them there
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.880]   People knowing how their data is going to be used much greater transparency
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:09.240]   In terms of the potential of it migrating over to some sales and marketing scheme of somebody else's
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.800]   The more trans this is all off the cuff. So I have to respect that he's this off the cuff. This is good
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.040]   It shows an understanding the more transparent we are the more customers can make a choice
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:25.640]   He also said everybody has to learn to code
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.960]   If Gina were here, she'd be going. Yeah, I'm not sure I agree with this
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.920]   Then how much of a coder are you?
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:39.720]   Um, I'm an old school coder. I mean I was coding uh for a trend of punch cards. What?
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.880]   Yeah
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.880]   Wow, you were four
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:50.600]   Uh, oh, jesus. What? I don't want to say how old I yeah, I was or am but um
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.000]   By the light of the fireplace. Jeez
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:59.240]   Ortran punch cards or tran punch cards. Wow. That's that's that's serious. That's
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:06.120]   Pascal unix yeah, the past. Yeah, I can dig unix I can dig but fortran on punch cards
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.400]   Yeah, it sounds like that's that's a long time ago
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.280]   That was just uh
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:17.160]   A particular program that really wanted you to learn it. I see
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:23.960]   Yes, yeah, it's like the photography courses now in high schools where they say you really need to learn how to use
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.320]   Film and a dark room. Yeah, and I want to say you know you don't
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.080]   No, you don't
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:36.040]   You need how to learn how to drive a buggy before you can buy your first car. No, you don't
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:42.280]   I think we can safely leave those technologies behind now. Let me let me ask you a question about this
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.320]   so sunjake is a computer science major and
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.120]   He should learn this
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.200]   Well, what what should you?
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.240]   Learn still and what should you not bother learning anymore in languages? I think that's very hard. Don't you?
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:58.600]   I mean in fact, I'm on the board of our local high school over here
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:04.280]   I'm like school my kids went to and we talk about this a lot and I say you shouldn't teach teach kids microsoft word
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:08.920]   That's stupid. You shouldn't teach people how to use an operating system. That's stupid
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:15.160]   You need to teach your mental lower level understanding of what's going on so that because I can guarantee you when they enter the marketplace
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.720]   It's not going to look that way
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:25.720]   Right. I mean there no you make a good point there because you know when I learned how to use a computer that had any kind of microsoft on it
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:30.040]   I learned DOS commands right so that's really held you in good stead. Hasn't it?
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:35.960]   No, I mean, but I can always do I can always default back to that when I'm troubleshooting a problem on a windows machine
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:40.600]   Yeah, that's true. Well, I still write DOS commands. I learned CPM
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:48.120]   Uh-huh. I'm also I'll also have you know that I'm glad I don't ever have to worry about troubleshooting jack on a microsoft machine
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:53.720]   Yeah, I don't get near them anymore. Well, I mean I use a Mac too, but I have people in my family that use
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.440]   Jeff still knows how to use pip
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:04.680]   That's the cpm copy command intuitively named pip. I could probably pick up my word star
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:11.320]   keyboard commands in about oh, yeah, yeah, okay dot k at or uh command control ks
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.760]   I remember that and the dot do you remember dot commands?
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.400]   Jeff do you remember teletext?
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.440]   Hey, yeah, I do watch it lid watch it
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:25.560]   But I and I agree that we need to have kids learn stem and they need to learn things like
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:30.040]   I think it's better to learn scientific method for instance and what that is then the need
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:33.960]   So his point he says what's true is that our lead little road
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:38.680]   Uh our lead in technology will road if we don't make some good choices now
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:43.800]   We've got to have our kids in math and science couldn't agree more can't just be a handful kids got to be everybody
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:48.760]   This is where I maybe disagree a little bit everybody's got to learn how to code early
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:54.840]   I I maybe I don't disagree in the sense that when you're teaching arithmetic
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:47:00.360]   Uh, maybe you teach some law, you know, Boolean logic. Didn't we do that with turtle graphics and logo?
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:06.920]   You know, uh for years. What does it mean to learn? I mean, I that's the problem. I don't think teaching
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.480]   uh a fourth grader
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.240]   Pearl
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.240]   Or python is going to be very valuable
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.480]   Here's the way I we just hired somebody who's wonderful who's trying to you know
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.600]   update our technology thinking here at our journalism school named
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:24.520]   Joi Yang and and I was talking about this just yesterday with Joi and
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.440]   um
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:29.720]   The way she put it is she wants to demystify coding for
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.200]   journalism students
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:39.400]   And I like that a lot and and my response was each journalism student probably has a different need where this can really pay off
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.000]   For their work and they can say oh the scales fall off their eyes and they see the value of it
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:47.560]   They see how far it can go. We're not going to turn out journalists as coders. That's a minicorn
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.760]   I believe uh, there's a few of them, but but not a big herd
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.680]   um
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:58.760]   But the idea of demystifying technology the main skill you you give and joy also argues this
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:02.200]   Is that you're obviously what you're teaching people is to look it up and learn it
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:07.960]   We had another student in our program who has a company called skill crush to teach particularly women how to code
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.920]   Because her problem was that when she learned to code around men
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.720]   in her view wasn't a
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.560]   welcoming atmosphere
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.560]   uh for what she was doing and
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.160]   um
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:23.240]   You know at the end of the day if she said what happened was every time she'd go to somebody and say uh
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:28.520]   Teach me how to do this the person would end up looking up online you quickly learn that what you do is you look at up online
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:33.160]   And then you teach yourself, right? So what we what you're teaching people is how to teach themselves. I agree
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.160]   That's really what it is
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:39.080]   They still have to answer my question if you were in a cs program now
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.800]   What languages should you still learn?
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.920]   I'm really what language is really old school on this?
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:48.760]   It's too late it's too late for jake because he's already yeah
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:53.000]   He's jake started by writing uh apps for facebook
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.800]   So he's already completely ruined with pia
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:59.640]   And I think it depends on need right like
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.640]   at cs school it depends on the specialty that you're going into
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:09.240]   Right, but but but but you have a curriculum that teaches everybody and you have requirements
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.040]   so
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:16.360]   Again, I'll get off this quickly, but but if you're a graduate of a program and let's say a cs program
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:22.200]   Uh, what should the world expect you to know and what should the world say a fine yakin no bother
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:26.760]   I have a weird point of view on this which i've expressed before but i'll express briefly here
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:32.520]   Uh, and it's no longer ochurant in uh, universities, but in
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.480]   A decade or more ago at mit and duke
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.040]   They uh wrote a really good book that was part of programming
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:42.600]   101 at mit and duke for many years no longer is
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:48.280]   And the theory of it was that it was really programming for everybody including liberal arts majors
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.440]   The theory of it was that instead of learning how to control a computer
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:59.640]   You should learn how to express a problem and solve a problem in a algorithmic way
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.360]   Yeah, I love that love it
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:09.160]   In the same way, you know, people always say why do you teach math? Well, yeah, you need arithmetic, but why why do you need geometry?
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:14.120]   Why do you need to learn broulean logic? Why do you need to learn trig or or calculus because it it's a rigorous
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:19.960]   Pro it's it's almost teaching that i think in a certain kind of way it's a rigorous discipline that helps you
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:25.480]   Develop your mind in ways that will be useful in non mathematical ways and I think this is the same
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:31.160]   Thing so they wrote a pro they wrote a book that is available online for free
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:38.200]   um and and I still recommend it was the uh, no, I can't remember
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.000]   structure and control of computer
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.800]   languages s i's
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:48.200]   S i c p you know what I think i probably have it in my bookmarks here. Let me just look real quickly
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.680]   um
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:54.120]   Yeah, here it is. How to design computer programs
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:58.600]   This is copyright 2001 mit. That's when they were still teaching this
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:05.960]   um, but you can down it's online at h t d p how to design programs.org
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.760]   and uh, it uses lisp
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:14.200]   Actually a variant of lisp called scheme and you could download the doctor scheme interpreter and
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:19.000]   It has a teaching mode and so forth and this is really aimed at
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:25.800]   They say in the introduction, which is great is we really hate when kids learn programming in high school
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:31.720]   Because they they learn everything wrong and now we have to re teach them
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.760]   um
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:42.120]   This isn't about learning computer programming. They say we we believe the study of program designers is the same center role in general education is mathematics
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:45.480]   And english everyone should learn how to design
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:53.000]   Programs it teaches analytical skills like math, but unlike mathematics working with programs is an active approach to learning
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:52:00.920]   I think it's it's also really fun. But um, so they have a really interesting point of view here
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:06.600]   mit is abandoned this as as has duke in favor of a more career oriented
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.760]   curriculum
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.000]   I think there's pressure from students and parents
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.800]   You but wait a minute. You gotta teach me a job skill. I don't want to learn this area. Very philosophy stuff
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:20.760]   I want to know how to write a program and see or c++ or
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:27.400]   C sharp and uh, and so they teach java. They teach c sharp. They teach c++
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.080]   um
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.920]   but really uh
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:35.800]   The best program and you know eric ramen's always said this best programmer has learned lisp first because they learned
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:40.920]   How to express problems in a rigorous fashion and express the algorithm of solution
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:45.720]   Independent of the machine it was it's a mathematical language for so anyway
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:50.440]   If if you ask me tell jake to go to h t dp.org
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.080]   And start reading
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:53:01.400]   Lynn that sounds good. I mean, I think I think it's more about the thinking it's thinking actual
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.880]   Than the actual language. It's the thinking because like jeff the point jeff brought up before
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:11.880]   Because of the background I have I can almost learn any language right very easily right um
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.360]   But one thing that's interesting that I just found
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:16.360]   Google
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:23.000]   New York City schools are going to teach a hundred thousand kids and after school programs google cs first
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.960]   Oh lord, how's that gonna help them in life? Yeah?
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:29.000]   Are they gonna learn go? What are they gonna learn?
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.120]   Oh no cs first cs first
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:37.320]   Will be offered to all kids enrolled in 857 after school programs
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:43.480]   I say I do love the idea of computer literacy. I do love the idea of rigor and learning how to think and learning
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:47.240]   how computers work and I mean we do need this he says they
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.880]   Cara asked if
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:53.960]   President obama had encouraged Sasha Malia his daughters to learn to code
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:54:01.080]   Uh, he said I think they got started a little bit late part of what you want to do is introduce coding with abc's and colors
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:08.200]   He also said I I I think in the right kind of coding. Yes the the way of thinking about stuff. Yes
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.400]   Not actually controlling a computer. I don't know how important that is
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:17.320]   Particular attention. He said needs to be paid and helping girls and other route underrepresented groups in stem
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:22.040]   Including african-americans latinos. I think that's true, right? Yeah
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:28.280]   What's uh the problem with the us tech industry when we see a litany of tech companies report workforce
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.200]   Statistics that are routinely 70 white 70 percent male
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:39.640]   Um, he's uh the president said I think part of the problem is just generally our school systems aren't doing as good of a job on this period full stop
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.600]   The risk of this though is then you get things like core curriculum, which I'm
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:53.080]   I think is a mistake. Yeah, and then he says and then part of what's happening is we're not helping schools and teachers teach it in an interesting way that may be okay
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:58.920]   And he also says you need role models and I agree we were talking before the show about this uh with linn
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.920]   um
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:02.760]   I feel a big burden
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:06.520]   To get more women and people of color on our shows as role models
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:12.280]   So that kids who are watching can say oh, yeah, I'm not a white man. I guess I shouldn't get into tech
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:15.000]   That's not what you want
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.840]   Right now and you make a good point with that. I mean I had no role model when I was in high school
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:28.920]   Programming, you know, basically gonna come with our 64, but you did it. Why did it? I was a math major. Yeah
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:36.280]   And so it was an elective math course and I I liked, you know, gaming enough at the time so
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.640]   It um, it kind of just followed suit, but that's really unusual
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:46.360]   I don't know. I had also taken a data processing course
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:49.880]   If you remember data processing
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:54.360]   In high school really yeah in high school. That's a good school
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.160]   For something. Yeah
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:00.760]   Actually getting kids young is important. I think about the story of bill gates
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:05.720]   Who got into computers at lakeside high school in seattle fancy private school, but they didn't have a computer there
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:12.360]   Um and his mom had a and other moms raised money through bake sales and stuff to buy a teletype
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:17.400]   Connected to the time sharing computer down the road and that that's where bill and uh
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:22.360]   His buddies including paul allen went there and started banging on uh
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:25.240]   banging on the teletype and writing programs
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:28.440]   Gates had actually a company when he was a
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:33.080]   High school student. I think it was called traf o data. He wrote
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:38.680]   You know those rubber hoses they put across the road and then the car goes from bump and they count how many cars go down and road
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.840]   He wrote software that would analyze that
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.360]   Mm
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.840]   That was his first business. Am I am I making this up?
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:50.040]   When you get to a certain age sometimes you think oh I hallucinated that
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:55.560]   Traffic you think you're brian Williams. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I was looking right down the barrel of that
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:59.400]   Traf o data was a partnership between bill gates paul allen and paul gillbert
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:04.200]   To read the raw data from road rate traffic counters and create reports for traffic engineers
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:09.640]   This was before microsoft. They were still in high school when they high school students at the lake side school in seattle
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:14.520]   So I did not make that up either that or I edited this article on wikipedia
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:17.560]   It's also a possibility
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:25.960]   All right, let us let us we're all in agreement and maybe you can disagree about what kids should learn
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.960]   But I think we're all in agreement that um
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.440]   That should be part. I think it's as much as mass should be part of the curriculum some sort of
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:35.800]   logic and and I don't know
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:42.840]   And yet there's people like you Lynn who despite all odds
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:46.200]   Just fell in love with it and you just you're bold enough
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:50.280]   Uncowed enough. That's really the problem is so many people get cowed
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:55.640]   You're uncount enough to say I don't care if you know, I'm the only girl doing this. I'm gonna do it
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.800]   right
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:01.320]   Right. Yeah, I mean, I didn't know I didn't really know anyone else
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:08.600]   Like me doing it, right? I guess I could say at the time, you know, um, but you didn't let some guy or some math teacher
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:13.400]   Tell you oh no, you shouldn't get into this. No, actually I was encouraged. Oh, that's nice
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:16.440]   It's encouraged. See there you go. That's that's what we need
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:19.640]   I was talking
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:23.240]   A couple of weeks ago. We had a visitor young woman who was it as a student at Cal
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:27.160]   She's graduating this year. She starts at google in the fall data analysis
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:32.520]   And I said that's so great. How do you tell me about how you got into math?
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:35.000]   She said well, I wasn't because I got encouragement
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:40.200]   She said my math teacher who was a woman said oh no, you should math is too hard for you. You shouldn't be doing math
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:48.040]   Isn't that terrible? It's terrible. I mean what what happened to me really was um, you know, I started
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:52.440]   The reason I became a math major is because I took algebra before I even went to high school
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:59.320]   And when I got to high school the math teacher I had there said how about you be a math peer tutor for me great
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:06.280]   So I think that's what started me loving math in that kind of way, you know, my daughter's facing this
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:08.760]   She's 23. She's a sophomore in college
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:12.600]   Right now. She she really has a hard time with math
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:18.360]   Uh, she blames me because I did not force her her to learn her multiplication tables when she was
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:22.520]   I tried
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:28.520]   Um, but we did a lot of soft enough. Yeah, maybe not we did a laden math adventure. I mean we did stuff
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.600]   but uh
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:35.640]   I think most of it was she was I think she's super smart and she wants a science career, right? So she needs math
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:41.000]   Right, um, so, uh, but she's I feel so happy. She's found a professor
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.560]   Uh who is oh it was a woman who says oh no
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:49.000]   You should be at a higher level of math and i'm gonna do a tutorial with you
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:54.040]   And we're gonna do two years of math in one semester because you are smart enough to do this
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:57.960]   This isn't hard and i'm i'm gonna help you get over this
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:03.320]   Uh block you have and i'm so grateful to that professor. We need more people like that
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:11.080]   Uh, definitely. I mean math block can be like writer's block. It's exactly like me. Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's exactly like that
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:14.920]   Uh, I did teach her how to play the ponies though. So that's good
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.240]   Um
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.600]   That actually wouldn't be a bad skill. I mean i'm just saying
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:28.600]   How to do it. Oh, i'm like, i'm poker. That's the one
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:34.360]   So yeah gambling you teach the odds, right? Yeah, i bet against the other way. That's good way to learn math. Yeah
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:39.320]   So we were we were speculating what metell was going to announce
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:44.520]   Uh, they had an event, uh, with, uh, google
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.280]   And and the speculation was correct. It is cardboard
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.040]   They're going to do a view master based on
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:56.440]   Uh, the google cardboard here's a us at a today. Um
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:59.320]   interview
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:05.720]   Is there a demo of it? I let me see if i can skip ahead and find it. Yeah, there's a demo. I saw a demo earlier today
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.680]   I love that idea. So there's what it looks like. It looks just like
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:14.760]   Uh, it's a bit. Let's riff take that. Yeah, it's good. It's like like 29 dollars or something
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.520]   It's a rebranded view master look and and it looks like they even have the discs with the pictures
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:22.440]   But you can see there's no pictures in there must be rfid or something
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.920]   You presumably have to slide a smartphone, uh in there. We'll see
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.560]   I want to see it
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.960]   Yeah, I want one. Wouldn't that be cool?
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:35.240]   This this surely this is what they'll give away at i/o
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:42.840]   They gave away google cardboard at i/o that was that was the best thing ever
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.960]   That is a pixel or daughter of cardboard. Yeah
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.920]   Well, I don't know if this is a good video because it's so how does it be put the phone in or not?
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.120]   Or is it in
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:02:00.600]   The phone slots into the top has to right? Yeah, no the phone slots into the top the uh the discs that you have there
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:05.480]   It isn't you know, it's obviously not film basically what it does is I believe through nfc
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:11.960]   It's like you tap it to the vmaster. Yeah, and it transfers the that's how cardboard was designed. Yeah, you know, uh
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.880]   Yeah, but the discs i think are something like 14 or 15 bucks each
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.520]   the vr
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:24.360]   You know the the actual view master unit is like 29 99 of the new viewer there we go
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:28.760]   Which will include a sample reel and then 15 bucks for the uh the discs
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:33.560]   But he's showing. He's showing cardboard. This is cardboard right now. He's showing cardboard
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.520]   Yeah, but next to the old and then the new i suppose
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.680]   Hold on to your cardboard kids. That's gonna be worth something someday
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.800]   I remember cardboard
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.760]   Well, unfortunately my cardboard won't fit my next to six
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.680]   Yeah, yeah, that's what I don't know about
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.320]   The next six
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:57.240]   Why do you I still understand why you need the you don't really need the disc you can just
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.760]   Need some i don't know you can do it in software. Absolutely
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:08.520]   Yeah, in fact remember with cardboard you can you can use that little slider and you can choose from a menu of things and then go through experiences
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.880]   What i'm saying is you can buy the program on play and not have to you buy a physical cardboard thing
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.280]   Just the enough not if the tell has anything to do with it
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:20.040]   Right because how would you make your work in the view master? You have to have those
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.760]   Tell me to buy the discs
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.880]   I gotta find a demo. This is terrible. There's just some guy sitting here
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.920]   Let's see a view master
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.600]   The other one is a press release. I don't know if they had a demo there or not demo. Let's see
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.240]   Let's see if google can help us
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.960]   Here's a demo of the upgraded view master. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to talk to you google. I'm not talking you go away
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.840]   Gosh darn it. I hate it when that's too good
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.960]   Here's oh
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:53.320]   And now i've lost my page. I think i've got one i found one on youtube at the toy fair because this is where matel
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:58.440]   Unveiled. This is this is the toy insider. I guess they're gonna sell cardboard too
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:04.680]   They're gonna sell cardboard as well. They just show they just show you what cardboard was
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:10.360]   Why is everybody playing with cardboard? I want to see the the it's true. No, there's a cardboard view master
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.920]   That's why it's so cheap. Right
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:19.480]   Well, what's the other thing we were here? What was that other thing that looked like, you know, yeah, what's that? What's that man?
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:24.520]   That is the view master. I mean, this says I don't know. I'm confused. They're showing cardboard
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:30.280]   We just want to see yeah, no, but every yeah
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:38.120]   Maybe they haven't finished the the google the uh, the new master brand it. Well view master brand and cardboard is pretty cool
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:47.240]   I'll take that not for 20 bucks 25 bucks. Yeah, this is definitely that's a ripoff man. Oh, so is it with cardboard?
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.840]   Oh here it is here it is
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:53.080]   What's this this is cnet? There's a picture looks like a robot, but then she's
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:59.640]   Obviously the the uh the plastic one was working at cardboard is what the children said
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.120]   dinosaur adventure
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:06.120]   Is it that with cardboard you do it with the phone and what the view master you do it with the disc?
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.080]   I guess
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:13.480]   But the view master you do insert the phone into it. It's like the top pops up you throw the phone and there drop it in
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.040]   fall 2015
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:21.800]   Oh, I'll buy one. Oh, of course you will eat by everything. Well, that's not really saying much is it
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.400]   I'm by anything
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.600]   All right, let's take a break. We're gonna come back with the more

[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:49.800]   Jason you put it up her case d is that like e Cummings? Why is the d lowercase?

[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:25.400]   Oh, it's it's fine. I didn't I didn't know we do it french style. I know I don't know why we started doing that
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:28.760]   In the very beginning and I still do it. It's just see my name
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:33.000]   She now I know I don't know why we do that. It's french the french do that

[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.480]   uh
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:00.600]   And most of us sometimes because the companies make us buy it from the company that sold us the printer
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.080]   But you don't go to the car dealership to buy gas
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:08.840]   Why should you go to the printer manufacturer to buy overpriced and I mean overpriced ink and toner
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:16.360]   ld products offers a quality alternative at a fraction of the cost as much as 75 less than the oem cartridge

[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:59.080]   And it's not a real person. It doesn't actually work for the company, but it's somewhere else
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:04.840]   It's actually from their platinum lead certified building in long beach. Yeah, even their building
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.480]   Is environmentally friendly?

[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.920]   Thousands of dollars a gallon. It's the most expensive fluid known to man
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:23.000]   Not really is to save some money
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.560]   use LD
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:29.640]   So, uh, I guess google not only having trouble in europe now russia
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.000]   Yandex
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.160]   This one's commercial clearly right
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:41.080]   Yandex asks russian antitrust authorities to probe google over bundling andrade with google services
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.480]   Yandex is guess what the google of russia
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:52.040]   Should google be a feared
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.720]   No, no, no
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.920]   No
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.160]   Everybody should be a fear to russia, but that's the difference. Yeah
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.520]   Um
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:01.800]   yandex
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:08.520]   Uh, isn't you know we've talked about this before so there are two ways you can have an android handset one is just pure open source
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.520]   But you get no google services
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:16.040]   Uh, the other but your customers. I think if you're making an android phone want google play store
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.600]   google maps
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.880]   google voice all of the nice google stuff the googly stuff
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:27.480]   And for that you have to get it certified by google and uh, I imagine pay them a little bit
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.160]   Um
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.560]   And and those are not those are proprietary those are non open source those those
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.840]   apps and services
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:42.680]   Um, if you want to put google play store on your device you have to install the entire suite of google
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:46.840]   Services gms services and google by the way also has to be default search
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.560]   on your browser
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.840]   Uh
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:57.720]   Yandex also complains that in addition to that not this is news to me device manufacturers are increasingly prohibited from installing any
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:00.200]   Services from google competitors on their devices
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:06.200]   That's kind of interesting it makes me wonder about this rumor sam sung
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.480]   Uh, and we'll we'll see the galaxy s6
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:13.240]   Probably a mobile world congress. How long off is that now?
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.880]   Oh, it's march 5th, right?
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:19.240]   Yeah, mike elgan's going we're sending a team out there because I think this is
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:23.080]   Increasingly the most interesting conference because this were all the all the new
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.800]   phones and tablets get announced
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.440]   um the rumor
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:33.240]   Uh, and I think this might be a good rumor because it makes a lot of sense. It seems plausible to me
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:40.760]   Is that the galaxy s6 will not have sam sung apps they'll still have to have google apps like the google play store
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:44.200]   But will not have sam sung apps, but instead
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.680]   Microsoft apps
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.400]   Yeah, I saw that
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.960]   Which I think is very intriguing
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:12:00.360]   Won't have sam sung apps will have microsoft apps. Yeah in android. Yeah
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:06.040]   So micro so sam so it'll still have the google play store and google services. I think i'm guessing
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:10.280]   Because that customers do want that, but who wants sam sung's crap
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.680]   Right where
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:18.680]   Low where where s health s s voice the one I by the way, I carry it a note for
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:25.480]   Because finally and I did not want an s5 because I want google voice google dictation
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:28.120]   I don't want sam sung's s voice
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:35.240]   Which is based on nuance and I don't like it and it was very hard to make it just go away on older versions on the note for
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.440]   I never see s voice sam sung's listening in fact
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.320]   according to this rumor
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:46.120]   Uh, you could still get the s voice if you want on the galaxy apps store
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:51.560]   Chip in by the way, Jason if you have anything to add on this because this is really all about android's beat
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:57.880]   Uh, but they are instead of installing the sam sung calendar the sam sung browser the sam sung
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.160]   uh
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.720]   Contacts all the sam sung bloatware they're gonna put microsoft
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:10.520]   And frisk google calendar google mail no, I think they still have to put all the googly stuff all I see
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.840]   I think it would be
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:17.960]   I mean at business people so right now when I get a note for I have two calendars
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.920]   I have the google calendar or I can download it if it's not on here and I have the sam sung calendar
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.960]   I have two stores. I have the sam sung store. I have the google store
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:33.000]   I have uh two music players. I have you know, it's it's because and this is true of most uh skin
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.520]   Android devices, right? They have htc's version of all those apps in addition to the google versions
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:45.400]   So what they're saying and by the way and when I pull out my pen on my note for a sam sung note taking app launches
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:50.280]   Not google keep what they're saying is one note microsoft one note will launch
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:52.840]   Instead
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:57.960]   Office mobile Skype and maybe they say a free office 365 subscription
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:03.000]   This makes sense given the way microsoft's very aggressively pushing office onto tablets
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.960]   and mobile
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:11.960]   Um, I'm very intrigued. I think it's an interesting switch if it does happen
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:17.160]   um only because for you know past three four years we've gotten very used to
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.000]   kind of putting
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:26.520]   Sam sung in a similar category as apple in the sense that sam sung really wants to provide its services front and center and it wants
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:29.720]   That to be the thing that its users use of course
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:36.680]   You know, we probably talked on this show and a lot of other shows on the network that not everybody's using those those apps and services on sam
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.000]   Some devices even though they're shipped with right?
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.880]   But this would all if this happens. It's almost an admission by sam sung that that isn't working
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:47.400]   Uh in a sense because it's basically them saying all right cool
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.560]   We tried it's not working here. Let's let microsoft in and I don't think you're gonna see
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:55.960]   This release without google's apps and services. I think that would be a good
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:01.240]   If they put the play they want to put the play store on there, right? I mean, I wouldn't buy it without that. No
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:06.360]   I was gonna. He said why not just go stock android like stock android has all right
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:11.800]   Like it why microsoft why I think for biz. I think you I think jeff was right
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.560]   It would appeal to me they've they've they've admitted that their own stuff is crap
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.240]   It doesn't need to be but it is
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.600]   They're trying to upgrade the hardware a lot and do creative new things in the phone
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:27.480]   Okay, it's good way and then they're gonna try to appeal to a business customer base
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:30.120]   And I wonder what the business you
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:38.200]   How many expensive expense account bought phones now are iphone versus android versus mowberry right?
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.800]   um
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.160]   versus
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:47.640]   No, he microsoft there's another reason by the way. Yeah, and mary joe foley came up with this on windows weekly and I think she's accurate
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.680]   Samsung and microsoft
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.680]   Microsoft was suing samsung saying because my samsung pays microsoft
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:57.640]   This is really bizarre
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:03.560]   Microsoft has always asserted that it has patents on the linux operating system that it actually owns
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:09.000]   And has been indemnifying linux companies saying okay, we won't sue you if you pay us some money
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.840]   Of course linux is the root operating system for android
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.360]   uh in
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:18.440]   2011 samsung agreed to cross license
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.080]   android from microsoft
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:23.240]   and
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.720]   According to some court documents that were released
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:31.320]   Uh samsung has paid microsoft a billion dollars a year ever since
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:36.440]   For android for android microsoft to microsoft to microsoft
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:43.320]   Uh in fact, we've known for a long time that microsoft makes a lot of money on android people have estimated as much as five dollars in android handset
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:46.520]   But all of a sudden
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.920]   Last week last week
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.920]   They buried the hatchet
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:55.080]   We don't know the details of the uh green that all fits together nice
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.320]   So
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:04.600]   Um, I think that's fascinating
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:08.920]   If that's the case it's still very interesting that that would be
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:12.520]   Kind of the the straw that breaks samsung's
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.920]   Back as far as their services are concerned. It's not like you can't get them
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:19.160]   It's not like interested people can't install them
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:25.720]   But it said if all along samsung's been relying on the fact that well if it ships on the device then people are more likely to use it
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.280]   All of the people are never going to install it
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:33.240]   Uh because they never have used well and and then samsung said or this rumor
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.640]   I should say says that samsung would still put the samsung app store on its devices
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:42.840]   I don't see any reason why they wouldn't right and then in the app store you could get s health s voice all the other samsung apps
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.080]   So it's really the best of all worlds
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.080]   So the so the
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:54.360]   What happened is that when microsoft bought nokia samsung went back and said hey that invalidates our across licensing agreements
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:57.160]   Uh and we're going to stop paying you
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:01.400]   And so microsoft sued samsung saying you owe us something like a third of a billion dollars
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.120]   In uh outstanding license fees
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.760]   But that got all got dropped last week
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:11.080]   So now I think it all makes sense and some apps got added. Yeah, yeah
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:15.960]   And maybe samsung will I don't know how it's going to work. This will pay microsoft for the apps
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.040]   I'm not sure but and they're not nobody's saying but
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:25.400]   I don't think it's a bad thing as somebody who uses samsung phones. I've always hated touch whiz. I've always had samsung bloatware
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.240]   um
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:31.800]   We you know a lot of us have bought google play edition versions of samsung devices
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.800]   um, I
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:39.560]   I would not use an s5 for that reason I like the note for because samsung's really downplayed the touch whiz
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.080]   On it and I think i'm reason how big is yes six supposed to be
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:47.560]   Screen. I don't know. Do you know what's the rumor? That's uh, that's a really good question
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:52.680]   I don't know what the rumor is pointing at I feel like I saw something that that even said it might be going
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:59.000]   In the reverse direction. I don't think it'll be uh size wise. Yeah, I don't think it'll be note sized. I don't really know. Yeah, no
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:06.040]   Um, they're saying some of the rumors are five inches right exactly. Come on back. I think that's gonna that's gonna feel dinky to me now
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:13.320]   Well, but then they have the note which is five point seven inches. I this is such the note for is actually a great phone
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:18.360]   Is it I just what do you think about the third the the rounded screen the edge?
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:23.400]   I don't have the edge. Yeah, I reviewed the edge. I was underwhelmed. It's weird to hold
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:26.440]   The edge then what do you care? What do you what do you holster?
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:31.080]   Um, I have an excess five and I have a note three
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:35.960]   Oh, hi. And you like the big the big note three screen or no?
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:39.400]   I do. I love it. And I use I use the uh
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:46.440]   I'm uh, I use the you know the pen, right? Yeah, do you use that? Yeah, you use it because I would like to have that
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:49.000]   I use it. I use it and ever note a lot. Right
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:55.320]   Yeah, well, so that's what's cool about that is the stylus, which I don't ever use but uh, I just like a big screen
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:20:00.440]   And it's the best it's easily the best screen out there. It's also a really good camera. So get this
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.360]   This was an article uh
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:05.720]   From uh phone arena calm. They've been doing a lot of camera phone
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:10.600]   Comparisons, but this is a wild one. They took the galaxy note four
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:14.600]   And iphone six plus and a canon
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:18.200]   Eos 650d a DSLR
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.800]   Shot the same scene three times did a blind
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.280]   testing
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:26.280]   And guess who won?
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.360]   the camera phones
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:30.040]   Wow
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.920]   There's a couple of theories why one is that the iphone
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:37.160]   Uh does do some over saturating of colors if you look at this tiger's nose
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:42.760]   The left hand one is probably the most accurate. It's certainly the the crispest is from the it's from the canon
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:49.720]   The iphone six though looks more vivid, right? The colors are more saturated and the galaxy note four as all the galaxy phones
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.280]   Uh over sharpen
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.280]   So everything's very crisp
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:59.480]   And I think the companies both samsung and apple realize that these are more appealing
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.920]   To the naked eye than the more accurate
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:05.240]   eos
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:09.320]   Uh picture we can look a little bit right the iphone six looks like hd
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.800]   Right because it's so colorful
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:15.160]   Is it more accurate? No
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.800]   But act but where but people aren't looking for accuracy
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:24.680]   In every respect if you look for accuracy like at this image the the the the dslr is much more accurate
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:28.200]   But the brighter colors of the iphone and the crisper
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.680]   edges of the note four
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:34.200]   Seem to appeal to people anyway. They did. I mean it's a blind test
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:38.520]   It's pretty amazing
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.600]   phone arena.com if you want to see those results
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.720]   This is a good example actually the uh
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:46.760]   And they don't tell you which is which
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.440]   Which one do you like the best of this russian building?
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:53.480]   the e or f?
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:58.760]   I I think f must be the dslr, but I don't know but I like d
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:04.280]   I'm like a d. Yeah, that's definitely a note four. I could tell I could tell and this would be the iphone because the color
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:07.160]   renditions, but uh
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.280]   Let's see. Do they tell you?
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:14.040]   It's a blind comparison. They don't
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.680]   You'll never know you'll never know
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.560]   Have to tell you hey they do somewhere. Yeah
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:27.560]   There's the there's the actual picture that's got to be the yeah, this is the high resolution
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:30.760]   dslr version
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:33.720]   That's got to be an iphone. I don't know
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:38.840]   It's fun, but just shows you what you may think
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:44.360]   uh, according to the article the galaxy a note four dominated the comparison
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.080]   beating both other cameras
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.680]   I
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.680]   like the note for a camera I do
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:58.600]   And you can see the pole results and they got 16,000 votes on this and this one uh seen the tiger nose
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:04.360]   Uh, the note four actually did not do well the iphone six plus one. That's because of color, right?
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:10.280]   Yeah, yeah, the note four in comparison looks very flat. So uh, oh I got it wrong
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:14.120]   the middle one of the building was the
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.760]   dslr the note four was the one I thought was a dsl. I see how much crisper that is
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.680]   The iphone six plus and of this one the note four one handily
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:25.720]   Not even close. By the way
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:33.000]   2 of 15,000 snies on a 91 votes picked a dslr image is the best wow only 2 percent
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.720]   Wow
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:38.040]   This is fun
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:41.720]   But that just shows that more people are getting used to doing photography with their phone
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.640]   Yeah, and they like it better
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:48.440]   This one the no via eyes are one of the right trained because we're so used to I was using it wrong
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:53.240]   Yeah, it's it's like a kind of like mp3 is right
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:57.080]   Lower quality mp3 but yet over time
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:00.600]   I used to it, right?
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.600]   I hate the modern world
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:08.600]   Okay, let's see we're gonna I think we're running out of time. So why don't we
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:11.960]   Take a break here. They just look quickly through
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.360]   um
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:18.360]   Pebble now supports android wearing notifications. That's nice. That's good for pebble
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:23.480]   Uh lg is doing an all-metal android wear watch
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:27.480]   Project ara
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:32.920]   Has a new camera module from tushiba a five megapixel and a 13 megapixel
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:36.280]   This is the modular smartphone that will only be available in porta rico
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:40.120]   I'm sorry at least in at first at first ara is is more and more
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:45.000]   It's fascinating me just just from the fact that we're starting to see hardware manufacturers
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000]   Publish or you know kind of talk a little bit about the modules that can plug into it
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.040]   There's one company that we talked about on alban andra a couple of weeks ago
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:57.960]   I can't remember the name of the company. They're currently working on a hundred modules. Yeah for our uh, I remember reading that
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:00.280]   Yeah, hi as there has a bunch of like high
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.880]   High fidelity audio components to plug into it
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:09.400]   It's it's becoming less of like a modular phone and more just a modular device or an upgrade
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.680]   What do you want it to do?
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:16.840]   Upgradable device, right? Yeah, well it's fascinating that you can create an accessory that's not an accessory. It's built in
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:22.280]   I thought this was really a wonky idea because I thought well the phone is gonna be really
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:26.120]   You might be in a crow crow leg here. We'll see
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:29.640]   When you call it
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.320]   crow leg
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:34.920]   Crow leg. I'm a crow crow just a drum just a crow drumstick
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:36.680]   What does that mean?
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:38.680]   Greeting crow. I'm eating crow
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:43.000]   We don't have to eat it. Yeah, not yet. I'm not saying you're eating crow yet because it could be dorky
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.160]   But I don't know. I'm not sure it's right. I'm ready to totally dismiss our
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:52.040]   I don't know. I mean mind you. This is somebody I you know what I really want. You know what I want
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:54.280]   But what do you want? What do you really really want?
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.880]   I want google to just refund the money for every snuck who bought glass
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:04.680]   I want my money back. Nope. Well you do you do because lin's a glass hole
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.320]   You want your money back?
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.560]   No, no
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:15.560]   I just don't I just don't like the fact that you know now that they're finished with the explorer's version
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:18.360]   It's like it almost feels like
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:23.800]   You know, it's over it feels kind of similar to the helpouts thing, right?
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:28.280]   It's like we were talking about earlier a bunch of people you know spend their time
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:33.560]   Creating you know creating their livelihood around something like when glass
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:37.720]   You know and when many people will correct you and say glass is an ending
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:42.600]   It's just going in a different direction. We're probably not going to see the fruits of that direction for another couple of years
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:46.200]   So in some senses it is kind of ending but a lot of people
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:51.160]   Uh poured their time for a year or two into development specifically for glass
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:57.320]   Thinking that they're in the beginnings of something that's going to turn into something great and they're going to correct kind of ride the wave and
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:02.920]   What happened? We're done for now. I think you're right Jason and and google
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:07.240]   Chose I saw some why did we talked about it in the show at one point?
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:12.040]   Google could have charged a lot less but they kind of wanted to charge that much money to get the serious people
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:14.520]   Google wasn't serious serious suckers
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.840]   Right
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:22.440]   I was there a 2200 bucks, but yeah add in the frames which I had to buy which were then like a week later were free
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:27.320]   And then add in the prescription expensive lenses that I have to have
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:31.800]   Lynn you upgraded you upgraded your glass, right? Yeah, I upgraded
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.560]   um
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:40.160]   Yeah, I mean what what was better on the the second version was the audio definitely right when was the last time you're warr
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:43.080]   I'm not saying
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:47.560]   I bought glass but Jason got glass. Have you uh, have you worn it lately?
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:55.000]   Well, I wore it uh the morning that we surprised lucy with her trip to disneyland see there you go and you guys are good
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.320]   Video I bet right yes, but that's that's pretty much the only time I use glass
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:03.720]   You would have the same result. The big thing is happening. I want to record it without holding a device in front of me
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:09.080]   Uh, so I'll put this on and it could have made a hat with a GoPro embedded. We've been the same completely
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:17.080]   Uh, maybe it looks a little bit less dorky than I had with a go for a dozen. I don't know it doesn't same same same but different
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.400]   No, doesn't look less dorky
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:26.200]   What happened to me is I gave a lot of talks around having google glass life with glass
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:30.040]   You know how you were you were like a spokesperson. Yeah
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:37.320]   And I got asked so so already there's gonna be embarrassing now like the future is glass. You have to have glass glasses gonna change everything
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:45.000]   There's some embarrassment there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've got some too long nose. I've got I've I defended glass
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:51.800]   Yeah, defend google generally works out, but boy it didn't work in that case. I just I got a big schmuck on my eye
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:55.880]   But I did say I didn't think it was the future of wearables though
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:29:01.320]   Yeah, I think I think that wearables is going to have to be more seamless. I I
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:04.520]   Well like like these
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:07.880]   My argument about about this is that this is two thirds of the functionality of glass
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:11.480]   Instructions that alerts are here and they and they didn't need to be here
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:15.080]   What needs to be here or here is a camera
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:18.440]   As Jason just said and and that needs to be rethought. I think
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:22.440]   There's an idea of an always ready capture what you see
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:30.280]   Camera, I think still has legs as long as it has a red light for privacy warning. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, that's true
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:33.080]   Breaking story
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:39.480]   Just came in Steve Kovac writing in the business insider Samsung has officially acquired loop pay
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:46.360]   We'd heard this rumor for some time. It's another way to do a touch and pay although a little more flexible
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:53.160]   Than apple pay it will work through traditional magnetic credit card readers
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:56.280]   as well as touch to pay devices
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:30:00.440]   So
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:03.800]   I the thinking is this might be a galaxy s6 feature
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:10.120]   You can swipe your phone. Is that right? Or you just put it near the swiper. I guess
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:13.080]   All right, so I'm confused
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:20.440]   Each that's proprietary so somebody has to sign up for the for the lume no, it'll work without no it'll work with what
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:23.560]   It'll work. Well, this is the thing that it's interesting first
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:27.880]   You've always had touch to pay with any android device with nfc and google wallet, right?
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:33.800]   Or if you use the carrier wallets like and if the vendor had the right thing which I hardly ever see right?
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.320]   But uh, well no, you're wrong now because of apple pay
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:43.000]   So it's a pal that with apple pay all the people who have apple pay also will allow you to use a google wallet
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:47.720]   I don't know if anybody who has only apple pay. I didn't even know that I had no idea
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:52.360]   So you'll see an icon that looks like a fish dinner like the bones of a fish dinner
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:57.240]   That's the touch to pay icon. That's always next to the apple pay icon. You can do one. You can do the other
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:01.720]   But what's interesting about a loop pay it goes one step farther. Remember that card coin
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:04.920]   The idea was put all your credit cards into this device
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:11.320]   It would generate a magnetic field that a stripe reader would say oh, I see you're using your visa card
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:17.240]   This does that as well. Now in the past the loop pay has had a case that you'd have to put on your smartphone
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:21.080]   You don't swipe it. You just have to put it next to the credit card reader. So
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:23.880]   in addition
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:26.760]   So this in theory would add more payment methods
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:29.720]   to the samsung galaxy s6
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:34.760]   Then apple pay so anywhere you can use apple pay you could use the nfc touch to pay
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:38.680]   Using your google wallet or your soft card or whatever you've got for a wallet
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:43.160]   But now you'll also be able to send a magnetic field that regular credit card readers
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:47.960]   Magnetic field that's interesting. Yeah, this is the icon you were talking about right?
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:51.880]   Yeah, it's like a fish dinner not the thing on the left right right. Yeah, not the
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:55.640]   Not the phone, but just this just a little fish dinner on the right there
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:32:02.200]   I think this whole thing about I mean that swiping is gone soon. I hope one hopes
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:07.880]   Um, so I don't know how important this is but it would give the s6 kind of a leg up
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:12.520]   You could say everything it can everything the apple pay can do and more
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:16.840]   I think it does. I mean people want frictionless payments, right?
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:18.280]   Oh
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:19.880]   It gives a leg up
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:23.640]   More options. I feel like though if if a store like let's hold food which has
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:25.400]   Uh tap to pay
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:28.840]   Everybody's kind of used to it now the all the clerks by now have seen somebody do it
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.920]   They're not freaking out if but the
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:36.040]   A store that just has a swipe credit card standard credit card reader has never done touch to pay you come in say well
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:38.040]   Let me just rub my phone against it
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:42.120]   I my dry cleaners are not gonna go. Oh fine
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:46.840]   They're gonna think some sort of devil devilry is in play here
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:52.200]   And you sure you're sure it's all card readers. It's not card readers
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.000]   Most
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:53.880]   with lupa
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:57.240]   According to the most standard magnetic card readers
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:02.600]   Mm-hmm because what it does it makes a field. It looks like a stripe. All right, okay
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:07.400]   Um, so Samsung has agreed to acquire lupa
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:14.680]   lupa's technology. This is the Samsung press release has a potential work in approximately 90% of existing point of sale terminals
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.320]   with no investment in new infrastructure
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:19.960]   Immurgions are buying it in the us anyway because uh
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:23.560]   uh of federal mandates so
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:26.120]   Interesting though
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:28.120]   Okay, so that's just in
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:30.200]   breaking news
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:35.560]   Samsung also has its own exenos chip of 14 nanometer 64 bit eight core
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:40.280]   Processor which they don't use exenos in the us. They usually uh
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:43.000]   opt for the qualcom
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000]   Snapdragon because it adds us
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:51.320]   uh freak radio frequencies, but uh, i've had Samsung phones with the exenos. That's what they sell in the rest of the world
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:54.280]   So there's more breaking news. Yes
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:58.920]   Megan Smith announces the appointment of dr. G DJ petitio

[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:29.640]   That's a familiar name an incredible career as a data scientist. Yeah president a product to relate iq

[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:03.640]   Okay, there you go breaking us
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:08.680]   Uh good good article. We need we need we need we need one of those little
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:15.000]   Just a new and somebody can hand me a piece of paper. Yeah, I think so. This just turned
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:21.880]   A little ripping sound off the off the teletype. Yeah, got a tweet from cena kana far who has written a blog post
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:24.440]   um cena
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:27.320]   noted that everybody in the tech media has
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:31.160]   celebrated the unlocking of phones
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:39.000]   the uh carriers voluntary unlocking agreement and everybody kind of interpreted it as now you can get your phone unlocked from any of the
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.480]   Any of the carriers in the us?
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:44.680]   Uh, so cena said not so yeah
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.280]   cena said
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:53.720]   Not so fast. So sprinting t-mobile have failed to fulfill half of their own voluntary commitments for rising as the most lenient policy
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:59.800]   They've almost entirely stopped most of their phones aren't useful elsewhere. They've stopped blocking their devices
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:02.440]   Uh mostly because the fcc required it
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:06.520]   AT&T has met all of their almost all of their unlocking requirements
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:09.880]   Um
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:11.880]   T-mobile not so fast
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:16.680]   Uh t-mobile's not doing apparently a very good job and doesn't even really know what you're talking about
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:21.880]   And see this this is interesting to me because years ago when I used to go overseas
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:26.760]   I used to call up t-mobile and say hey, I need to use a foreign sim in my phone
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:29.080]   So can you unlock my phone and they would do it?
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:33.000]   Now most people are many people use unlocked phones with t-mobile
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.600]   I mean that's one of the reasons I like t-mobile
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:38.680]   I just put a sim in and I use it with my unlocked phones like your nexus five or my six or
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:44.360]   Um, but t-mobile will here's their policy will unlock post-paid devices
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:49.880]   But ads restrictions preventing customers from unlocking more than two devices per line of service in a 12-month period
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:53.560]   They also require devices on their monthly plans to be active for at least 40 days
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:59.160]   Even if the contract expires after a month under t-mobiles uncarrier policies and all do's have been paid
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:01.400]   Um
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:05.400]   Anyway, this is a good easy technology fellow at the eff. Thank you cena
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.160]   um
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:12.760]   And the article is at uh, cena.sina.is
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:15.640]   little report card
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:18.280]   On the uh, on the unlocking
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:23.640]   So don't don't leap to the conclusion that unlocking is here completely
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:28.040]   Uh, let's see what else?
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:29.080]   um
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:31.480]   How quickly running through the other headlines
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:40.120]   We mentioned uh, we've been talking about facebook and the memorializing of websites facebook now allows you as google does to designate a digital air
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:44.520]   A legacy contact for your digital afterlife once you go
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:49.320]   Uh, you the person in charge can say to facebook. Okay
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:52.120]   They're gone
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:54.120]   freeze the account
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:38:01.000]   Uh, turn it memorialize the account google's been able to do this too, right? The inactive account manager they call it
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:03.800]   A nice way to put it
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:11.320]   So now when you make your will in addition to everything else you have to do like handing over your google password and your facebook password
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:13.320]   Do you any designate a?
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:15.640]   So what do you want to live after you?
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:19.880]   I would be nice if they just deleted it all right really?
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:22.840]   I don't want my facebook page to live on
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:25.960]   Well, okay, well, maybe I do I don't know
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:31.720]   Yeah, it is a little freaky when I see somebody leaves a comment or something and I see a dead person pop up in my feed
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:40.520]   I have a friend on facebook who passed away and they're the family, you know, like on the anniversary of his death they update
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:43.000]   That's nice. I think that's sweet
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.560]   It's like a gravestone in a way, right?
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:48.680]   Yeah, memorial. Yeah
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:51.880]   I wanted to give you uh speaking of uh
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:59.160]   The grim room for I wanted to give you a chance. Uh, jeff you wrote a very nice piece on david car. Oh, thank you
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:01.480]   Um creamer
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:05.880]   I didn't know him you didn't know him either. It sounds like I thought you for sure would know David. Oh, I certainly knew him
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:07.880]   But I'm just saying there were people
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:09.320]   I knew him better
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:14.600]   Yeah, I knew him better and so at one level I said I shouldn't write anything. I didn't know him that well
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:17.560]   But then I also said to myself
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:23.320]   That a tweet was or a thousand feet tweets was insufficient, which by the way puts people on warning when I go
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:25.720]   I expect more than a tweet. Okay
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:30.840]   I will write you a nice eulogy. I want a little more than a tweet. Okay
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:35.960]   Um you should do that agreement where if I go first who you know who you know, whoever goes first
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:39.160]   The other guy would be there to carry the coffin
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:42.680]   Uh, yeah, you know, it used to be having to work in newspapers for years
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:44.920]   It used to be the only real fringe benefit of working for newspapers
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:50.120]   He got an open in it now the newspapers are dying before I am, you know, it was a bit of a shock because I had read
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:53.880]   cars really good peace about brian, uh, williams and
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:57.240]   um, john stewart in the times
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:03.960]   Yep, uh that and then the next day he like he actually shortly after I read that piece
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:05.720]   He said he died in the newsroom that night
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.160]   That that night, uh, the night he died he had he had
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:12.840]   a discussion with glenry what laura pewteris and and
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.840]   stoden
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:18.680]   And then at nine o'clock night collapsed and they said since that it was um
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:21.560]   Cancer for those of you who don't know who david car
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:26.920]   Was uh, he was an incredible character. He was media columnist for the new york times
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:29.800]   He was a crack addict from the old days
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:31.480]   who, uh
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:37.480]   Wrote a book called night of the gun about he basically went back and and fact checked his own life and the video you're about to play as him
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:44.440]   Given what for to shane smith. This is from a documentary which is really good called page one about the uh
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:50.280]   New york times came out what about a year ago and uh turned out you're not david became kind of one of the main
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:55.240]   Voices of his very distinctive voice by the way. Listen. Yeah, unmute your audio. Uh, it's muted shoot
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:41:02.520]   So he's talking to the editors of vice who are pitching him on why vice is going to be such a great
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:05.240]   news source
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.240]   He's typing away
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:09.960]   david was such a great media analyst
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:15.960]   He understood new media like no one else he was a great voice for all of us
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:28.520]   I'm looking at human shit
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:34.600]   Warning there's a little profanity in this
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:42.040]   And then drink I guess I should just leave people though watches, but it's worth watching
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:47.720]   Yeah, and if you go to my blog post the video below that is shane smith and talking about how they
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:53.960]   at a cuny event at how they were actually buddies and uh david car wrote a piece later
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:59.400]   kind of admitting that that vice was worth paying attention they were doing a lot with news and
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:07.640]   Uh, so it's also an interesting video. It's fun. Smith said people like david car who speak their minds and tell the truth are few and far between there should be more
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:13.480]   Uh, david cars there is today. Unfortunately, David was amazing. He and I didn't agree about about some things occasionally
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:20.200]   Uh in in the movie page one he used what would google do as a prop for his laptop keyboard
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:23.480]   Uh, i think i've had a message
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:26.280]   I went to the i didn't go to get to go to the funeral, but I went to the wake
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:30.360]   And it was incredible absolutely jammed
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:36.200]   Uh carl bernstein standing to my left brian's still turn in front of me three editors of the new york times there
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:39.640]   He was a champion of stelter right uh very much so
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:44.920]   Uh a great line from page one that he said uh brian's stelter was a robot built to destroy me
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:52.600]   Um and then he mentored him and he mentored him like crazy and and and and with great mutual respect incredible
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:57.720]   And uh lina dunham spoke at the wake uh tom arnold spoke with the wake
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:02.840]   They've been friends for more than 30 years for the last 27 years didn't uh drink or do other nasty things
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:05.880]   Um, it's probably how they met so I would yes
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:11.480]   Yeah, they didn't their time, but uh, um, so was he's dave
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:15.320]   Was an incredible incredible character and the out pouring on twitter that night
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:20.440]   Uh that he died was unbelievable. Yeah, my lights are going out. Yeah, um
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:27.640]   By the way, that's not it's a pretty moment. That's not a metaphor or anything. Uh, his lights are actually going on
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:30.840]   So sorry
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:34.360]   You listening at home get those treats ready people
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:37.080]   Um, justice lights just went out
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:43.720]   Did you know them at all uh lina or no, I didn't just read them. Yeah read them religiously
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:45.320]   Um
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:47.880]   Yeah, very sad because I had just read his wonderful piece
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:52.920]   Uh in the times, you know, I started subscribing to the uh the paper version of the times last week
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:58.920]   And uh, you know, it's mind boggling. That's there's a lot of content every single day in that thing
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:01.240]   Why did why did why did you describe the baby?
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:07.000]   Just you know, we had uh on our uh on our little vacation lisa and I got the times every morning in the hotel room
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.080]   And I remember how much I love reading it what I forgot is how long it takes
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:17.240]   Yeah, but you know, I I I tweeted that somebody from the times editor from the times tweeted that uh,
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:20.760]   Who's doing the latin american stuff at the time is really interesting
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:23.720]   Uh lint paulver and she she tweeted that um
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:28.280]   Oh the new yorker she has a description of the new yorker, but she has never read the paper version
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:31.240]   She reads it online. So I turned around and asked and I said well
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:37.080]   Same thing here. The thing is that we subscribe to the print new york times because the deal is better
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:42.200]   Than just subscribing alone, but we don't read the print paper
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:47.400]   Now what this means from a business perspective is the times is artificially right um
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:53.320]   Holding up print for obvious reasons print subscribers are more valuable than digital subscribers
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:58.840]   At some point the advertiser is going to figure this out that some large proportion of times print subscribers
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:01.640]   Only subscribed to it to get the better deal on digital
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:05.880]   I did for a long time. I just got the sunday times and I would read and I wouldn't read it
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.640]   I would just read the the digital stuff
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:12.200]   But you don't get everything you get in the digital stuff where you don't see as much as you do
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:16.920]   When you have the paper there I think the app the android app is how I use it and it's just great
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:20.440]   And I wander through the times and I I give the same serendipity lint. What about you?
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:25.960]   Well, I used to get the weekend print, you know now I do the android app and sometimes mobile
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:33.320]   But I feel like with print the findability is is easier. That's just that's just my take on it in particular for me international stuff
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.360]   Like I felt like I was reading more when I did get the print yep
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:42.200]   Mike Elgin also gets the print version of the times and he and I were talking
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:46.280]   And uh, he says I don't think of it as a newspaper. I think it was the first draft of history
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:52.120]   It's online. I can't remember who said that there's my uh, there's my cup of coffee in the New York Times from I think yesterday
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:54.040]   um
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:58.840]   But but particularly for the news stories that I probably wouldn't read
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:01.880]   about greek debt
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:05.160]   And uh things like that I get because it's there and in front of me
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:09.960]   I think I get I read I know more about what's going on internationally than I would if I didn't have the print
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:15.320]   I have the times the new android beta here is that the paper duplicate or is that
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:20.520]   No, this is just a beta version of the paper that's digital. That's the whole paper
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:22.520]   And I hate that
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:26.760]   Um, but but but now what you do is is that you just swipe from section to section
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:32.520]   So you swipe and and roll and and and and that way it's a lot easier to find this herndipity
[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:35.000]   By the way speaking of swiping have you played with?
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.400]   We talked about this in the show uh, uh, uh, stem dance discover no
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:44.440]   Swipe left, uh
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:49.320]   Yeah, well, I think we did talk about this because neck built was on a couple of weeks ago
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:52.040]   Uh, and he just written on the whole for the times
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:58.280]   He explained to you why do you snapchat? Yeah, and uh, and uh, I think this is a brilliant
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:03.240]   Monetization strategy for snapchat, but you know what I stopped using it
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:05.240]   You know why because I want stuff to live on
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:12.200]   If i'm gonna put all the time and energy into making a video. I don't want it to go away in 24 hours. Oh you stories
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.040]   But the stories go away
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:20.360]   Don't they so it news is fish rap leo's no I was doing stories
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:24.920]   And I was doing you know like it is story me making spaghetti and making spaghetti sauce
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:30.520]   My thing 24 hours even I think lint unless i'm really wrong the stories are gone after 24 hours too
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:33.560]   Yeah, everything's gone. It's public. I made it public
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:36.920]   Right, but I would rather use instagram or or uh,
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:39.960]   There are other apps, uh, is it storehouse?
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:43.800]   I love storehouse where you can take a story publish it and is there forever?
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:46.600]   I'm not fish rap
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:50.760]   Well, you may not be but
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:56.760]   Um, the stories that appear there aren't newsy. I I think it's starting good
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:01.480]   I think it's really interesting what care where katie kurik is doing with yahoo news for instance
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:04.680]   Which is a whole newscast and you swipe you swipe you swipe and you're done
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:08.840]   It makes more sense for me if I think about my son for instance
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:12.120]   Who's 20 is really into snapchat all his friends are that's their app
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:15.880]   They don't they use it to almost the exclusion of everything else
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:19.400]   And um, I can see him looking at the espn
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:22.520]   property
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:26.360]   It's just so weird
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:29.080]   Is it?
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:31.080]   Roll up roll up
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:36.520]   The president
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:38.520]   Isn't it?
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.520]   It's just so fluid
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:44.360]   The opposite of the print version of the new york times though. I mean talking about no substance
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:51.400]   Uh, yeah, but well, well, but let's compare it to tv news. Well, I don't watch tv news either
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:58.280]   All right. All right, uh, no, I think it's very interesting and I got very engaged in it
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:01.960]   After Nick showed me how to use it and create stories. Lynn. This is what you do for a living
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:05.400]   Do you council uh brands and people and companies to use snapchat?
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:08.360]   Um stories. Yeah, definitely
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:15.240]   I mean, it's a great way to do a breaking story, right? Uh, especially if you're a brand that uh, caters to younger people
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:18.520]   Well, that's the thing. It's how you can reach 18 to 25 year olds basically
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:22.040]   It's the only way you can reach 18 to 25 year olds
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:25.800]   Uh, what do you get if you do um
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:30.520]   If you do this, you know brand thing with snapchat, do you get numbers?
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:33.720]   Uh, you know engagement numbers or views
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:34.760]   We don't know yet. I mean
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:39.080]   The thing that you need to do that these companies all need to do is they need to
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:42.520]   They do need to find ways that you have a business benefit in terms of not just
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:45.320]   A mottits snapchat. It's only for discovery, right?
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:46.520]   And and
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:50.920]   But you need to find there needs to be some linkage to you in some way there needs to be
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:53.560]   There needs to be more discussion of that, but nonetheless
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:57.560]   Yeah, the idea of making everybody come to you and your website
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:02.280]   Uploaded well, I know that that's why we're redoing our whole web
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:04.760]   Presence
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:08.440]   Just as I said, it's why I said, you know, websites are dead now you're spending
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:12.760]   A billion dollars on yours. No, no, no, we're not though. That's the pull point
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:19.160]   We're spending this out of the api on the api on a public api which the website is one consumer of but not the only consumer of
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:24.840]   Right, but I did I did tell our news division. I said I talked to mike and and megan. I said, you know, you really ought to think about
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:29.480]   Uh doing a little snapchat news. Mm-hmm. But what would we gain from that?
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:31.320]   Discovery
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.280]   That's exactly
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:39.560]   I'm I mean, that's what that's what all of using all of social media is about right. It's about discovery right so how are they gonna discover us
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:45.160]   Use the right types of uh tags, right
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:50.840]   Okay to be to be a part of certain discussions. Okay, that's how they discover the tags. Okay
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:53.640]   Do you deal with the snapchat do tags?
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:57.560]   No
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:04.200]   I don't know how the only way I know to discover somebody on snapchat is to pay a lot of money to be part of that explore pitch
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:08.520]   You have to be you have to you have to spend some money just like you know facebook early days
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:12.040]   You you had to spend money to be a really big brand on facebook
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:15.000]   Yeah, baritone day and uh nik are both using uh
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:22.200]   snapchat to do interesting things, but it makes me sad because whatever they do however interesting it is 24 hours from now
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:23.800]   It's gone forever
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:28.200]   But that's why you have to create these things in more than one way, right?
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:31.480]   You have to okay, you have to tell you have to tell a story
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:34.760]   on different platforms
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:37.560]   Makes a lot of sense to me
[01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:40.440]   Because you're gonna reach a young
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:48.120]   Younger demographic that just doesn't watch tv or read the web or any of this stuff. They you know youtube maybe
[01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:56.680]   Oh, they all use messaging messaging that they my kids. I'm telling you they love snapchat. They don't use anything else
[01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:01.720]   I asked them to use twitter. We'll use it to talk to each other to fool around, but we don't really use it
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:04.200]   Facebook are you kidding? That's where parents are
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:08.840]   It's snapchat snapchat. Let's point out in the news
[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:15.400]   Got ridiculed for turning down three billion dollars from facebook and and it's lead us around and uh rumored or announced i'm not sure
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:20.920]   Which today it's 19 billion valuation they said they're gonna raise half a billion dollars
[01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:26.760]   That will give them evaluation of 19 billion. You know what that's less than what's app?
[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:31.640]   Right now that valuable. I think they are right now. The problem is it's just right now
[01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:36.920]   It's about time. It's like OMG pop get it while you can
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:44.040]   Wow, I ended up uh, I was gonna close this thing out about an hour ago. Okay, let's stuff

[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:28.360]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis has a number the number is 300
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:30.760]   300 androids
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:39.160]   What 300 androids? What is it all singing in unison? So we watch if you go to the second video 40 seconds in
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:41.640]   They start music
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:45.400]   Okay, an androids chorus. This is in japan
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:51.160]   Googles head of device marketing did this let's go about 40 seconds in and listen
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:59.720]   Who is it that went?
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:03.480]   Real quickly to all of the androids and push start
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:05.640]   I know
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:07.800]   Van a white that's who how do they do that?
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:13.240]   So funny. I like the android ad campaigns they've been doing lightly frankly. They have a
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:18.040]   I say don't understand the animals as friends one at all, but it's cute
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:22.120]   I love it and it's like be together, but not the same. I like that
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:28.040]   It celebrates diversity, but everybody should use a google product even if you
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:32.280]   Even if you want to be diverse use a google product
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:36.600]   300 the number of androids devices in this video
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:41.800]   It feels like it's a small world after all is that my imagination
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:46.360]   I do love how the android character is is
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:48.360]   durable enough
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:50.360]   To kind of cross all these instances
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:59.000]   Well, you you knew that Jason how when you use these for your all about androids and logos and stuff. Yeah, that's androidify androids
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:05.000]   It's called androids and you can go in there and you know, it's like from a ton of different hairstyles and
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:10.200]   Here's the watch or whatever. Here's the chat room. Here's has given us
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:15.160]   This is the new ad which I really like is the high five. I haven't seen this one actually. Let me stop the house
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:17.960]   300 androids
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:27.080]   I like this because it's all like happy people and it doesn't even mention the products hardly at all
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:33.000]   We're not we're not apples knots. We're happy. We don't need to sell a product
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:37.240]   We just need to show happy people and you too will be happy
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:46.200]   Seeing this a lot I've seen it like crazy on the Grammys
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:50.520]   It's a really very soft sell
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:57.240]   Although some of these are YouTube videos like that or Robosize. Uh-huh. So maybe there's a subtle
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:00.920]   YouTube plug
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:03.880]   I
[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:09.400]   I'd like to be the person who has that job
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:12.440]   That's it. That's the ad
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:15.160]   Amazing
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:21.240]   Lynn, have you uh, do you use or anything you'd like to tell us about something you find cool or interesting or
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:23.800]   Wonderful in the world
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:28.280]   Well, I've been on a slight digital hiatus lately. That's a good thing
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:32.760]   But other than that, I've been using slack a lot lately
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:37.160]   Wait, is that a hot product from Stuart Butterfield one of the founders of flicker
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:41.160]   Yeah, I mean I find it really useful using it
[01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:47.320]   To talk to work with clients on projects as well as you know to talk with friends like friends and groups although
[01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:51.800]   Twitter, I think launched their groups feature a little bit too late
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:53.160]   um
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:57.880]   Some friends and I are using slack in that way and I'm using them with other teams as well as clients. So
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:03.720]   I'm really I'm really digging it. Uh, and you know, you can integrate all of your cloud services
[01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:06.440]   basically with it to share files so
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:09.720]   It's really it helped streamline productivity
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:12.920]   Right on
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:15.000]   Slack I haven't used it
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.760]   I have to give it a try
[01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:19.720]   I agree google groups. I used to use yahoo groups like crazy
[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:23.000]   And google groups just came along a little too late in the
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.960]   Game. I wish they had to come sooner
[01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:32.680]   Um trying to think of what's uh, what's the latest thing from google? I'm using push bullet a lot
[01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:34.360]   I don't know if you guys are familiar with pushball
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:37.800]   We've mentioned this before but it's gotten better and better and better
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:40.600]   You put push bullet and push push bullet
[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:45.560]   On your android device. I bet you it was in the android arena Jason at some point
[01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:48.120]   I know it's a it's a show favorite. It's a classic
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:54.200]   You put it on your android device and then you put it in your chrome extension and you'll get notifications
[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:59.960]   From your phone to your desktop. You'll get you can actually send notifications to your phone from your desktop
[01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:07.080]   Um, it is a really slick way of communicating and they've really increased the capabilities
[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:09.880]   Um of this
[02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:14.040]   So i'm i'm gonna admit something here. So I saw suddenly out of nowhere. It said
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:17.640]   Thank you for installing push bullet and I said I didn't install push bullet
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:23.800]   Or installing push bullet and I got freaked so I just uninstalled it quickly to make sure I wasn't wondering how that happened
[02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:26.600]   I don't know. Maybe it was a new version and it does something
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:32.920]   So one of the things about chrome because you log in is if somebody installs push bullet on one chrome and installs on all grooms
[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:34.200]   Yes
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:39.480]   Uh, by the way speaking of chrome style. Okay. Go ahead. So you know how I get driven
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:42.920]   Not spy the accounts he is to under fix google
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:45.000]   um
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.680]   And I was going crazy that even when I was not signed in to my
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:50.920]   gmail account
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:56.120]   Anywhere on the machine every time I opened something new was to fall into gmail defaulting a gmail not to my apps account
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:01:02.200]   Finally figured out. I think it was uh hangouts the hangouts app on chrome. Yeah
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:05.800]   It's signed into my gmail account. Ah
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:11.240]   So even though the machine was signed into my apps account everything on the machine was signed in my apps account
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:14.600]   It started defaulting everything to my gmail account. Wow
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:18.040]   Which means that I like what I was saying was send me a link to a document
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:19.800]   I couldn't open it up
[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:25.400]   Because it wouldn't let me open it up in the account that it had been sent to wow would go to gmail account
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:29.720]   Google google google lovely guys
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:31.240]   I
[02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:33.240]   I think i've fixed this
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:35.960]   So, uh
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:39.800]   One other thing about push bullet there is a mac app now, which is nice a desktop app
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:45.640]   But also if you go to the push bullet partners page you can for instance have things like subscribe to notifications
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:47.640]   Whether if or google buys something
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:51.720]   Subscribe to a google acquisition notification
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:59.160]   Yahoo acquisition twitter acquisition facebook apple acquisition so you'll know before I these are very useful for us frankly
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:04.840]   Um, but there's a lot of now this partner page is great. I mean you can find out all sorts of stuff
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:08.600]   Uh the amazon free app of the day updates to cyanogen mod
