[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff Jarvis is here. Kevin Tofel filling in for Stacey.
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.360]   We will take a look at Mary Meeker's annual slideshow 333 slides. We'll pick our favorites.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.680]   That's really kind of some interesting trends on the internet. The New York Times got it all
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:23.120]   wrong about Google News. Jeff will explain the Pixel 4 has been leaked and we finally figured out
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.360]   who Stadia is for. It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.280]   to talk about today. Let's kick this thing off. Jeff Jarvis is here. He is the director of the
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.600]   Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.600]   the City University of New York. And he's mad as hell and he's not going to take it anymore.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.400]   I don't know what I'm mad about yet but I'm only... Have you seen Network yet with Brian Cramps? Oh
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.800]   I guess it closed. No I haven't. You missed it. I didn't make it. You know Colleen here in our
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:09.120]   office, our supervising producer, saw the last night. Oh she says it was really good. I said shut up.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.760]   That's Kevin, the turtle of Kevin Toful, the Torvall turtle,
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.760]   turtle from about crumbooks.com and of course it's co-host on the IOT podcast with... My Chrome Hero.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.160]   And his Chrome Hero. That's nice. That's my goal in life Jeff, is to be your Chrome Hero.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.680]   And you've succeeded. You are the wing beneath his trackpad, the wind...
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.640]   So Jeff I thought I'd start with your... That New York Times story. And that is hell.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.480]   And I'm not going to take it anymore. You're right. Your response. This... You know it was kind of
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.160]   weird that New York Times just printed what has essentially oppressed release without any...
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.120]   With conflict of interest up the ying yang for its own industry but you should explain it first.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:09.280]   Headline, Google made $4.7 billion from the news industry in 2018. Study says. And the study of
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.960]   course is from the news media alliance. Formerly the newspaper association of America has
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.080]   finally changed their name. Yeah and it comes from I think a false premise which is
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:28.000]   that when Google shows snippets from news articles and its search results, the money it makes from
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.160]   those ads, Google should give some of that to the newspapers. It gets worse and worse.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.760]   They... Yes, they presume that the value is in the snippet or as I said in the post I wrote that
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.920]   it's as if if you take one sentence of theirs, it's like a camera taking a picture and stealing the
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.600]   soul of a native. You take it all the value out. And so that's problem one. So obviously
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.120]   all the value is the opposite. So there's sort of an argument like see all these ways that Google's
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.480]   gotten more interested in news. They're doing more news and more news and more news. But it's
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.360]   all good for the news industry. Yeah because it's more traffic to news people, right? As you point
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.840]   out every month, every month, this is from Google's statement, they're talking about the
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.360]   $4.7 billion. These back-of-enveloped calculations are inaccurate as a number of experts are pointing
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.360]   out. And really that's true after the Times published that everybody jumped on. The overwhelming
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.840]   number of news queries do not show ads. Number one, the study ignores the value Google provides.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.800]   And this is I think the most important point. Every month, Google News and Search drives over
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:45.040]   10 billion clicks to publish his websites. Now let's add to that Leo. That number is eight years old.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.160]   Wow. It is much higher now, but I couldn't get that number out of them now. I tried.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.000]   Much higher now. And we know because was it France? Was it Spain? Where did they cut off Google?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.360]   Spain. Spain. And it killed traffic by 10 or 20%. It was a big flop.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:11.760]   So the next fallacy of this whole thing, the basic logic of it falls apart in the second paragraph.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.200]   Google's paying more attention to news. They should pay us more. No, Google already is paying
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.240]   you more, but give you more traffic. All flop from that on. But the real statistical travesty of this
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:31.040]   is they relied entirely on a 10 year old offhand comment in some conference made by Marissa Meyer,
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.120]   remember her, where she was just trying to be nice to news and saying, yeah, yeah, we're not
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.800]   crazy to have news. I don't know how to be worth $100 million. So they used that and then
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.880]   extrapolated that. And so well, Google's grown this much. They use data from two publishers.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.520]   It's grown this much. Ergo, it's now worth $4.7 billion. The entire thing is flawed to flawed to
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.320]   flawed. Now, normally I would just write that off as well in the New York Times. They're one of
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.600]   them newspapers and this is in a conflict of interest self-serving. But they're publishing this.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.160]   They publish a study on Monday because the House Subcommittee on Tuesday,
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.680]   having a hearing and the news alliance hopes, in fact, the director of the news alliance said he
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.200]   hoped an outcome of any conversation generated by the study would be the passage of a bill,
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.760]   a law, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, which would give news publishers a four-year
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.560]   antitrust exemption and allow them to collectively bargain with Google and other online platforms
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.440]   over revenue splitting. Because if you go all together, it's collusion.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.600]   Right. And so they're arguing that Google's antitrust. So what's the cure to antitrust? More
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:53.120]   antitrust. It's all just ridiculous. And the real problem here is that it's, and I get the
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.840]   sum trouble for criticizing publishers. And a lot of them do try and editors do try. And this is
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.280]   really hard and we don't have the answers. I don't have the answers. But this is not the answer.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.400]   Protectionism is no strategy for the future. It's distracting from their real job, which
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.480]   to serve the public and figure out new ways to do that. And you know what? Even if they got
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.920]   $4.7 billion and divided by all the members of the news media alliance, it's nothing,
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:24.320]   nothing. There is no solution here. There is no answer here. Basically, the Americans are jealous
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:32.000]   that Europe has its European copyright directive with its horrible clauses. And I had just come from
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.880]   Google Newsgeist, full disclosure, Google pays for the venue, the food, and a lot of drinks.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:44.880]   Isn't that ironic? But we pay for our travel. I pay for my travel. In Athens. Very nice, by the way.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.960]   Great, grilled sardines. Oh, I want to ask since this fall, you'll have to give us the...
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.520]   Oh, okay. I wish I knew more. I was there for two and a half days.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:58.800]   But 20 minutes at the Acropolis. But I sat in a room filled with European editors and publishers
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.600]   who are scared, S-less, over what the copyright directive is going to do to them because they're
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.640]   sitting there in the room saying, "Well, this demands that Google licenses and pays for snippets."
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.560]   Google's saying, "They ain't doing that. No way we're doing that. We didn't do it in Spain. We're
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.360]   not doing that." So then what's the extension of that? Does Google at some point pull... Not just
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:24.080]   pull Google News out, but do they say, "We can't really put in snippets and decent links to news
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:30.320]   sites that haven't given us a license throughout search." So who suffers? The publisher suffer,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.400]   the journalist suffer, the public suffers. Good work industry.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:42.800]   Apparently, there's a bilateral support in Congress for this bill. Now, this doesn't mean
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.720]   they'll be able to make a deal. They'll succeed because the same thing is going to happen here.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.120]   They're going to say, "Hey, us Google." And Google's going to say, "No." We already give you value.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:56.400]   And you publishers should be smarter about how to exploit those relationships. And they weren't,
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.560]   so what did Google do? Google came along and they created Google and subscribed with Google
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.920]   to make it really, really easy to subscribe instantly from Google Pages just because the
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:12.400]   publishers were too busy to figure out how to do this on their own. They're busy.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:19.840]   That's it, that was nice to me, wasn't it? And Google, I think Google takes 5% fee, something
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.720]   ridiculously little just to cover their costs. That's it. And they've been doing that. But the
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:31.760]   bigger issue here is that this is an example of what public news publishers are doing to ruin
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:42.480]   the internet. And it's happening over and over and again. And it occurred to me, Leo and Kevin,
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:48.800]   that-- so I appeared on MSNBC yesterday about this. And when the antitrust argument is made,
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.400]   the problem is that everybody now thinks that Google and Twitter are the internet. They're not.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   Though what you do to them, you do to the internet is an issue. But I sat there at an NBC studio and
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:07.360]   I said Comcast is an internet company. AT&T is an internet company, Amazon's internet company.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.800]   Soon Washington Post and New York Times will be internet companies. There's lots of internet
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.360]   companies out there. So when you talk antitrust, let's talk about the whole internet and all the
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.000]   functions of the internet. And I think it's hard to argue antitrust, but that's what's happening in
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.760]   Congress. And the result as publishers are using their political capital in conflict at
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:32.320]   interest, corruptly, corruptly, knowing they have the click the clout they have to attack
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:38.880]   not just Google and Facebook, but also the net itself and how it operates. And I have had it.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:46.080]   I am at as hell in my own damned industry. And I'm pissed. And I was far from alone. There were
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:53.120]   a lots and lots of tweets and posts. So I was flying back from Athens. Like 10 minutes before I
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.400]   got on, I see tweets from my friend Aaron Pilhoe for MJ Rosen about this. And Jay's saying,
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:05.280]   you got to get on this. So I'm on the plane with the with with with 100 BOD internet.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:12.000]   Trying to follow all these links and fair what's what I spend most of the flight back from Athens,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.840]   writing this post because I'm just so pissed off at my own industry. What was the outcome
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:28.000]   in Spain? The outcome of Spain was that so so I'll say it just because you love to hear me say it.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.400]   In Germany, the Leistungschütterecht, the ancillary copyright said that
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:42.000]   the publisher actually grant a license to to allow the snippets. Publishers goes to Google and says
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:51.040]   pay us for snippets. Google says, ah, kind big, no way. And so then publishers pulled out of Google
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:59.040]   for literally a few days, hurt like hell, came back and said, okay, uncle, put us back up. In Spain,
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:07.520]   there was no option for a free license. Spain decreed that the platforms must pay every basically
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.080]   everyone in news that they quote. That's another way to negotiate get the get the
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.360]   legislator to do it. Well, what happened was Google said, we won't do it. We can't do it
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   no way. And thus they closed Google News in Spain. And there have been many reports since that this
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.520]   hurt, especially small publishers. You know, the big guys in all of these discussions with Google
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.440]   and Facebook are the biggest publishers, the New York Times, the Washington Post, they can deal
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.880]   with a lot. But I sat in at Newsguised Europe and there were small publishers there who are
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.600]   hurting already. And these things when they come along cause just huge
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:48.640]   tourists and cost for them. So it reduces the diversity of the news ecosystem at the time when
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.920]   we need it most. And it's shortsighted and I competitive and it's stupid. If Google decided to
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:00.320]   take snippets from our podcasts and push them in search results, I would kiss their feet.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:07.440]   I would be so happy. Why wouldn't you be happy? Right? It was a link to the show.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.640]   And I mean, that would be the best thing Google could ever do. I'm happy that they're even thinking
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:19.680]   about indexing the podcasts at all. That's a great example. That's a superb example of a parallel
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:25.440]   about how that's going to be extremely helpful to you. You get more involved in search.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:31.600]   Yeah. So it seems to me almost rent seeking like they think Google's rent seeking. In other words,
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:37.440]   not adding value and asking for money. But of course they're not. It's really the other way around.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.280]   Google's giving you value and you're saying, well, you should pay us for the value you're giving us.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:47.840]   Yeah. That's money. Yeah, it's discovery. I am one of those small publishers, very small
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.480]   publishers. And I just love to know. You're big in my mind, Kevin. You're very big in my mind.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.360]   Thank you, sir. Thank you. About 35% of my traffic comes from Google News.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:07.200]   That's not insignificant. Number one. Number two, I wonder, and Jeff, maybe you've seen a real
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.760]   study because I don't buy this anymore than anybody else does, the one that we addressed earlier.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:19.280]   Is there a study showing how many people maybe who don't subscribe to news sites,
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:25.200]   but still go there as a result of Google News or Apple News or some other, you know, internet
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:31.360]   discovery mechanism? I'm guessing it's quite high. Yeah, the problem with this is that you're
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.800]   kind of proving a negative. The contrary argument that's made is how many people just see the snippet
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.200]   and don't go? You're saying the opposite. How many do you see the snippet and go? You don't know
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.800]   what they wouldn't have seen? In a way, you know what I'm saying? I go every that happens to me
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:54.480]   every day. I look at a snippet and go to a story, but I'm a very specific use case.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:01.440]   But I mean, it is part of our beat check. I go to Tech meme and sites like it.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:08.560]   And I want to see a new source. I see like, here's Tech meme with top tech news, right?
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.960]   It's got snippets. I want to see the snippets. It also has links to competing stories from other
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.360]   places. You might prefer another brand. Yeah, it has. So Kevin tweets. This is all good for everybody.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:27.120]   This is just driving. So Kevin, there was a study, somebody from a certain large company,
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.800]   we happen to be discussing and told me, but didn't have the details and didn't remember
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.840]   who was from. So this take this with a grain of salt the size of Utah, because I don't know the
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:42.160]   details, but did say that there was a study in Europe that valued the clicks. Now, I don't know,
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.240]   the problem is, I can't see the study. I can't know what level is it, just new users,
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.280]   is it a user, but in the range of like four to five euro for whatever definition that was.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:59.040]   There's a tangible value for a link, but the only way to exploit that link is if the publisher
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:07.920]   does so. And if the publisher is going to show you, you know, junk links and 55 ads,
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.400]   then you're going to lose them. The publisher's job is to try to start to build a relationship
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:18.080]   with you and find your lifetime value. We're going to get to Mary Meeker's thing in a minute,
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:25.760]   but one thing that's emphasized is the customer acquisition cost. She said it goes up above
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.160]   lifetime value and that's unsustainable. When you get somebody from Google that is free
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.280]   customer acquisition, free, that's where the value is. Yeah, right.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.720]   My bigger, so there's two issues. One is, you don't like Congress to get involved in this because
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.040]   they're apparently just going, "Oh, okay." Maybe because maybe, I don't know,
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:51.440]   is this newspaper alliance pays members of Congress's money, which would be unheard of,
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:57.680]   but probably the case. But also because there are reasons to be upset about Google and their
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:02.160]   monopoly. And there are things perhaps Congress should get involved with. This is not one of them.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:08.800]   This is a special interest case that I just don't think benefits anybody. It's stupid.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:15.520]   By the way, I have to admire Google. Well played, sir. This morning, I woke up to see
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:23.920]   images of a Pixel 4 phone from Unbox Therapy and other places. It was really,
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.320]   it's the usual leaks we get because the Pixel wouldn't probably come out to October, but the
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:34.480]   leaks we usually get around this time as they start putting out models for case makers. So it was that.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:40.000]   And Google responded to me by Google Twitter feed, "Well, since there seems to be some interest,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.560]   here you go." They said actual pictures of the back of the Pixel 4, which I just,
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:49.200]   I mean, that's the way to handle it. There's still lots of things they didn't tell anybody.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.360]   There's no way to know if there's a headphone jack. We're not seeing the front of it,
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.880]   so we don't know what kinds of affordances there are. You can only see one button.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:03.120]   So there's a lot of question marks. What a great way to handle a leak like that. I've never heard
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.440]   of a company doing that. That's kind of a nice exchange there with Marcus Brownlee.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.720]   Yeah, he says, "At least let me drop my Dream Phone 2019 video first."
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.520]   And Google responds. The year's not over.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:21.920]   Pretty good Google. Well played. It also makes me wonder if maybe October is not the
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:27.920]   day. That's when they released the previous Pixel phones. Maybe they're thinking, since they announced,
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.280]   well, I guess it would still make sense to do it later in the year they just announced the Pixel
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:39.440]   3A. But they could do it. Yeah, I wouldn't think they'd follow up the 3A launch with Pixel 4
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.920]   a month or two later. I still think October. October. Yeah.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.960]   But they are kind of going to different markets. I mean, this will be, this will, I'm sure,
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.360]   be an expensive high end. I hope Google's going to do what others are doing now and do a high end
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.160]   and a less expensive version. That would be fantastic.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.360]   I mean, but it's, you know, I really like my 3A.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:04.720]   I can't say that I see huge difference between it and the 2XL that I had, but who cares? It's new
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:13.520]   and I love new. So it's really nice. But if a 4 comes out, you know, the other question that
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.560]   the Poulter Rott brought this up, yes, earlier on Windows Weekly is, why doesn't Google tie the
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.360]   release of its high end flagship phone to the release of the Snapdragon it's going to run on?
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.080]   At this point, it's coming out kind of toward the end of life of the Snapdragon.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:34.400]   Yeah. A lot of the phone makers and even computer makers fall into this trap of chip cycles.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:41.280]   And you can tell who's got the most pull with the chip makers because they're the ones who come
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:47.280]   out early in the cycle. They pre-buy or commit to buying, you know, 50 million Snapdragons or
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:53.280]   Core i5s, whatever the case may be, or they have their own chips like Samsung with Exynos. So
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:20:01.120]   they're in a very enviable position of having a high market, you know, percentage, plus they have
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:06.640]   their own chips to rely on. So they go in March or April. Everybody else has to follow along.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:12.960]   Right. And to do it in October is to basically say, well, you're not going to have the latest
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:20.240]   chip, but hey, it's from Google. Isn't that determined by the holiday shopping schedule?
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.080]   Maybe. Are they stuck? I mean, if you're going to change something, change the chip schedule.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:32.080]   So Sam does the Galaxy S phones in the spring and does a fall release of the note?
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.840]   And that's been worked pretty well for them. I don't know. Anyway, they have lots of products
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.640]   whereas Google basically has a Google's one of them. Something's wrong with the chip.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.320]   Then you save yourself from it. Well, that's true. But they the chip comes out in the spring,
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:51.280]   comes out around March. You want some time to expose any problems. I think, of course, it's right.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:21:00.880]   Yeah, like a whole year. Oh, it's really locked down now. Let's take a break. We have Mary Meekers
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:06.480]   333 slide. Future of the internet. I brought dinner because I feel we're going to be here
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.640]   at about nine o'clock. Yeah, we're not going to go through every slide, but I am counting on you
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:16.880]   and Kevin to tell me what the important slides are. Because I had planned last night, it was good.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:24.240]   I was going to watch the it's like just the even ones, even the even Jeff will be on and we'll
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:31.600]   so Mary Meeker who is before we take the break just to set this up. Who is Mary Meeker, Jeff?
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:38.720]   She was a famous analyst. Then she was a planner Perkins. Then she left planner Perkins as the
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:45.760]   basis of a new company. And she's just the the Mondo analyst of digital internet technology.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.880]   And this how many years has been coming out? God, it feels like we do it every year for a
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.760]   whole year. Oh, we do. She comes out with this 300 plus page PowerPoint every once a year. And
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:04.160]   it's very well done. It's very valuable. She also became famous because back when she was an analyst,
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:12.800]   she made some right on predictions, right? And people she got the reputation, which is easy to
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:19.120]   get and oddly hard to lose that she's really prescient. But I don't think she does that as I
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:24.800]   mean, I tend to dismiss the notion of futurists. I can't imagine a more heuristic job title.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.160]   I see the future. I don't think she does that so much as she just sees the current trends
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:40.640]   and notes them. She was an analyst at Morgan Stanley. And in 1995, she foresaw how the internet
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:46.240]   was going to change everything basically. And they called her the Nostradamus of technology.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:53.520]   In fact, she made a lot of money for Morgan Stanley because in 1995, who went public? Oh, yeah,
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:02.080]   Netscape, Priceline later Google, they got in on those IPOs. She also recommended Amazon,
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:09.440]   AOL, Intuit and Dell. So she had, she made a lot of money for Morgan Stanley with her predictions.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:17.680]   So she's, it's gotten longer. This article is in from 2012 and by Stephen Levy and Wired
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:26.080]   from 2012 or seven years ago, at that time, it was 99 slides in 20 minutes. This year, 333
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:32.000]   slides. And I'd be curious, actually, this is back when she was a client. I'd be curious to see
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.320]   how much she got right in 2012. But we'll leave that. There's a lot to do just to go through
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.440]   today's slides. So we'll talk about some of Marymaker's predictions and what you all think of them
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.400]   in just a second. But first, I got a prediction. More and more people are going to be using
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:52.320]   virtual private networks. There's two reasons you'd want to use one one for your security,
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:57.520]   especially when you're on an open access point at a coffee shop or you're at a hotel or on a cruise
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:02.240]   ship or, you know, just anywhere where you're joining in a Wi-Fi network, others are on. That
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:07.920]   means they're on your network too. And so you're, there's some risks involved. If it's Wi-Fi,
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:14.400]   your data is flying through the air plus because of the nature of networks, people can actually see
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.560]   your computer on there and they're trying to attack it. And there are some really interesting
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:24.000]   attacks out there on Wi-Fi networks, even of machines that are secure, just look up the Wi-Fi
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.400]   pineapple and get some idea of what you can do with that thing. So that's one reason you might
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:33.920]   want to run a VPN. The other one is for privacy. A VPN encrypts all your traffic from your computer
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:40.800]   to the VPN server so that your internet service provider, your carrier, anybody, you know, in that
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:46.320]   area, anyone in between you and that server can see what you're up to and can sell that to the
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.640]   highest bidder. We know carriers and ISPs often do that. So that's another reason people use
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:57.600]   a VPN. There's a third reason, geographic restrictions. Express VPN allows you to
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:04.400]   enter the public internet from many different countries. They have servers all over the world.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:10.160]   So you can bypass geographic restrictions on a lot of, let's say you're, you're somewhere and you
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.240]   want to watch Netflix, but you're out of the country or maybe you're in the US and you want
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:19.440]   to watch the BBC's iPlayer. There's some really cool reasons you might want to use a VPN. Now,
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.200]   here's what you're looking for in a VPN, something that protects your privacy and security.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:29.840]   What Leo, you say, I thought all VPNs did that. Well, I wish it were true. Unfortunately,
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:35.760]   some VPNs are not well run. They're not well secured. We've heard problems with VPNs in the past,
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.680]   never express VPN. The other problem, they leak IP addresses. The other problem is, frankly,
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:47.040]   some VPN people are not scrupulous. And so especially if you're getting a cheaper free VPN,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.560]   often they are taking that information and selling it. See all the stuff that you
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:56.720]   kept from your ISP now is going through the VPN provider. Express VPN does none of that. They
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.440]   secure an anonymizer in an app browsing, they encrypt your data, they hide your public IP address,
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.560]   and they never log, they know nothing about you, or they don't want to. So that if
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:11.760]   ever anybody asks, they say they could just say, I don't know. It's really the other thing I think
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:17.040]   that's great as pure convenience is they have apps for every platform. It takes one click to turn
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:22.560]   it on, one click to turn it off. And because they have so many servers, more than anybody else,
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:29.760]   it's fast. Express VPN rated the number one VPN service by tech radar. I give it my two thumbs up,
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:35.760]   an absolute recommendation. And it comes with a 30 day money back guarantee. It is literally the
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.920]   best VPN in the world. It's the one you should be using protect your online activity today,
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.240]   and find out how you can get extra three months free when you buy a one year package at Express.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:49.120]   That's the best deal, by the way, to express VPN dot com slash twig, the number one most trusted
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:56.720]   VPN in the world. The one I use Express VPN dot com slash twig, three months free with a one-year
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:02.720]   package. We thank them for supporting this week in Google. And I thank you for supporting us by
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:11.680]   using that special URL Express VPN dot com slash twig. All right, should I pull up the slide show?
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:21.120]   I put my favorite link already there to slide number 22 slide slide number 22. Yes, that was mine too.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:26.560]   I happen to like this one. You're meeting the times or will if those of you listening will
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:32.160]   describe all the bars to you. It's cut off. It's media time versus advertising spending
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:45.280]   2010 and 2018. Okay. So should we start with 2010? Yes. Print had very low time spent 8%,
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:52.240]   but 27% of ad spend went there. Oh, interesting. More than three times what it deserved.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:57.280]   The advertisers were still spending in the old world. One old radio. It was the other way around.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:03.200]   Lots of times. 16% spent 11% ad spent. That TV was equal.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.840]   Forty forty three and forty three because advertisers understood TV. They knew what it was.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.640]   They got it. They they they cracked it markedly. And nobody ever got fired for buying the Super Bowl.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:21.120]   Right. Desktop time spent 25% advertising spend lagged that only 19% mobile.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:29.520]   8% time spent half a percent. Yes. Because nobody knew what it was yet. So that was the picture in 2010.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:41.120]   Now let's come to 2018 and start the other end of the chart. Now mobile is almost tied with TV at
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:48.480]   33% time spent. 33% ad spend. A third of time spent and a third of ad spend is mobile.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:55.440]   This is actually fairly critical. In fact, just moments ago, the amount of time spent watching
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:04.080]   screens on mobile bypassed that of TV just this month. So you're really starting to see this big
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.640]   seed change. What's interesting is that advertising spending has gone along with that. That's that's
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:15.120]   figured out. Right. Well, and desktop is also equal 18 and 18. There's another part of this
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:21.600]   story to me, which is it's very efficient. Yes. When both numbers are the same that and the reason
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:27.440]   it's so efficient on these digital platforms, I think, is because they know they they can measure
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.680]   it better than anything. You can go right. Yeah. So you know what you're getting.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:38.160]   I don't know why TV's been so efficient, but maybe I think I just used to it and they know it.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:44.640]   But then if you go to the old media, right, print has gone for time spent has gone from 8%
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:53.760]   to a mere 3% checks. Gutenberg is dead. Right. 3% print as spend 7%. So if I read the times on
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:59.040]   the web, that doesn't count. Does that not count? Okay. This is this is the medium used not the
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:06.400]   kind of I haven't read anything printed in a long time. Dead trees. Wow. What a radio is still
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:12.800]   undervalued a little bit. 12% of attention goes to it. 8% goes to the spend.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:19.200]   So those two are both cock-eyed. But this clearly becomes the mobile story going forward. And there's
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:26.000]   another slide elsewhere. The presentation that shows that in media viewing like video,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.880]   it's incremental growth in mobile. It's all new growth. It's phenomenal. That's
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.160]   feeling from TV and that's how people are watching things now. That's just interesting.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.200]   I think mobile stole not only from TV, but also from desktop.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:45.840]   So it's really become the platform. And I think that this trend in another 10 years is going to be
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:51.040]   70% mobile. It's going to be huge, right? It's going to double.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.640]   Yeah, you're going to watch everything on mobile. You're going to listen to things on mobile.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.600]   You're going to read things on mobile. Who needs these other media?
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.040]   I'm surprised people aren't sitting at their screens. I guess 34% is not bad.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.440]   Yeah, you don't want to have to go and get your news or whatever media it is. You want it in
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:11.840]   your pocket. That's the whole point and the whole thing here.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:18.880]   And again, it's incremental. It's feeling time when you couldn't have been consuming media before.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:27.440]   So Ronnie Mola at Recode picked out a few other interesting slides. There are now
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:36.160]   3.8 billion internet users in the world. Three really critical 51% now the majority of the world
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:43.120]   by 1%. Mostly most of the new growth, of course, is in mobile. A lot of people with smartphones,
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:47.920]   sales of smartphones, though, are declining because everybody's got one.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:54.320]   But still huge growth to be had. This is another slide in Asia and Africa.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.880]   So as big of China is gigantic now, killer now, and will only get much bigger.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:10.000]   This is more a victory lap than anything else, but 10 world's most valuable companies are tech
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:19.200]   companies. Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Tencent, those seven. And then there's
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:24.880]   Berkshire Hathaway, Visa, and Johnson and Johnson, which is it just barely made it.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:29.920]   So that's not a surprise, though, but Microsoft number one, in terms of market cap, I think,
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:36.880]   in Amazon and then Apple. E-commerce is 15% of retail sales, which this is actually a little
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:42.160]   surprising growth has slowed, but growth in regular retail was only 2%.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:47.840]   But growth has slowed. It's still growing. It's still growing. But you'd think with only 15%
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:56.080]   of all sales, it would still be growing at a growth pace. But you're still going to compete
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.440]   with the convenience of going to the right quarter store to buy.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.120]   Bread and milk is keeping the retail sales alive.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.240]   And they've already eaten most of the retail sales.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.040]   Right.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:12.000]   Their growth could slow because there's not that much more retail to swallow.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.880]   Well, but it's only 15% of the retail sales, though.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.360]   Oh, that's true.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.560]   So there's still a lot to go. That's what I kind of was thinking.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.880]   Internet ad spending has accelerated up 22% last year.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.320]   Most of the spending still on Google and Facebook, dang it.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.920]   But Amazon is--
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.320]   The year's the basic thing on this, Leo, for the slide.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:35.760]   Programmatic ad buying. Do I need to explain what that is to the audience?
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.480]   Yes. What is that?
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:43.760]   So, you know those ads that you see when you looked at some boots on Amazon and the friggin'
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.480]   boots follow you around for the next two months everywhere you go?
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.960]   That's a combination of retargeting and programmatic advertising.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.800]   Retargeting has a data point about you that as a cookie that knows,
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.280]   "Hey, she looked at boots. He looked at boots."
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:06.160]   But programmatic then is an automated, AI-powered, instantaneous trading floor,
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.720]   competitive trading floor bidding structure for ads.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.360]   Point being, you open up an ad page. There's a blank ad there.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:20.800]   The site says, "Hey, programmatic networks. I've got somebody who looked at boots. Who wants her?
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:26.400]   Who wants him?" And then all the traders come along and say, "Well, I'll bid this much.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:31.600]   I'll bid that much." And then one ad wins and then goes in there.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.560]   And that happens in the time it takes you to open the page.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.200]   Google invented this. And this was really--
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.800]   Well, Google and AppNexus.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.000]   AppNexus invented it too.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.640]   Oh, OK.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.120]   OK.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.120]   Google model. The auction model was Google's idea.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.720]   Yes, the auction model, but this programmatic-- there's no short of the trading floor.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:55.200]   So programmatic buying in MECR has gone up from 10% in 2012 to 62%
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:04.160]   last year. Now, I held an event at Newark School a few weeks ago. It was a follow-up to a post I
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:09.760]   wrote about the scorched earth of our media business models. And there was a chat about it,
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.160]   and I can't say who, but there was an ad exec there who scolded the room and media people.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.520]   These are high-level executives and said, "Why are you any of you using programmatic?"
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:27.040]   It's fading as we go here. It commodifies you. You shouldn't be on programmatic. But one of the
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:32.960]   ad VPs in the room said, "Sorry, bud, but you're right. I don't like using it, but that's where all
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:38.240]   the ad dollars go. And I got to follow where the ad dollars are." So the ad agencies are using
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:43.600]   programmatic because it's an easy way to get the best price publishers. Is it more effective, though?
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:50.960]   Well, that's an argument that goes on. I could see why Google loves it and Facebook loves it,
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:57.760]   because it maximizes their price. One of the challenges for old school media like us is to
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.400]   figure out, "Well, what should we charge for our ads?" But they have this automatic system that
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:08.000]   immediately, automatically, instantly maximizes it. They literally charge every penny the market
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.800]   will bear. The old media guys try to say that, "Oh, targeting's overdone. It doesn't really work.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:20.800]   I just saw some lobbyists in saying that just now because they want to say it's branding that
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:25.280]   works in a theater environment." But you look at a company like Meredith, which is another Meeker
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:31.440]   slide, they do a lot of this and they really target very well. And their revenue is going up
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:40.160]   and they bought Time Inc. So no, I think the targeting-- They do a lot of this as buying ads,
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:44.480]   not selling ads, or do they do programmatic. They're a Meredith is a publishing company,
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:49.280]   so they're normally selling ads. Selling, but they're doing it around data and they work with
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:56.160]   companies. This is one of Meeker's examples. And Meeker emphasizes strongly the personalization
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:01.120]   and targeting has real value. So yes, as far as we know now, it works. The problem is that it's
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:08.640]   an abundant space marketplace, so prices will keep falling. And this is why she emphasizes that
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:15.920]   and desperation will increase. So even so, customer acquisition cost goes down and that's why
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.880]   things like freemium are going to be better than advertising because it's all but free to the even
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:26.480]   to the-- We were talking before we were on the air, there's what's it called? DaVinci, a video
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:34.160]   platform, a video editing software that's free. And I would say, how could it be free? And Kevin
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:40.480]   and Leo school me that it has all this high end other stuff, freemium is essentially a free
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.960]   customer acquisition cost and advertising is going to be expensive. So I think advertising is going
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:53.440]   to end up suffering. And that means that Google and Facebook could suffer. And meanwhile, Amazon
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:58.480]   is a force in advertising suddenly now. And it knows more about users. So targeting is
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.080]   still going to be there, but it's going to be in a commodified abundant marketplace.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:09.200]   Sorry, I'm media walking out here. No, it's interesting. I have a little dog in this hunt
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:14.480]   because that's not how we sell advertising. So should I get out of this business, you think?
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:20.240]   In a sense, you kind of do though. You have a freemium product. I mean, there's a side on here
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:25.920]   about Zoom, for example, which she talks about for user conversion of paid subscribers. I mean,
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:30.640]   as Jeff said, there's no acquisition cost when you're doing it this way with Zoom. And
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:35.760]   they basically say, we just make our product freaking awesome. And we get conversions as a
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.920]   result of it that we focus on the product. More and more people are doing that. I love that.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:48.080]   Here's the strong platforms. Google growth 1.4 times, Facebook 1.9 times, still small in Google,
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:52.080]   but they're growing faster. And you know, who's really going fast? Amazon, Twitter,
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:59.840]   Snap, and Pinterest 2.6x. And this is the programmatic buying as a percentage of digital display.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:03.840]   In seven years, it went from 10% to 62%.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:11.920]   Which commodifies everything. Because it doesn't matter where that boot ad appears.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.560]   What they care about is that that person was interested in boots.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:19.360]   The content is irrelevant. As long as you get the eyeballs, you got to get eyeballs.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.400]   But you're the right eyeballs. That's the point of working.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.560]   It's a lead generator, right, Jeff?
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:29.680]   Yeah, that's what all advertising is in the end, right? And that's what this ad executive was
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:34.960]   saying about programmatic. He said, you're fools to be using it because it was invented really to
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:41.280]   create more inventory for commerce. It was created so the boot buyer could be found.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:46.640]   That was the idea. But then it was so easy for advertisers to go in. And they still loved the
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:50.000]   idea of getting all this inventory. And the publishers, the reason they went in
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.640]   is I heard them say this and I asked them, they said, well, this is great for us. We get to
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.600]   expose our inventory to all these new advertisers. We're not going out and selling. We don't get
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:04.800]   our off piece for them. So hey, it's new to us. Well, but the advertisers are the reader,
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.960]   don't really give a damn where their ad appears or where they are.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:16.960]   Yeah, but if you're a content creator, it helps you too, because whatever the audience you have,
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:23.120]   you can monetize, right? Because you may not have boot buyers, but surely if you have people
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:29.520]   listening, they're buying something. But in an abundant marketplace, more and more and more
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:36.320]   places come into these marketplaces. And that boot buyer could be anywhere and somebody's going
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.040]   to undercut you. But that's why you have to focus on your product, right? I mean,
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:47.360]   I focus on my content, Leo, you focus on your content and so on. If I make great content,
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.920]   keep people coming back, I don't care that there's an abundance because hopefully they're coming to me
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.400]   or, you know, and I get ad revenue.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:00.240]   The I get ad revenues, the tough part. Yeah.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:05.440]   As you get more efficient with programmatic buying, maybe you don't get ad revenue as the point.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:11.920]   That's the problem. That's exactly the problem. That's the last connection. That's a challenge.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.840]   Reasons for trying a new service is what you were talking about.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:21.520]   The best way to do it is free, free trial or tier. Now, this is a survey.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:27.760]   So this is this is a little softer number, but free trial or a free tier.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.800]   For online streaming. For online streaming is easily the best.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:37.360]   Content library access to exclusives. That's important because I think we all thought it was
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:43.280]   exclusives that drove traffic to people like Netflix, right? Good years of experience. No, free trial.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:51.520]   Free ad supported products. This is Spotify. She, by the way, Spotify, we should probably say
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:58.240]   is one of bonds investments, her company's investments. Our premium model accounts for
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:04.640]   about 60% of our gross says Spotify. I'm sorry, our gross added premium subscribers.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:12.880]   I remember during Phil Libbins reign at Evernote, he said, and I think this was a pretty common number
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:22.560]   5% pay. 95% don't. Right. Right. So you want to hold down the cost of that 95%? Right.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:30.720]   But you know you're going to get a solid 5. I don't know how this relates to that,
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.040]   but it's, but it sounds like the premium model is the way people start.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:39.840]   I think the New York Times conversion rate to paid is running a little over 2%.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:45.200]   For most newspapers in the US, the conversion to paid is running about 0.4%.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:51.040]   So a 5% conversion to paid is pretty impressive in that world.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:59.280]   Well, they say an interesting thing here too, as Spotify does, are the ad supported service
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.240]   subsidizes the costs of the free service, the new subscriber acquisition. So that's actually
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:08.560]   low, thus lowering your, your costs. Yeah, cost of acquisition.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:13.680]   Happy customers. Right. So the only thing you were talking about,
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:21.280]   yeah, stay there for one second. So if you're a newspaper and you get someone to convert,
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:27.120]   logic would say you should offer them an ad-free experience.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:34.160]   But those who convert are your most frequent users, and so they have a disproportionate amount of
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:39.040]   your traffic and inventory. So they don't want to take away the ad. So you still give the payers
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.560]   the same kind of crappy experience. You give everybody. That sounds like Hulu.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.840]   Yeah. There you go. Big old companies running Hulu. Yep.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.560]   They don't know. They finally added a more expensive ad-free tier.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:44:00.960]   If freemium, so this is Zoom, free to join when paid user hosts. We really want to get customers
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.120]   to test our products really hard to get customers to try it without a freemium model.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.400]   Yeah. That's what you were saying.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.240]   Reasons for trying a new subscription box.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:17.520]   Recommended by someone, maybe a podcast. Which is to say free.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:22.160]   Maybe a podcast. Yeah, it's not free, but it's cheap. Maybe a podcast.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:32.080]   Oh, now somehow we're actually in the slide deck and we're only on the 37th slide.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:37.120]   One tends of the way. I'm sorry. I'm going to go through stuff like this.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:44.320]   It's slide crack. Yeah. She puts more content into one slide than a whole lecture.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:49.200]   This one is interesting. This is interesting. So this is daily digital media usage.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:56.800]   And it's desktop laptop versus mobile plus other. So mobile is the green bar, the top bar,
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:02.240]   desktop laptops, the middle gray bar. Other is-- Desktop laptop has stayed fairly consistent
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:08.640]   at a little over two hours. But there's huge growth in the overall and all of that growth in the overall.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.640]   It's mobile. All of it. Yeah.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:16.640]   But it shows the network rollout pretty well in the USA because 2008,
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:21.520]   that's when you start having 3G and 4G, I guess.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:26.880]   So imagine what 5G will mean. There's no benefit to using a desktop or other connected device.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.680]   Just online. No, but yeah, you'll be online. Well, even your desktop could even be online,
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:37.200]   because that would be your home broadband in some cases. But it will certainly help mobile
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:44.240]   considerably. As will Elon Musk's Starlink, if that ever happens. Daily time spent-- This was
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:50.800]   what I was talking about, the crossing of the lines between mobile and television just happened.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:57.840]   The red line, the top line is TV viewing. The blue line is mobile viewing. And for the first time
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:03.200]   ever, daily time spent in the United States is higher in mobile.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:07.920]   So we can't tell from this slide. So I know we're not going to come up with an answer. I'm just
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:14.400]   curious how they handle watching online television on a device, because I generally watch YouTube
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:20.160]   TV on my Pixel Slate. Not on a TV. We can. And my wife watches it on a TV. But I don't know where
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.160]   that fits in. I'm going to make a ruling here that if you're watching on the slate, that's mobile.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.960]   Yes. Because you can get up and walk around. My wife is watching YouTube on TV on her TV.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:32.640]   TV is actually TV. Yeah. But you're right. I don't know what
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:39.840]   you marketed her who created this. It's non-D-dupe to find his time spent with each medium individually,
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:45.360]   regardless of multitasking. I don't know what I mean. I don't know. I don't know. Video time.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:53.760]   Daily Minutes of watching video actually is pretty constant. Digital has been growing at the expensive
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:47:01.360]   TV. But it hasn't overall. I'm surprised it's growing so slow. There's only so much TV anybody
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:11.120]   could watch. Here you go. Coming up to slide 50. That's the one I know. Okay. Okay. 70 million
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:16.080]   monthly active podcast listeners. That's doubled. Doubled. Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:24.160]   the last four years. I wish our audience had doubled. Do you know you're getting Leo 2005?
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:29.840]   Do you think this is actually a big growth rate? Because when I saw this, I was like,
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.240]   and Stacy and I were looking at this together. We were both like, we're not that impressed by
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:39.120]   that. I mean, it's great to see the growth, but doubling in four years by comparison to all the
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:46.080]   other things that have grown fast. I'm just not blown away by it. I'm going to have to
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:54.400]   call an audible though on this right hand column. They're claiming that Apple knows how many
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:02.720]   podcasts downloads there are. Apple does not. So this number she's misunderstood. This might be
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:09.600]   based on Apple's charts, which are based on subscriptions and are heavily weighted for recent
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:14.320]   subscriptions. That's why we're not on here. We have more downloads, I'm sure, than some of these,
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:19.840]   but that's not how it works. This is not the most downloaded Apple podcast, but it doesn't
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:24.240]   matter because these are very big podcasts. That's for sure, but they're not the most downloaded.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:31.040]   Because Apple doesn't know. I wonder. Yeah, I also wonder if these two
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.920]   data bits are totally separate. Don't really relate to each other. They're just two snapshots.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:41.840]   She threw this in to give you an idea. Oh, that's a podcast. Oh, I know the daily.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:48.640]   That's a podcast. The daily is claiming two million daily listeners. So that's a big number.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:55.600]   That's a lot of the growth right there. Multiply that times 52 weeks times 5, 110.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:01.760]   Actually, yeah, that's actually more listeners than the monthly act.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.560]   Okay, that would make sense. Yeah, half of the monthly active listeners are listening to the daily.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:13.120]   Essentially, Amazon Echo installed base big growth there, doubled in a year.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.320]   So did the Echo skills. In fact, that is a hockey stick almost of Echo skills.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:23.440]   Yeah, well, Amazon, if you've been following any of their developer, the developer blog,
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:28.640]   actually Stacy and I look at that on a weekly basis and they have made it so easy to build skills
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:34.560]   with their blueprints. I mean, you could be in grade school and make an Echo skill at this point.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:38.080]   I'm not saying it shouldn't counter it should count. That's irrelevant. The point is they have
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:44.800]   just really made it simple, far simpler. How does anyone discover a skill? That's the real question.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:50.560]   That is the hard part. That is the hard part. The discovery mechanism on Amazon site is not that
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:57.440]   great. We ought to do more of this on the IoT podcast and highlight some of our favorites on a regular
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:02.560]   basis or new ones. Yeah, it's really, really difficult. How many of those skills are actually
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.640]   used on a daily basis? For example, I'd love to see that number. I would think that percentage is
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:12.560]   pretty low. I'll skip through the international growth, except to say, yeah, she has a whole
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:19.600]   section on that. It's big. It's growing. It's fast. This is about images. This is fascinating.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:27.520]   The annual new photo is taken. It's going up fast. The Instagram monthly active user is growing
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:37.920]   up even faster. Instagram is now at 1 million monthly active users. The number of photos taken
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:47.520]   globally is somewhere around a trillion up from under $7.7 trillion four years ago.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:54.480]   She also points this out that more than half of all tweet impressions contain images of some
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:51:03.440]   kind or video. It was just text to slide 86 as a funny quote. I can get there by pressing the
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:09.440]   button fast. Kevin Seistrum. Kevin. Oh, yeah, creator of Instagram. People have always been
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:14.240]   visual. Our brains are wired for images. Writing was a hack, a detour, picture-able
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:18.960]   languages are how we all started communicating. We're all coming full. I've heard a variation of
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:26.400]   this for years. I remember Trey Radcliffe, the photographer said, thanks to Instagram and Facebook
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:32.240]   and Google+, that people are learning to communicate again with images that images communicate better
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:38.560]   and more. But not as precisely, I might add. Yeah, I don't think writing was like there would,
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:43.440]   if we had Instagram, we wouldn't be writing. No. No. It's a lot. I mean, have you ever put
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:48.960]   something together using a IKEA manual, which is all pictorial? It's not fun.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:54.240]   There are some things the precision of writing is a lot better for.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:52:01.280]   Have you guys ever looked at your Twitter analytics or similar service and looked at the
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:06.880]   engagement of the tweets with images that you sent out versus the tweets without images?
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:10.480]   I've actually done A/B testing using the same text with and without the tweets.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:15.680]   Oh, wow. Images are much better. But we knew this years ago with blogs, right? A blog post that
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.560]   has an image and it does much better than a blog post that's just text. But I love Mary's sense of
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:25.840]   humor because she puts in this slide, which is worth more a picture or 1,000 words. Here's a picture
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:32.240]   of little ducklings jumping into the water and 1,000 words about ducklings, which is really,
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:37.840]   frankly, got a lot more information. So maybe a picture isn't worth 1,000 words or it just depends
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:43.280]   on whether it's a picture of, I don't know. I think that's pretty funny of Ms. Meeker.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:49.600]   Interactive gaming, not growing as fast as I thought, the number of players globally is only
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:55.360]   up 5% year over year. It's almost half of the world though. Oh, yeah. Good point.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:00.960]   Yeah, it's more than $2 billion. Okay, never mind. $2.4 billion.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:09.040]   It is kind of fair to be a little astonished by this because mobile gaming has really grown
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:15.040]   quite a bit. That's what it is. Yeah. So, yeah. Fortnite.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:24.720]   Yeah, let's see. Epic Fortnite cross-platform evolution versus registered users. Some of these
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:31.280]   you know, I'm not, there's Ms. Oh, there's Ninja. Ninja got a shout out.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:40.560]   Discord registered users. Look at that jump from almost nothing two years ago to somewhat
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:45.680]   over 200 million, 250 million. Yeah, I wish they could filter out the non-gamers that use
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.120]   Discord, like my study group at school. We use Discord. A lot of people use this. It's not about
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:54.160]   it. It's not just gaming, I agree. Right. Right. Anyone in Twitch, and this is the Twitch slide,
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:57.280]   is just about gaming. We're on Twitch.
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:04.000]   She talks about Fortnite and Battle Royale.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.680]   Freemium business. I guess she's come back to this.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:11.520]   In just the gaming context, yeah. Right. Interesting gaming.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:16.080]   I don't want to go through this whole thing one by one. Give me some other.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.280]   185. Okay.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.440]   Hey, halfway through.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:24.080]   You may before that.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:28.400]   I'm scrolling through real quick, but I don't think I have any before that.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:32.800]   We do this every year. One of these days, though, I'll figure out a better way to do this.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:39.280]   There's so much information in here, but it is, I think it's a value. I think it's become a valuable,
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:44.320]   yearly exercise, and just kind of the state of the internet, the state of technology.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:49.040]   Here's the perception of the internet. So you hear, if you listen to media,
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:53.440]   allow me my moment here, if you listen to media, oh my God, the internet and social media are
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:55:00.160]   ruining lives. They're ruining society. It's all a mess. Oh my Lord. Sky is falling. This is just
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:06.560]   awful. However, a Pew survey asked, when you add up internet advantages and disadvantages of the
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:13.040]   internet, sorry, when you add, yeah, it has been blank for me in society, mostly good.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:22.320]   For me, 88%, say it's mostly good. That's 10% from four years ago, but still a big number.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:26.480]   That's not a large number of error, folks. Yeah. And for society, 70%. Yeah.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:31.280]   Right. The internet is still a good. The vast majority of people think good.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:34.240]   Unbalance it's a good. And I think, I mean, I think we'd all say that.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:39.360]   Yeah, but not if you listen to, I mean, you know, you watch the line. I'm wine all the time about
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:44.320]   social media and stuff. But I think there's just no question that in balance, you should say that
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:51.440]   more often, damn it. I do. I say it a lot. I would not lie, I would live in a world without the
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:59.600]   internet. And if you go to 188, you see a contrast of quotes of where we could be headed, where you see,
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:06.160]   oh, I'm sorry, the wrong slide, wrong slide. Never mind. There's another slide later. Never mind.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:13.920]   That's a good question. Internet regulation, open internet, why it's a good thing.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:21.360]   Online reviews can boost multi-sided accountability. She gives us an example. Air B and B,
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:29.680]   70% of guests leave a review, which I think I think that's actually very powerful. Yeah.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:34.960]   Yeah. Yeah. That review system, if it's verified, works quite well.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:40.240]   It works well on Airbnb because you can't leave a review unless you stay there. It doesn't work
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:46.160]   quite as well on Amazon. Maybe Amazon should require that. I'm wondering, I'd love for somebody
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:52.240]   to study Uber, where your motivation is to leave sterling reviews even for bad drivers,
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:59.280]   so you don't get a bad review. Two-sided reviews is fascinating. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:05.840]   Airbnb is two-sided. I wonder if they put in some measure to keep,
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:11.600]   like when the landlord does the review, if she's not allowed to see what your review was first,
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:18.480]   or something like that, that would be interesting. Interesting. Yeah. Social media is important for
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:27.280]   Pew survey, 69% say getting the government to pay attention to issues, 67% say creating
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:34.320]   sustained movement for social change, 58% say influencing government policy decisions.
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:39.840]   It's a good. I don't know if this would be, if anybody would think social media was useful in
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:49.360]   government and it pre-Trump. Oh, Black Lives Matter. Okay. Good. You're right. There you go.
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:56.720]   And of course, the Arab Spring. Yeah. Okay. Well, it's not the first, it's not my go-to
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:03.040]   way to go contact my congressman, or should it be? Oh, yeah. I'm a tweet your member of Congress.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:08.880]   You bet. Okay. I guess they're paying attention. Yeah, they're paying attention.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:13.440]   Just like brands pay attention to Twitter, even though I think it's importance is
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.880]   outsized compared to the actual, it's actual importance.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:25.440]   Well, this is food for thought. That's most of what I have. Kevin, did you have anything else?
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.880]   No, I mean, we were kind of interested in what's going on in China in general that I mean that,
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:35.760]   as you said earlier, Jeff, tons of growth opportunity, just about everything that Mary
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:42.480]   talks about there will be dwarfed here in the US by what happens in Asia, between internet
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:49.120]   speeds, usage, so on and so forth. So what exactly there was, I remember, I could remember the names
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:53.440]   of these services. There were group buying services many years ago, 10, 12 years ago.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:56.800]   Yeah, they're still around. Yeah, but nobody really used them.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:01.120]   It's like mass drop, I think it's called. Yeah, that's kind of stuff. China, one of them
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:05.440]   are huge, gigantic. Things that we didn't scale, they're now scaling.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:13.200]   But there's a lot here about work and on-demand work, a lot about health.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:19.440]   Here's a disappointing slide to me. The number of sites supporting two-factor authentication
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:24.240]   has actually gone down over the last few years. That's really disappointing to me.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:28.560]   I would have hoped that that would have been a completely different direction.
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:35.680]   That's just odd. I have a horror story to share, but it's my thing, so I will wait till the very
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:43.440]   end when it relates exactly to this. Oh, okay. Cyber warfare.
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:50.320]   It was a good thing conversation there. Yes, I have a good thing too, so stay tuned.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:54.080]   All right. So thank you, Marian. Thank you, Mary-
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:54.480]   And you, Mary-
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.960]   Yeah. I think one of the better presentations this year, lots of-
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.920]   I really think it was very good. Yeah, I was glued to-
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.560]   Oh, I didn't watch her, but I went to the PowerPoint.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:11.120]   She's working on the next one already. Good Lord. Yes, she only has 333 days to create those slides.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.760]   Yep. One slide a day. Okay, go on, girl.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:21.760]   I showed they brought to you by WordPress. See, if I were creating a great presentation or a great
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:28.000]   talk, I would want to put that on my personal website as just another data points.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.800]   Then when people Google my name, they go to my website. That's the first thing that shows up.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.480]   That's the place you're home on the internet where you show your best work,
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.160]   whether you're an individual or a business is your website. Everybody needs a website.
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:45.040]   Everybody has my campaign. Everybody needs a website and WordPress is the place.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:48.880]   It's the best place to make your website WordPress.com. They do the hosting.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:55.280]   They have powerful site building tools, thousands of themes. And if you ever run into a problem or
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:01.760]   question, they have full-time support 24/7 from actual WordPress experts 300 strong,
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:07.440]   and they're just great. They're just great WordPress.com lets anyone pursue whatever it is they love
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.840]   by launching a site that's free to start and has room to grow.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:17.920]   That really since the day Matt Mullenwig started WordPress, that was always the plan.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:23.360]   WordPress was created so anyone can publish their ideas. There are no gatekeepers. You own
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:29.680]   your content forever. It's fine to be on Facebook and Twitter and Medium and everywhere else.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.160]   But if you don't have your own site, you're missing out. And if you're a business without a
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:40.960]   website, what the heck? WordPress.com. I sometimes see business sites like
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.040]   in other places and it's like, come on, you know, this could look so much better, so much more
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.600]   professional. That's why I use it. Leo Laporta, I've been there for 12 years. WordPress has no
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:55.920]   two-week trials, no hidden fees. You own your content forever free to start, but it'll build,
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.120]   it's built to grow with you to get you wherever you want to be tomorrow.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:04.960]   And it's so flexible and powerful. Some of the biggest companies on the earth use WordPress.com
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.280]   to build their websites. Not only we talked to Harry McCracken, he said, "Yeah, fast company.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:16.960]   It's our content management system." Fortune.com, courts, millions of people, big and small,
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:22.320]   use WordPress.com every day to turn their dreams into reality. When it's time to create a new website
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:29.280]   or your first website or a gift for somebody just coming into the world, this is the new coming out
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:36.400]   party. Create a website and gift it to them. WordPress.com/twig. You'll get 15% off any new plan purchase.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:45.040]   WordPress.com/twig. We thank WordPress so much for supporting this week in Google. They're a great,
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:52.080]   great partner. And we thank you for supporting us by using that URL, WordPress.com/twig.
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:01.200]   Google has bought 270 companies in the last decade or actually in the 2000s.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:06.800]   Compared to a much smaller number of acquisitions by Facebook.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:14.720]   Is there anything to say about that? I just like the production is beautiful of this. This is from
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:20.400]   the Privacy Project, Tim Wu. Big tech companies like Google and Facebook are in the reality products
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:28.720]   of hundreds of mergers. And they have this great graph showing how Google became Google or Alphabet
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.080]   by acquiring 270 companies over two decades. But the problem is they present this under the
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:43.920]   ages of privacy. And a lot of these acquisitions are back-end technology, presentation technology,
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:49.440]   advertising technology. Most of these do not bring users and user data with them.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:54.720]   I did see, and let me see if I can go back and find that article because I did bookmark it.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:04.800]   Really a good analysis of why modern, why current antitrust law can be effectively used
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:13.840]   against or in these big technology companies. And let me see if I can find it.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:23.840]   I hope I bookmarked it because I want to give you the exact quote. I think I didn't. But it was,
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:29.760]   I believe a member of Congress. But the point was, here's the criterion. Was that acquisition done?
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:38.560]   Because it's a sensible growth to the business or to stop a competitor or put a competitor out
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:44.400]   of business or to keep that competitor from becoming a problem. And he says, if we use that
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:52.800]   acid test, that's a good way to judge whether these acquisitions are sensible or not.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.400]   Where do you stand on T-Mobile sprint?
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:59.120]   That's a big one going on right now. And now, just how many
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:07.920]   attorneys general are suing trying to stop it, making the, I guess, reasonable claim that
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:14.000]   with only three big phone companies, it would be roughly a third, a third, a third AT&T Verizon
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.320]   T-Mobile sprint. There's not enough competition. I don't know. That's a lot. Three companies is
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:24.800]   not a monopoly. It's more cable companies than I have. Yeah. And I think you could also make the
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:33.200]   case that sprint and T-Mobile are weak by themselves. And that allows Verizon and AT&T really to
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:39.280]   stomp all over them. And if you want 5G to take off, you're going to need somebody strong enough
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:44.160]   to do the very hard thing that's 5G, which is putting in double the number of
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:47.600]   towers. All right. You just convinced me.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:56.480]   I have, I mean, I think I'm a little biased because I'm a T-Mobile customer. And I would love to see a
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:02.560]   better, stronger T-Mobile. I think T-Mobile's done a lot of good. I hate things. Some of the things
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.680]   T-Mobile does, for instance, zero rating is a very, very bad thing. It's against net neutrality.
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:14.080]   And they zero rate a lot of services. But they also got everybody else to lower their costs
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:19.360]   to provide decent international plans. I think they're scrappy.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:25.280]   I'm behind on this question, because I remember the old days of the radically incompatible
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:31.760]   standards they use. Are all the phone companies now? Yeah, LTE. They're still as that CDMA,
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:38.560]   GSM, Golf. But any modern phone uses LTE, and that's what they all support. And 5G will be the
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:44.640]   same way. It will be across all platforms. So the world is moving towards that. Yeah, we're
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:49.120]   past that. We're moving away. And it was mostly a US thing, Jeff. I mean, most companies are on the
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:54.240]   low, we're not. I think there was only one other major CDMA. I can't remember. Japan was CDMA.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.080]   Was it Japan? Yeah. So,
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:04.160]   so the lawsuits are essentially, you know, the FCC chairman came out in favor.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:10.640]   The Department of Justice said, well, we don't think so. And these democratic
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:15.520]   attorneys general filed suit, all 10 of them, because if the merger goes through, the price
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:21.040]   is consumer pay for phone plans would rise because there'd be one fewer competitor. I don't think
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:26.480]   that that's true. Sprint is so weak. I don't think anything Sprint does. It's like, what,
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:32.080]   how does that impact what AT&T's pricing is? It just doesn't make sense. I think you have
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.920]   two, if you have three strong competitors, that's better than two strong competitors and two weak
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:47.200]   competitors. Right. So, I don't think I agree. The lawsuit may not stop the merger, but the time
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:54.000]   says it could delay the deal significantly. They wanted to close it by next month. That ain't
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.760]   gonna happen. Federal regulators might fast track it, but the courts have it. And that,
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:05.120]   you know, how long that's gonna take. The attorneys general say that the merger would cost
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:10.720]   T-Mobile and Sprint subscribers $4.5 billion. Low-income and minority communities would be hit
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:17.360]   especially hard. It's exactly the sort of consumer-harming job-killing mega-mercher
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:26.080]   our antitrust laws are designed to prevent. These days, everything costs $4.5 billion.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.400]   Yeah, everything, literally. Everything. It's just the new normal.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:38.400]   I'm an, I kind of am in favor of it, but, you know, I understand that competition is critical, but
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:44.720]   I don't think this is a bad thing, especially when you have companies that aren't doing very well.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:50.560]   Remember, you know, how many, exactly how many satellite radio companies are there in America?
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:57.280]   There used to be two. They were both about to go serious in XM or both about to go out of business.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:02.800]   So, they were allowed to manage. Well, and, well, not seem better than that. They were one company.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.720]   The government insisted they be split up into two, which means that neither had the full,
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:12.000]   and to this day, you don't have the full range of frequency that they could have had if they'd
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.880]   stayed one. The good news there is that the competition to satellite radio is terrestrial
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:24.000]   radio. There's plenty of competition there and your iPhone, but I don't know. I think we should,
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.200]   I think I'm in favor of the merger. I have the same bias as you as a happy,
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:34.960]   team of customers. I'd love to see it be stronger, and I want it to be strong in 5G.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:41.440]   As a Verizon customer, I'm for it because I've seen... You should thank you,
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:48.080]   you should thank Team Mobile. I've seen exactly. I've seen I got back an unlimited plan because
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:55.920]   of Team Mobile, and I haven't seen Sprint effect anything on Verizon or AT&T.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:03.600]   Oh, man, this absolutely brought tears to my eyes. This is a story in the New York Times.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:11.680]   You know, the Times makes me crazy because they do things like publish that press-release
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:20.640]   journalism, the crappiest journalism ever, and then they do this. This is in Sunday's New York
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:28.080]   Times magazine, an incredible exposé. Do you remember in 2008 when the Universal Studios backlot burned?
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:36.160]   Barely. Yeah. It was a big deal. It was the town square and back to the future and a lot of
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:42.480]   Western sets. It might have made a more of an impression if you knew that also burned there was
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:52.800]   a warehouse rented by a Universal Music Group that contained the master recordings, 22,000 square
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:11:02.240]   feet of more than half a million recordings. And this, I know as a music lover, Kevin, this has
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:11.040]   got to affect you. Every single buddy Hollymaster is gone. At the time, Universal downplayed it.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:16.080]   Oh, we got copies of everything. The masters, those are second copies. It's not true. And the
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:21.120]   only reason that this story is coming out now is because the man in charge of the warehouse
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:29.840]   was fired by UMG last year and is now talking. And it is devastating. There's also a lot of the
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:38.800]   documents came from a lawsuit. UMG filed against Universal Studios and in discovery, there was a
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:46.480]   lot of information about what we really lost. And part of the reason UMG didn't want to tell
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:53.680]   people is because the artists themselves would have been livid. Because Steely Dan, for instance,
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:12:00.800]   and there's an anecdote in here about Steely Dan's manager calling saying, we want our masters.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:06.480]   Where are the masters? And it turned out that some of the masters have been stored somewhere else.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:12.400]   So they gave them those, but they didn't mention that a whole bunch more of those albums are gone.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:18.880]   I think to understand the importance of this, you need because a lot of people say, well,
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:24.560]   I can get everybody's Holly Song and Spotify or Apple Music right now. What's the big deal?
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:31.040]   But these are the originals. These are the actual recordings. And Kevin, maybe you can speak to this.
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:38.800]   But I know when the Beatles, Sergeant Pepper was just remastered. And Giles Martin went back to
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:46.640]   the vault, got the tapes, the eight track tapes with handwritten notes. And they
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:53.520]   re digitized them with more modern equipment. And the point made in this article is there's
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:13:00.720]   stuff on the masters that you couldn't hear on the masters until more modern technologies came
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:05.600]   along, allowing us to capture that. Plus, as you know, from the Sergeant Pepper, there's
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.160]   outtakes that were never released that are on the masters.
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.640]   Yep.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:17.440]   So this, I don't know, this could make you cry. It was the biggest disaster in the history of the
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:26.880]   music business. The things that were lost, Frank Sinatra original recordings, Edda James original
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:33.040]   recordings. UMG put out a press release where they mentioned two artists nobody had ever heard of
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:40.560]   and said, you know, it was people like this. It was people like this and John Coltrane and Patsy Klein.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:45.120]   Almost all of Coltrane's masters from impulse were lost.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:54.000]   Just just devastating and they're gone. So there's not much more to say about it. But
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:03.200]   it's shameful that UMG was able to hide this for so long. And I mean, two contrary thoughts here.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:09.840]   One is that in a digital world, it never happened. It never happened. Yeah. Though it says we have
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:14.560]   to worry about formats and wise storage strategies and other things that it could happen in the
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:18.960]   sense that formats become useless. I should also point out there were digital masters lost as well
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:28.400]   as tape masters in store warehouse. So digital can burn down just as much as, you know, and of course,
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:34.000]   a vault, things can happen. The originals, there's only one. There only ever is one, no matter how
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:42.400]   many copies you make. I just just makes me very sad to a lot of people are probably sitting here
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.320]   because I hear this one like every time there's a new remastered album from the Beatles or something.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:55.760]   By that, exactly. You do have that. You don't have exactly that, if it makes sense.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:00.240]   Because they can you mentioned the handwritten notes when when Giles Martin went through the
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:06.560]   masters and they spent so much time reading the notes and trying to remaster the original
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:12.800]   Sergeant Peppers, the way the Beatles intended it to be, the way they wanted it to be heard.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:20.000]   Not the way some other person wanted it to be heard. And if you need a simple comparison,
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.480]   if you're familiar with the Let It Be album, the Phil Specter Wall of Sound, there's also the
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:30.160]   Let It Be Naked album, which is without the Wall of Sound, vastly different music, even though what
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:35.520]   is the same music. And that's maybe not the greatest comparison, but it's a simple one if
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:40.800]   you've ever heard the two of them that you can understand. It's really, really sad to see this
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.560]   original. That's what it is. It's original music. We have copies of everything these days. So you
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.320]   can say I've got it on my iPhone, but you really don't. Well, and there are stuff you don't have
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:51.680]   copies of. There's out drinks. There's extra extra extra extra material. There's hundreds,
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:16:00.560]   millions of hours lost. The other thing is Martin remixed the mono mix. So that's really
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:06.480]   interesting because he had the masters, he had the original tracks and he could mix those
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:13.920]   in stereo from a mono master. That was the big thing with the Beatles, sorry, the Beach Boys
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:23.920]   reissue that came out probably 10 years ago now. Of Smiley Smile? Well, it had
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:32.320]   that it had the two big things where it had extra tracks from Smile, which were never released and
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:36.240]   was a huge, huge thing for fans. I remember that. That was so awesome.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:42.960]   And also, Brian Wilson was mostly deaf in one ear, so he did everything in mono.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:52.080]   So they really stuff in stereo for that. Well, that's what the market demanded.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:56.480]   Yeah, exactly. No, they re-released stuff. Oh, I see they were able to.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:03.280]   They were able to re-do it as scary. They kind of said, "We've got to make a stereo
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:09.680]   version for the Americas." They weren't quite a long though. So they just threw out a stereo mix.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:16.800]   It was terrible. Notoriously terrible. Different people on different tracks.
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.280]   Right. It was horrible. Paul's in one ear.
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:26.160]   Right. Nobody cared. Anyway, so that's the story. There's nothing to say.
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:31.600]   Except that this is just one more example of why the music industry sucks, and that these record
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:44.640]   labels were just, they didn't care really. They really didn't care. And it's sad. Read the articles.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:56.000]   Really well done. The information for the litigation is pretty funny because they talk about a new
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:03.440]   jersey warehouse that UMG also owned that the upstairs tenant of food service company loaded
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:08.240]   too many pallets of salad dressing into its storage holes, which caved in the ceiling above
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:14.000]   the vault ruptured a pipe, collapsed sheet-rock dangling electricity lines, hundreds of shattered
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:20.880]   salad dressing bottles, and a foot of water in a vault that contained 350,000 master tapes,
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:28.240]   including the entire Motown catalog. They actually were able to save a lot of those,
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:32.640]   but thank God, but they didn't save anything from the Universal Fire.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:41.360]   Mamas and the Papas, Joni Mitchell, a ton of stuff, Tom Petty. I just thought I'd bring that up.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.920]   It's not. There is a tech angle in the sense that we have digitized this stuff,
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:51.120]   but the problem is there's always better technology. These tapes, especially,
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:59.920]   contain a lot more information than you can create in a recording, in a performance.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:06.800]   Even stuff is recent as Cheryl Crow. Stuff was lost.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:15.200]   So there you have that. Let's do some Google changing of the logging, shall we? Play the trumpets.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:17.840]   The Google change log.
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:27.040]   Here's a huge one. The Google Assistant is now available in ways.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:36.560]   What took them so gosh darn long? It feels like they bought this is an example of where Google
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:40.880]   probably bought a company to keep them from becoming too big, right? No, no, no. I just wanted
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.520]   the technology. They've really not used it well.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:50.320]   No, but here's what they did. I know a couple of years ago, I talked to
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:53.520]   ways people and I tried to talk to ways people when I was working with a newspaper company to
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:59.040]   work with them. I think they were left alone so that they would develop new stuff.
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:03.760]   Waze is a product, it's magnificent. It's not a case where everything that AOL bought
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:09.120]   and others like that, but Compu-Sir bought and Yahoo bought and all those companies in the past,
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:14.080]   they ruined everything. Waze is far from ruined. Waze is just not improved.
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:19.040]   It's improved, much. It is. I think it's better because they left them alone in Israel to develop.
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:23.440]   Okay, good. I'm not defending Google in this case. I'm just saying that Waze is brilliant.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:26.560]   Yeah. And you've got to look at how. Well, and the nice thing now in Android Auto,
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:31.280]   and you can use Waze or Google Maps, which is really nice. And I think anybody who commutes
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.000]   knows that Waze is the superior experience from that point of view.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:46.160]   So you can say things like, "Hey, Gee, I want to report traffic," or, "That'll be big. I'll find
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:51.440]   me a route without tolls," and so on. What I wonder is what we'll do, things like find me
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:58.880]   the nearest Starbucks, or? I hope so. See, I thought, okay, so this is an interesting take on it,
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:02.160]   because I was hoping they would incorporate all of those great Waze features into Maps.
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:06.960]   Right. Same. But that is an interesting point of view. They wanted to preserve it.
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:12.800]   Yeah. And it's weird too, because you want to get so used to something. My son Jake uses Maps.
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:17.280]   I use Waze. And I don't know all the tricks, because you've got to know the tricks well,
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.680]   because you're not going to be screwing around with UI when you're driving.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:24.000]   So I use Waze religiously, and I just don't know from Maps unless I'm walking.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:33.520]   Is there a real problem with taxis in India? Because Google has introduced a new alert for you.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:41.760]   When your taxi goes off route, like he's taking you somewhere else, but it's initially rolled out
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:47.200]   in India. Maybe that's just where they're testing it. But your phone will alert you if your ride
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:52.960]   goes off route by 500 meters or more. Are they being overcharged?
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.880]   Oh, maybe it's for overcharging? I don't know. I was thinking, "It can happen."
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.440]   Okay. You're right. It's more like he's taken the long way. It's the...
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:08.160]   He's taken the long way alert. Okay. So it is available in India. Maybe it'll be offered in other
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:14.240]   places. But I love... I really do see it. This is what I think Google's doing a lot of good things
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:18.960]   in Maps. That's why. And Waze felt like it was a little bit behind. But okay.
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:24.960]   I don't know if you're ever in in cabs or Ubers, but do you find yourself sometimes going ahead
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:28.640]   and train on Waze just to track and make sure that they're taking the right route or how long
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:33.440]   it's going to take you where that kind of stuff? Usually I just... Well, cabs I never worry.
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:39.920]   Well, maybe I do. I should worry. I guess Uber, you know they're not going off route, right? Because
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:44.560]   they have the... I don't know. I just sit back, relax. You're not paying more for the Ubers.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:50.000]   They go off route. Yeah. I just figure... My feeling is they drive this every day. They know the best
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.040]   way to go. Yeah. Especially from the airport. You'll get a cab from Jamf, Gaetam, Manhattan. I know
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:59.600]   you probably have this having all the time, Chef, because you probably make that trip monthly,
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:04.880]   daily, weekly. But they'll... They're on the highway and they go, "Oh, crap." And then just go
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:10.240]   off on the side roads up there on the... By the houses. And I feel so bad for the people who live
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:17.120]   there because all these cabs are going... It's all cabs. Yeah. But I'm never... I'm not going to say
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:21.520]   no. First of all, I'm just not going to say no period. Any cabbie. They...
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:27.360]   They're probably using ways. That's the... Yeah. It looks like a ways detour. Definitely.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:38.560]   What did I have here? Oh, I am sad to say. Did you ever use Google Trips? I like this idea. I thought...
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:44.240]   And it's not very old. They were going to use it kind of as a trippit substitute. But now it's dead.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:51.440]   It will be incorporated, they say, into Google's new travel search page. But after all,
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:57.360]   August 5th, if you're using Google's Trips, which I did because I really liked it, no more.
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:03.200]   It would grab flight ticket and hotel booking information from your Google inbox, set up a trip
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:07.680]   in the app. It's make other suggestions saying, "I know you're going to Rome. Here's some restaurants
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:16.880]   you might like." I thought it was very useful. Google apparently has a new... A new page that's going to...
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:21.200]   This is my email. How much I miss inbox? Yeah, they just kill stuff. I was just going to say that.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:26.240]   Yeah. Because it wasn't not just that, but they also... The trip part of inbox was brilliant.
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:31.920]   Oh. Finally, I got stuff together in one discussion that would add more value. It was great.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:39.040]   She'd be able to so freaking ugly. Sometimes, change log is things going away.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:47.360]   Not just new things. And in fact, according to a guy named Kevin Tofel, the Pixel Slate
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:52.480]   Celeron Edition is going away too. Yes, it is. I hear that's a WordPress blog, by the way.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:57.920]   Is it? It's very attractive. Absolutely. It's very attractive. And you don't
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:03.440]   apparently like me using an ad blocker. That must be a WordPress plugin. I'm going to turn off my
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:08.880]   ad blocker because... No, that was the GDPR. I clicked the GDPR, but at the bottom, there was an ad.
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:14.400]   Oh, good. I have my little personal left there. But yes, ads aside, the Pixel Slate Celeron,
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:19.120]   which probably should have never been launched. You couldn't even buy it, right?
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:26.320]   It wasn't long. It was not long. I think it was on the market until about a week after the bad
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:32.160]   reviews of that particular model came out. And it's a darn shame because... Not because of the
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:36.960]   Celeron going away. That probably should, as I said. It just doesn't have the horsepower to handle
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:46.400]   that type of device, 3,000 by 2,000 pixels and so on. But that gave all the Pixel Slate line of bad
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:53.040]   name. And it's a much improved device now. So it's a real darn shame that that happened. It
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:58.080]   probably should never should have. You can't get one anymore anyway. They probably did it so
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:03.040]   that they'd have a 599 starting price, but they've actually taken care of it anyway by reducing
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:07.840]   the price of the other models, right? Yes, yes. And I don't know if that's temporary,
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:15.200]   but yes, the prices have come down on all the other models. I agree with you because when they
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:22.320]   talked about the slate, they said it's coming. It'll start at 599. So that's probably why they had
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.280]   to do that. All these companies do that. Because they... I don't know. They know... I was going to
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:34.240]   say they think we're stupid, but it's not... No, it's not rocket science. It's not rocket science
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:39.840]   people over underpromise and overdeliver, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, by dead it.
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:44.720]   Now you have one more there, Leo, that I wanted to mention. Google photos.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:51.360]   That's bad. Well, no longer synch. You think it's bad? I do. I think a lot of people really,
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:57.280]   really automatically stop. It won't automatically. The problem was... So I accidentally said yes to
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:03.840]   that. And my drive is now filled with photos that are in photos anyway, right? So I didn't want that.
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:11.280]   So you can see users can choose to sync photos to drive. Why would you do that?
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:19.680]   It's a second copy and it's eating up your storage. Not necessarily. The photos are technically
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:25.200]   stored on Drive. This is really... Or at least they used to be. But you have unlimited storage
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:32.880]   for Google photos. Yeah, I think the bigger issue is having to use two apps. Some people just want to go
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:37.600]   into Drive and get all their Drive stuff. What's different about photos that they have to be on
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:45.360]   their own UI and all that, right? It really should be optional. And it was confusing. I'll give them
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:51.840]   that. This was for G Suite. This was for G Suite. G Suite users do not have the option to show photos
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:58.320]   from my drive in Google Photos. But you can choose to sync photos to Drive so that when you
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:03.040]   upload a file of photos, it's automatically uploaded to Google Photos folder and Drive.
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:08.160]   Once these changes go into effect, this folder will no longer get updates.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:14.400]   But I don't think this is just for G Suite because there's a link in that story from the
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:19.920]   Google blog, the G Suite updates. There's a helpful link that takes you to the keyword,
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:25.200]   which is their main blog. And they're not really saying G Suite only here.
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:31.120]   Well, I love it. We heard feedback that you just were confused. Yeah, I am now.
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:35.040]   It's confusing. And I get exactly what Jeff is saying because, you know,
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:40.160]   if you on Drive, if you have the information pane on and it shows your most recently updated files,
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:44.800]   all of a sudden you've uploaded some photos from your phone automatically. It's all the most.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:48.240]   Yeah. Yeah. There's tons of images there. You're like, what is that? Yeah.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:54.240]   Starting in July, new photos and videos from Drive will not automatically show in photos.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:59.600]   Similarly, new photos and videos in Photos will may not add to the Photos for a link drive.
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:03.680]   Photos and videos you delete and Drive will not be removed from Photos.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.800]   Items you delete in Photos will not be removed from Drive.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:14.240]   So I'm still puzzled why is that the only reason people would put their photos in Drive is so that
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:20.640]   they have that available when they make presentations or stuff. Why do you just say here's your photos
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:26.480]   and do you want to see your photos and photos? Yeah. And maybe it should link to just photos
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:29.600]   that Google economy don't want. Well, I'll give you another place you can get them.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:35.520]   So this is under the G Suite updates. Is this only for G Suite customers? No.
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.840]   No. It's also under the normal updates. Okay. Thanks. If you look in their normal
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:45.040]   everybody, next month. Yeah. But it would only affect people who are intentionally
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:50.720]   copying photos to Drive. Those who enable the Google Photos. Yeah. Yes. It's not on by the
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:55.360]   fault, right? No. No. And it does make sense to simplify it.
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:30:00.480]   Yeah. Their explanation was very simple. Yep. And confusing.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:09.600]   We ain't doing it no more. Google's celebrating for the second year in a row, 100% running on
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:18.240]   renewable energy. Now that's a little deceptive because of course they're not. But they're buying
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:26.800]   credits, I guess, right? Yeah. So there. So what it really is that during 2018, their purchases
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:33.120]   of energy from sources like solar and wind once again matched our entire electricity consumption.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:41.600]   So in Mountain View, they get the, I presume they get their electricity from this Mountain View
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:49.040]   electric company, PG&E, which is generated by a variety of means, including diesel, wind, water,
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:54.640]   coal. I don't know if we have any coal plants in California, but
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:31:03.200]   hamsters, whatever it can. But what they do is they buy offsets so that they buy as, I don't even,
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:09.680]   excuse me, it's confusing because electricity is electricity no matter how it's produced.
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:15.280]   I pay for wind generated here in Pennsylvania. I pay a few extra cents per kilowatt hour.
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:18.960]   I'm getting the same electricity as my next year neighbor who doesn't get wind power. I mean,
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:24.240]   it's, yeah. So it's a it's a scale game of source. They should do it. It's good. Yeah.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:27.920]   Right. It's better that way. See, I have solar panels on my roof.
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:33.920]   So I know that the electricity comes from there into my house. Actually, it doesn't because it
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:40.240]   then goes from there into my house and up to the PG&E, snarfs it up and then gives me money.
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:43.680]   And that's the Google change law.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:52.720]   Such sad news. We talked about this on Sunday. Maker Faire is closing its doors as is make magazine.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:32:01.040]   Though there's some good news. Everybody's favorite VR maven Palmer Lucky says I'd buy it. Did he?
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:10.480]   Not yet. He's kind. You know, he might be a big talker. I don't know. This is nuts. He tweets to
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:15.120]   Dale Dowherty, some friends and I would love to help save maker media. I love maker fair and I've
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:27.280]   been a make reader since literally the first issue. Okay. Good. I hope so. Well, that was five days
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:33.760]   ago when I haven't heard this. So they all 20 staffers were laid off. I'm sad to say I am a huge
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:38.080]   fan. And what's really sad is they were doing well. They made their ticket calls for the most
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:46.960]   recent maker fair. The magazine was beloved for 15 years. 15 years? Wow. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:56.560]   And it really created a maker movement, I think. But it's it's it's been tough.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:00.880]   Dowherty who we've had on our shows that he's a great guy. They're just up the road of peace.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:05.680]   It's going to try to get some way to keep the make online archive running
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:11.600]   and allowing third parties to license the name to throw affiliated events. So they're not going for
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:19.600]   bankruptcy, rather assignment for benefit of creditors process. How much debt he's in?
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:28.240]   The company had raised $10 million. The magazine had 125,000 paid subscribers,
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:34.720]   one million YouTube subscribers, 1.45 million people attended its events in 2016.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:40.080]   I think what was really bad is that it never was able to make money without sponsorships.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:47.360]   And they had some big sponsorship pullouts. Microsoft and Autodesk pulled out before this
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:53.600]   year's flagship maker fair. And I bet you that's that was it. They just, you know, sometimes.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:58.800]   Yeah, one bump in the road. You don't have a lot of tires.
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:05.440]   Yeah. Yeah. But geez, I thought that was such a great thing. And I have a lot of maker books
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:10.000]   and magazines. We've interviewed many of the new actually make stuff make people. I don't make
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:17.360]   anything. I used to. I sit in my underwear and watch TV. This is on the phone. Yeah.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.520]   A little phone according to Mary maker.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:27.760]   We are actually, but of course we're older, right? So the older demographic, we're going to be
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:31.760]   doing old fashioned thing. I have more TVs in the house than I have phones and I have a lot of phones.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:36.960]   I don't know what any of that just meant.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:46.960]   For you, Jeff's got a trio of phones in his hand. Yeah, see, I have a TV. I have,
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:51.120]   actually, it's kind of embarrassing. I don't have TVs in the bathrooms yet.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:57.200]   Oh, we have one. I have TVs pretty much everywhere else. Good. Well, you're a former TV guide critic.
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:04.000]   So it's okay. It's okay for you. There's so much. There's too much good TV. I don't.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:16.880]   I can't keep up. So I have to watch for night maker Epic Games acquires house party this morning.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:24.320]   We don't know by how for how much house party has kind of an interesting story.
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:32.080]   This. Do you remember a mirror cat? Yeah. Remember? Sure. And Jeff Needles, who used to work for us,
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:36.000]   was like, so in a mirror cat, we all kind of got into it, allowed you to stream live video.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.040]   And then the company that started a mirror cat shut it down saying, yeah, it's failing.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:44.960]   Because it had a lot of it was one of those things that had a big uptake and then nobody
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:50.320]   used it after a while. And I think that that he went on to do house party. That was their pivot.
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:56.320]   They took some of the same technology and created house party. In fact, here's the article from 2016
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:02.080]   from the Verge. Mirror cat built a new app and secret and almost 1 million people are using it.
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:07.120]   It's house party. It's basically mirror cat for groups, kind of like hang out group hangouts.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:14.000]   But it's done all right. And as of 2016, they had a million users.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:19.760]   Jeff Needles, by the way, continued to work for house party and was very happy this morning.
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:26.320]   Because, yes, well, he made the right choice. He left us to go to work for them.
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:32.640]   Epic does Fortnite. And I think what's really interesting about this is many people think that
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:39.760]   Fortnite is actually a social network more than a game, including me, that for the 12 year olds
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:46.960]   who play it and every 12 year old plays it, it's the lobbies and the socializing that
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:53.280]   occur in Fortnite are really a big part of the game. So house party kind of makes sense. It is a
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:37:00.240]   video chat that they could perhaps build into Fortnite. CEO Tim Sweeney says, "By teaming up,
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:06.000]   we can build even more fun shared experiences than what could be achieved alone." House party
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:12.560]   says, "Nothing's going to change. The app will stay the same." But I suspect what you'll see is house
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:18.480]   party integrated into Fortnite. And this is how you disrupt companies like Facebook. You don't
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:26.240]   try to make another Facebook. I would say this is one company to watch.
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:36.560]   Did you read the article from Kev.net? Why you probably don't need recap chat?
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:41.760]   I tried, but good lord it goes on forever. So I was hoping you would just explain it to you.
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:49.200]   His basic position is you probably don't need it if you run a website. People use recapture
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:54.880]   to prevent robotic logins, automated logins by spammers and things like that.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:38:02.560]   It's a Google service that's free, so a lot of people use it. But Google gets a lot of information
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:11.280]   from it. And as it resonated with me, because I've pissed off at the new traffic sign, is this a car
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:17.840]   capture. Remember, you've seen that grid of such a pain. It's horrible. And it's training Google's
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:23.200]   automated vehicles for free. It's machine learning. We're doing work.
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:31.040]   I'm doing all the work for Google for free. And so his point is that you're giving Google a lot of
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:36.240]   privacy information, plus you're giving them machine learning for free. What privacy information
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:39.120]   to give them just because Google has a special update. Well, they know you're there. They see you.
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:43.760]   Yeah, it's a Google pick. I use Brave and turn off all those pixels.
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:53.040]   There was a debate I read on Hacker News about this article about whether you really need to
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:58.800]   use recapture. And not his position is it doesn't. There's lots of other ways to prevent robotic
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:07.120]   sign-ins. Many developers vastly overestimate the likelihood of customized spam. He says he also
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:13.040]   offers some recapture alternatives that are well known. And of course, it's a back and forth battle
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:21.840]   between spammers. But I kind of agree. I feel like I just, I mean, the old capture was so
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:27.760]   such a pain in the butt. Anyway, now they've added all these images, even more painful.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:34.800]   I'm going to some very, very small conference with 20 people and they have me signed, you know,
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:40.320]   register and put all my stuff in this fund. Nobody ever goes to this page ever for any reason.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:45.040]   And they have every we capture on it. Yeah, it's just kind of automatic. What robot is going to
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:51.760]   sign up for the conference? Yeah. And there are other ways to do that. And other captions. So I
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:56.960]   kind of, I kind of agree. If you're Twitter or Facebook, no capture will solve all your issues
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:01.440]   for everyone else. He still, he writes, there are still a lot of simple tools and heuristics
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:07.440]   that go a long way in helping to stop abuse. Be kind to your users and try and try your best not
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:13.200]   to force them to spend their free time completing recaptures for Google. They they will appreciate
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:21.280]   it. Kevin Davis, I agree. I will appreciate it. Tries me nuts. Have I been pwned is for sale,
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:28.480]   Troy, Hunt, who was the security researcher who created one of the single most useful services
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:32.320]   out there. If you haven't used have I been pwned, give it a shot. It allows you to enter
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:37.120]   your email address. Actually, let me go to it just to show you real quickly.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:43.200]   It allows you enter your email address. And you'll see if you are in one of the massive breaches
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:51.920]   that corporations have reported. And by the way, my email address has been pwned on 28 breach sites
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:58.000]   and found in two pastes. So there's also though, I think an even more useful tool where you can
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:04.960]   enter a password and see if that password is among the half billion real word passwords
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:15.040]   exposed in data breaches. And by so I entered monkey 123 and apparently so did 60,803 other
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:20.000]   people and they use it for real passwords. Use your good real secure password. Maybe your last
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.760]   past master password, something like that. Just to make sure people sometimes ask me, well,
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.440]   wait a minute. I shouldn't put my real password in there, right? Because he gets it. No, the way
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:31.600]   the JavaScript works and it's unopposcated. He does not get it. It's actually a very clever
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:36.800]   hashing technique that he uses to make sure to check checks against a hash database to see
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:44.080]   if your hash shows up. So it's safe to do that. And he has a whole explanation of how that works and
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:50.080]   so forth. But this is a really good site. And Troy, it's such a good site. A lot of people use it.
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:57.680]   And Troy says, I just can't, I just can't. I want to sell it. He created it back in 2013 for free
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:07.920]   as a kind of a labor of love. So I just mentioned this because somebody should buy it. So it's a
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:14.480]   great thing. Well, but it matters who buys it. Yeah, that's a good point. Somebody good should buy
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:19.040]   it. Well, you know, good, but I mean, he's not gonna sell it, but he bad. No, I don't think so.
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:23.120]   Troy's pretty serious. But you don't know who ever sells it can sell it again.
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:28.160]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, actually, I don't know. Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:35.120]   It's a hell of a database of passwords that he got. He has a series of seven commitments that he
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:41.840]   sets forth saying, you know, saying why this is this is going to be okay.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:48.960]   And you know, so forth. So he's going to work with the KPMG to find an organization that would
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:56.880]   fit his requirements. And it really is important how I've been pumped. So I would hate to see it go.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:02.240]   Yeah, you've used it. Oh, yeah. In fact, I get emails every once in a while, like, hey,
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:08.640]   your email address showed up in another breach. It's built into one password, I think. I think
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:14.240]   I've seen it in Chrome. Maybe I can't remember where else I've seen it, but it's yeah, it's great.
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:19.360]   It'll let you know that's nice to know. Chrome has a plugin that will let you know if your password
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.840]   has been used elsewhere. I think password checkup. I don't know if they use have I've been pwned,
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:31.680]   but that's another great Chrome plugin. Okay. Okay. Anything else? Did I leave anything out,
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:38.720]   kids? Oh, yeah. So much stuff. I know. It's a giant day. I'd like to talk about Stadia just for a
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:44.640]   tiny bit. Okay. So would they mention it? They rolled out the more and from they figured out
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:51.920]   who it's for? I did. For me. It's not for me. For you. So Stadia, the announcement was on Monday.
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:59.520]   It will launch in November in the US, UK, Canada, and 14 other territories. 31 games, 21 publishers.
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:06.720]   They have an initial founders edition for a bizarrely overpriced $130.
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:07.760]   Got it.
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:18.560]   You get a Chromecast Ultra. That's 89 bucks by itself. I already have one. You get this weirdo
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:24.720]   Wi-Fi controller, although that's a good thing. You don't have to use it for Stadia. You get three
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:35.200]   months Stadia, which will be $10 a month after that. And you also get a game that you don't want
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:43.920]   called Destiny 2. I'm glad about sums it up. Yeah. The weird thing about Stadia, so it's one of
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:49.120]   those. It's like online. It's like Guy Kai. It's a streaming service. It runs on Google's servers.
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:52.960]   Very powerful servers. It has some very nice features. They showed it. They had an event at
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:58.080]   GDC and they talked about that. You can run it on anything that doesn't need a lot of power. In fact,
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:02.720]   a Chromecast Ultra. So you plug that into your TV. The Chromecast Ultra isn't doing anything except
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:09.840]   streaming the game. Your controller, which is Wi-Fi, is talking directly to the server. So there's low
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:14.400]   latency, supposedly, although really the proof will be in the pudding, depending on your internet
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:19.840]   service provider. The weird thing is it's not a streaming service in the sense a lot of them are
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:23.920]   where you get access to a bunch of games. You have to buy literally outright buy the game.
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:29.360]   To play it. Right. So this is a little different than the Microsoft version,
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:34.640]   which is what game pass? Yeah, you pay a fee a monthly fee. You get access to 100 games.
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:38.000]   100 games, right? I was just looking at it today because I have an Xbox
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:44.080]   collecting desk right now. I'm a member. Yeah, it's good. Yeah. So yes, this is different in
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:49.600]   that. Yeah, you're getting Destiny 2 and all the content for it. Google has not said what other
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:55.920]   content you will get for free as part of this premium service. You will all
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:02.080]   all the servers. Gate 3 will ship pretty exciting. I like Baldur's Gate, but all right.
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:07.040]   Yeah, it's a fun enough game. I mean, okay. Yeah.
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:15.440]   Yeah. Also a farming simulator 19. I can pass on that one. The thing is a lot of people getting
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:21.600]   worked up appropriately for the $10 a month and I still have to buy my games effectively. Yes.
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:31.760]   But the pro service is literally the first part that's launching in November. And
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:38.080]   that will give you 4k 60 frames per second service for your games.
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:42.880]   In a service provider allowing. Well, that's a whole other issue with the whole
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:48.240]   caps. But that's not Google's issue. That's individuals issue. Well, it's my issue. If I buy
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:52.560]   it, I still have to get through my internet service. You'll be able to play for 65 hours.
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:47:02.080]   Oh, that's good. Yeah. That's a lot of Baldur's Gate. In 2020, the subscription part of it will be
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:08.160]   free if you want to drop down to 1080p 60 frames per second. It's probably better, frankly, for
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:13.360]   streaming. Yeah. I mean, you're going to go through your caps much slower number one and
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:17.760]   and if you don't have a 4k TV, what's the point and so on and so forth, you can drop out of the
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:22.000]   service. It's a month to month thing. So you can switch back and forth. You don't lose your content
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.320]   if you drop from one service to the other or leave for three months. I feel like given the
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:33.680]   competition from Sony and Xbox, this is a non starter. I don't even understand. I think
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:38.320]   Google's going to give up on this in three months. Let me let me explain to you. Okay. We know the
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:46.640]   market now. Carsten Bondi, once again. Just to go back a little bit, my son, Zach, is 14.
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:51.760]   He has been ridiculing this since they first announced. He has. He even made a video. He thinks
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:48:00.160]   it's the dumbest idea ever. It's not for him. Until there was another announcement at E3,
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:08.560]   Ubisoft announced that they are going to be streaming their entire catalog,
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:16.880]   their entire PC catalog to their going to for $14 a month, you can get their entire. It's either
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:28.320]   streaming or download on Steam and Stadia. Oh, oh, that does change things a little bit. We are a
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:36.480]   gaming household, but we don't have a gaming PC. But honestly, we have all the consoles,
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:41.920]   but we don't have a gaming PC. So that is who this is for. Right. But we're console gamers who
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:49.680]   want to play. But in two years of Stadia, you could afford to buy an Xbox. Yeah, an Xbox. Not
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:57.360]   a gaming PC. How many years is it going to cost me to buy a $2,000?
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:02.960]   So you think this will be better than an Xbox? I think this will be better than a gaming PC.
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:07.600]   You're renting a gaming PC, essentially. You're renting a gaming PC.
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:14.880]   It gets automatically updated every year. You don't have to buy a new gaming PC every two years.
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:20.400]   And I don't have to play PC games on my
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:28.720]   OK, you can play it on a 70 inch TV or your phone or my phone or a Chromebook.
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:36.080]   OK, two weeks ago, I had no idea who this service was for. Now I know it's for me.
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:41.840]   It's a gaming PC. It's a gaming PC. Now we should say you have obviously some sort of magical
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:48.320]   internet service. I have Sonic. Yeah, you do in fact have magical internet service,
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:53.840]   which is what is the minute? What is the bandwidth you need for 4k 50 megabits?
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:58.800]   I'm not going to have it. It's I'm not going to get I'm probably not going to buy this
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:03.680]   day one. I'm going to get the free tier. Right. And then I'm going to get
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:08.080]   see what 10 a you look like. Then I'm going to get Ubisoft's streaming service or Activision
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:15.840]   streaming service or what because that's the next five years of gaming is every major gaming platform
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:20.320]   is going to offer a streaming service. So in about six months when this comes out,
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:24.080]   Carson is going to stop shaving. Yeah. Well, I already stopped shaving. Oh, he already did.
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:30.800]   He's going to come into work a little bleary. I've been playing Baldur's Gate 3.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:39.120]   It's amazing. Okay, I guess that, you know, again, the only issue is your bandwidth and
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:45.280]   Google doesn't control that. So it's it's it's caps. You know, I have a terabyte and a half cap.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:50.320]   And I want to do other things besides playing stadium two hours a day on my internet access.
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:56.640]   And it's latency and speed. All of those will really be your mileage may vary. You're just
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:01.680]   going to have to see. But if you do have a magic ISP, if you have a very good ISP with low latency,
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:05.120]   no bandwidth caps, high speed, this would be better than a gaming.
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:10.800]   So Sonic gets fiber to my neighborhood. Yeah, fiber will change will be transformative. Yeah.
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:16.880]   Okay. I have fibers on all in. Yeah.
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:21.840]   Five G specialized, maybe 5G or Elon.
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:28.320]   Elon's magic. Well, 5G work inside. Yeah. Yeah, they're going to have home.
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:31.120]   They're going to have home 5G. Yeah. Because you put something in the window.
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:34.880]   Actually, that's the only kind of 5G you get right now is Verizon's home.
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:39.840]   Five your business 5G. Yeah. Yeah. But it's a different anyway. It's a long story.
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:42.880]   If next time Stacey's here, I'll let you ask her about.
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:48.160]   Google says Chrome is not killing ad blockers.
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:55.680]   We've never talked about this one. Yes, we have. It's just trying to make extensions safer, guys.
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:52:00.880]   Why are you? Why are you? Why are you misunderstanding us? Except that the ad blocker I use on Chrome,
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:08.400]   you block origin won't work. When they, when they update Chrome with manifest V3.
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:16.000]   I think it's reasonable to say that Google is doing this to make you safer.
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:20.800]   Because it's going to change the way plugins work.
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:26.240]   Google says there's been a lot of confusion and misconception around both the motivations
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:30.080]   and implications of this change, including speculation. These changes were designed to
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:34.960]   prevent or weaken ad blockers. That's absolutely not the goal. It's just a nice side effect.
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:41.200]   He didn't say that part, but it is a side effect.
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:48.400]   So maybe they're making, I suspect before it happens, they're going to make some changes
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:54.640]   to perhaps make it possible. But Gore Hill, who creates C-block origin, is obviously not very happy.
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:53:01.040]   There will be, and it's interesting, opera, Vivaldi, brave, other browsers that use chromium,
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:06.240]   the open source. Chrome have said, well, we're not going to implement that part of it. We're
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:10.640]   not going to do it because they all want to have ad blockers. In fact, brave is an ad blocking
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:21.040]   browser. I think we're flagging here. I think we need an infusion of advertising.
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:29.360]   We've hit our data caps. Yeah, I've hit my data caps. And then we will get picks and numbers and
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:35.600]   things like that. But first a word from Capterra. If you have businesses, and I know many of you do,
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:40.480]   and you use software in your business, and I know many of you do, and I know many of you using
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:48.720]   software that is old to put a finer point on it. It's really old. It is so old that you still have
[01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:55.760]   to use IE8 or Windows XP. That's not good. It's time to get some up-to-date software. There is up-to-date,
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:54:01.360]   beautifully written, highly functional business software out there for every business, for every
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:08.240]   possible application. And the place to find it is capterra.com. 700 categories of businesses,
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:15.040]   all the big one, CRM IT, project management, e-commerce, link management tools, web conferencing.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:22.720]   Also, all the little ones. Are you running a veterinary business? Are you a yoga studio? They've
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:28.960]   got that too. Software for every business. What's great is you can find the software you're looking for.
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:34.960]   Maybe filter it down based on, say, product rating, user deployment. You know how many users you can
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:39.600]   have features, whether it's on the web, on your hard drive, that kind of thing. Is there a free trial?
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:46.000]   Get a list of filtered suggestions that work for you. What's chemical software? Is that what
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:51.680]   the chemical brothers use to make their albums? What is chemical software? I don't know. But
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:58.560]   if you use it, you can get all this here. And then, here's the best part, they have almost a million
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:03.920]   reviews of products by actual users. So every product, you can look at them, compare them side
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:10.160]   by side, and then read the reviews to know, "Oh, that's a CMS chemical software. It's not for chemists.
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:18.560]   I get it. I get it. It's actually, you know what? This is fun to go just browse around
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:23.280]   Kaptera, even if you're not. It's just fun to interest. It's really interesting. All the kinds
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:27.280]   of software that's out there. And these reviews are very helpful. More than 1,000 new reviews
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:34.000]   every day. In fact, instead of asking you for money, because Kaptera is absolutely free,
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:41.200]   Kaptera says, "Why don't you leave a review? Pay it forward. We're sharing our knowledge, right?
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:48.000]   A free directory of business software, all the latest tools, and real reviews from real customers.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:57.200]   Wow. Kaptera.com/twig. C-A-P-T-E-W-R-A, Kaptera.com/twig. I think you're going to find this incredibly
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:04.880]   useful, incredibly useful. Kaptera, and it's free. Kaptera.com/twig. Kaptera is software,
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:11.600]   selection, simplified. And we thank you for their support of this week in Google. Kevin Tofel,
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:16.800]   I got to pick aboutcrombooks.com. Kevin's incredible website, all about Chromebooks.
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:22.560]   You have a number one fan over here in Jeff Jarvis. And of course, the podcast,
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:26.880]   the IT podcast, he does with Stacey Higginbotham, who is now in Seattle.
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:32.640]   Yeah, she's in Montreal. Right now, she's in Montreal. That's right.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:42.000]   So my pick is more of a public service announcement. And we talked about security today quite a bit,
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.840]   and two-factor authentication. In fact, this week, I don't think we got to it on the show notes,
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:52.000]   but real quick, you can now use a Google Android phone as your two-factor authentication method
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:59.040]   to authenticate in Google services on iOS devices, which you wouldn't think would be too handy,
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:02.480]   but a lot of Android phone users have iPads. Wait a minute, how does that work?
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:09.680]   Is it NFC? It's Bluetooth. So your Android phone is a dongle.
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:16.000]   In a sense. Yeah. Nice. Right. So whether you use that Android phone as a two-factor
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:22.240]   authentication bit, or you buy, like I did, I bought the Google's Titan security key,
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:25.760]   which is like a UV key. It's just a specific implementation Google made.
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:32.080]   Well, you use an authenticator app. Definitely use two-factor authentication. And here's my
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:38.000]   horror story as to why. I do another podcast on weekends. I've been doing since 2006 with a
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:43.840]   great guy who writes for ZDNet, Matthew Miller. People may know him on Twitter as Palm Solo,
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:54.640]   because he's a huge Han Solo and Star Wars fan. His phone was sim hacked, meaning somebody
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:58:00.640]   called T-Mobile and convinced T-Mobile that they lost their sim or whatever and had his phone
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:08.000]   never transferred to their sim. Using two-factor authentication text messaging,
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:13.600]   those folks now have access to all of his Google accounts, as well as his Twitter account,
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:18.560]   his verified Twitter account is gone. The person has removed two years' worth of tweets.
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:23.920]   He will not be able to get it back from Twitter until they get a response from him from his
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:30.080]   registered email, which is Gmail, which he doesn't have access to. So my point here is,
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:37.440]   and he's very upset about this, and he should be. My point here is don't use text codes for
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:43.440]   authentication if you can help it. Just please download the Google Authenticator or the Microsoft
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:49.280]   Authenticator app. You use that for one-time codes, a little more secure. Use a hardware
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:55.600]   key or an Android phone or some other physical device to authenticate everything these days,
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:59:00.960]   because it's just getting too easy for people to get these text messages and sim card hacks and
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:07.760]   so on. And you lose everything. He's distraught. It's just terrible. Who is this? Matthew Miller,
[01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:13.200]   Palm Solo on ZDNet. If you go to Palm Solo, his verified account is still there, but now all the
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:19.600]   tweets from 2015 onward are gone. The person has deleted them. He's livid.
[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:28.720]   He should have taken my advice. Unfortunately, he probably had text authentication and such,
[01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:34.000]   and it's not his fault that he was sim hacked. That's on the carrier. You can put, this is another
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:39.680]   piece of the puzzle, go to your carrier and put a pin number on your account. Therefore,
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:44.160]   he didn't have that. If somebody calls and tries to move your phone over to their sim,
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:48.240]   they're asked for the pin code and chances are they're not going to get that right.
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:54.720]   You shouldn't also allow SMS messages for two-factor. Sometimes you have to, my bank.
[01:59:54.720 --> 02:00:02.240]   Sometimes you have to, but Google doesn't. And turn that off. Just don't do that, because that's
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:06.480]   dangerous. And it gets back to the slide, Leo, that you pointed out how two-factor
[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:10.480]   authentication websites have actually, the number of them has decreased for the percentage.
[02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:12.800]   It is sad. I cringe when I heard that.
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:19.200]   Yeah. And so many banks still allow SMS messages. Now, they, she was targeted, right? Because you
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:23.760]   can't, this is not a general purpose attack. Somebody has to take the trouble to get your
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:29.280]   phone number and then call the cell phone company and impersonate you, get them to send
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:32.000]   the send out. So it's somebody targeting him,
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:36.720]   nevertheless. But that doesn't mean it won't happen to you. It's not a good thing.
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:41.360]   How do they get the Gmail just because don't you have to have both the password and the
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:43.600]   text? Well, that's a good point.
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:50.480]   I think you can, if you don't remember your password, one of the ways to get through is
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:56.960]   text me a code, right? Exactly. Yeah. Phone numbers, I mean, we take them for granted, but
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:02.880]   people use them a little or rely on them too heavily for security purposes. And we can't be
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:07.920]   doing that anymore. Long ago, not long ago, but last year, List NIST finally said,
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:12.160]   do not use it is not safe to use SMS messages for two factor.
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:19.760]   Now, when I sign on to Google from a new device and it says, unlock your phone and say,
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:26.320]   yes, that's me. That counts as two factor. It does. It does. It's app based. It's basically
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:33.280]   an app based system. So yes. So Google offers a huge variety of two factor solutions.
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:39.040]   I have a Yuba key, which I use. This is the Yuba key. So it's on my key chain. So that way,
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:43.520]   that's a physical dongle. And then you're going to give it a backup. And so you can print out
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:48.960]   codes if you want, put them in your drawer. You can use Google Authenticator to generate a
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:53.360]   six digit number. The more modern way to do it, which I really like in Google started using this,
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:57.120]   is you can have it send a notification to your phone. That's different from an SMS
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:04.320]   because it's sending it over Wi-Fi or the internet to the app, which the app then pops up a notification.
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:08.480]   And it says, did you just log in? Do you want to prove that? And you say, approve Microsoft and
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:12.640]   Google both offer, which is so much easier to than having to put a number. It's great. It's very far
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:18.080]   preferred. But do go into your Google security. I guess I shouldn't show mine because it has
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:23.520]   personal information in it. But go into your Google security.google.com.
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:30.800]   Take a look at how it suggests to secure your account. And if two step verification is on,
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:39.120]   make sure that it is not on and allowing SMS. You can say, no text messages is not one of them.
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:43.920]   It shouldn't be a fallback. It shouldn't be anything. Because if it's a fallback, it's the weakest link.
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:49.920]   And that'll work. And they can send Jack you. And it's not just simjacking. Does he know how
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:55.520]   they got his sim, his phone number? There's a variety of ways to do it.
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:58.880]   He hasn't told me. I mean, I've had little, little contact because I don't even know.
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:00.720]   He doesn't apply his offline.
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:06.080]   Yeah, he's got a new Twitter account temporarily.
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:13.120]   I've actually asked him things that he would know, only things I've said to him privately,
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:17.040]   not something I've emailed him or is available online, just to verify it was him.
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:20.800]   Jesus. That's what a pain in the head. Oh, it's crazy. It's absolutely insane.
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:27.600]   So there is a couple of things you can do. The problem is that the broadband, the baseband
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:34.640]   software in all cell phones is hackable. And it's well known to be hackable. It hasn't been
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:41.040]   fixed ever. It's been broken forever. And SS7. And so that's one way they can do it. They can kind of
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:46.080]   intercept messages. The more common way is to call your phone company and say, hi, this is
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:53.280]   Kevin Toffle. And I lost my sim. Please send me a new one, a new address. And the phone company,
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:59.520]   because they are after all customer service, reps often will say, oh, yeah, sure. What's the
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:06.480]   address now? Don't use SMS. That's a good reminder. Thank you.
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:08.000]   Does Fye any better or worse?
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:13.920]   You know, I hope so, because that's the number I use is my fine number. I hope they're smarter.
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:17.760]   Put a pin on it, though. You're right, Kevin. That's a good thing to do because then at least
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:22.240]   the customer service rep will say, well, what's your pin? And that would stymie a hacker, I think,
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:27.200]   in most cases. Jeff, your number of the week. I was just trying to look at how to put it fit on
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:32.560]   one. Just send me your phone number. Yeah, that's right. Actually, just tell them.
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:39.040]   Open the Google Fire app and the account tab under phones that didn't click voicemail. No,
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:44.720]   that's a voicemail. You want an authentication pin with support? Never mind. They may not.
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:47.760]   They may not. Who knows if they don't offer it, because they don't know any customers.
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:52.640]   Team mobile does. In fact, team mobile got hacked some time ago and they sent text messages to many
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:05:00.960]   of their users, including me saying, put a pin on your account now. So I did. Jeff,
[02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:10.000]   all right. So Facebook watch says they have 140 million daily viewers who watch at least one minute,
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:17.840]   but average of 26 minutes a day, 220 million monthly users compared to 400 million in 2018.
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:25.840]   So it's growing. I don't know. I don't know whether Facebook that does. Does that include the videos
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:32.000]   that come by in my news feed? No, no, no, that's a separate channel. That's separate. So you
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:36.960]   got to go to Facebook. Watch. I don't do you go to Facebook watch. You don't even have a Facebook
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:42.400]   account. I did see yesterday an exclusive of something I would have liked to have watched. It
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:46.800]   was only on Facebook watch, but I can't remember what it was because I didn't because I can't.
[02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:52.800]   So don't folks, if you want people to watch, exclusive is not a good idea, but Facebook watch
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:58.560]   is surprisingly gotten surprisingly traction. But I guess we have two and a half billion users
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:02.720]   or whatever. It's probably not hard to do that. But I don't really see it. I mean, it's not being
[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:07.440]   promoted in my news feed. So it's funny. I just don't think to go there. I'm going there right now.
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:10.640]   Oh, don't know. No, baby deer.
[02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:24.560]   So they have Fox News on it, CNN's on it. It's amazing. They have 700. What is it? 720 million
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:32.400]   viewers. That's a that's a that's amazing. And arguing that now that the other was the best video
[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:39.840]   of the year is the baby talking to his father. Is that on Facebook watch? It's not a Facebook
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:43.600]   watch. Yeah, it's everywhere. You've seen that one. No. You haven't seen that one?
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:51.040]   All right. All right. Can you find it? Yeah, I could play it. You want to watch it? Oh, you do
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:59.120]   want to watch this? Okay, this is this is from YouTube. This is a a vertical video recorded
[02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:06.560]   apparently with somebody's smartphone. Oh, I you know what? I've seen it without audio.
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:12.240]   Which you got you got you got the audio. Yeah, yeah. So they're watching.
[02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:20.000]   Yeah. Yes. Okay. Did you understand it though? No. Okay.
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000]   Oh, right.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:26.960]   Oh, not not this one. This is Instagram. Now, yeah.
[02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:30.480]   Yeah. That's the last one.
[02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:36.720]   I was wondering. I don't know what they're gonna do next season because they did some stuff this time.
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:41.520]   Exactly what I was thinking.
[02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:44.880]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:52.160]   Right. Don't break that in. You know what I'm saying? Don't do the same stuff. You know what I'm saying?
[02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:53.200]   Yeah. I don't think that. Yeah.
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:08:01.600]   Like go somewhere else with that, but don't break the kids. You know what I'm saying?
[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:13.360]   That's what I'm saying. You know what I'm saying? I'm like, what in the world?
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:17.760]   Don't do it here. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So the kids talking Sim talk. Yes.
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:19.760]   Yeah. Yeah.
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:22.640]   Really? How'd that say me?
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:26.000]   I think a lot of like,
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:31.200]   oh, that's crazy.
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:34.320]   Right.
[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:38.880]   Now, who says the Internet's a bad place?
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:44.560]   It's been watching more than 55 million times. Oh, it's unbelievable.
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:46.800]   Shared one of the half million times on Facebook.
[02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:49.840]   Surprised I haven't seen them on Ellen's generous yet.
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:55.680]   I've had that conversation a million times. To me, it's like, well, yeah.
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:03.280]   Okay, fine. I guess people who don't have kids don't, you know, like it or something. I don't know.
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:06.080]   The hard-hearted people. Yeah. I'm a hard-hearted person.
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:11.040]   It's cute. Cute, kid. Cute. So anyway, it's on that.
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:14.800]   That among everything else is on Facebook. Watch. People are watching Facebook. Watch.
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:20.160]   And they're starting to feel left. Time when. So the bigger, the bigger thing is interesting to me.
[02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:26.000]   So I think Google has been standing back kind of saying, but Facebook, they're on the hot seat.
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.200]   Oh, we're not the same. You know, Google people will say to me all the time,
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:32.080]   don't call us platforms. We are different companies, right?
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:39.520]   So now YouTube is causing trouble for Google. So they're in the same hot seat that Facebook's
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:44.080]   going on. And you can't. And then the newspaper industry goes after Google. So now Google's on
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:47.920]   the hot seat again. So it'll be Google for a month or two, and then it'll be Facebook again.
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:53.520]   So this is what you get if you don't have a Facebook account when you go to Facebook Watch
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:59.280]   is sign up for Facebook. Original shows, popular videos and producers and careers you love.
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:07.680]   Schmuck. None of these. I've heard of Will Smith. I don't really care about his bucket lists.
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:12.480]   Steph Curry. Okay, great. But I can watch him play basketball too on TV.
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:14.080]   Damn. You can't watch scam without it.
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:19.760]   Scam is awesome. What's scam? Oh, we've talked about that like two years ago.
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:25.520]   That's a kind of live teenage soap opera thing.
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:26.560]   But you can.
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:28.080]   Car sure. I want to watch that.
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:33.840]   It's good. Like I said, I got too much stuff on Netflix. I already went to watch
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:38.000]   thousands of brilliant women. It has really bad link.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.840]   Beatty stuff Netflix is dark. I try to go watch stuff on Netflix before I went to Athens.
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:49.760]   Try to download some stuff. Man, everything, everything there is depressing and dark.
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:54.400]   Yeah, but dark is really good. You know what? The German show.
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:57.120]   The world is kind of dark right now, Jeff.
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:00.080]   People aren't really ready to laugh.
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:04.080]   Or by media. What German show?
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:08.720]   Bill Cacao. Dark is Leo. You know this one.
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:09.600]   I haven't seen it.
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:14.560]   Yo, no, you've seen it. Dark. The German. It's like it's like Stranger Things.
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:16.800]   Oh, I did see that. Oh, right.
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:20.000]   It was the and I watched it first in dubbed English. I thought this is the
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:23.040]   world show I've ever seen in my life. And then I watched it in German.
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:24.960]   And I said, I don't understand it, but it's a lot better show.
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:27.200]   I think the second season just came out.
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:31.040]   Oh, yeah, it was good. It was basically German Stranger Things in German.
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:34.480]   You would like it, Jeff. But you know, there just came out today.
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:39.840]   We were talking about music. The Martin Scorsese documentary of Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Review,
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:47.200]   which I remember seeing was a seminal moment in my young life in 1975 at the New Haven Coliseum
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:55.280]   Arena. There's a bunch of good stuff on Netflix. That's not all dark.
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:58.320]   That's all I'm really going to show in me is dark.
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:01.040]   OK, well, maybe then you'll understand my pick of the week.
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:05.600]   So when you die. Oh, good.
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:14.000]   Instead of getting buried in a cemetery, I saw how I'm going to die this afternoon,
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.480]   by the way, just to just to hold a second die.
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:20.240]   You know my fear. I feel about hate. My hate of heights.
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:21.200]   Yes, your height, hate.
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:28.400]   The glass bottomed observation deck in the building normally known as the Sears Tower.
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:29.680]   Yes, cracked.
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:34.560]   What? I stood there and thought this is terrifying because you're looking down.
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:36.240]   My palms are sweating.
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:38.000]   It cracked and people fell through it. No.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:38.960]   No.
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:39.680]   Just as a crack.
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:40.880]   Wow.
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:53.920]   Willis if you search for Willis Tower, protective layer of Sky Deck cracks under visitors feet.
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:58.800]   And again, this is my scare at the Willis Tower.
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:02.640]   Another sky has scared under visitors feet.
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:06.480]   This video is shot on the 103rd floor last night after the legends protect
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:12.480]   players splintered into thousands of pieces. It actually covers the glass bottom below the
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:16.800]   Willis Tower says no one was ever in danger because of the fact that it was
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:21.680]   supposed to. But try telling that to the mother who was standing on with her kids.
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:23.840]   It's just the same thing.
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:26.320]   I was standing on over with my kids and it cracked.
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:30.560]   I thought I was going to die. But when I do die, I want to be buried in a tree.
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:32.480]   There we go now.
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:36.560]   Oh my god, it's cracking. It's cracking.
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:45.760]   That's the actual that's actually wild. This is a bridge in China that cracked while people were on it.
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:47.920]   Are you still showing it?
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:49.840]   Yeah, you could stop now, Carsten.
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:52.320]   So Jeff wouldn't do it.
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:56.880]   I'm pretty sure it's video screens.
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:13:57.760]   Oh, yeah.
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:13:59.920]   Yes.
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:02.880]   Oh, it's it's not real. No.
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:07.920]   Oh, it gives a terrifying experience an extra zing.
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:11.840]   Zing. Jeff Jarvis.
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:13.120]   So that's how I'm going to die.
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:14.480]   Now what are you going to do with my body?
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:18.240]   So if it survives that long fall, it doesn't just splat into a million pieces.
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:19.040]   Silicon Valley.
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:19.520]   What are you going to do with that?
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:22.720]   Silicon Valley startup called Better Place Forests.
[02:14:22.720 --> 02:14:24.320]   It's betterplaceforest.com.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:30.240]   Instead of and they've already bought started to buy up old growth forests.
[02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:35.280]   One of the things they do when they buy them up is they make sure they'll never be built on ever
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:40.240]   because now it's a natural memorial. There's one near us.
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:41.280]   I'm going to do this.
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:44.320]   You take your pick of giant redwoods, mossy tanox,
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:47.680]   reverend furs and more, find a tree that fits your personality.
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:49.920]   Choose your forest, make it your own.
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:54.080]   And then when you kick, they cremate you and they put you in the tree.
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:55.600]   They fertilize the tree with you.
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:59.120]   And I hope put a little plaque on the tree.
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:00.320]   I don't know about that part yet.
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:01.600]   Until the tree burns down.
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:03.120]   Well, it's well, but dies.
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:03.760]   Yes, fall.
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:04.960]   You know, everything dies.
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:05.440]   Whatever.
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:09.280]   You think that anybody's going to visit your grave in 100 years?
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:11.840]   Oh, yes.
[02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:12.320]   Oh, yes.
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:13.840]   I'll be famous.
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:15.920]   Oh, okay.
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:18.640]   You'll be like good people go to visit good as cemeteries.
[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:19.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:19.760]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:20.400]   Absolutely.
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:21.200]   Jim Morrison.
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:21.680]   He was on.
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:22.720]   He was on twig.
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:28.560]   Here's the one I wanted in Santa Cruz where I went to high school.
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:32.080]   It's an 84 acre woods on a ripped view.
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:32.560]   Look at this.
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:33.680]   Wouldn't you like to be buried there?
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:35.760]   Well, you're not actually buried.
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:38.480]   I think you're cremated and then they use your...
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:41.840]   You're in case you want to visit it or some hotels and restaurants nearby.
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:43.440]   [laughter]
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:44.960]   This is Silicon Valley.
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:45.920]   Let's see what this is.
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:46.560]   Silicon Valley.
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:48.000]   So you get pricing.
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.280]   So is this called cremation?
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:50.480]   Take your tree.
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:53.120]   Don't think so.
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:53.680]   No.
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:58.480]   Your pricing include is based on your tree's size, species, and location.
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:00.080]   Oh, Jesus.
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:00.800]   Not cheap.
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:03.600]   If you want a young tree up to 70 feet tall,
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:06.720]   rising toward the sunlight,
[02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:08.480]   our young trees are quickly headed for the canopy.
[02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:11.040]   Santa Cruz is $6,400,
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:13.120]   but point of arena is cheaper, $2,900.
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:16.560]   And then they can spread you out other places.
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:18.480]   Of course, if you want a big tree,
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:20.320]   Jeff, because you're going to live forever, $16,000.
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:21.360]   I'm a big guy.
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:21.600]   Yeah.
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:23.520]   Because you're going to have a tree that's mine size.
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:23.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:24.480]   Yeah.
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:28.240]   Cremation kills like most of your benefit for the tree.
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:29.360]   Yeah, they shouldn't really cremate you.
[02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:30.480]   They should compost you.
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:30.960]   Yeah.
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:32.480]   There are composting caskets.
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:33.440]   That might be the next thing.
[02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:36.240]   Did you see that?
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:38.880]   They spray you with a little mushroom foam.
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:45.120]   And you can even include your pets.
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:46.640]   Of course you can.
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:48.160]   Because there's plenty of room.
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:49.360]   Yeah.
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:49.760]   Yeah.
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:50.400]   What do you think?
[02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:51.440]   Oh, I like to say.
[02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:52.960]   Does they inject you in the tree?
[02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:53.520]   What do they do?
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:54.880]   They, what do they do with your spring?
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:56.400]   They just spray you on the tree.
[02:16:56.400 --> 02:16:56.640]   Yeah.
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:16:58.880]   Uh, spear you.
[02:16:58.880 --> 02:16:59.760]   You'll smear.
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:00.560]   That little bowl.
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:02.720]   That little bowl's wrote about this today and the times.
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:05.120]   A better place for us.
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:07.680]   It's cheaper than a cemetery.
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:09.920]   You don't have to worry about somebody cleaning your grave.
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:12.400]   They already have a few dozen remains in the soil.
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:15.120]   They've sold thousands of trees to the future dead.
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:18.720]   Most customers are pre-need, middle-aged and healthy.
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:21.680]   Decades have headed finding themselves in the roots.
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:24.880]   They've raised 12 million in venture capital.
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:26.960]   I'm Silicon Valley's southern.
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:27.200]   That's...
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:30.400]   I think this is a good idea.
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:31.440]   I'm in a series here.
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:34.240]   If your tree dies, they will replace it with the same species.
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:34.960]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:39.280]   I'm in as soon as they don't do cremation.
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:41.040]   Because this has always been my plan.
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:42.640]   To be glad it's finally...
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:44.560]   Get the mushroom spray and then just, you know,
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:48.000]   dig a standing hole and just jump in.
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.320]   Customers come to claim a tree for perpetuity,
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:52.640]   which costs between 3,000 and 30,000,
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:54.320]   depending on your tree.
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:57.120]   There's also $970.
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:17:59.600]   You could just be in a community tree, cremation not included.
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:03.520]   Then you get a round plaque in the earth like a gravestone.
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:07.360]   They dig a three by two foot trench at the roots of the tree.
[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:10.000]   They mix your remains in with soil and water,
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:14.960]   sometimes adding other elements to offset the alkalinity of the bone ash.
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:20.160]   You know, pets are allowed.
[02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:23.680]   Spreading is what they call the ash deposit.
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:26.880]   The trenches of space, the water can is a vessel.
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:29.680]   The onsite, sales staff are forest stewards.
[02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:31.520]   Get it right.
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:34.080]   And then here's available trees.
[02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:36.480]   You can go in the forest, see these ribbons?
[02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:37.840]   That means you could be buried there.
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:40.560]   That's a cheap one right by the liver there.
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:42.000]   Nice.
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:42.960]   Location, location, location.
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:46.400]   Death is a growth industry, says Nelly Balls.
[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:49.360]   Why isn't this in Mary Meeker's presentation?
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:51.520]   I think this is awesome.
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:52.320]   Look at the marker.
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:52.800]   You can't even know why.
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:56.160]   Look, and you can even have a little quote.
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:58.640]   I was spread here.
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:06.000]   Most people I know who had cremated relatives did this for free though.
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:07.520]   Yeah, you're not supposed to.
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:08.800]   They just kind of went to the tree.
[02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:08.800]   You can't.
[02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:09.760]   That's not right.
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:10.560]   You're not allowed.
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:13.520]   People say, oh, please spread me at Disneyland.
[02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:14.480]   You have to sneak in.
[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:18.960]   This way it's legit.
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:19.840]   Plus there's a plaque.
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:21.680]   I guess you're right.
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:23.040]   You could have somebody do it.
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:24.480]   My mother is in Memorial Garden.
[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:25.440]   My sister is church.
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:27.280]   My sister is about to be a minister.
[02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:28.080]   It's a little weird.
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:30.240]   She got to walk by mom every day.
[02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:34.480]   I'm going to do the mushroom spray, I think.
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:37.600]   What is this mushroom spray?
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:40.640]   This is like the Whole Foods mushroom rack thing.
[02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:45.040]   It's a composting.
[02:19:45.040 --> 02:19:46.720]   It's a composting casket.
[02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:47.200]   Mushrooms.
[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:48.800]   They turn you into a host.
[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:50.960]   They call it the mushroom burial suit.
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:55.000]   It turns dead bodies into clean compost.
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.120]   There would be so much better for the tree.
[02:19:57.120 --> 02:19:59.960]   Do you look good in that, Carson, I think it would be
[02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:01.160]   good for you.
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:02.320]   It's a good good one for you.
[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:03.940]   Would be great fro the detection too, apparently.
[02:20:03.940 --> 02:20:05.080]   Yeah, look at that thing.
[02:20:05.080 --> 02:20:08.060]   Yeah, and stealth.
[02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:11.460]   But this got a little fungi spores in it.
[02:20:11.460 --> 02:20:14.740]   And there you go.
[02:20:14.740 --> 02:20:15.960]   And you don't have to burn it.
[02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:19.860]   It's the infinity burial suit.
[02:20:19.860 --> 02:20:22.020]   And according to the CDC, it cleans
[02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:26.360]   the body of toxins before returning it to nature.
[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:29.360]   What does that t-shirt say?
[02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:31.000]   Choose the suit.
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:32.200]   Infinity burial.
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:34.600]   Well, that's a funding to go wearing around town.
[02:20:34.600 --> 02:20:36.400]   Yeah, get the t-shirt.
[02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:38.240]   The t-shirt's cheaper than the suit.
[02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:40.040]   The suit is $1,500.
[02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:42.480]   It comes in black or natural colors.
[02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:44.280]   Who cares what color it is?
[02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:45.280]   I'm going to have to get the--
[02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:46.480]   You're buried.
[02:20:46.480 --> 02:20:48.280]   I'm going to have to get the large.
[02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:49.920]   Let me just add this.
[02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:51.080]   Do you want an infinity?
[02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:54.380]   An infinity burial shroud?
[02:20:54.380 --> 02:20:57.440]   So then you have no coffin at all.
[02:20:57.440 --> 02:20:59.820]   They wrap you in the shroud, stick you in the ground,
[02:20:59.820 --> 02:21:03.420]   put a plaque by the tree, and you're done.
[02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:06.060]   That's Michael.
[02:21:06.060 --> 02:21:12.780]   C-O-E-I-O.com, if you want the infinity burial suit to.
[02:21:12.780 --> 02:21:14.540]   I feel bad for the people who have suit one.
[02:21:14.540 --> 02:21:18.700]   There's no upgrade.
[02:21:18.700 --> 02:21:19.700]   There's no upgrade.
[02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:28.140]   Ladies and gentlemen, what a way to end not only this show,
[02:21:28.140 --> 02:21:30.900]   but there's no upgrade in death.
[02:21:30.900 --> 02:21:33.540]   There's no upgrade in the infinity burial suit.
[02:21:33.540 --> 02:21:35.020]   One and done.
