[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. It's practically a real-time list of coronavirus
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   cancellations. We'll talk about what Google's doing to help people who have to work at home,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   including every single one of Google's North American employees.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   We'll also talk about some fun new products, including a sous chef on my counter
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   and the latest Chromecast Ultra. Plus, we've got a price for the Pixel 4a.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   It's all coming up next on This Week in Google.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   This week in Google comes to you from Twig's LastPass Studios.

[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   This is Twig.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   This Week in Google, Episode 550, recorded Wednesday, March 11, 2020.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Fruit of the Poison's Tree.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   This Week in Google is brought to you by Zip Recruiter Hiring.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   It's challenging.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   But there's one place you can go where hiring is simple and smart.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   This place, Zip Recruiter, where growing businesses connect to qualified candidates
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   try it free at ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It's time for Twig this Week in Google.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   This place he sneaks one last bite of lunch.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   So I'll introduce, I'll go on the other side.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I'll introduce Jeff Jarvis first.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Jeff is...
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   So, Anne can take one more bite of pop.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Yeah, you and I are the only guys not eating.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   What?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Jeff Jarvis, this would be a good time to read his entire title.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   The lettered title, professor for Gerlussing Innovation of the Craig Nubar Graduate School of Journalism.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I'm going to use this to scratch my nose.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Director of the Todd Eyed Center for the Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Nubar Graduate School of Journalism
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   at the Closed City University of Newark.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   They announced it's a closure today, yes?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Well, and we're going to go virtual.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Not until next Wednesday was the state's announcement, but then the city university said no, we're going on the even till next Wednesday.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   We're going virtual.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   My wife's going to be very sick of me.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It's problematic, not so much because the professors have to go home.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   But the kids have to go home too.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's rough for a lot of...
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   So some of these schools are keeping their dorms and facilities open and some people say, "Why?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That's just keep the professor safe."
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Well, no, because some of these students don't have anywhere to go.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Yeah, and I mean, the young people are not likely to have severe symptoms.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   In fact, the real problem is they may be asymptomatic, go home and infect their family and friends in towns.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So maybe that's where Harvard sent everybody home.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Stanford's keeping everybody in the dorms or keeping the dining halls open.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And I guess the idea is, well, we'll contain it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And it's true.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   You wouldn't want to send kids home who are, you know, have the virus.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   So it's an interesting issue.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I have a friend whose son is Harvard.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Sorry, Yale.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   She said, "Yeah."
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Oh, I get those so confused.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   He's home.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   He's home.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Yale and Harvard both doing classes virtually.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   All Harvard students are required to be out of the dorms by this Sunday.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   See, that's problematic.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Some kids, you know, are lower income.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   They don't have some where to go.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Their parents may not be ready to welcome them home.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   They may be Italian.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   They could be Italian.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You know, oh, you mean from Italy?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Not Italian Americans.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   They could be Italian Americans.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   No, they could be from Italy.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   They can't go home.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And you had enough pie?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   What pie?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   I'll introduce you now.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And Pruitt celebrating his birthday with a birthday pie, which we, you know, the whole habits die hard.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Hand shaking.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I find it really hard not to people shakes people's hands.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   It's very hard if presented with a pie with candles on it, not to blow them out.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Well, that was on purpose.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Who said I was sharing pie?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Oh, you're going to eat the whole thing.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I have seen aunt eat an entire half of a pecan pie when I was there.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Real.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   What was it the week I was there?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Yeah, there was leftover pecan pie.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Yeah, I was going to get a slice of it, but I came back and...
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   It was gone.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   You were just a tad slow, moustace.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I know.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And I didn't claim it.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I feel that if I had said aunt, save me a piece of pie.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Yeah, I'd had you back.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Definitely.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   If anyone would have said to me, she'd buy aunt, whatever.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Yes.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   That is the wonderful Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on IOT.com.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And her great podcast, O'Kevan Tofolie, IOT Podcasts.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   You know, we were thinking...
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   So Stacey, quick question.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Last week, we were all in suspense as to whether or not you were going to do a public event that night.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Did you end up doing it or not?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Oh, I did.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   That's actually the next day.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And I did.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I went to a Seattle and I gave my talk in front of a crowd of 250 people.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   What?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   They were supposed to be 400-something odd people, but something...
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Wow, you're brave.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Well, I was on stage.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I bet you you couldn't do that today.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   No.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   No, because Seattle just said that we can't have any more than 250 people together in a place.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I think there are a county just the south of us, 100 people.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Yeah, this is...
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   But all of this...
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Some people are saying, "Well, this is overreaction.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   It's being sensationalized."
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And you know what?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   With any luck in a few months, it'll seem like crazy.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   We close all that stuff with any luck.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   It'll be the right thing to do and everybody will be fine.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Anthony Fauci today testified that this virus is at least 10 times as fatal as flu.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   He also testified that...
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   As of right now, it's 30 times.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Yikes.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   He thinks it'll go down.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   He also testified that the mortality rate was only 1%, which is different than the booze.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Well, so what he said was, it's one and about 3% now.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   He thinks when we finally get testing in, it's going to reduce.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Though in Italy, it's 5%.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Right.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Yeah, that's...
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   I was like, without adequate testing, I was...
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   So, how do we...
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   How does he know?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   But even...
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   But he was trying to make a point...
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   He should have expressed it differently, I think.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   He was trying to make a point that even if you come down to kind of a lowest case...
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   It's still worse than...
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Still 10 times.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   And of course...
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   There's no immune...
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Fatal...
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Because it's a novel virus and there's no vaccine.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   So, people are vulnerable.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   The really thing...
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   The phrase I really like and I'm seeing it on Twitter and other places is flat in the curve.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Zaneup Tuficke wrote a great blog post in Scientific American explaining why that's really what we're all about here.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   The coronavirus curve or any epidemic...
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Oh, let me...
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I am a member.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I just haven't logged in.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Let me quickly log into the New York Times so that I can show you an example of this curve.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   The idea is that there is a curve, if it gets...
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And by the way, the who today declared it's a pandemic.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   There's a curve.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   The dotted line is the number of cases...
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Or I'm sorry, the Y-axis number of cases.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   The dotted line is the capacity of our healthcare system.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And without protective measures, the number of cases can go above our ability to handle it.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   That's what's happening in Italy right now with not enough hospital beds, not enough ventilators.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   With protective measures, if people do their best to wash their hands, stay healthy, not congregate, you know, social distancing, self-quarantine,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   you can keep that curve below the line on our healthcare system.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Notice, by the way, with protective measures, that doesn't mean fewer cases.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   It spreads the cases out. It flattens the curve.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And this is from the CDC and Zanep's excellent article in the scientific...
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   It explains...
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Yeah, a lot of doctors have been using that illustration you see it kind of all over there.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   And so it's quite standard in the field, which means they all believe it, and it's important to understand it.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Yeah. And so that's... And I think it's important to say it also because I think it helps people understand what we're about.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   We're not... You know, what we're trying to do is take care of people like Jeff.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   The old is the most vulnerable members of our society.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And not people like you, young whippersnappers.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Right.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I'm in the same box as Jeff.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And think of your parents. My mom and dad are 86.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Right.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And it would almost certainly be fatal for them. The fatality rate is very high for people in their age bracket.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   So I want to protect them. That's what we're up to.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Some Florida old folks homes are now restricting prohibiting visitors.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Yeah. And if you're a kid, don't even think about it.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   So I'm not going to make this show, by the way, be a coronavirus show.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   We're going to get this out of our systems and go on.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   There are some reporting to do.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   NAB has been canceled now in the National Association of Brocks.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Oh, and we've finally got very big show in Las Vegas.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I didn't see that.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   So has E3, the big...
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   By the way, NAB is in April.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   So they're looking ahead.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   This is, by the way, huge economic problem.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   South by in your old town, Stacey, canceled.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   And that means hotels, restaurants...
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   These are employees, which is the worst of it.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Right.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Those businesses will suffer.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And then their employees, as a consequence, will not get paid.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   It is a cascade. Go ahead, Stacey.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   No, I was going to say, South by, they actually, the organization that puts it on laid off a third of their workers,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   and they're contemplating bankruptcy because they can't...
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   So their insurance doesn't cover.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Well, that's one of the things that, you know, and here I am running a small business, and we're also on the edge.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   As a small business owner, I understand that...
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   By the way, this is not to add to your anxiety, Stacey.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Oh, no, I...
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   It's going to be fine.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Sorry.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   You knew it.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   But many small businesses, including ours, don't have a lot of cushion.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Right.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Nobody builds their business so that they could have no business for three months and then just spring back in action.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Well, that is... And there's a cascade effect from all of that.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   The NBA and the NCAA have announced that ongoing, their basketball games will have no attendees.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   The March Madness will have nobody in the stands.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   It's going to be eerily quiet.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Isn't that going to be just strangely quiet?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   It's like watching a practice.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   That's a lot of people out of work.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   That's a concession workers. That's security.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   It's a lot of people who won't be working.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   So the other thing we want to do, in the sense of serving, but I mean it in a best way.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   When you're home, listen to more podcasts.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Yes.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   There are ways you can stay in touch.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   I think...
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Stay informed.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Now is a good time to think about how you could perform your job at home.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Certainly we are as a business, but I think, you know...
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   And to that goal, Google's announced that they're going to offer their business level hangouts
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   for free for the next, at least through April, with...
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   For education, they increased at marketing.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   In case 250 people.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   We went to 250 plus recording, which we didn't have before in our account at the school.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   That's awesome.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   I think Microsoft's doing this with teams. Everybody's doing that.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   It's, you know, and it is.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I'm the cynic and I say, "Oh, the capitalism at work, because they're figuring,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   "Well, we're going to get some new businesses away."
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   But it's also the right thing to do.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Let me say this.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Let me say this.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Just for my little defending the internet hat for a moment.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   We go from moral panic to viral panic.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Imagine...
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Because this germ is just this germ.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   This germ can happen whatever, right?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   So it just happens.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Imagine everything we're going through right now, if you were going through this with no internet.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Yeah, thank goodness.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   No Google.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   No Twitter.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   No Facebook.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   No Amazon.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   No Amazon.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   That is something to think.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   And I read somebody I like last week and I haven't written a response to this yet.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Trying to say, "The internet's broken. We have to fix it."
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   And I just get...
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And the internet's doing more harm to society.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   No.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   No.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Yeah, we got to fix it.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Like we have to fix it pretty impressed.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Yes.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Fine.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   But God's sakes.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   There are some instances where I'm going to look squarely at Clemson University.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I saw a headline yesterday that says, "A potential coronavirus student or a person there."
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   And I'm like, "Why even print that and put it out there?"
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   They're sick, but you didn't necessarily have to put out there that they could possibly have the coronavirus.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   But then, the caution, as they say, and...
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   You know, that's full.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Just say it.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Well, because now you just decide...
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   The person actually gets it.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   You know, there's a 14-day incubation.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   The person actually gets it.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   You don't find out for 14 days.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Well...
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   You'll be a little pissed at Clemson?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   No.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   In respect to...
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   So the other challenge is there's no testing right now.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   So you're going to be possible for weeks without...
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I mean, you could die and still be possible for...
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   We went to RSA two weeks ago.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   You and I went to that party afterwards.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Now we've learned that two attendees did have coronavirus.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   One of them, a guy in his 40s, is in an induced coma.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   He has it so badly.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And so...
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   That probably was spread throughout many of the attendees at arson.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   It's coming to me.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   How many people...
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   They said hi, too.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   We don't.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   And who knows?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   We weren't at the convention, but we were at the after party.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   After party.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   We probably talked to people who talked to some of them.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   So...
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   It's been...
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   It's included into people's sensationalism.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   You don't want to sensationalize.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   I think there's a really...
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Bill Gates, I think, did a very good job of all people.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Describing as he wrote a piece in the New England Journal of Medicine,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   an opinion piece, he said, "We don't know.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   This could be that once in a century pathogen everybody's been worried about.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   We don't know."
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And one hopes would pray that it isn't.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   But it would be foolish and irresponsible not to act as if it were.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Much better to act as it were and prevent millions of deaths than to say,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   "Ah, it's probably not."
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   It's a mistake.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   I didn't mean to step on you, Anne.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Which I did.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   I understand what Anne's saying.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   No, I stepped on you.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   But because it just...
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   It pissed me off when I saw it yesterday because that's a small town in upstate
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   South Carolina and I've lived there and I got a good feel on how people think
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   and how people operate down there.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   And everybody is so paranoid.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   My own family included.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   You have no idea how many phone calls I've gotten.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Their texts I've gotten about it.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And I'm like, "Well, you all stop reading the news."
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Well, that's the question.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Should you just bury your head in the sand?
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   No.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   But you shouldn't be...
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   They're being out of shape and don't have to be.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Be informed.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Be informed to be prudent.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   But don't panic.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Hard not to panic though when you're reading all this.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Buying up all of the water on the planet and then all of the toilet tissue and all of the...
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   What does that do?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Somebody had a theory.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Harsden, why did you buy up everything?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Somebody had a theory that the toilet paper thing is kind of an irrational...
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   It's inexpensive and it has to do with cleaning.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And so it's this irrational thing.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   It's not likely that...
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   So if you go to my numbers, don't you find out if there's a paper?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   The toilet paper was already gone by the time I got there.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Well, but you looked.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   There's a Leo exactly what you're saying.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   If you go to my numbers, there's one down there called zero risk bias.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   An academic writing about this.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   That's the name for what this is.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Exactly.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Because you can't control everything.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   So you control the one that you can control.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Yes.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Right.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Yes.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   There's plenty of toilet paper in the US.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   So why are people hoarding it?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   This is from the conversation.com.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   And by the way, this happens every time.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Johnny Carson created a fake toilet paper.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Really?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Rush many decades ago by making a joke about it.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   No man.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   What do you expect?
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   And so, yeah, here it is.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   They actually mentioned it.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.400]   Government press release warning of a potential shortage in toilet paper led to a lot of press
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.640]   coverage, but no outright panic buying until Johnny Carson joked about it during his opening
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.640]   monologue.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.000]   Instead of laughing, people began to hoard toilet paper.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Now I have a better...
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   My wife got it from Costco and they were hoarding...
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   They were going after bleach.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   So don't hoard.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Don't panic.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Oh man, people are hoarding like rizzos.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.400]   But it's not a bad thing to say.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.320]   I don't know, Stacey.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.320]   I don't...
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.320]   What?
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:07.320]   So you've tweeted publicly about how...
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.000]   And you even wrote a post on your blog about this.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.360]   You said it's like 2010 all over again.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:19.560]   You can start obsessively reading Twitter and that's risky, obviously, for a lot of
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.560]   reasons.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.560]   I know you love Twitter, but geez.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.560]   So my...
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.560]   So my...
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.760]   I will say to...
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.520]   Because this is something I've obviously been thinking and writing a lot about because
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.720]   I've been so anxious.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:38.600]   A lot of mine comes from the fact that I am realizing that I had a lot of faith in our
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.760]   government because I feel like the United States was first world country where we're
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.560]   pretty good at stuff like this.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:59.040]   And what this feels like or brings home is we have let basic funding fail for a while.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.840]   We don't really have the resources in place and we don't have the expertise or the leadership
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:11.080]   that may not be actually necessary but is definitely psychologically necessary.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.640]   So I feel like maybe a person in Venezuela might feel like...
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:20.440]   I feel like a big support leg that I have counted on and not even realized I counted
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.320]   on has been taken away from me.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:29.480]   And so now I feel like this is driving all of that home and it's driving at home.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.520]   I'm not worried about being sick, actually.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.120]   If I get sick, I get sick.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:39.400]   I'm not actually worried about that, but I am worried about understanding...
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.560]   I'm worried about the lack of testing.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.080]   I'm worried about the lack of clear communication.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.640]   I'm worried that our government is actively lying to us in a way that I don't think our
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.200]   government has ever done in a time of panic.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.640]   And I'm also worried because I see people trying to be good and be their best selves,
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.400]   saying, "Oh, I think I'm at risk.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.800]   I should get tested and make sure I'm not going to infect people and not being able
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.160]   to act on those things."
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.960]   So that's where my anxiety is coming from.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.960]   I have discovered.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.640]   It's an opportunity too though for people...
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.720]   Well, first of all, I'll say a couple of things.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.720]   First of all, and this is really common in the tech sphere, in the geek sphere, this
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.240]   kind of cynical thought, "Oh, government's always a bad thing.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.040]   You just have Jerry Pournell come on and he's...
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.760]   Just all government is bad."
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.000]   And there is definitely that feeling.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.560]   Now, there is a place for government.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.320]   So I agree with you on that, Stacey.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:41.060]   But I also noticed that in troubled times, I think in 9/11, in troubled times, people
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:48.320]   step up and take care of each other in ways that during Katarina, FEMA was notoriously
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.460]   failed those people.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.960]   But people stepped up in a way.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.920]   It really gave me hope that people are good.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.320]   Not as good as dogs.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.320]   Dogs are better.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.320]   That's the thing in the world.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.160]   If you've got anxiety, just hug that puppy.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.160]   Hug that good boy.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.960]   Sorry about that.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:12.100]   So that's another way to look at it is here's an opportunity for people to step up and show
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.740]   our better side, our better nature.
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:20.380]   When government fails, and sometimes it does, it did it Katarina, right?
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.380]   Katarina.
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.380]   Katarina.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.540]   Why do I call it Katarina?
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.540]   I don't know.
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.540]   I am in Puerto Rico too.
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.540]   I am in Puerto Rico.
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.060]   You would rather that you call it Katarina.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.460]   Puerto Rico as well.
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.460]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.660]   Same thing, right?
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.660]   After the big hurricane.
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.560]   So I just saw this, this is just over.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:44.160]   The Lamar Alexander just blocked an effort in the Senate to require companies to pay for
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.960]   sick leave.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.120]   So people are not going to go, people who are sick are still going to come to work so
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.800]   they can earn the paycheck that they depend upon.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.800]   And they're going to spread the disease war as a result.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.800]   And this is a short trip.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:02.280]   And the new Bicell blocking cuts the CDC funding by about eight times I think.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:07.580]   Yep, they're also blocking efforts to keep pharmaceutical companies from overcharging
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.900]   for coronavirus tests.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.560]   How much does it coronavirus?
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.520]   One guy got charged $3,000.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.320]   Son of a.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.320]   Ooh.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.940]   Gates Foundation is going to be issuing.
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:27.100]   This is an example of the private sector stepping up issuing home testing kits for COVID-19
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.500]   in Seattle.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.580]   It shouldn't have to.
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.580]   It shouldn't have to.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.580]   Right.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:36.440]   Because when private industries step up, they step up.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.900]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.520]   They step up to their interests.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.580]   And it may be that their interests are everyone gets tested.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:51.220]   But the role of government is to protect both the least of us and also those in to protect
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.820]   us as a herd, right?
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.020]   So there's two priorities.
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.100]   And neither of those are happening right now.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.100]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.100]   Yeah.
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.100]   Anyway.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.100]   I hear you.
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.100]   I hear you.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.100]   So I think what else.
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:10.100]   So one thing I wanted to ask you about your piece.
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.860]   The and I don't do this to defend the tech companies.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:14.860]   I'm just curious.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.300]   Government certainly I agree.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.500]   Is there any more you think the tech companies should be doing now?
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:24.460]   So when I, yeah, when I wrote this, it was a, it was a week ago.
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.460]   So that's one thing.
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.460]   So things change a lot.
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.460]   So at the time, Microsoft is now.
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.460]   Yeah.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.060]   Well, they read your piece and they got their act together.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.060]   So yeah, I don't know.
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:40.260]   But in the point of my piece, honestly, is that government is relevant and it is relevant
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.260]   in two ways.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:46.660]   One, it funds infrastructure we need to build and to create innovation for technology.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:53.620]   And two, it's the entity that usually defines the data that we need and mandates its collection
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:59.340]   in ways that help us address systemic issues, right?
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:04.500]   And that then the parallel of why it's 2010 is because we had this chance with broadband
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.020]   and now it's coming back to bite us because we're like, oh, we need broadband for telework,
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.380]   but there's lots of people don't have access to broadband.
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:15.380]   And we kind of screwed that up a little bit in 2008, 2010 timeframe.
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:20.980]   Anyway, so the point for the tech companies is they are Microsoft has announced that they
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.780]   will pay people who are at the campuses, even if their workers are not.
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:30.980]   So if you're a cook at Google, I think Google's also said they're going to do this and a cook
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.700]   at Microsoft, you'll still get paid even if you don't have anyone to cook for.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:42.500]   I know that I've written about in the Microsoft courtesy, the shuttles that take you from
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:47.180]   campus, like building to building on their campus, those people will still get paid even
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.140]   though people are no longer on the campus.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.140]   Right.
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.140]   That's good.
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.700]   Big companies can do that, but little companies can't.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.700]   No.
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.700]   And that's part of the problem.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.180]   Yeah, if you're a Google employee, you're going to weather this storm fine and you're
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.460]   going to be working at home because Google has told everybody work at home.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:06.140]   Well, then again, as I mentioned on all about Android last night, it's telling people to
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:10.380]   work from home, which is essentially working from the parking lots there on campus with
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.020]   all of those RVs and stuff.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.380]   So it's the difference.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.060]   Well, at least they're stuck in there.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.180]   But as the little companies that can't, that it's going to be very hard to do this.
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:26.540]   And I think it's nice to say everybody should give people sick leave.
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.300]   But if you're Joe's burger shack, can't afford it.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.580]   You may not be able to do that.
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.700]   And if already, you're going check, check too.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.580]   The privilege question here is this brings out a lot of privilege.
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:41.900]   There's a hacker news thread, which is Google employees complaining that they don't have
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.820]   two bedrooms to have offices at home.
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.620]   Oh, and I get that.
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.620]   Right.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.980]   Actually, this is this is a thing because, oh, sorry.
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:59.900]   What about the person whose office is an Uber car or a UPS truck or a restaurant kitchen?
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.900]   Right.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.780]   And so we got to keep that mind in these cases that, yes, it's going to be hard for a month
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:09.740]   or two to be on your partner and you are going to get on each other's case in a small apartment
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.620]   in San Francisco because you can't afford anything more than a studio.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.380]   I'm not unsympathetic to that.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.580]   But let's please keep in mind that that's still going to be a privilege position.
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.860]   Because as you just said, Leo, you'll still be working at Google.
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.940]   You'll still be making money.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:22.940]   It's OK.
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.940]   Sorry, Stacy.
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:24.940]   Go ahead.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:29.540]   No, I was actually going to say as if this shifts to the concept of teleworking and more
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:36.820]   people working remotely for a variety of reasons, it's an interesting shift.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.580]   So I know that we're buying, we're obviously in the market for our house because we're
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.740]   going to be homeless soon.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:49.260]   And we need two offices, one for me, one for my husband, which is ridiculous because we
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:55.420]   only have one child, but we're looking at these like 25, yeah, 2500 to 3000 square foot
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:26:05.100]   houses because I'm like, I'm looking forward.
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.020]   And this is this is one of those interesting.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.660]   You couldn't get a partner desk with your husband.
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.460]   Yeah, we'll just look at each other across the way.
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.460]   So I'm doing twig.
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.100]   That's a good marriage, right?
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.500]   Hi, honey.
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.500]   You again, huh?
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.780]   White House has gone to Silicon Valley this morning, apparently, according to the Washington
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:32.860]   Post, to ask them to help combat coronavirus, track its spread.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.500]   And I think maybe most importantly, stop misinformation.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:44.100]   They asked Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, Twitter.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:50.020]   They met with for two hours with representatives from those companies looking for support and
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.260]   help.
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:57.060]   I would hope that they didn't say, can you guys just stop talking about it?
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:02.460]   During the session, which participants described as a collegial brainstorm, the post rights,
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:06.940]   and has officials urged the tech industry to coordinate its efforts to stop the spread
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:12.500]   of conspiracy theories, urging the companies to swap intelligence about harmful hoaxes
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.340]   before they go viral.
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:19.300]   And that's completely reasonable.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.700]   So we're all in it together.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.380]   I agree with you, Stacey.
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.900]   The government has a responsibility.
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:29.620]   And when the government fails to do its job, it's bad for all of us, all of its citizens
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.620]   suffer.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:37.020]   And I think the worst thing is hiding the numbers, suppressing the tests, that kind of thing,
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.740]   because you can't fight it effectively without that.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.620]   CDC is, I mean, tracking this over the last.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:47.460]   So CDC takes the weekend off.
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.180]   They don't update their numbers during the weekend, which just out of the loan, just
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.180]   put it in my buckling.
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:57.540]   So then when they came back to work on Monday, I was tracking versus Johns Hopkins has, and
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:03.460]   the links are down on the numbers again, there's a Johns Hopkins tracker across the world,
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.140]   which is excellent.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:09.020]   And it is invariably ahead of the CDC.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.260]   And somebody said, well, no, CDC only reports confirmed cases.
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.260]   I look back at the fingers.
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.940]   There's no confirmed and presumptive cases.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.980]   So they're at 938 right now.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:26.540]   And Johns Hopkins is at, for the US, is at, we're loading in, it loads slow.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.540]   A lot of people are 1135.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.900]   That's a big difference.
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.100]   It's a huge difference.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.740]   It's a huge difference.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.860]   You know, there's now a total.
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:43.700]   So the Johns Hopkins tracker, 122,399 total confirmed cases, 4,552 deaths.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:49.060]   And then there's, they're tracking the recovered too, but clearly that's underreported behind.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.060]   It's going to be deaths versus total will be the number of the other.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.060]   By the way.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:58.140]   I don't mind this so much, but we have all of the shows that we've done that have like
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:03.980]   this talked about coronavirus have been demonetized on YouTube because they don't want anybody
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.940]   making money on coronavirus.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.500]   Oh, no.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:13.380]   It's not a huge amount of money for us, but it's, it's YouTube apparently is after a
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.460]   lot of creators angrily said, what the hell?
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.460]   Yeah.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.460]   They're slowly start monetizing.
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.060]   And I think that that was not an unrealistic.
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.860]   It was an easy bet.
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.860]   It's true problem.
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:24.860]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.420]   Automatically demonetize it and then figure and then sort it out, you know, figure out
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.500]   who, because I, you know, I understand.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.740]   It's touching on both sides.
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.860]   Such a YouTube side and the creator side.
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.100]   Well, we don't, it's easy for us to say, oh, that's fine.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.380]   We don't rely on YouTube money, but there are a lot of people who do.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.980]   And if you want to talk about the biggest story going on and maybe share sympathy and
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:45.980]   share, right?
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.540]   Tips, not this information, right?
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:52.820]   Or just hearing like, you know, people feel a connection to people as hosts.
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.220]   And they would like, what is Jeff think?
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.220]   Right.
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.700]   I don't care.
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.020]   The markets are down a lot.
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:06.700]   20% the Dow, 19% since its peak on February 19 for the S&P 500.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.540]   So yeah, my FU money just said FU to me.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.540]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.540]   I know.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.540]   I know it was only a few weeks ago.
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.100]   I was thinking, well, at least at my retirement's in good shape.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.260]   Oh, man, was I wrong.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.260]   Wrong.
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.780]   Glamour magazine, Russia, glamour.ru cover mine.
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.060]   At cutting ass, put this up.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.020]   This is amazing cover for those of you on audio.
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.860]   It's a glamour cover with a model wearing a 3M mask.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:31.860]   I have mask.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:32.860]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.660]   It's a good shot.
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.660]   Well, that's great.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.660]   It's a publishing.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.660]   Yeah.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:49.740]   That's the other is the Australian newspaper that is dealing with the hoarding in Australia.
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.940]   Sorry about why I was coming in with printer.
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:51.940]   It's all right.
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:59.220]   It's like the BBC thing where they can't even where they printed pages.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.220]   Yes.
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.020]   For blue paper.
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.140]   Blue paper is a newspaper run out of blue paper.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.620]   The NT news cares.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:12.620]   That's why we've printed an eight page special lift out inside complete with handy cut lines
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.740]   for you to use in an emergency.
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:20.540]   Get your limited edition one ply toilet newspaper sheets starts on page 21.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.540]   And it really really did.
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:22.540]   It's a video of it.
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.420]   You open it up and there's a circle, but that's promote.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.420]   Right.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.420]   It's a little bit.
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.900]   I live in the Pacific Northwest and Moss is the acceptable.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.380]   Moss alternative to.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.380]   Awesome.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.420]   Well, oh God.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.380]   So that's I'm like, oh, we're fast.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.380]   Well, wait a second.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.380]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.380]   Moss falls apart.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.780]   No, no, I can't.
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.780]   I don't want to get the details.
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:46.780]   My old.
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:47.780]   I'm on Jeff.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:51.500]   Jeff, my father who hiked up.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:58.020]   Mount Rainier for 10 days when he was 15 used, used Moss the whole time.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.980]   Just Google Moss toilet paper and you'll see.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:00.980]   I don't want to know.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.980]   It beats a cornice.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:02.980]   I guess.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:03.980]   Oh, I crust.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:04.980]   I don't know.
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:05.980]   Look at it.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.860]   We're going to fall apart like a pie crust.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:09.860]   Sorry.
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:10.860]   Enough.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.860]   Enough.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.860]   Okay.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:13.860]   Time out.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.860]   I just want to offer that.
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.340]   There's an over Australian couple that ordered.
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.420]   So Australians are hoarding like crazy.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.580]   And I thought, oh, this is this is a lousy gone completely berserk.
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:28.020]   But she ordered 40 rolls of toilet paper and got 40 cases.
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.020]   Whoops.
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.020]   That's a lot of paper.
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:35.780]   So there's pictures with the story of her.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.780]   I was it up below.
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:37.780]   I thought I put it in the road.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:38.780]   No, it is.
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:39.780]   It's here.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.780]   I saw it.
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:41.780]   Okay.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.780]   Yeah.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.740]   And so they made a crowd a fork out of it.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.380]   They did all kinds of things with the toilet paper.
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.380]   Wow.
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.380]   Now it's fun.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.540]   Where we can.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.820]   Now there's actual news.
[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:53.820]   So we're done.
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:58.580]   That's the that's the coronavirus update, which we put in every show so that we can't
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.540]   make any money on YouTube.
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.740]   That's that's what we're up.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.140]   You should put out the show as part one, part two.
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.140]   Yeah, part two.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.980]   Actually, we have wouldn't be a bad idea.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.740]   The non coronavirus show.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.220]   If you called it that though, Google would still are you to be monetize you.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.260]   The show that's not about the virus, which shall not be named.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.260]   Now you get it.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.260]   Now you show.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:24.380]   Well, by the way, by the way, we also need now we're going to need a new phrase for
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.660]   videos that become really, really popular.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.660]   Can't say viral.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.660]   Can't say viral.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.740]   I don't know how to write.
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:37.180]   Although somebody said now I understand what the kids are talking about when they say viral.
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:44.060]   So Steve Gibson yesterday talking on security now about Android.
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:50.620]   And really, I think a severe problem, which is I think underreported partly because nobody
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:55.780]   wants to look like an Apple bigot or an Apple fan boy.
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:01.940]   But there are not only are there many phones that cannot be fixed from there's a number
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:08.500]   of Android exploits that are fairly severe that require an updated Android operating system.
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.220]   Many of them are still being sold.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.700]   There's a Sony Xperia being sold that can't be.
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:16.100]   In fact, if you look on Amazon, you'll find a lot of phones that can only run Android
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.100]   8.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:24.460]   And so as a result, I asked Steve, Steve, is it time to say stop buying Android or if you
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:29.860]   or maybe say if you only if you buy an Android phone, only get it from Google.
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:33.860]   But even Google will not update the phone after three years.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:41.740]   And Android is ridden with show stopping exploits, severe exploits.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:47.900]   You know, every hacker I know who goes to Defcon or Black Hat says whatever you do, don't
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.220]   bring an Android phone.
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:55.620]   Now we know all cell phones, including iPhones, have exploits thanks to this single SS7, the
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:59.580]   radio software, which is unpatched or never will be probably.
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:03.220]   But those are a little harder to take advantage of.
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:09.420]   The good news is there are at least there are Google Android phones that are less expensive
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.580]   and Eveleaks, Evan Blass had a picture.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:16.460]   I don't know where he got this of billboards.
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.460]   Oh, shoot.
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.220]   I got brought me to the wrong part.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.860]   Here it is.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:30.340]   For advertising the Pixel 4A, which is pretty imminent unless the factory making it is closed.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.100]   And look, this billboard says starting at $3.99.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.540]   Oh, well, that's the A's.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:36.540]   Aren't the A's?
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.540]   This is not the four.
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:38.540]   This is the A.
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.260]   But I think we're also seeing a whole punch.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.980]   We're seeing a little bit of what it looks like.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.900]   It looks like it's got three cameras.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.940]   Snap Dragon, set not.
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:48.940]   Even 65.
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.940]   Yeah.
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.420]   Nobody's going to get them free at I/O.
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.860]   No, sorry.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.420]   No I/O for you.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.980]   They'll ship them out.
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:56.980]   I/O for you.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.820]   Actually, it looks like it's a big camera bump, but it's deceptive.
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.980]   It looks like it only has one lens and then a flash.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.860]   It only has one lens.
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.860]   Only one lens.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:06.860]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.860]   You are so spoiled.
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:13.860]   How do you live with all your support and lens on your phone?
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.660]   I don't, you know, I love Android.
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:17.860]   I think Google does a very good job with its pixels.
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.580]   I'm happily sitting right here with a Pixel 4.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:26.260]   But I'm starting to really wonder if we should be recommending Android devices at this point.
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.460]   Well, go back again.
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:32.860]   If you buy the Google Pixel 4, you're OK.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:33.860]   You're fine.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.860]   For three years.
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.860]   So the question remains.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:41.260]   It's hard to recommend that people buy a phone that in three years, you're going to have
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.340]   to say you must get rid of it.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:47.180]   But Apple doesn't support their Oasis for more than three years.
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.180]   Oh, no.
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:53.340]   If you have an iPhone, you have the latest, you have to go way back to get an iPhone that
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:54.820]   won't support IOS 13.
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:59.420]   Yeah, I thought it stopped like the seven or something at this point.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.340]   Do phone batteries last longer than three years?
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.580]   Good point.
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.980]   Can you get a replacement battery?
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:06.980]   Yes.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:10.180]   Boy, I think a lot more portable one.
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.580]   Is that what you're talking about?
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:12.780]   No, you can get a replacement battery.
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.380]   Any phone you can get a replacement battery.
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:15.380]   That's true.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.380]   IOS.
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.300]   Let me see how far what the oldest I'm going back.
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.900]   I'm going back to get one.
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.220]   The six.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:28.260]   So the iPhone six or the iPhone SE or your oldest ones.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.260]   SE.
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.260]   I was thinking seven.
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:36.100]   So we're at seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven or five years after the six.
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.100]   Oh, well.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:41.500]   But I'm pretty sure they only promise a certain level.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.500]   Okay.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.340]   But it's not fair for Google to stop after three years.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:48.340]   Oh, there was no nine.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.340]   There's only four years.
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.340]   You're right.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.340]   So it's only four years.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:58.780]   How long does Apple support IOS?
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.860]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:02.860]   That's a good point.
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:06.740]   I mean, you shouldn't use an old phone, should you?
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.740]   Did it answer it?
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.740]   Yes.
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:09.740]   Here's the chart.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.740]   It'll say three years.
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.740]   Here's the chart.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:12.740]   Oh.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:17.220]   13 goes back, goes from 2015.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:21.020]   So it's five years to 2020.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:25.660]   But you can, and if you have, the thing is you can still buy a brand new iPhone eight
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:32.620]   or ten, well, that's not going to solve, save you much.
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:37.100]   But you can, yeah, you know, I think five years is not unreasonable.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:38.100]   But two years is not.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.100]   Two years is not.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.500]   And the real problem is you can still buy brand new Android phones that are forever
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.500]   vulnerable.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.180]   And that's a problem, I think.
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.900]   Well, the other problem is environmental.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:55.260]   If you make these things disposable, that's the presumption of disposability.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.500]   So anyway, we don't, I don't know when the foray will come out.
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.820]   That's probably up in the air because I don't know where they're making.
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:05.140]   There is apparently a Cuban store already selling it.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.740]   So that's a, that means that it's probably not too far out.
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:09.740]   Cuban store?
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:12.180]   Yeah, the video comes from Cuba.
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.180]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.340]   For real though?
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:19.140]   This is exactly what happened with last year.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.140]   Yeah.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.340]   But in the previous two phones.
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.340]   In a came up from Cuba?
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.860]   The three, the three was Dominican Republic.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.340]   Wasn't it?
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.980]   Okay.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.820]   So who, who, who, we don't know where it's being made.
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.660]   There's a video of it.
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:39.140]   Honestly, you still use a three a Jeff or did you get a four?
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.140]   I was three.
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.140]   I think the three is excellent.
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.780]   I think the four a would be excellent.
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.420]   And at least we have a good Android phone that's 400 bucks that we can recommend to
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.420]   people.
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.420]   Right.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.420]   I love the three.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:50.420]   Yeah.
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.420]   I like the three.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:52.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:40:00.380]   The only thing is it gets a little weird sometimes when I go from airplane mode to normal mode.
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:03.820]   My Bluetooth sometimes gets a little wonky, but that is the only complaint I have.
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:04.820]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.460]   And that's, I think that's not uncommon with phones sometimes.
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:12.540]   I was gonna say I don't think Bluetooth is perfect in any phone.
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.300]   Bluetooth is just not perfect in general.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.300]   Always a miss.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.300]   Oh, you're right.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.300]   It's awful.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.300]   It's awful.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.300]   It's awful.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.300]   It's awful.
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.300]   It's a horrific.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.580]   It's terrible.
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.580]   It stinks.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:36.340]   Anthony Levin Dowsky, you may remember he was a Google engineer who went to Uber and
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:44.540]   was then sued because Google said you took trade secrets over to Uber.
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:52.460]   He has been ordered to pay a fine of $179 million to Google.
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.580]   He immediately declared bankruptcy.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.980]   Big dollars.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.820]   That's a lot of money.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.500]   He says, actually, he's not doing that bad.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:06.420]   In filing for bankruptcy protection, he says he has 50 to 100 million in personal assets.
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:12.220]   So like not bad, Anthony, but he can't pay $179 million.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.220]   That's crazy.
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.220]   Man, goodness.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.220]   Wow.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.220]   Wow.
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:21.820]   I don't know which is more stunning, the fine or the amount of money he actually has.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.940]   It always makes me wonder how does a team of lawyers come up with these actual dollar
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.620]   amounts for any of these cases?
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.580]   I mean, that's pretty specific.
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.580]   179.
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.780]   Sometimes it's not a team of lawyers.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.180]   Sometimes it's a judge or a jury.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.180]   In this case, it was a judge.
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.260]   I wonder how do you come up with those numbers?
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.580]   I would think he'd go through a appeal before finally.
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.300]   They were fabulous, Ant.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.300]   They are.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.980]   There are actuarial tables that tell about how much certain people, certain jobs are
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.460]   worth, and then they kind of roll from there.
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:51.460]   Oh, OK.
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.660]   TIL.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.340]   And there may be actual losses.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:58.900]   Or Google may be able to say, well, that it costs us this much to develop it.
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:01.940]   Uber is going to get this kind of benefit from it.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.140]   Speaking of lawsuits, I don't know if you remember this.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.340]   I forgot about it.
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.340]   Uh-oh.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.340]   Tulsi Gabbert sued Google.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:16.860]   She's accused Google of infringing on her free speech when it briefly suspended her advertising
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.300]   account last year.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.300]   She sued for $50 million.
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:27.540]   A judge in the US District Court for Central District of California has dismissed that case.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:32.580]   Granted, Google's motion dismissed because he said the campaign had failed to prove the
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:37.660]   First Amendment clause, the prohibits government from curbing free speech, a pride to Google
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.380]   as a private company.
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.460]   You don't have a First Amendment right with private entities.
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.460]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.460]   Yeah.
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:46.460]   How many times do you have to say that?
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.460]   Somebody who's a private president can't read the damned bill of rights.
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.460]   Figure that out.
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:50.460]   Yes.
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:55.940]   You don't have a First Amendment right with the company.
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:02.540]   It was the first lawsuit ever by presidential candidate against a major tech company.
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:07.460]   She argued that Google by regulating political ads on its platform assumed the traditional
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:12.580]   role of government in terms of regulating elections and therefore was subject to the
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.580]   First Amendment.
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:14.820]   The judge disagreed.
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:15.820]   She's still in the running.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.380]   She's not going to be in the debate.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:18.380]   Yeah.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.180]   But she hasn't withdrawn yet.
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.300]   Google is not the government yet.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.300]   Thank goodness.
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.380]   I'll operate right now.
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:26.940]   I would take Google.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:27.940]   Yeah.
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.860]   Doctor Google would do a fine job.
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:45.140]   The Swedes have fined Google a whopping seven million euros because it doesn't even matter
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.140]   why.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:52.980]   No, because Google had failed to comply with the Swedish data protection authorities'
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:56.580]   orders to remove search listings.
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.660]   Google said we disagree with the Swedish decision.
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.020]   We plan to appeal.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:02.660]   I just give them the money, honestly.
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:05.620]   How much is going to cost more than a few?
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:06.620]   Yeah.
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:07.620]   But you can't set a precedent.
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:08.620]   Right.
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:09.620]   Sure.
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.660]   It's more about the press point, isn't it?
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:12.660]   The regular--
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.660]   Sorry.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.900]   I'm just like, so I'm well actually lady today.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:15.900]   Sorry about that.
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.860]   No, you're-- do you-- Stacy, well actually--
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.020]   She's actually just keeping us ground.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.460]   Well actually.
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.700]   The regulator also found fault with Google's practice of notifying website owners of delisting
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.420]   requests and who requested them.
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.100]   What's wrong with that?
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.580]   In its delisting request form, Google states that the site owner will be notified of the
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:42.020]   request in a way that might result in individuals refraining from exercising their right to request
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:47.820]   delisting, thereby undermining the effectiveness of this right.
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.220]   Hmm.
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.220]   Anyway.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:55.500]   But this-- it's completely unrelated, but it's Spain.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.580]   The Spanish Supreme Court said that Google has a right to do that.
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:01.580]   Oh, EU.
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:02.580]   EU.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.380]   You're so confusing.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.260]   It's the second GDPR find for Google.
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:11.180]   Remember France sued the-- find them 50 million euros.
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.180]   Seven million euros.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:14.940]   And it goes first, yeah.
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:16.780]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.060]   Does someone need to get that?
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.060]   Nope.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.060]   Thank you for asking.
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.060]   Well actually.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:25.060]   Well actually.
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:26.060]   Well actually.
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:27.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.060]   All right.
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:30.900]   Let's see what else here.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:35.740]   I'm not going to read that one.
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:39.380]   Facebook's 40% female and 30% black.
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:40.380]   That's good.
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.380]   Hey.
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:42.380]   That's a no rundown?
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.380]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:44.660]   We can-- we can-- I know where it is now.
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.860]   We can edit that one.
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.220]   Okay.
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:49.220]   It's the one right above it.
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:50.220]   You know which one.
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.220]   Oh wait.
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:52.220]   This is interesting.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.220]   Because Adam was sorry.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.220]   Hold on.
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:59.660]   Was that seven million or seven million-- seven million dollars or seven minute crooners?
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:02.220]   It said-- it says euros.
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.220]   Oh, euros.
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.220]   Or a political.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:07.460]   See, that's-- isn't that the universal symbol for a euro?
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.380]   That's what I thought.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.500]   Yeah, but Sweden's not on the euro.
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:14.500]   They're not on the euro.
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:15.500]   They use croon.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:17.660]   Well maybe that's the-- oh, I don't know.
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:18.660]   Maybe that's what--
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:19.660]   Dateline.
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:20.660]   Because Ireland is.
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:21.660]   Dateline Brussels.
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:22.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:24.420]   It's very confusing.
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:27.660]   Okay, well no, I just-- people were putting it out and here's the--
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.620]   I'm just saying that's what the headline read.
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:32.100]   That's what I read.
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.100]   You could figure it out.
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.300]   It's not seven million croollers or whatever the hell they use.
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:36.300]   Gotta do the crooners.
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:37.300]   Crooners.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.300]   Croollers.
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.300]   Hello.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:41.300]   Seven million croollations.
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.300]   Oh, I see them.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.300]   Awesome.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.780]   Like bring it.
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:48.500]   Every Swede gets a crawler on Google.
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:49.500]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.180]   The Swedes.
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.420]   I will say the Swedes do love their Swede products.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:55.820]   They like their donuts.
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:56.820]   They like their cakes.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.820]   Leganberry jam.
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:58.820]   Mm hmm.
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.060]   They're Leganberry jam.
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:05.660]   Actually, the Swedes have become very aggressive about encryption.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:11.060]   In a way, some say is anti-democratic.
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.340]   Yes.
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.540]   And I always like Sweden.
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.740]   I'm saying I love-- I love Ikea.
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:18.740]   Ikea.
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:19.740]   Ikea.
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:20.740]   Meatballs.
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:24.180]   No, actually, I've been to Stockholm a lot of times.
[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.300]   I've been in parts of places in Sweden.
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:27.300]   That's a beautiful country.
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.540]   It's a great place.
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.500]   They like many other countries now are cracking down.
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:38.340]   I guess we could talk about the Earn It Act that's coming up in the-- thanks to our fine
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.340]   senator from California--
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.260]   No, talk about the Swedish Act first.
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.060]   Do you want to talk about the Swedish Act?
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.900]   This is actually a pretty daring series.
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.660]   Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:49.860]   The only reason-- Oh, well, you're fine.
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:50.860]   No.
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:51.860]   The only reason why-- I'm like--
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:52.860]   I'm like--
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:53.860]   Please.
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:58.820]   The only reason-- I'm a little concerned about this is the source.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:04.020]   I never heard of the source for this story, and I haven't seen it anywhere else.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.020]   So--
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.020]   Linux reviews?
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.020]   Yeah, Linux reviews.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:08.620]   Yeah, I don't know that I've ever--
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.820]   So I don't know--
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:14.780]   I have seen other articles on this.
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:16.260]   Let me see.
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.060]   Sweden has ended democracy.
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:21.060]   See, that's a little sensational.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.060]   Here we go.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:27.460]   With the passing of a new secret electronic surveillance law, the thing that's scary about
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:33.780]   this law, it doesn't require law enforcement to have a warrant to install hardware, surveillance,
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:36.380]   hardware, and software and electronic devices.
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:39.860]   And according to the article-- and again, I really want to see another source before
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:45.420]   I get too head up about this-- it would allow the Swedish authorities to install surveillance
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:51.860]   devices on a place that the culprit, the alleged perpetrator, might even be visiting.
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.300]   So if you think, well, you know what I think he's going to go to Burger King tonight, you
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.900]   could put a camera up in there.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:00.300]   Again, and without a warrant.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.420]   So I want to see another confirming--
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:06.540]   The local, which I just put up, which is a good publication in English and Sweden.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:07.540]   Okay.
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.180]   Five things to know about the law.
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.180]   Okay.
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.180]   All right.
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:17.180]   So the National Police Chief says that in order to reach the most serious criminals, you
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:19.100]   need to be able to keep an eye on their communication.
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.460]   Otherwise, you will always be blind or half-blind.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:25.140]   As criminals turn to encrypted messages, we need to be able to follow them.
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.140]   Same argument.
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.580]   Every law enforcement--
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.580]   Everybody official.
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:29.580]   And the other thing that's--
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.580]   The other thing that's--
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:31.580]   The other thing--
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:32.580]   The other thing--
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:33.580]   The other thing--
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:34.580]   The other thing that--
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:35.580]   The other thing--
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:36.580]   The other thing that makes it possible--
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.580]   The other thing that makes it possible--
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:41.020]   The other thing that made me nervous is that the law comes into effect on April 1st.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.020]   So I really want--
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:46.860]   I'm glad you found a second source.
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:48.220]   It really is terrifying.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:53.820]   They can basically install malware on not only the suspect's devices without a warrant,
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:57.860]   but anywhere the suspect might be going.
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:58.860]   That's terrifying.
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:49:59.860]   I hope--
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.380]   What does this law mean for Sweden's images of Mecca for internet freedom and online privacy
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:05.580]   asks the reporter of him or herself?
[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:07.300]   The reporter of him or herself answers.
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:10.980]   This law cannot be considered as mass surveillance, since it will be used in a targeted manner
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:14.620]   only when someone is suspected of a serious crime.
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:18.420]   Police have estimated that they will need to use the law about 50 to 100 times.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:22.300]   Though, I would imagine once you have a backdoor in there--
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:29.380]   Well, and remember, I think this critical thing is you think they're going to be somewhere,
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:32.100]   you can install surveillance devices there.
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.300]   That surveils everybody who's there, not just the--
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:35.780]   Everybody else, yeah.
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:42.100]   So then the police are they going to ignore everything they see and learn there because
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.820]   they only want to get this one guy?
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:46.380]   I don't know.
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:50.460]   So wait, this is once you have a warrant to monitor a person's stuff?
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:51.460]   It's no warrant.
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:52.460]   No warrantless.
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:56.460]   Okay, so did you guys see there are two stories in parallel.
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.460]   One is from Protocol.
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:58.740]   It's from six days ago.
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:03.780]   It's on a company called Babylon.
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:05.020]   It's Locate X.
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.020]   Let's see, Protocol.
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:10.420]   I'll get this.
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:14.100]   Surveillance firm Banjo is the title.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.660]   Did you find it?
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:18.540]   Surveillance firm Banjo used a secret company in fake apps.
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:19.860]   Oh, no, that's not the one.
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:21.100]   Sorry, my bad.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.100]   That's vice.
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.780]   I'll find it, maybe.
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:28.900]   I had the link up earlier and now I can't find it.
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:29.900]   Sad.
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:30.900]   It was basically--
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:34.180]   All I can find is a bunch of articles about bluegrass.
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.180]   So you're going to have to--
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:41.500]   Yeah, no, it's Locate X.
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.940]   There's a company name associated with it.
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:44.940]   It's one.
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:46.980]   Ah, I found it.
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.660]   Protocol.com.
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:56.060]   So through apps, not warrants, Locate X allows federal law enforcement to track phones.
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:59.700]   Federal agencies have big contracts with Virginia-based Babble Street.
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:00.700]   That's it.
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:06.980]   So you're going to have to have a lot of information about the data.
[00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:12.580]   So you're going to have to have a lot of information about the data.
[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:16.740]   So you're going to have to have a lot of information about the data.
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:20.740]   So you're going to have to have a lot of information about the data.
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:24.220]   So you're going to have to have a lot of information about the data.
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:27.660]   So you're going to have to have a lot of information about the data.
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:32.660]   So you're going to have to have a lot of information about the data.
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:37.660]   And you're going to have to have a lot of information about the data.
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:41.660]   And you're going to have to have a lot of information about the data.
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:45.660]   And you're going to have to have a lot of information about the data.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.660]   And you're going to have to have a lot of information about the data.
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:52.660]   And you're going to have to have a lot of information about the data.
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:57.660]   And for the identities of everybody who's in this area during these robberies, in fact,
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.660]   they used it to track somebody down.
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:02.660]   He was in every single area.
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.660]   That's exactly what LocateX does.
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:08.660]   Google's always fought those warrants, but it's handed them over in time.
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:13.660]   A former government official familiar with LocateX provided an example of how it could be used.
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:21.660]   Referring to the aftermath of a car bombing or kidnapping investigators could draw what is known as a geo-fence around the site,
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.660]   identify mobile devices.
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:29.660]   So not just an individual, but in general that were in the vicinity in the days before the attack,
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:34.660]   see where else those devices had traveled leading up to the attack or where they traveled afterward.
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:36.660]   So it's everybody.
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:44.660]   And if you see a device that a month ago was in Saudi Arabia, you know maybe Saudis were involved or maybe not.
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:45.660]   It's a lead generator.
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:47.660]   You get a data point from there.
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.660]   You can use your other resources to figure out if it's valid.
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:53.660]   There's a recent story about this from a bicyclist.
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:54.660]   I think they were in Florida.
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:56.660]   Yeah, I remember that.
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:01.660]   And within the last week or so, I'll leave you as in Florida, an older lady.
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:02.660]   There it is.
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:03.660]   We got it on the screen.
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:08.660]   Google tracked his bike ride past a burglarized home that made him a suspect.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:11.660]   It's not fair, but I get it.
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:13.660]   That's what the tech provided as a data point.
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:14.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:15.660]   It's not fair though.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:19.660]   It's not very much different than having, say, a camera outsider home and then try to track down all the people
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:21.660]   that you saw in that camera.
[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:23.660]   I just don't think Google should be involved in this.
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.660]   And this, what this underscore is Google.
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:27.660]   I think they want to be a problem, right?
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:30.660]   This underscore is the problem with these, with our phones.
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:35.660]   It sounds like LocateX was aggregating data from a variety of other apps.
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:36.660]   Is that right?
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:37.660]   As Stacy?
[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:38.660]   Yes.
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:43.660]   So you may have apps that feed your location to LocateX already on your phone.
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:44.660]   Mm-hmm.
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.660]   Probably do, I would bet.
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:54.660]   But isn't Google right now trying to go through and do an audit on apps that are, you know, different?
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:55.660]   Right.
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:55:02.660]   And Android, just like iOS now, does prompt you if an app has, is gathering your location behind the scenes all the time.
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:03.660]   Mm-hmm.
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.660]   And by the way, that's worked really well, at least on the Apple side.
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:11.660]   People who gather location information report that ever since Apple started saying,
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:14.660]   "Do you want to allow this all the time or only when the app's running?"
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.660]   In fact, the Apple pop-up doesn't even give you all the time.
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:17.660]   Right.
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:19.660]   It says, "Disallow or only when the app's running.
[00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:22.660]   If you want to turn it on all the time, as you might with, say, Google Maps,
[00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:26.660]   you have to go in the set, dig down into the set, find it and turn it on."
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:31.660]   And that has reduced dramatically the amount of location information apps on iOS get.
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:32.660]   It's a good thing.
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:33.660]   That's a good thing.
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:34.660]   It is.
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:40.660]   I have to say, I love my Android devices and I love the configurability, but I have to say increasingly I'm thinking,
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:46.660]   and if you really, I mean, Apple at least steps up and tries to protect you.
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:47.660]   It's not perfect.
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.660]   No, Apple makes you shtick a Google.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:52.660]   Well, Google tried to protect this gentleman too that we just talked about.
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:53.660]   Yeah.
[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:54.660]   They did.
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:55.660]   I mean...
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:59.660]   They said, "Hey, look, the law enforcement are trying to get this information, so here's our note to you.
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:03.660]   You have to get over there to the courts within X amount of days to fight this out.
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.660]   They didn't just flat out say, "This is you."
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.660]   But they said, "It's up to you to fight it."
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.660]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:09.660]   They did say it's...
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:15.660]   So the two remedies here, Google either decides to dump that information after a very short period of time,
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:16.660]   which they could do.
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.660]   They could, yeah.
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:26.660]   Or two, we write our laws to be a little bit more protective in this case of people who might be caught up in these sorts of drag nets.
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:28.660]   Those are your two options.
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:29.660]   That's the key.
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:30.660]   That's the key.
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:33.660]   And it's like the...
[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:37.660]   Light detectors.
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:38.660]   Right.
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:39.660]   So you can do that.
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:41.660]   You can test the galvanic skin response.
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:42.660]   You can get the data.
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:45.660]   What does it mean and how do you use it?
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.660]   Matters.
[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:48.660]   You can tap phones.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:52.660]   But we put laws in place that said you can't do that without a warrant.
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:56.660]   We did not do that in the case of your male, electronic male.
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:57.660]   And that's the issue.
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:58.660]   So we've got it.
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:05.660]   We do not have a high level principle of privacy under which these things can then flow.
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:08.660]   Instead, we're doing a technology by technology episode by episode.
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:10.660]   That's what's wrong here.
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:17.660]   The thing that really bothers me about locate X is that if you go to Google, you got to get a warrant.
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:19.660]   You got to subpoena them.
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:20.660]   They're going to fight you.
[00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:22.660]   It's a higher standard.
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:23.660]   They're now even charging.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:27.660]   They still don't like geofence warrants, but at least there's a higher standard.
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:29.660]   So the police, what are the police do say?
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:32.660]   Well, more we could just go to locate X and buy the information.
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:33.660]   Right.
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:34.660]   And that's terrible.
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:35.660]   Right.
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:37.660]   That's where it sounds similar to that clear view AI.
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:38.660]   You're right.
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:39.660]   That's where it's similar.
[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:40.660]   That's where it's similar.
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:41.660]   Yes.
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:42.660]   You're exactly right.
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:50.460]   Now, one could argue though, that in a case, a legal case, if it becomes clear that this
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:55.660]   is how a company is getting their data, then what you would see is prosecute or sorry.
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:57.660]   Going after locate X.
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:58.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:02.260]   Defenders going after and trying to defend someone and going after it that way.
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:08.860]   And you could invalidate police use of this in one or two sweeping court cases.
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:09.860]   That's a good point.
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:15.780]   If it's a good defense to say, "Your Honor, they bought this information from the sketchy
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:16.780]   company."
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:17.780]   Right.
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:18.780]   They violated unreasonable search and seizures.
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.620]   It's true of the poisoned tree, Your Honor.
[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:23.980]   Oh, I learned that on the LA Magazine.
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:24.980]   That's a deal.
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:29.620]   But I don't think they just got data that's available otherwise, so they didn't use their
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:30.620]   power, right?
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:34.180]   Well, that's for a judge to decide.
[00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.980]   That's unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:39.260]   All right.
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:41.340]   So then I would go with fruit of the poisoned tree.
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.340]   I'm not a lawyer.
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.340]   Yeah.
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.340]   I'm not a lawyer.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.340]   But it's like saying fruit of the poisoned tree.
[00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:48.500]   Someone is going to have to come and fight that.
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:52.020]   And a lot of people are just going to acquiesce and get cut up in it, most likely those who
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:53.020]   are poor.
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:56.140]   And I mean, this guy happened to talk to his parents and his parents were like, "We'll
[00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:58.140]   spend a couple thousand dollars for a lawyer otherwise."
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:58:59.140]   Isn't that sad?
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:01.820]   And he went out and hired a lawyer.
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:03.380]   That costs them a lot of money.
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:04.380]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:05.380]   Yeah.
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:08.020]   And this is where, like if Google's like, "Screw it, we want to keep this information,"
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:11.540]   I would like to see Google and all these other companies start looking at these laws and
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:14.740]   saying, "Hey, we should probably make the lobbying effort to protect our customers,"
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:17.540]   because eventually our customers are going to be like, "Screw these phones."
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:18.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:19.540]   So Google.
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:20.540]   Excellent point.
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:21.540]   Get on it.
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:24.620]   Well, Stacy, I could be on it.
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:27.340]   The platforms need to stand up and protect the Internet more.
[00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:33.100]   When it comes to Section 230, Ron Weiden, the Senator who was a co-author of it, is enraged
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.100]   of the platform.
[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:38.420]   It's because they didn't send anybody high up to fight Fosta Cesta, because who wants
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:41.580]   to stand up in favor of child porn was their PR view.
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:44.820]   But what they didn't do was stand up for the First Amendment of the Internet.
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:47.540]   They didn't stand up for free speech.
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:51.860]   So yes, with great power comes great responsibility.
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:56.620]   And if they are the proprietors of the Internet for now, they should be better protectors
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:58.500]   of it, and I too get angry at them.
[00:59:58.500 --> 00:59:59.500]   Yes.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:04.420]   By the way, that works so well for Fosta Cesta that now the government's working on the
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:05.420]   Earnet Act.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:06.420]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:10.260]   I took this away from Earnet.
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.820]   I'll bring it back to Earnet.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:12.820]   Nicely done, sir.
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:20.380]   This is a, by the way, Barry Partisan Bill sponsored by Matthew Green's article is very
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:21.380]   good.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:27.220]   I'm a photographer at Johns Hopkins and not a, you know, a crazy flaming political guy.
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.220]   This guy is very serious.
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.860]   Oh, he taught me all about differential privacy.
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:30.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.860]   He's good.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:32.860]   I like him a lot.
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:33.860]   Yeah.
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:34.860]   He's one of the best.
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:36.700]   So Lindsey Graham and Dick Blumenthal, boy, if you wouldn't expect them in the sit in a
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:43.020]   tree, co-sponsors, this bill is a weird bill.
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:47.980]   It attacks some of the things we hold very important on the Internet in very interesting
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:48.980]   ways.
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:57.580]   These companies will have to earn their section 230 protection by doing everything they can
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:00.260]   to capture child predators.
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:01.820]   Always a good thing.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.620]   As if the platforms aren't, this is such a PR thing.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:08.740]   As if the platforms are not in fact today doing everything they can.
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:11.460]   They are not doing everything they can.
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:12.460]   They are not, Jeff.
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:13.940]   Did you not read that?
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:19.980]   The horrifying story in the New York Times about how they don't respond in time to police
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:24.300]   efforts to get data from them because they don't have enough people.
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.300]   You didn't see this.
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:28.780]   Go read that story because it is horrifying.
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:33.180]   In it, it doesn't argue for encryption or any, you know, it's not making those kind
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:38.540]   of arguments, but it's basically saying that these tech platforms are in a lot of ways
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:43.900]   complicit because when investigators try to get data, they have to wait.
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:49.740]   It speaks to get the legal, to get proof basically back from these companies and people are going
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:52.340]   free, people, they can't catch them in time.
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:56.140]   Maybe they're just, maybe law enforcement, scapegoating, but it sounded pretty.
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:00.060]   It's a very good thing to invoke.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:02.460]   Think of the children.
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:07.540]   As a guy said again, it worked really well with Foster and Sesta.
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:08.540]   Earn it works.
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:13.860]   This is Matthew Green writing by revoking section 230 protections.
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.620]   That's a sacred cow for us on the internet.
[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:20.060]   It makes it possible for providers to operate on the internet by preventing the provider
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:26.060]   from being held responsible for what their customers do on a platform like Facebook.
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:30.540]   Just like the phone company's not responsible, the conversations you have on the phone, section
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:37.900]   230, protected Facebook, Twitter, more importantly, at least from my point of view, blog, comment
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:41.300]   sections from stuff posted there.
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:47.100]   The new bill, Green goes on to say, would make it financially impossible for providers like
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:54.100]   WhatsApp and Apple to operate services unless they conduct, and this is in quotes, best practices
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:58.700]   for scanning their systems for child porn.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:04.660]   But Green says, "There are no best practices in existence and the techniques for doing this
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:07.660]   and still at the same time preserving privacy are completely unknown."
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:08.860]   There's the rub.
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:13.540]   The bill creates a government appointed committee that will tell technology providers what technology
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.860]   they have to use.
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:19.860]   The specific nature of the committee is Byzantine and described within the bill itself.
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:24.980]   Needless to say, the makeup of the committee, which can include as few as zero data security
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:29.460]   experts, ensures that end-to-end encryption will almost certainly not be considered a
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:32.100]   best practice.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:36.300]   You can't scan those messages for illegal activities.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:39.300]   Well, you can't have that encryption.
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:43.740]   So Green, who's a cryptographer, thinks this is a backdoor way to allow the government
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:46.900]   to ban encryption on commercial services.
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:51.060]   And even more beautifully, it doesn't come out and actually ban the use of encryption.
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.180]   It just makes it commercially infeasible.
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:55.020]   It's like a big goal.
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.220]   And it's probably like a few things.
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:58.740]   Yep, clever, isn't it?
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:01.580]   Yep, and small companies, this could kill them.
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:07.060]   And so if you hate the platforms only in the world and you want some new entrants, this
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:10.300]   kind of regulation creates a barrier of entry.
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:16.260]   And unfortunately, and this again works so well with Faust and Cesta, everybody who writes
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:20.580]   about Cesta say, "Oh, I'm not in favor of child sexual abuse material.
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:24.740]   Let me be clear, that's horrific, that's terrible."
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.540]   And that's why they use this.
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:30.260]   They just need to be pro-internet freedom.
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:34.020]   This is like the abortion language.
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:37.140]   Pro-choice or pro-life.
[01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:39.580]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:47.700]   And encryption makes scanning for child sexual abuse material almost impossible.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:54.940]   And so I'm not going to presume that Diane Feinstein and Lindsey Graham and Dick Bluenthall
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:59.900]   are proposing this bill because they want to get rid of encryption.
[01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:03.340]   Although they've all said they want to get rid of encryption.
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:05.180]   No, but it may be.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:10.020]   But if Diane Feinstein's been not a friend of encryption, she doesn't know why.
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.020]   Yeah, she does.
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:12.020]   And Lindsey Graham does not like it.
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:13.940]   I don't know where Dick Bluenthall stands on it.
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:18.900]   But you know, and it could very well be, you know, you're a senator, you go around,
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:22.860]   I need sponsors for my bill, it's against child sexual abuse.
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:25.260]   Okay, sign me up.
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.740]   They're not technically sophisticated.
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:32.740]   They may not understand that no means it really exists to do this in a private way.
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:35.060]   It allows encryption.
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.980]   And so we're all against child porn.
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:39.380]   Nobody's saying that's a good thing.
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:40.380]   Nobody.
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:41.380]   Amen, brother.
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:46.100]   But be careful what you wish for.
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.980]   Section 230 is really important.
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:52.500]   Without section 230, these businesses can't operate.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.780]   They just can't operate.
[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:58.540]   So they're, or to put it another way, forget the businesses, we can't converse.
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:05:59.540]   Right.
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:02.460]   Because they're not going to let us converse because as our conversation will put them
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:04.980]   in a position of liability.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:10.740]   So in that case, they're going to say, well, section 230 encryption, which is more important
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:14.100]   to my business, it's very clear.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.100]   Section 230.
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.100]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:17.100]   Encryption.
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:18.100]   Okay, fine.
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.060]   So that's actually, you got to admire their clever.
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.060]   That's clever.
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.580]   It sounds like some lawyers has been at it.
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:24.580]   Clever.
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:29.220]   Instead of going head on against encryption, like the Swedes or whoever, like the Russians
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:36.060]   and Australians, this is a little side, a little jiu-jitsu, very clever.
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.460]   Wow.
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.460]   Let's see.
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:41.260]   Okay, I should give you some happy stuff.
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:42.260]   Can you say that?
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:43.260]   Or an ad?
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.260]   I'll give you an ad.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:45.260]   I think I've got plenty of time.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:47.060]   But it's a happy thing to converse.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:49.100]   That's the happiest thing of all.
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.100]   Calm down.
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.100]   I'm going to get the ad.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.100]   I promise.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.100]   The economy's creating.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.100]   I'm going to get some more.
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:58.100]   Carson told me that we wouldn't be on for too long today.
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:00.100]   Oh, no, that was you, Leo.
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:07.100]   Oh, I'm glad you're looking at this face.
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.100]   Stacy.
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:11.100]   All right.
[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.860]   Google plans.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:15.700]   I'll just do one happy story.
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:16.700]   Don't worry.
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:17.700]   It's not going to last long.
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:18.700]   Google Play.
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:19.700]   Party.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:20.700]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:21.700]   We're going to get dinner here.
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:22.700]   That is me.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:29.380]   When you go to my house for a dinner party, you're seated at dinner or snacks, like pre-dinner
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:31.020]   snacks right away.
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.180]   Love it.
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.180]   I would.
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.180]   Sorry.
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:39.500]   I will just let you know that if you come to my house, you will get snacks immediately.
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.980]   You will be.
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:41.980]   That's better.
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:44.300]   You will be supplied with food and liquor immediately.
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.300]   I can confirm.
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:47.900]   Yeah, you can confirm, right?
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:48.900]   I can confirm.
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:49.900]   Lisa, thank you.
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:50.900]   You're serving so much hors d'oeuvres for it.
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.460]   Nobody's going to have any room for supper.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.900]   You walk in and nest the first thing you see.
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.900]   He's food.
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:57.900]   He's lots of food.
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:01.020]   And now, thanks to Carson, I have an entire...
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:02.020]   Oh, that ham.
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:03.020]   That ham.
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:05.100]   Yeah, that ham looked awesome.
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:06.100]   It's really good.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:07.820]   Come on over, everybody, because it's me.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:10.300]   I got 40 pads a ham on my kitchen counter.
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.300]   Hamon.
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.660]   Hamon serrano, the Spanish ham.
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:20.620]   He bought a rack for it, and it has a special sword-like knife so you can thinly slice
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.420]   it because of it.
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:23.420]   I should...
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:24.420]   You know what I should...
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:25.420]   Oh, I was stupid.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:30.180]   I should have done a time lapse so you can see it whittle it down because it's already
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.460]   considerably whittled.
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:33.780]   It doesn't been whittled already.
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:34.780]   This is about this much gone.
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:35.780]   I'm impressed.
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:36.780]   Oh, man, I love that.
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:38.260]   I'm impressed that you don't put that much work on it.
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:39.260]   I can't.
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:41.260]   I can't walk by it, not slice it off of that sucker.
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:42.260]   It's like candy, right?
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.460]   I love it.
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:44.460]   It's salted.
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:47.020]   It's basically a country ham.
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:50.340]   It's a salted cured Spanish ham.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:51.700]   Slice it very thinly.
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:54.140]   Put it on a nice cracker.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:55.140]   That's dinner.
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.780]   That's good living there.
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:57.780]   The hamon.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:58.780]   There it is.
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:08:59.780]   I'm on freedom.
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:00.780]   A little cheese, please.
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:01.780]   It's a freedom ham.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:02.780]   You don't eat cheese with this.
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:03.780]   It's so good.
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:06.580]   I was eating it without the cracker, but I really thought something should absorb all
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.940]   that grease, so I put a little cracker on it.
[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:12.340]   You already deserve it.
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:13.340]   Absorb all degrees.
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:14.340]   They got it.
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:15.340]   Google plan.
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:17.260]   You're happy story.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:18.260]   Delaying it.
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:20.260]   You have it further.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.060]   Oh, screw it.
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:24.220]   Let's do an ad.
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:26.500]   No, Google plans.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.220]   A new Chromecast Ultra.
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.540]   This is not as happy as I thought it was going to be.
[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:31.540]   Why not?
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:33.140]   It's going to have a remote.
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.340]   That's not a bad thing.
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.340]   Yay.
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:36.340]   I don't know.
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.340]   It's not that bad.
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.340]   That's not a bad thing.
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:39.900]   I mean, it's a way we'll ever see it now.
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:41.460]   It's just a remote on my couch.
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.500]   They're making it in Italy.
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:48.180]   You're losing the whole phone connection in all of its clujiness because the Chromecast,
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.300]   I had a love-hate relationship with Chromecast.
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:53.340]   No, that's a good point because I think it confused a lot of people that the phone was
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:54.340]   the remote.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:57.180]   It's like, "Well, what?"
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:02.900]   So now it's a mass consumer dongle that runs Android TV, which that's good too.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:03.900]   Good news.
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.580]   So you'll get YouTube TV, Netflix, Disney+ Hulu and more because instead of having to
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:12.620]   have that on your phone and then sending it to the Chromecast, all of those reasons
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.900]   to fail before you get to watch your first show.
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:19.060]   No information on pricing or availability.
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:22.260]   Probably something they thought about launching at Google I/O along with the Pixel 4A, but
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.260]   that's all gone.
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:26.660]   It sounds like a nice competitor to the Roku folks.
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:27.660]   Yeah.
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:28.660]   That's a little stick.
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:29.660]   I dig that.
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:30.660]   I do too.
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.460]   And actually I like Android TV.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:38.020]   Unfortunately, a lot of over-the-top streamers do not.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:39.820]   I like my Roku so much.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:40.820]   Roku is nice.
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.820]   We got one.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.820]   Roku is the best.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:47.980]   For instance, at least with Chromecast, when you try to sign on the HBO Go on the Android
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:49.580]   TV, it says no.
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:55.420]   I just don't understand when Roku is out there, why would you want a Google product?
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.420]   No, you're right.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:57.420]   Sorry.
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.420]   It's just choices.
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.420]   It's competition.
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:00.420]   It's good.
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:03.860]   It works with Google Voice or Google Assistant.
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.940]   Yes.
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.220]   It has other features.
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:08.740]   My favorite Android TV is the Shield.
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:26.320]   The
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.100]   Samsung, the iPhone, and the iPhone, the iPhone, the iPhone, the iPhone.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:34.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:36.860]   It's a little bit different.
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:37.860]   It's a little bit different.
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.860]   It's a little bit different.
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:39.860]   It's a little bit different.
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:40.860]   It's a little bit different.
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:42.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:44.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:45.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.860]   It's a little bit different.
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:47.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:48.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:49.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:50.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:51.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:52.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:53.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:54.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:55.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:56.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:57.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:58.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:11:59.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:00.860]   It's a little bit different than the iPhone.

[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:53.860]   You didn't get much pie, I'm sorry.
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:56.860]   I got a bit of a slice out of there, I'm good for tomorrow.
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:58.860]   I love how he looked like a guilty German chicken.
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.860]   I know, it's like cute.
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:02.860]   Yeah, busted.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:04.860]   I'm not hiding it, I love pie.
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:07.860]   He's titrating that pie, he's going to get that pie to last all day.
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:08.860]   Just drink it.
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:13.860]   Oh, I'm sorry, Ant.
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:18.860]   We should really have a good conversation that doesn't involve Ant so he can really shut down.
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:21.860]   Oh, birthday present for Ant is leaving him alone.
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.860]   I still have pie for post-show work.
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:27.860]   15 minutes after the show, it'll be gone.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:30.860]   I love it, they gave you a whole pie just for yourself.
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.860]   I love it too, that's so grateful.
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:35.860]   We got a second one for the staff, so they got to have some.
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:36.860]   What kind of berries?
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:38.860]   It's really very, very low.
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.860]   I didn't know where that was until moving out here.
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:43.860]   Oh, they're delicious, they're kind of like blackberries, yeah.
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:44.860]   That's correct.
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:46.860]   I was like, I've had Mary and Berry pie.
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:51.860]   Is it just a coincidence that the former mayor of Washington, D.C. that was busted for cocaine?
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:55.860]   Yes, in his clean and very, very, very, very coincidence.
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:16:00.860]   Yeah, because his parents probably didn't know there was a California thing called a Mary and Berry.
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:01.860]   Probably not.
[01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:03.860]   Mary and blackberry.
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.860]   And I don't see any.
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:07.860]   It's not just California, it's Oregon too.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:08.860]   It's what?
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:09.860]   Oregon?
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:10.860]   Oregon, Oregon, all right.
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:11.860]   West Coast.
[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:13.860]   They don't have it in North Cackalacki.
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:16.860]   Nope, we just call them blackberries over there.
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:19.860]   It's a variant.
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:21.860]   California takes everything special.
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:22.860]   Special.
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:24.860]   California variety.
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.860]   Oh, are those carri... California?
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:28.860]   They have them appear in Washington too.
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:31.860]   They're from Mary and the county of Oregon, that's what I heard.
[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:33.860]   And they do look, they are based on their blackberries.
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:35.860]   That's a blackberry.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:38.860]   We call those do berries in Houston.
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:41.860]   They look just like O'Lallyberries or all of that.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:42.860]   They're all just different variants of that.
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:43.860]   Oh, that's what those look like too.
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:44.860]   Yeah.
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:45.860]   Okay.
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:46.860]   Right.
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:47.860]   Cars are in O'Lallyberries similar.
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:49.860]   O'Lallyberries are more like blueberries.
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:50.860]   Oh, okay.
[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:51.860]   No.
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:52.860]   Okay.
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:57.860]   It's a cross between an O'Lally blackberry and a Chihalum blackberry.
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.860]   Never heard of them, but it's delicious.
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:01.860]   There's an O'Lallyberry.
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:05.860]   On the O'Lallyberry, they don't have a picture of the berry, just the pie.
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:06.860]   Nothing.
[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:08.860]   And no if said.
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:09.860]   Pie.
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:11.860]   I need pie.
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.860]   This is what pies go to.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:14.860]   Oh boy, do I need pie now, yeah.
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:17.860]   Duarte's in Pescadero on Route 1.
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:18.860]   Go now.
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:19.860]   Mmm.
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:20.860]   Oh, yeah, I've been there.
[01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:21.860]   That's right.
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:22.860]   That's good.
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:23.860]   Pescadero.
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:24.860]   Yeah.
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:25.860]   I grew up in Santa Cruz.
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:29.860]   The berry O'Lallyberry was a selection from a cross between the black Logan.
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:32.860]   Developed by Judge James Logan in California.
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:35.860]   And the young berry developed by Burns Young in Louisiana.
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:36.860]   Youngberry.
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:42.140]   Cornet Judge Logan, black Logan, was a cross between the Eastern blackberry Crandall and
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:43.140]   the Western Dewberry.
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:44.860]   Oh, it's too very.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:47.860]   Also known as the, oh, look at this word.
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:48.860]   Ockenbog.
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:50.860]   I don't know how you say that.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:51.860]   Ockenbog.
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:56.860]   Youngberry is from the Phenomenal versus Austin Mays, not Austin Myers.
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:57.860]   Austin Phenomenal.
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:00.860]   Phenomenal is a cross of the Ockenbog Western Dewberry.
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:01.860]   Oh, the Oldberry.
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:04.860]   And the Cuthbert Red Raspberry.
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:05.860]   Good Lord.
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:09.860]   I had no idea there was so much work being done in blackberry horticulture.
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:11.860]   There is though.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:14.860]   I appreciate their work because this pie is great.
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:17.860]   I think it must be really easy to cross blackberries.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.860]   Like they just beg to be crossed.
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:22.860]   Blackberries are a scourge upon the earth.
[01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:23.860]   They hurt.
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:24.860]   They are.
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:26.860]   Yeah, those brambles are awful.
[01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:29.860]   They have the road we live on is lined with blackberry bushes.
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:33.860]   And Lisa has a penchant to go out and pick them.
[01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:34.860]   We make the boys pick them.
[01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:35.860]   Nope.
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:36.860]   Always go out with long sleeves.
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:37.860]   I had to teach my boys.
[01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:38.860]   They're serving.
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:39.860]   They're serving though.
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.860]   Were you long sleeves when you go pick the berries?
[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:42.860]   She makes a pie.
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:44.860]   We've got blackberry season.
[01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:47.860]   Pie days coming up March 14th Saturday.
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:49.860]   Everybody have some pie.
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:52.860]   It'll be just another day for me.
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:54.860]   I always have pie.
[01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:57.860]   I don't want to quote Moseri.
[01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:01.860]   But it is an interesting story.
[01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:10.860]   Instagram head Adam Moseri on how Facebook protects Instagram from scrutiny.
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:16.860]   He says, he's also a little bit throwing them under this all driving car.
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:17.860]   And I say, well, they screw up.
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:18.860]   We learn from it.
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:19.860]   And we look better.
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:24.860]   He said this on an interview on NBC News Buyers Market podcast.
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:30.860]   For lack of a more elegant phrase, Facebook as a company serves as a poop umbrella for
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:31.860]   Instagram.
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:32.860]   Nicely done.
[01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:33.860]   Nice.
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:36.860]   We're our delicate ear.
[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:38.860]   So the idea is what?
[01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:40.860]   Oh, because nobody criticizes Instagram.
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:42.860]   They all criticize Facebook.
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:43.860]   Right.
[01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:48.860]   And so as a result, Instagram kind of skates along.
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:49.860]   Okay.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:55.860]   Well, I think he's also saying that when Facebook screws up, they see they learn from those
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:56.860]   states too.
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:57.860]   Yes, we learned.
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:01.860]   Which Adam is really smart, but let's remember he was in charge of newsfeed at Facebook.
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:03.860]   But never getting criticized.
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:07.860]   So by the way, his word of advice to Instagrammers.
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:12.860]   Don't double Insta referring to posting twice to your Instagram feed in one day.
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:14.860]   Only once a day.
[01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:17.860]   Everybody double Insta's most try double Insta.
[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:19.860]   You only post once you have a rule once a day.
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:22.340]   I don't I don't install that often.
[01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:26.860]   We instead see yes, and then we forget our account for the next game months.
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:28.420]   Wait a minute.
[01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:31.860]   So who's saying is don't double Insta head of Instagram?
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.360]   Wow.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.500]   He says, I think it's okay.
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.360]   But young people don't think it's okay.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.460]   It looks like you're trying too hard.
[01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.060]   Oh, so that's why I say it.
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:42.900]   Yeah, yeah, other than that didn't do it.
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:46.380]   If you're trying to push up, then yeah, you should.
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:48.380]   The more you post, you get pushed up.
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:49.380]   Yeah.
[01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:52.420]   I'm not trying to appease any young people.
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:54.940]   They don't give a crap what I post anyway.
[01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:55.940]   Exactly.
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:57.260]   Screw the young.
[01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:01.300]   We don't need them.
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:05.060]   This whole poop umbrella discussion.
[01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.940]   You want to bring that up?
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:13.340]   Well, it was making me think is that similar to basically having like a shell game.
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:18.780]   You have the larger company at the top as an umbrella, if you will, and under you.
[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:19.780]   Sure.
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:21.460]   You can nurture Instagram, let it grow.
[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:24.060]   And then when it gets big enough, it can be a poop umbrella.
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:25.060]   Right.
[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:26.060]   Somebody sort of branches out.
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:30.100]   But in the inner room, it's more of a poop umbrella is all the way down, kids.
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:31.660]   You hide some stuff there.
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:32.660]   We've all been accounting.
[01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:33.660]   Hi, Casey.
[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:36.140]   You were acting all pure technical about it.
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:39.820]   Then you just can't stop saying it.
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:44.300]   So we talked a couple of weeks ago about Amazon's grocery store.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:46.220]   No, it wasn't us.
[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:50.940]   It was on Twitter with Christina Warren, who lives across the street from the 7,000 square
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.020]   foot grab and go store.
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:53.260]   It's like a full grocery store.
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:54.260]   Oh, she lives in Seattle?
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:55.860]   Yes, she lives on Pike Street.
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:57.020]   We talked about it here too.
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:58.740]   We talked about it because Mr. Musco.
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:21:59.740]   Have you used?
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:00.740]   No, you were out of town.
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:01.740]   Oh, Sam used it.
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:02.740]   I know because he keeps stealing bananas.
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:03.740]   Right.
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:04.740]   I haven't used the big one.
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:06.220]   I've used the smaller Amazon goes for it.
[01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:11.860]   So it turns out now we've learned that Amazon has made this technology so that they can
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:14.980]   sell it to other people.
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:16.460]   That's how Amazon does.
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:20.700]   Amazon, everything that Amazon builds is designed to be sold to other people, even if
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:22.300]   it never gets there.
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:24.540]   They design everything as a service first.
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.180]   It has a terrible name.
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:28.180]   Just walk out technology.
[01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:30.100]   I think it's a great name.
[01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:31.100]   You like that?
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:32.100]   I do.
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.100]   Just walk out.
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:34.100]   It's just literal.
[01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:35.660]   I'm not going to name a movie that.
[01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:38.300]   It's what Stacy's going to do unless she gets her dinner or so.
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:39.300]   Just...
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:40.300]   Oh, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:41.780]   I'm not hungry.
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:42.780]   I'm just anxious and...
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:43.780]   I need to...
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:45.420]   Aren't we soothing you?
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:46.420]   Are we soothing you?
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:47.420]   No.
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:48.420]   You're not.
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:49.420]   You're the opposite of soothing.
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:50.420]   I love you.
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:51.420]   I love you.
[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:52.420]   I love you.
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:53.420]   That's...
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:54.420]   I think we're very soothing.
[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:55.420]   We have our moments.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:56.420]   So Stacy can sit back and talk about warm...
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:57.420]   Oh, my God.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:58.420]   With the skin moving.
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:22:59.420]   With the skin moving.
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:02.020]   The Nilla Ice Queen.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:04.380]   And just the right size bowl.
[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:05.380]   Big, see.
[01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.380]   I'm leaving the output.
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:07.380]   Puppy couch.
[01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:08.380]   Oh.
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.380]   With the remote.
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:10.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:11.380]   I'm getting very anxious right now with this.
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:14.380]   The ASMR is not helping you all.
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:17.620]   Basically, I just have a hard time sitting still right now.
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:20.940]   But I said that Ant was the Bob Ross of Twit.
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:22.660]   He took it a little too much to heart.
[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:25.700]   He really developed that, didn't he?
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.980]   He worked on that persona.
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:31.980]   So they're going to sell just walk out to an airport...
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:35.060]   Others, but this is the first.
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:38.300]   Airport Hospitality Group OTG, which operates...
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:39.460]   The Newark Airport has those.
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:43.460]   Yeah, these little corner stores, the SIBO Express Gourmet Market.
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:44.460]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:49.420]   So in fact, it's going to open next week at Liberty Terminal C, if you want to try it
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.420]   out, Jeff.
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:52.140]   Go steal a banana.
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:57.940]   It will then be followed by additional stores, both in Newark Liberty and LaGuardia.
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:58.940]   So...
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:23:59.940]   I think that's...
[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:00.940]   So Newark has gotten...
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:01.940]   This is actually...
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:08.060]   So Newark has gotten rid of all kinds of staff.
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:09.060]   Yeah.
[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:11.180]   So now every restaurant is a fake brand.
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:12.780]   They're all run under one thing, right?
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:13.780]   Right.
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:14.780]   And they're all like, "My first choice is..."
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:16.780]   But they've never heard of anything before, because they don't exist.
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:17.780]   Of course.
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:19.780]   And you sit down and there's an iPad in front of you.
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:20.780]   Yeah.
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:21.780]   Oh yeah, that's what it is.
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:22.780]   And there's one keypad in front of you.
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:24.740]   Well, that was one kitchen, but it's fewer kitchens.
[01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:25.740]   Yes, they're shared.
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:28.780]   There's an iPad in front of you, and you order from the iPad.
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:29.780]   That's the only way you can order it.
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:30.780]   You keep that.
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:31.780]   It's disgusting.
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:32.780]   I hate touching those things.
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:33.940]   Yeah, I don't really like that either.
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:34.940]   That's too many hands.
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:36.980]   But then they come to you with the stuff wherever you are.
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:39.860]   And then in the stores, they also don't have a checkout.
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:42.700]   You have to do the scanner thing.
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:43.700]   Yep.
[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:47.580]   And so they've gotten entirely entire airport.
[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:49.900]   They have one Starbucks operating like an old Starbucks.
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:50.900]   Yeah.
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:52.220]   They have one Wendy's leftover.
[01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:54.500]   Otherwise, it's all of this iPad stores.
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.500]   Huh?
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:56.740]   Big food stuff and fake store thing.
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:25:02.300]   Well, I guess this company is the one that OTG is the one that runs this stuff.
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:06.860]   But on the other hand, I think that that is a really good use of grab and go technology
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:10.580]   because you're running, you're getting a plane, you want to just get a couple of peanuts
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:11.580]   or whatever.
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.780]   But you got to have the app.
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:14.780]   You just walk out.
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:15.780]   You just walk out.
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:17.780]   You don't have to have the app.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:18.780]   Stop, stop.
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:19.780]   You don't have to have that.
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:20.780]   You have to have a credit card.
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:22.460]   Yeah, they're going to start using.
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:23.540]   I think it's a little too silly.
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:28.980]   They're going to start using a technology that will just scan it.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:30.620]   Yeah, because they don't want people.
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:35.340]   So they have, they're using, it's going to be card based technology.
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:40.100]   And I'm not sure how that will work with like airports, but they recognize that people
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:43.660]   do not want to have a bunch of different apps for each retailer.
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:50.180]   So they've tried to tie it to a physical media, which again, don't know the details.
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:53.460]   Jeff, you do really need to go steal a banana and see how it's going to work.
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:54.460]   Well, I've gone in.
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:56.860]   I've gone in the morning New York and I bought stuff.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:57.860]   But I had that deal.
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:58.860]   But that uses the app.
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:25:59.860]   Right.
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:00.860]   No, but now you have to go into the.
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:01.860]   Well, you're telling me I've got a new airport.
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:03.860]   Now right now we're not.
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:05.860]   Everyone, I have had.
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.060]   I have got a new one.
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:09.060]   It's canceled.
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:10.780]   Eat things canceled.
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:15.620]   I still have an event that I'm speaking at at the end of April.
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:16.620]   We'll see if that stays.
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:17.620]   I don't know.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:19.900]   Jeff's like, no, you're not.
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:24.700]   With this using credit cards, they're not specifically talking NFC, right?
[01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:28.540]   Because I don't know if it's credit cards or loyalty cards with like an NFC chip built
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:29.540]   in.
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:33.540]   That is not specified in anything that I've seen.
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:35.540]   It is NFC based.
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:36.540]   Okay.
[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:41.940]   So and so now if it is NFC, I just wonder about speed and performance of that because
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:46.460]   I mean just using the tapping go stuff right now on your regular grocery store.
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:49.660]   It's still a little bit of a hang up and a delay.
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:50.660]   What is it?
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:51.660]   For me it is.
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:52.660]   Just a bit.
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:53.660]   Yeah.
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:58.220]   What if when you, but the way this will change is you do it when you go in?
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:26:59.220]   Okay.
[01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:00.220]   All right.
[01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:03.180]   So before you grab your stuff, just go ahead and tap before you walk.
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:04.180]   I got you.
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:05.180]   Would that help?
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:07.180]   That makes more sense.
[01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:10.500]   Well, it figures it out later and sends you a bill.
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:11.900]   You're not waiting for it to happen.
[01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:15.620]   It just because that's the story that we had on the show.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.300]   Like when you try to fool it, it took four hours to get the bill to him.
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.060]   This is a way to watch it.
[01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:21.060]   Right.
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:22.060]   Sam's story.
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:27.180]   I'm waiting for that story of the person in the Philippines who's watching people shop
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:28.180]   for things.
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:32.420]   Yeah, because they got to do some type of audit.
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:33.420]   Right?
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:34.420]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:37.380]   I mean, that's behind every automated system.
[01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:39.340]   There is a person.
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:45.180]   What percentage of transactions or videos or whatever automated system, you know, you're
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:50.720]   part of is an open question is it 1% is it 20% but there's always going to be a person
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:53.500]   checking to make sure that computer did what they need to do.
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:54.500]   Yeah.
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:55.500]   QA.
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:56.500]   Thank goodness.
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:57.500]   Wow.
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:01.420]   Italy says all stores except pharmacies and food markets will be closed.
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:03.180]   So they need this system there.
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:04.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:09.700]   There are people in the so it is worth noting that there are still people in the Amazon
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:10.700]   go stores.
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:11.700]   Yes.
[01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:12.700]   Yes.
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:13.700]   But yeah.
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:15.700]   I mean, helping and answering questions, all that.
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:24.820]   And to continue this vein of the ghost run life, we need a name for this.
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:27.900]   The great and phantom life.
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:34.620]   Carson was talking about Amazon's my soundtrack feature Amazon.
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:36.740]   And I would bet Google ends up doing this.
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:44.460]   Their music services are starting to get smarter about what they pick.
[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:46.500]   Now this is completely anecdotal.
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.820]   This is completely anecdotal.
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:52.820]   But Carson says that so what is this my soundtrack?
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:54.660]   This is a playlist there.
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:57.780]   It's basically yeah, their version of whatever Spotify.
[01:28:57.780 --> 01:28:58.780]   I don't know.
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:28:59.780]   I don't know what Spotify.
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:00.780]   Yeah, there's Spotify discover weekly.
[01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:01.780]   I'm all in on Spotify.
[01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:03.780]   Spotify does the daily mix.
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:04.780]   I love that.
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:06.700]   I've had Amazon music for the past year.
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.700]   And then so my soundtrack is there.
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:10.700]   Yeah, me and three other people.
[01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:11.700]   I use it.
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:14.220]   I'll do them my soundtrack.
[01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:15.860]   So you see one to other people.
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:16.860]   It's good.
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:17.860]   Stop it.
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:18.860]   Everybody.
[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:19.860]   You know what?
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:23.020]   It's more than you think because everybody with an Amazon Echo gets a free limited version
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:26.580]   of this and the temptation is that, well, I might as well pay for the unlimited.
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:31.100]   And then the temptation is, oh, and by the way, you can get a three month trial of HD,
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:32.100]   which is uncompressed.
[01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:35.220]   And by that time, you're going to owe them a hundred bucks a month.
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:36.220]   Yes.
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:37.220]   It's not good.
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.220]   Every day, get all in.
[01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:39.220]   Okay.
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:41.500]   So my soundtrack is in the Amazon music app.
[01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:42.500]   Yes.
[01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:48.460]   And in the last week, they've launched this my soundtrack station.
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:49.460]   Oh, it's a radio station.
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:50.460]   It's a radio station.
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:51.460]   It's a station.
[01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:52.460]   Okay.
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:55.980]   They've had my discovery mix playlist for a couple of months.
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.180]   I've used that and I love that.
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:01.100]   And if the idea is it's based on what they know you like, what you listen to.
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:07.500]   But the my soundtrack station, the first three songs it played were songs that I had downloaded
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.980]   off of LimeWire in 2002.
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:10.980]   That's just a coincidence.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:11.980]   Wow.
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:13.500]   LimeWire was one of the pirate.
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.300]   It was after Napster.
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:19.820]   So mine is playing, I just started playing it, shake it off by Taylor Swift.
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:21.980]   Boy, have they got this wrong.
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:23.300]   But here's the weird thing.
[01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:24.580]   So your son comes home.
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:25.580]   Okay.
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:26.580]   I'm listening.
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:34.300]   I'm at home, it's playing literally like white guy suburban rock for me.
[01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:37.700]   And my son comes home and it sees him in the ring doorbell.
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:38.700]   You sing on it.
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:41.380]   It's recognized your son.
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:46.620]   We turned it off the music for a second and rebooted it.
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:52.420]   So every time it restarts, it changes genres a little bit.
[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:58.420]   The genre it changed to was his favorite Hamilton songs.
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:30:59.700]   Interesting.
[01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:03.980]   So you're thinking it knows Zach's home.
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:07.140]   Alex, Alex, Alex, Alex is home.
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:09.020]   And it's playing his music.
[01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:10.740]   Yes.
[01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:14.460]   I am 100% pro this.
[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:15.460]   So we're going to ask.
[01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:16.460]   I love Madam A.
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:17.460]   Yeah, what's wrong with that, right?
[01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:19.460]   This is not the same thing wrong with a good thing.
[01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:20.780]   Great use of constant.
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:22.180]   I wish it were true.
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:23.180]   In a way.
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:27.860]   But you know, it's like the Tivo recommendations, right?
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:35.180]   So we want to invite everybody in our audience to try Amazon's MySAT track.
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:36.180]   And tell us-
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:37.540]   I'm going to check back with you next week.
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:39.660]   Tell us if you have to have the service obviously.
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.660]   But tell us-
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:41.660]   I'll try it for-
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:43.020]   Don't buy the service for that.
[01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:49.700]   But just see if it does weird things and maybe it is my experience as I just told you.
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:53.140]   The first thing I play wouldn't be Taylor Swift, Shake it off.
[01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:58.020]   I've been on Spotify for a couple months now, full time, after pulling everybody from Google.
[01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:00.540]   Let me see what comes after Taylor.
[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:04.420]   Wake me up before you go go by Wham.
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:09.740]   How much do you use Amazon Music versus the other services?
[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:11.580]   Are you a Spotify guy?
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:15.220]   Never use Spotify because I don't have an account anymore.
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:17.020]   I use mostly Amazon.
[01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:18.020]   Oh.
[01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:19.660]   And it's still screwing up.
[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:22.740]   I got a feeling by the Black Eyed Peas.
[01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:24.420]   Grenade by Bruno Mars.
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:28.940]   Wait, are those paid for this or is it free?
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:29.940]   It's paid.
[01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:30.940]   Oh.
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:31.940]   It's like Spotify or-
[01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:34.620]   No, no, no, no, I just didn't.
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:36.860]   Because I have the free prime version.
[01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:38.340]   I don't have the paid version.
[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:40.460]   I think you probably have to have the paid version.
[01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:43.940]   And I get a lot of crappy music because that's what's free.
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:45.780]   Yeah, well, maybe that's what-
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:47.420]   Because now it's playing the Backstreet Boys.
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:50.260]   I want it.
[01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:53.060]   Which is an amazing song and I will fight to the death.
[01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:54.620]   Anyone who wants to argue with me on that.
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:55.620]   Do you like-
[01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:56.620]   Oh, wait.
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:57.620]   I'm waiting on it.
[01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:58.620]   I'm waiting on it.
[01:32:58.620 --> 01:32:59.620]   I'm waiting on it.
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:00.620]   I know what happened.
[01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:02.060]   This is your music, Stacy?
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:03.060]   Yeah.
[01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:04.060]   Oh, that totally fits.
[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:05.060]   Shake it off.
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:06.900]   Maroon 5, you like that?
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:08.300]   Oh, no, I hate Maroon 5.
[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:10.300]   Firework with Katy Perry.
[01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:11.860]   My daughter does love that song.
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:12.860]   She's full loose.
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:16.940]   She plays whatever music the nearest two people are to her.
[01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:19.580]   Jolene by Dolly Parton.
[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:20.580]   That is an excellent song.
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:21.580]   That's a classic.
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:22.580]   Jolene.
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:23.580]   Jolene.
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:24.580]   Jolene.
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:25.580]   That's a classic.
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:26.580]   Alex Sherman.
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:27.580]   Hello, mother.
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:28.580]   Hello, father.
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:30.580]   I don't know that's not-
[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:31.580]   What the hell?
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:32.980]   Oh, we're old enough to know that one.
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:33.980]   Hello, mother.
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:34.980]   Stacy's not hello, brother.
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:35.980]   Hello, father.
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:36.980]   My mom used to sing that.
[01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:37.980]   It's a cab.
[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:38.980]   Cabra nada.
[01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:43.980]   Cabra nada.
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:44.980]   Now this is depressing.
[01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:47.620]   Stacy knows the song better than you and I do, Jeff.
[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:50.420]   That's because my mom used to sing it to me.
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:51.420]   Anyway.
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:55.860]   Okay, just, you know, I don't know.
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:57.700]   I don't know what to say.
[01:33:57.700 --> 01:33:58.700]   It would be good.
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:00.140]   It would really be good.
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:01.140]   I've always wanted-
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:05.340]   My hello, doorbells should see me coming in and start playing my theme song.
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:06.340]   I dig that.
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.340]   I dig that would be good.
[01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:09.540]   I would be playing trumpets for you.
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:12.100]   Oh, speaking of trumpets, it's time for the Google-
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:14.140]   That was a changelog.
[01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:16.980]   The Google changelog.
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:24.780]   They got rid of those cigarettes fast.
[01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:28.580]   We mentioned this before, but I'll do it in a little more detail.
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:35.540]   Google is expanding hangout meets to help businesses and schools stay connected in response
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:38.500]   to closings because of COVID-19.
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:43.300]   You're going to get the features that normally are only available to paid G Suite users.
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:46.580]   Larger meetings up to 250 participants per call.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:51.020]   Livestreaming for up to 100,000 viewers within a domain.
[01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:54.980]   So you'll all have to be working together or schooling together.
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:59.220]   The ability to record meetings and save them to Google Drive.
[01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:01.980]   Which is a big deal because our account before didn't allow that.
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:02.980]   Yeah.
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:03.980]   It just does.
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:08.340]   It's an enterprise edition of G Suite or G Suite Enterprise for Education features.
[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:10.300]   No cost through July 1st.
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:12.740]   And I'll bet they'll extend it.
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:13.740]   Yeah.
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:17.100]   Although that's pretty much the end of the school year for a lot of.
[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:18.100]   Maybe that's cool.
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:19.100]   Yeah.
[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:23.300]   Speaking of which, while we're on that for a second.
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:26.140]   I haven't used Zoom in the last two weeks.
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:31.220]   Some people say that they're having a little trouble keeping up.
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:33.820]   Blue jeans I like to.
[01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:35.820]   No, okay.
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:36.820]   Wow.
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:37.820]   That's why I'm asking.
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:38.820]   That's why I'm asking for your good opinion.
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:39.820]   Why don't you like blue jeans?
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:40.820]   What?
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:41.820]   Wow.
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:45.260]   That was a sound I've never heard come out of you Stacey.
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:47.700]   I have an amazing repertoire of sounds.
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:48.700]   Wow.
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:49.700]   Blue jeans.
[01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:53.380]   So Zoom is my absolute favorite because it's one click from your phone.
[01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:56.900]   And it's got a good mobile and a good web based interface.
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:59.660]   And it can do breakout groups I'm told.
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:00.660]   Why do you hate that blue jeans?
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:02.660]   Blue jeans has Dolby voice.
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:03.660]   I don't care.
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:06.180]   It's not as easy to join from a mobile.
[01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:07.180]   And that's what I just want.
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:09.780]   Well, the reason blue jeans, you reason I've had to use blue jeans is because I've had
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:13.180]   that meetings with Facebook people and they're not allowed to use.
[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:14.740]   Hangouts because it's Google.
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:15.900]   Oh, they can't use hangouts.
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:18.060]   Of course.
[01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:26.500]   We use Zoom because it's part of we get free from our phone ring central as it's a white
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:31.980]   label zoom and then I think we also use we have a zoom account through artisanal art
[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:32.980]   agency.
[01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:34.620]   So we use zoom but I don't know.
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.740]   I mean we use we're using Skype now.
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:38.540]   We use Skype a lot for broadcast.
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:40.620]   Yeah, but Skype for business is not awesome.
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:46.420]   And can I just say Microsoft Teams just no one should send people who like are outside
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:51.620]   of your organization teams invites because Microsoft makes you sign in to use it.
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:54.620]   No, you can't just be a guest and I'm like good.
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:55.620]   Yeah.
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:56.620]   No, that's true.
[01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:58.220]   I don't like any of those services.
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:00.020]   If they make you become a member, that's no good.
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:01.020]   Yeah.
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:02.020]   I agree with you.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:03.020]   That's a non-starter.
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:06.700]   Now I like zoom better, but it did try to make me.
[01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:08.660]   Be a star or something.
[01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:09.740]   Oh, you have to install.
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:10.740]   You have to install.
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:11.740]   Yeah, you have to install.
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:12.740]   What's up the blue jeans?
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:17.140]   I think all of these make install an app because they can't just do it magically.
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:19.580]   Blue jeans, zoom, runs in the browser though, right?
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:22.340]   Yeah, WebRTC would, but most of these don't use WebRTC.
[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:23.340]   Oh, okay.
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:24.580]   I think hangouts might.
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:26.340]   Hangouts will run in a browser.
[01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:27.340]   Yeah.
[01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:29.340]   Since the zip didle will still run.
[01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:31.340]   What is it?
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:32.340]   Zip didle.
[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:33.340]   Zip didle.
[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:34.340]   Oh, yeah, IPDTL.
[01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:35.340]   We've used that.
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:36.340]   No doubt one.
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:37.340]   And there's Jitzy.
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:38.340]   I'm going to use that in a while.
[01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:40.820]   There's a lot of, you know, we've got to try some of these other services.
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:43.820]   We just, we're kind of, uh, funny days.
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:45.220]   I'm a funny daddy.
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:46.220]   Skype works.
[01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:47.220]   We've used your 2005.
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:49.140]   I'm just going to keep using it.
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:50.140]   It works.
[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:51.140]   Yeah.
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:52.380]   We get pretty good results from that, right?
[01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:53.380]   Yep.
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:54.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:58.300]   So, um, the hype is really still the best for any audio recording or podcasts.
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:01.700]   Like Zoom will let you record, but it won't let you export split tracks, for example.
[01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:03.540]   So you're like, "I hate you."
[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:10.780]   There is, um, Sam Ables-Sam-Ed, who does the Wheel-Bearing's podcast, uses a technology
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:16.460]   that automatically it does a double-ender, which is cool.
[01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:17.460]   What does that mean?
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:21.020]   You get a local recording, get local recordings with each of the hosts.
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:22.700]   You're all in a conference call.
[01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:25.020]   But then they locally record it that way.
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:26.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:27.020]   You get full quality.
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:28.020]   Whoa.
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:29.020]   Who does that again?
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:31.460]   Um, Sam uses it for wheel-bearing.
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:32.460]   Let me see.
[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:33.460]   He told me, uh, over the weekend-
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:35.860]   I got to ask for the radio interviews all the time.
[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:41.580]   I used to have one of those, but the downside was you can't close that browser window until
[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:42.580]   it's done processing.
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:43.580]   Is it cast?
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:44.580]   Ah.
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:45.580]   Yes, it's something cast.
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:46.580]   Cast.
[01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:47.580]   I think it's just called cast.
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:48.580]   Zipcast.
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:49.580]   Was it Zipcast?
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:50.580]   Let's see.
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:53.260]   I can't remember.
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:54.260]   No.
[01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:55.260]   Nope.
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:58.900]   That's, uh, anybody in the chat remember what Sam said?
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:00.300]   Anyway, it looked pretty good.
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:01.700]   He says it works really well.
[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:05.500]   Of course, the reason we use Skype is because we don't want to do double-enders and the
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:08.860]   codec in Skype gives us good sound.
[01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:12.580]   And so I'm very happy with kind of the generic, we good sound that we get when we don't tend
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:14.460]   to get that with other conferencing things.
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:18.140]   But if you could do a double-ender, the reason we don't do that is that adds additional
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:21.140]   time between the time the show's over and the time we can post it.
[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:23.580]   We'd like to do it as quickly as possible.
[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:24.580]   But it seems like a good thing.
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:28.060]   It does individual tracks for every host.
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:29.860]   It's a simple web login.
[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:32.100]   So you click a link and you're in it.
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:33.100]   So there's a lot of-
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:34.700]   I have used this on multiple occasions.
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:35.940]   It's driving me nuts.
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:36.940]   I can't think.
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:40.140]   I thought it was just called cast, but that's, I guess that's not it.
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:43.140]   Because someone else had to be as a guest on one of their shows and that's what they
[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:44.140]   used.
[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:45.140]   Zen cast.
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:46.140]   Zen cast.
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:47.140]   That's it.
[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:48.140]   Thank you, Chad.
[01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:50.780]   Yeah, that's not ideal.
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:53.140]   And I tried it for a couple of shows.
[01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:55.420]   It was a little walkier.
[01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:56.420]   It broke.
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:57.420]   That's the one.
[01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:58.420]   Yeah, it's CR.
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:39:59.420]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:00.420]   Zen cast.
[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:01.420]   Zen cast.
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:02.740]   I said, "High fidelity podcasting."
[01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:04.580]   So you didn't like this?
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:07.860]   No, because it doesn't always work.
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:11.860]   The other thing is if you have certain settings on your browser, your users are going to get
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:15.860]   an error and they're going to be like, "Oh, you need to turn off this."
[01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:20.340]   So when it works, it's nice.
[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:25.540]   And for Ashley, this show, it could be good because we could all, like, for your regular
[01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:31.300]   hosts, we would all put the effort in to make sure everything is set up correctly.
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:32.740]   Oh, I'll screw that up.
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:36.580]   And honestly, I'll tell you what, we'll put this in our back pocket.
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:40.220]   If we start out in trouble with Skype, we will, but we just, it works so well at this
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:41.220]   point.
[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:43.660]   Does it work on a Chromebook?
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:44.740]   Zen castor.
[01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:45.740]   It says it works in the web.
[01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:47.420]   It's browser based, so sure.
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:48.420]   Okay.
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:50.420]   Well, that's nice.
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:51.420]   It's like, agitating.
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:54.060]   Yeah, I'll have to check it out.
[01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:57.700]   Well, now that Skype actually does work on my Chromebook is okay, but I suffered all
[01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:59.700]   those years of using Iptidol and...
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:00.700]   I see.
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:03.500]   I used something else too for a while.
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:04.500]   Google lens.
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:08.180]   Remember they were talking about this at Google I/O last year?
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:12.660]   Apparently, now it is in lens.
[01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:18.660]   When you're dining out, you point your camera to physical menu and you will get dish recommendations
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:24.900]   and reviews and even pictures of the text based entries in Google Maps.
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:26.420]   I dig it.
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:27.420]   That's cool.
[01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:28.420]   I dig it.
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:29.420]   Yeah, that's very cool.
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:31.460]   Point it at the menu and then it'll show you what they look like.
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:33.420]   It'll even give you reviews.
[01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:37.220]   Because it's always begging the local guys to take pictures of their food and describe
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:38.220]   what it is.
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:39.220]   Right.
[01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:40.380]   This is finally using the poop umbrella.
[01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:41.380]   Sounds pretty good.
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:42.380]   Not a poop ball.
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:46.260]   So there's a little button in lenses that has explore dishes.
[01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:52.060]   If you point it at a menu, you'll get a pop up that tells you stuff about the menu and
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:54.660]   then also shows pictures and gives you reviews.
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:55.900]   I think that's clever.
[01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:56.900]   Thank you.
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:42:01.460]   The downside is most people when they take pictures of their food, it's not very attractive.
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:04.660]   So you're going to get a lot of ugly food.
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:06.340]   Yeah, you can.
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:09.900]   Ugly food.
[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:12.500]   This is for you, Stacey.
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:18.340]   Google launches TensorFlow Quantum.
[01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:21.300]   Machine learning framework for training quantum models.
[01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:24.420]   Now they're just throwing buzzwords at stuff.
[01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:29.020]   Who's selling somebody IBM or somebody selling a quantum compute Honeywell?
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:30.020]   selling Honeywell.
[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:31.020]   Can you imagine that?
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:32.020]   Jesus, still alive.
[01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:33.020]   I hope they've been.
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:37.260]   The last place being advertised on late night TV.
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:38.260]   It makes famous stats.
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:39.260]   HVAC.
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:41.420]   Well split their business into two business.
[01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:45.900]   One, the HVAC or sorry, the thermostats that normal people know, that's actually under
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:47.860]   a brand called Residio.
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:52.220]   They still, the company is Residio and that was spun out all their consumer home stuff.
[01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:54.740]   They also make jet airplane engines.
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:57.100]   They make apparently a quantum computer.
[01:42:57.100 --> 01:42:59.460]   They make oil and gas processing equipment.
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:02.060]   It's actually a very huge industrial conglomerate.
[01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:06.340]   Our quantum technology enables high quality qubits.
[01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:07.660]   What's a qubit?
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:08.660]   No one's.
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:09.660]   No.
[01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:10.660]   Boy, you know that one.
[01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:11.660]   What's a qubit?
[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:14.980]   Oh, it's the bit of a quantum computing.
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:16.380]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:19.180]   We actually, we shouldn't quote him anymore.
[01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:23.180]   What really is it that bad is he like, yeah, 20.
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:25.080]   Yeah, he was canceled.
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:26.080]   He was canceled.
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:31.520]   All cuz because sexually assaulted more than 40 women canceled.
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:32.520]   Cancel, cancel.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:33.520]   That's right.
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:36.800]   I can't say Lord, what's a qubit anymore.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.320]   So these folks, they make jet engines as well.
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.320]   Is that what you said?
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:43.320]   Mistase.
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.320]   I believe they're in the jet engine.
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:46.220]   They also make like industrial HVAC stuff.
[01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:47.220]   They make lots of--
[01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:49.120]   What's wild is that they're making quantum computers.
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:52.320]   I didn't even blouse my mind.
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:53.400]   Like you could go out and buy one.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:54.400]   Should we get one?
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:55.400]   One.
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:56.400]   Yes, why not?
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:58.280]   It probably helped us do Skype better.
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:01.640]   Google is giving away.
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:08.240]   But now three months of Stadia, if you have a Chromecast, you don't have to buy anything
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:09.240]   else.
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:11.800]   You're gonna get three months of Stadia.
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:15.360]   On any supported--
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:19.800]   Actually, I guess you're sending it out in their Chromecast marketing email.
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:24.360]   So look for your email and you can get a ProPass code and redeem it.
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.080]   Normally, it's $10 a month.
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:30.680]   And in the past, you've had to buy a lot of other stuff.
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:33.440]   So look for promotional emails from Google.
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:35.880]   It's a ploy to get you to read their spam.
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:37.760]   Please read our spam.
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:42.040]   We're giving away three months of Stadia.
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:43.040]   This--
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.600]   Okay, another one for you, Stacey.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.920]   You know what jacquard is, Google's wearables, right?
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:50.480]   We've seen a jacquard jacket.
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:52.200]   I didn't know this.
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:56.800]   They're also making a new jacquard-based shoe in Seoul.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:57.800]   It's so exciting.
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:03.320]   And this is meant to be worn in soccer shoes so they can analyze your kick.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:07.560]   Well, so it's meant to be worn in soccer shoes and they did a deal with EA.
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:09.200]   So your mobile FIFA--
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:10.440]   It's a FIFA or FIFA.
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:11.440]   FIFA or FIFA?
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:12.440]   FIFA.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:13.440]   FIFA.
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:14.440]   Thank you.
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:19.720]   Your mobile FIFA game, when you do soccer activities in the real world that will translate
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:24.520]   over to training and whatnot into your digital games, which is super fun.
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:25.520]   And it's nice.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:26.520]   So it's more for gaming.
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:28.560]   I thought it was more for training players.
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:29.560]   No, it's for gaming.
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:32.040]   And what's great is this is only 40 bucks.
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:39.360]   In jacquard, the technology is just sensor-infused fabric with a little computing unit that takes
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:43.680]   the data from those sensors and sends it-- computes it and sends it to your phone.
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:49.200]   But we had seen in the Levi's jacket, the trucker jacket was actually kind of expensive.
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:54.040]   And the-- you've sent Laurent Batpack with super expensive.
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:59.720]   So this is only 40 bucks for an insole, which is a great price that people might buy.
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.640]   I don't know.
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:02.640]   But I'm really excited about this.
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:05.520]   I think this is a really awesome use of technology.
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:10.240]   And at that price, you could see something-- the basics are there to stick an insole into
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.240]   someone's shoe.
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:14.920]   If you're like elderly or something like that, you could do like gate and fall measurements
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:18.320]   that might be interesting from health and wellness.
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:21.560]   There is some really cool stuff here.
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:26.600]   So what's the real reason they tell me this?
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:27.920]   What data are they getting?
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:30.160]   They're getting gate analysis, aren't they?
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:31.160]   They want to be--
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:35.680]   Well, I assume-- yeah, they're getting an understanding of how someone's-- they had
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:43.320]   to build the algorithms to see-- like when I press this way on the insole, I am running.
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:45.240]   When I press this way, I'm taking it.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:48.000]   So they're getting that kind of data.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.000]   That'll come in handy for things that are not gameplay, but it's good to start there,
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000]   I guess.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:59.400]   The nice thing about games is when you make-- when you're running and kicking, those are
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:03.000]   very exaggerated big movements as opposed to walking around all day.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:08.840]   So maybe that helps you train your models better because the data's so exaggerated in
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:09.840]   the first place.
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.400]   I don't know.
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:16.640]   Google marks International Women's Day and Women's Months.
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:20.920]   They had a 3D mandala doodle on Sunday.
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:23.280]   That's pretty cool.
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:28.360]   It's kind of sad because International Women's Day was only 23 hours.
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:29.360]   Somebody said that.
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:30.360]   That was--
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:32.880]   On Twitter, I was like, damn, damn.
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:36.400]   First February, now this.
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:39.600]   And then I think they're-- oh, look at that.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:40.600]   Wow.
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.640]   That's kind of-- actually, that is kind of cool.
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:44.120]   That's all cool.
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:45.440]   It's not Biders full of women.
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:47.200]   It's a mandala full of women.
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:48.200]   Yay.
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:54.720]   And then you can ask the Google Assistant, hey, Google, tell me about an inspiring woman.
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:56.560]   It's going to do it.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:01.720]   At a time that Kenyan girls were not expected to attend secondary school, Kenya and Thai
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:03.800]   are fought to continue her studies.
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:04.800]   She attended university--
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:08.720]   So this is-- that was this a race, saying that too, which is kind of cool.
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:14.160]   So you can ask a bunch of different things to celebrate Women's Month.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:18.880]   You could say, hey, Google, happy International Women's Day.
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:19.880]   Hey, Google.
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:21.680]   It's a wonderful day to--
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:22.680]   Oops.
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:23.680]   Stop interrupting me.
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:24.680]   It's a neighborhood.
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:26.880]   As usual with women, I interrupt.
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:33.760]   Hey, Google, tell me quotes from inspiring women.
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:35.720]   Let's see.
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:37.520]   Let's see.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:38.840]   Now she says I'm mansplaining.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.280]   You have mine talking over here.
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:42.240]   Hey, Google, tell me quotes from inspiring women.
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:45.360]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:47.160]   It's just really-- she's mad at me.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:52.360]   Mine just said, because it heard you, "Sicess is only meaningful and enjoyable if it feels
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:53.360]   like your own."
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.520]   That's a quote from Ms. Michelle Obama.
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.040]   I think that's true.
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:58.480]   I don't want anybody else's success.
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:48:59.560]   I'm on my own.
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:01.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:02.880]   Just like a man.
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:04.680]   Just like a man.
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:08.600]   And we missed it.
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:10.120]   Shoot.
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:14.400]   Holy was Monday and Tuesday.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:18.320]   That is the Hindu Festival of Color celebration.
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:22.200]   You've seen the holy pictures of people sprayed with color.
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:23.520]   Google was letting you do that.
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:26.080]   Their search results shoot.
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:29.600]   So maybe I can-- let me just see if I can do it, because it'd be fun if I could do it.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.120]   You search for holy.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:34.320]   Google.com.
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:37.080]   I'm going to search for H-O-L-I.
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:39.440]   And then see if I can throw.
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:42.440]   No, I guess it's over now.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:43.760]   I can't throw anything at it.
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:47.680]   But you were able to throw a little color bombs at it, which is kind of cool.
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:49.240]   That's my favorite festival.
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:50.440]   What a great idea.
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:55.920]   That's weird, because the Bay Area isn't celebrating it until the 28th.
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:57.120]   Oh.
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:58.560]   Why are we celebrating it late?
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:49:59.000]   I don't know.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.440]   No idea.
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:04.800]   Coronav--
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:05.360]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.160]   I didn't do it right.
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:08.240]   Did you misspell holy?
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:10.800]   No, you tap the-- there's an Easter egg.
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:13.080]   You have to tap the search results.
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:15.160]   So I-- oh, where did he get better?
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:16.920]   So there's the bowl of spices.
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:18.760]   Whoa!
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:22.280]   Oh, it's a mess.
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:23.920]   That's so fun.
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.240]   It's a happy mess.
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:26.520]   It's so fun.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:27.760]   So much fun to know.
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:30.840]   I see people covered in these colors, and I worry.
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:33.360]   Like, are they going to get lung disease from this?
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.680]   No, it's so much fun.
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:36.320]   It's OK.
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:38.840]   I'll go with my brother's girlfriend.
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:40.480]   What is in the-- what are the-- what
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:42.760]   is the color bombs made of?
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:43.440]   Cat damn.
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:44.280]   I do not know.
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:45.280]   Cat damn.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:46.280]   You're right.
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:50.040]   It's mostly not radioactive.
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:51.800]   What is the made of?
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:52.360]   Chalk?
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.080]   I don't know.
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:53.600]   Chalk?
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:55.640]   It's all good.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:56.840]   Cornstarch.
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:00.720]   Cornstarch would be OK until it rains.
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.240]   Click.
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:01.800]   There we go.
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:03.120]   That's fun.
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:04.760]   OK, so that's still in effect.
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:07.520]   Search for H-O-L-I on Google.
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:10.880]   And then in the knowledge graph, click the little balls of
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:11.960]   spice or color.
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:14.280]   And you too can do this.
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:15.840]   And then if you want to clear it, you click the little
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:17.120]   rain drop.
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:19.400]   It rains and it starts all over.
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:20.120]   Cleaning it up.
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:20.600]   Pretty cool.
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:22.040]   Fun.
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:24.840]   And that's-- you Google change long.
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:31.320]   [SINGING]
[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.640]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:35.360]   So Carson, you tried visible?
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:36.840]   I tried visible.
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:42.360]   This is a Verizon's new service that doesn't require--
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:47.680]   Well, the news is that today there's a new Yahoo branded--
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:48.200]   What?
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:49.600]   --MVNO.
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:50.040]   So how to--
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:50.440]   How to rise--
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:51.200]   --like a Yahoo.
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:53.600]   Verizon's new MVNO is--
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:55.320]   We're solely with trios.
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:58.280]   It's gotta be for old people, right?
[01:51:58.280 --> 01:51:59.560]   We've got to do something with the brand.
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:00.720]   I don't know.
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:04.080]   Why is Verizon launching all these MVNOs?
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:09.640]   Because they are widely renowned as the most expensive
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:10.440]   way to get a--
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:11.680]   So here's a way to get something--
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:12.960]   They have to, yeah, for sure.
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:18.480]   I tried their visible MVNO and I had a very, very
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:19.120]   miserable experience.
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:20.600]   It was inexpensive.
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:21.840]   It was cheap.
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:27.240]   But I lost data like the third day I was there.
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:32.680]   And their customer service is only via text.
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:33.160]   Oh, boy.
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:37.920]   Takes about four hours to get anything done.
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:39.800]   This is why you stick with Mint Mobile.
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:40.880]   Yeah, it was--
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:41.480]   Our sponsor.
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:42.240]   --sponsor.
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:42.760]   It was not.
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:45.600]   So Yahoo Mobile is a new Verizon MVNO.
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:48.960]   No one asked for according to Android Central.
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:52.600]   Visible is unlimited talks, data, and text for $40,
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:56.800]   which is definitely a good price if it works.
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:00.160]   But apparently, Carsten says it ain't very good.
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:02.040]   And now you can do the same thing,
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:05.280]   probably the same exact thing, with a different name called
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:06.560]   Yahoo Mobile.
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:09.880]   No data caps, but mobile hotspot speeds will be capped
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:11.920]   at five megabits.
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:15.840]   Data speeds may be temporarily slower in times of traffic.
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:18.840]   You'll get Yahoo Mail Pro with a terabyte of cloud storage.
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:20.600]   Oh, Yahoo Mail Pro.
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:23.800]   Oh, it's the best Yahoo Mail ever.
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:26.440]   It's the best Yahoo Mail we've ever offered.
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:28.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:31.240]   That's a safe thing to say.
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:34.080]   You can either buy a new phone through the new MVNO
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:37.080]   or bring your MVNO, which stands for Mobile Virtual Network
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:40.080]   Operator, or bring your own phone.
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:41.320]   There you have it.
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:42.880]   Free ad for you, Verizon.
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:49.040]   This sad, sad story of Yahoo's just getting sadder,
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:50.920]   and sadder, and sadder.
[01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:53.440]   Does Katie Couric and David Polk, do they still work there?
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:54.120]   I don't think so.
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:54.640]   Nope.
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:55.640]   OK.
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:57.640]   I don't think Scooter S just posted on the chat.
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:58.640]   Put it on.
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:02.440]   California won't appeal the T-Mobile Sprint case.
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:03.440]   That's it, then.
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:04.280]   The language of the proceed.
[01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:04.920]   That's it.
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:05.560]   It's over.
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:06.560]   Thanks for sharing this with me.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:11.000]   Our long national nightmare is over T-Mobile and Sprint,
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.040]   bringing you the worst of both worlds.
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:16.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:17.840]   Without the colorful president, right?
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:18.760]   Doesn't he leave?
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:19.840]   Yeah, just a little bit.
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:21.520]   How do you say his name?
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:23.480]   I say Ledger just because I'm lazy.
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:24.120]   Leger.
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:25.080]   How do you say it's Stacey?
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:25.800]   Do you say it right?
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:27.320]   I thought it was Leger.
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:30.320]   But it's very fresh, if you said the way.
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:32.120]   But I don't actually know.
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:33.720]   I can't remember.
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:38.400]   I did neglect to mention that John Legend's voice
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:39.840]   is leaving the chrome-log.
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:40.240]   Yes.
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:41.760]   It's a change-log.
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:42.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:44.280]   I thought that was going to be in the chrome-log.
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:45.760]   Well, it's a change-log.
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:46.400]   I guess it could be.
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:47.400]   It's a change-log.
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:47.880]   It's a change-log.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:48.960]   It's not something coming to your phone.
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:49.960]   It could change the name.
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:50.800]   It could change the name.
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:52.960]   It's not like the chrome-changer-log.
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:54.240]   It's changing, though.
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.400]   It is changing.
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:55.880]   It has changed.
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:57.200]   So I should have put that in the change-log.
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:57.840]   I apologize.
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:01.320]   Let's do picks of the week.
[01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:02.840]   I'm going to show Stacey something that's
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:04.640]   going to cheer her up.
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:07.240]   Stacey has many times now convinced me
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:12.920]   to buy horrifically overpriced kitchen appliances.
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:14.280]   Oh, OK, I can't.
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:15.720]   I was like, I'm like--
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:18.880]   This time, I did it without your help.
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:19.800]   What'd you buy?
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:21.600]   A thermo mix.
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:26.040]   Oh, my god.
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:27.960]   I walked out so badly.
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:29.640]   I knew you would.
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:33.840]   It's the size of a small robot on your counter.
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:35.640]   I am so jealous.
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:37.280]   It's so bizarre.
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:40.000]   I haven't cooked anything with it, but I just set it up.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:45.360]   It has a downloadable internet recipes.
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:46.600]   By the way, they look great.
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:48.400]   It has a variety of weird--
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:54.520]   It looks kind of like-- so this base, by the way, $1,500.
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:55.280]   I don't have one.
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:56.920]   Look, reward your a chump.
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.280]   You are such a good chump.
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:55:58.760]   Oh, no, OK.
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:01.240]   This is legit, y'all.
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:03.280]   They have had this in Europe for a long time.
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:05.840]   I read a really good review on Wired,
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:07.480]   and that's why I suck her in the mix.
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:08.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:09.320]   Yeah.
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:10.920]   I have a guy who wrote that.
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:13.040]   And it cooks-- OK.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:14.400]   You stick your stuff in it.
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:14.800]   Like, if I eat--
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:16.120]   It does it all for you.
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:17.880]   It, like, chops it.
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:20.120]   So you chop an onion into, like, four quarters,
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:21.440]   and you're like, hook, hook.
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:22.960]   And then it's like, in a minute, it's like, OK,
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:25.560]   now throw in a clove of garlic, and you're like, hook, hook.
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:28.320]   And then it's amazing.
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:29.280]   Do not sound again.
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:30.200]   Please do not sound again.
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:31.200]   She's really good.
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:32.280]   I had-- I've wanted this.
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:33.720]   I've underestimated.
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:35.320]   So come over to my place.
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:37.520]   No, no, when you get bored, send it to me.
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:38.640]   OK.
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:40.560]   It basically is like a blender.
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:40.920]   It's like a--
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:41.760]   You're able to go anywhere.
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:43.720]   A metal blender to tears.
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:45.600]   But then there's all these attachments
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:47.200]   you put on top of it.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.640]   It makes bread.
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:49.720]   It steams rice.
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:50.680]   It makes soup.
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:51.280]   OK.
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:52.520]   That gets a little weird.
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:54.720]   But basically-- OK.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:57.240]   It makes these candy bars.
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:57.880]   Yeah, don't worry about it.
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:56:59.200]   So it caramelizes.
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:00.040]   It sufedes.
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:00.840]   It ferments.
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:01.720]   It self cleans.
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:02.120]   It writes--
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:03.400]   It makes.
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:05.880]   So when are you going to do your hands on tech?
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:06.560]   I don't know.
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:08.360]   You can make yogurt and kimchi in it
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:10.920]   with a fermentation function.
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:13.240]   And all of these recipes are online,
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:16.960]   and you download them into the computer and the base.
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:18.720]   I know I'm such an idiot.
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:20.200]   I'm such an idiot.
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:22.800]   Must have been-- I guess without Instagram now,
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:26.120]   I've got to find some other ways to waste my money.
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:26.880]   No, no, no, no.
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:29.400]   This is a legit life.
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:30.720]   I mean, it is expensive.
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:32.520]   But this is something that will actually--
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:34.360]   you will cook more often.
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:34.840]   Yeah.
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:35.800]   It makes it easier.
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:38.000]   I wanted to make more soup.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.640]   Like I have sat through so many
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:41.240]   because I go to the smart kitchen thing every year.
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:42.600]   But how big that thing is.
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:44.880]   I'm just looking at Mr. Jarvis's face on this thing.
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:45.880]   And it's cooked--
[01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:46.600]   He's just--
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:49.480]   is weirdly named CookieDew.
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:50.640]   Yeah, that's new.
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:53.120]   So they added the CookieDew recipe thing.
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:55.800]   It used to just be--
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:58.040]   and it's actually based on an Android tablet.
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:00.080]   So you put it on your Wi-Fi.
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:04.320]   So it can invite all its friends to come visit.
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:04.840]   And then--
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:06.640]   And it does, Suvied.
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:09.520]   It has the food processor in it.
[01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:10.200]   It's so much--
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:14.040]   It's like a blender food processor, Instapot, soup,
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:14.640]   everything.
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:15.600]   It's everything.
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:18.920]   Also, it is a bunch of devices in one, which I already have.
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:20.240]   Which makes sense for it.
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:22.760]   Caustin as much because if you bought all of those devices,
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:24.080]   it's going to be about that much again.
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:24.920]   It's for crazy people.
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:26.080]   It's not for normal people.
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:27.760]   That's for sure.
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:29.480]   I want to--
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:30.240]   I knew you would.
[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:31.240]   That's why I bought it.
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:32.800]   I just want to make you jealous.
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:34.640]   Why didn't you just send it to me?
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:35.720]   I would have done a full show.
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:36.240]   No, no, no, no.
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:37.320]   Give it to me when you're done.
[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:38.320]   Everybody wants it.
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:39.160]   You want to see it when you're done.
[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:40.280]   Carsten, did you know about this?
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:41.720]   No, I did.
[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:44.000]   So tell Carsten that if he wants it,
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.160]   he has to get more excited than I just did.
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:48.440]   Yeah, that's pretty tough.
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:48.960]   OK.
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:50.080]   That's pretty tough.
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:51.040]   Nope, nope.
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:52.080]   It's all yours, Tacey.
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:53.600]   You're horrible as time.
[01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:55.080]   You can't even do it.
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:56.600]   People say, like somebody in the chat room,
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:58.040]   it's basically the advanced pressure cooker.
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:58:59.840]   No.
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:00.320]   No.
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:01.200]   That's the Instapot.
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:06.520]   This is like a whole bunch of things in one very odd French
[01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:07.080]   packet.
[01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:08.800]   How much did that weigh?
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:09.280]   It's heavy.
[01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:09.840]   It's big.
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:10.400]   That's what I--
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:12.640]   I kind of-- you can't tell from the website,
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:14.320]   but it's the size of R2D2.
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:18.280]   It's like-- it takes up a lot of space on the counter.
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:20.080]   But I think-- yeah, I haven't made anything yet,
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:21.400]   because I'm a little intimidated.
[01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:22.920]   One of the things that happens when you order it,
[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:25.840]   they say, OK, now set up your one-on-one with R.
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.480]   They do a Zoom conference with you.
[01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:27.920]   Wow.
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:29.720]   One-on-one to show you how to use it.
[01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:31.120]   But I think I can figure it out.
[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:32.120]   Yeah, because--
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:33.760]   But you can use it in this last word.
[01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:35.400]   The idea is you put all the ingredients in it,
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:36.960]   and then you come home, and it's done.
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:37.760]   It's like a little sushi.
[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:39.240]   You do the one-on-one Leo, because I
[01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:41.840]   sat through the cooking classes,
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:45.360]   and they actually will help you prepare better food.
[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:46.640]   It's worth it.
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:47.160]   Trust me.
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:49.600]   It looks really interesting.
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:50.480]   Oh, my god.
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:51.760]   This is so wasted on you.
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:55.640]   You go all-- you go all the Leo on it.
[01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:56.560]   So wasted.
[01:59:56.560 --> 01:59:58.360]   It's so wasted on you.
[01:59:58.360 --> 01:59:59.640]   I'll tell you what.
[01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:01.960]   If you'll take the giant ham off my hands--
[02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:04.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:05.080]   I don't eat ham.
[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:05.680]   I know.
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:06.640]   I know.
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:09.880]   Stacy, what's your pick of the week this week?
[02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:11.440]   Just demoralized, man.
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:12.280]   I'm like, oh.
[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:14.320]   She's so jealous.
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:17.200]   OK, so last week I showed you the helium hotspot.
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:18.040]   Where did my phone go?
[02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:18.540]   OK.
[02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:19.560]   The helium hotspot.
[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:22.280]   And I tested it.
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:25.240]   It was a shared hotspot.
[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:27.720]   And the news that I was alluding to
[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:30.520]   was that now it supports Laura radio.
[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:32.560]   So now you can have any Laura device
[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:35.560]   will talk to your helium hotspot, which is pretty cool.
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:38.120]   The other thing I'm running, because I'm doing this experiment
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:42.040]   with things that generate money for network services
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:43.720]   is basically the experiment.
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:47.120]   I downloaded something called nodal cache onto my phone.
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:53.320]   And nodal cache is an app, N-O-D-L-E.
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:57.840]   And it basically makes my Bluetooth accessible
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:02.680]   to other devices that need Bluetooth access.
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:05.000]   So it uses my phone's Bluetooth as a way
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:06.360]   to say where something is.
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:08.320]   So line bikes are using nodal.
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:14.200]   If you've got a line bike near you, it's going to be like,
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:17.960]   boom, it's going to use my phone to say, hey, I've
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:20.280]   been to ping it and be like, I'm here.
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:21.440]   It's kind of like tile.
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:22.920]   But this gives me a token.
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:30.800]   So now I have earned a whopping 0.0014209 nodal cache so far.
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:33.320]   I was doing much better when I was in Seattle.
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:34.520]   Yeah, I'm just going to say, do you
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:38.080]   don't live near enough people to make this useful, do you?
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:39.920]   Well, no, but I travel a lot.
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:43.560]   Yeah, because it's a mesh hotspot, the helium.
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:44.200]   Yes.
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:44.520]   Well, helium--
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:45.800]   So it really makes sense if there's
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:47.160]   other helium owners near you.
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:49.560]   So helium is last week.
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:51.080]   Helium was last week's thing.
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:51.560]   And I just want to--
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:53.120]   No, does it use helium?
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:54.400]   No, it does not use helium.
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:55.320]   It's a separate thing.
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:55.800]   Oh, so--
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:56.320]   It's a separate--
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:59.360]   No, it was a low power network for IoT.
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:01:59.600]   Right.
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:00.680]   It's Bluetooth based.
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:03.280]   Helium is now Laura-based.
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:06.360]   But helium has its own cryptocurrency.
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:06.960]   It does.
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:09.200]   It has helium, something network.
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:12.320]   You're going to have so many cryptocurrencies.
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:13.200]   OK, so--
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:13.720]   Yeah.
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:17.040]   You turn on the nodal and you're earning nodal cache?
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:18.240]   I'm earning nodal.
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:20.600]   I'm earning noodles.
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:22.320]   Because my phone is--
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:27.840]   it's basically like if tile paid you, it noodles.
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:30.080]   Why do they pay you?
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:31.760]   They want to incent me to use it.
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:34.080]   They want to incent me to become part of their public Bluetooth
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:34.840]   network.
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:36.160]   That's why they're paying anyone.
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:37.800]   It's like phone.
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:43.160]   But they provide a service to everybody who uses the network.
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:44.560]   OK.
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:47.480]   So they're giving you back a little of the money they make.
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:47.960]   Basically.
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:49.000]   Is it incentive?
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.120]   Good.
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:52.120]   So yeah, there you go.
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:57.240]   Nodl.io, N-O-D-L-E, not N-O-D-A-L, N-O-D-L-E.io.
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:02:58.560]   Interesting.
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:00.800]   I feel like I live in the past and you live in the future,
[02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:02.280]   Stacy.
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:04.160]   You have a third of this and I don't.
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:05.240]   I have to say N-O.
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:07.280]   I beg to differ, sir.
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:10.560]   I live in some weird alternate universe.
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:13.200]   Jeff, do you have any numbers left?
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:15.120]   So yeah, I do.
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:20.200]   Can you play like 15 seconds of a YouTube video?
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:20.680]   Carsten.
[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:21.240]   Yes.
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:23.760]   We're demonetized anyways because we're talking
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:24.480]   about the coronavirus.
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:25.000]   All right.
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:25.760]   So I said it earlier.
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:26.840]   It's still in the chat.
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:27.760]   The Italian guy?
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:28.240]   Yeah.
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:31.240]   The pasta.
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:32.240]   I'll do it.
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:33.240]   What's happening?
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:35.240]   He says, "Makuntus of a tattooer.
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:36.240]   The spectacular, "I love it."
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:37.240]   He said, "It was.
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:39.240]   It is so much panic when the World War II started."
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:40.240]   Oh, my God.
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:41.240]   Go back to it again.
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:42.240]   So, Italian man pissed off.
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:43.240]   Show it to be getting.
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:44.240]   We didn't see the beginning.
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:46.240]   Oh, we did see the beginning.
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:49.240]   The pasta shelves are empty.
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:53.240]   That's socialism for you right there.
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:54.240]   Mm.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:55.240]   I love you.
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:56.240]   The pasta shelves are empty.
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:57.240]   I love it, Tannos.
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:03:58.240]   I love it, Tannos.
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:03:59.240]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:05.560]   So I asked some people today what was going to be next, because my wife went to Costco
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:07.040]   and there was a line outside.
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:08.120]   They had open early.
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:09.120]   People were crazed.
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:10.920]   They were grabbing things like crazy.
[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:11.920]   It's just continued.
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:13.120]   So I wondered what things.
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:19.480]   So Nielsen, so what happens, has data on the pandemic pantry.
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:23.280]   And the biggest dollar growth, 305.5%.
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:26.240]   You want to guess anybody?
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:27.240]   Oh, no.
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:28.240]   Oh, no.
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:30.240]   Air fresh air.
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:31.240]   No.
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:32.240]   No.
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:33.240]   Sanitizer.
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:34.240]   No.
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:35.240]   No.
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:36.240]   Rice.
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:37.240]   Oh, no.
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:38.240]   Oh, yes.
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:40.240]   My favorite milk.
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:41.240]   I love it.
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:42.240]   Because it's shelf.
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:43.240]   It's shelf stable.
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:45.240]   Oh, milk is shelf stable.
[02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:47.240]   Even after you open it.
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:50.240]   Well, I don't think it's shelf stable for a while until you open it.
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:55.240]   So it's a septic packaging, but a lot of things are shelf stable with a septic package.
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:58.600]   So fruit snacks are up 12%.
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:03.560]   Pet medicine is up 11%.
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:04.560]   Dried beans.
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:06.080]   There you go, Stacey, 10%.
[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:07.080]   Energy beverages.
[02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:11.240]   So you're going to be really anxious sitting at home doing nothing.
[02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:12.800]   Clearly 10%.
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:17.640]   Bath and shower wipes probably because all the alcohols gone and all the hands Senate
[02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:18.640]   is gone.
[02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:19.640]   9.5% pretzels.
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:25.200]   Because you know, when the rules falling apart, you better have some pretzels in beer.
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:26.200]   9%.
[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:27.920]   Supplements, somebody percent.
[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:32.000]   First aid gets this point to present and water, which makes zero sense.
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.520]   There's going to be plenty of water.
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:37.160]   You have a tap in this country.
[02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:38.160]   People are preparing for an earthquake.
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:40.160]   You know what the good news is?
[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:41.920]   We'll be prepared for a natural disaster.
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:42.920]   Yeah.
[02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:43.920]   So that's not so bad.
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:45.960]   But let me give you one of this little moment.
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:46.960]   This is a moment.
[02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:49.480]   I went back to the non monetizable topic.
[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:54.400]   Sam Garacci, G-E-R-A-C-I on Twitter.
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:56.360]   The winning tweet of the day.
[02:05:56.360 --> 02:06:01.840]   The Rural Health Organization announced that dogs cannot get COVID-19.
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:03.720]   Dogs can be released from quarantine.
[02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:08.560]   I guess you could say that who let the dogs out?
[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:10.520]   Well, I saw that just a minute ago.
[02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:11.520]   Yes, I left.
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:15.040]   Oh, dad jokes.
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:16.040]   I appreciated it.
[02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:24.320]   So I combined the angry Italian man and the number and the dog joke.
[02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:26.200]   I did your freaking numbers.
[02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:27.200]   Thank you.
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:29.480]   Do you, if you want, Jeff, I will take over numbers.
[02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:30.960]   You don't have to ever do numbers again.
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:31.960]   No, no, no, I'll do the numbers.
[02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:32.960]   I'll take the challenge.
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:34.880]   Because the words are good too.
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:36.480]   Numbers are everywhere.
[02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:37.760]   It can't be that bad, isn't it?
[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:42.120]   I did go looking for a new German word today, but it's hard to beat Hamster Prakoff.
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:44.120]   Oh, OK.
[02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:46.200]   So, cars are the same that word.
[02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:48.280]   This must have been from last week.
[02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:49.280]   It's from last week.
[02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:51.280]   OK, I couldn't figure out why you can't figure out why you can't figure out why.
[02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:52.280]   Hamster Prakoff.
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:53.280]   Hamster Prakoff.
[02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:55.520]   And Hamster is like filling up your cheeks with stuff.
[02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:56.520]   Yes.
[02:06:56.520 --> 02:06:57.520]   So it's 40.
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:58.520]   It's German for hoarding.
[02:06:58.520 --> 02:06:59.520]   German hoarding is Hamster Prakoff.
[02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:03.680]   I think the German word of the week would be a great Jeff Jarvis segment.
[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:04.680]   I think so.
[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:09.080]   Or the German portmanteau of the week.
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:11.120]   Mr. Ant, happy birthday.
[02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:12.120]   Thank you, sir.
[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:15.360]   What do you want to celebrate today?
[02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:19.320]   I can't remember if I told you all about this particular uncle or not.
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:21.080]   Maybe I told you off the air.
[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:22.680]   You got a big family.
[02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:23.680]   Yeah, I do.
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:27.880]   Is it the principal uncle of the week?
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:29.200]   Hey, I like that.
[02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:30.200]   It's uncle.
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:31.200]   I have an uncle, Matt.
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:34.680]   He is my great uncle, my grandfather's brother.
[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:35.680]   He's a blues artist.
[02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:38.680]   Look at him playing the gas can banjo.
[02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:45.440]   And if you look at his image, that is a gas can that's turned into a guitar.
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:48.080]   It has pickups on it and it's got a neck.
[02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:51.000]   That's actually one of his quote unquote newer models.
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:58.480]   The original model had just the gas can and some bar stool legs as part of the week.
[02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:00.000]   That is the greatest.
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.160]   And some wire because it had some chicken wire.
[02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:08.520]   My grandfather knew that his brother liked to play the guitar when he were kids.
[02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:09.520]   So do you figure it out?
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:12.400]   Well, I'll go out and try to find something to help put a little guitar together.
[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:18.880]   So my grandfather decided to get the gas can, the legs from a bar stool and found some chicken
[02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:21.280]   wire and wrapped it up.
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:24.480]   And they pretty much learned how to make music that way back then.
[02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:30.840]   And my uncle took it to heart and just continued to run with that gift of his and turned it
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:31.920]   into a career.
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:33.920]   He's still touring to this day.
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:34.920]   Oh my God.
[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:35.920]   Do we have any of his music?
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:37.920]   He's 70 something years old.
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:40.320]   I can't remember how old uncle Mac is, but he's 70 something years old.
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:42.640]   He's in the Alabama Blues Hall of Fame.
[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:43.640]   Oh my God.
[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:49.240]   Toured and played with muddy waters in Chicago back in the days.
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:51.480]   So he was pretty diagram good.
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:55.480]   And he's still, like I said, he's still out there getting it done and touring just whenever
[02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:56.800]   he feels like it.
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:08:59.840]   Let's hear a little bit of Mac Arnold in the plate full of blues.
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:00.840]   Plate full of blues.
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:02.520]   That's his band.
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:04.440]   Can you turn that up a little bit there?
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:05.440]   Is it?
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:08.680]   And it's all blues.
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:11.480]   Is it me that needs to turn it up?
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:12.480]   Hey, YouTube.
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:15.160]   Oh, it's coming out of the wrong hole.
[02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:16.680]   Wait, what?
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:22.400]   How many times have I seen it?
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:24.040]   We retake that.
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:27.720]   Let me fix that here.
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:30.000]   I can hear it on your-- yeah, coming out of the speakers.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.000]   That's wrong.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:32.000]   What is not going on?
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:33.000]   There it is.
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000]   Now.
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.000]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000]   Really?
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.000]   That's actually not him.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000]   Let me get some of that here.
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000]   Let me get some guitar.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.560]   This is here some-- oh, man, that guitar sounds good.
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:44.560]   He can play it.
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:46.880]   Oh, I think they just got him overpowered again.
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:10:07.080]   Son of a sharecropper, 13 children, which means you have even more uncles.
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:08.080]   Oh, man.
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:15.360]   And he can play a mean gas can guitar.
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:18.800]   The story with-- I wish I could have found the interview.
[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:21.480]   There was a radio station that interviewed him and my grandfather.
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:25.960]   And my grandfather told the story a lot better, you know, because it was-- they lived it.
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:26.960]   He's in Wikipedia.
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:28.880]   That's pretty good.
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:29.880]   Wow.
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:30.880]   That's like the Uncle Mac.
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:31.880]   I told him about Uncle Mac.
[02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:33.880]   I never told him about my mother.
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:35.520]   I told you about my other Uncle Mac.
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:36.520]   My first principle.
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:37.520]   Yeah, the principle.
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:38.520]   Yeah.
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:39.520]   This is a new Uncle Mac.
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:40.520]   Yeah, this is my other uncle.
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:41.600]   How many uncles do you have, man?
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:42.600]   I couldn't tell you.
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:43.600]   That's good.
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:45.600]   I don't want him to run out.
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:47.800]   Well, Uncle Mac, this Uncle Mac has 12 siblings.
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:51.240]   He's got a few aunts in uncles.
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:52.240]   Good.
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:56.560]   This is that.
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:58.680]   That's coming out of a gas can guitar.
[02:10:58.680 --> 02:10:59.680]   Gas can guitar.
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:00.680]   That's on fire.
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:01.680]   Yeah.
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:03.280]   That's like I say, that's his newer one.
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:08.560]   His other one has-- it still has the bar stool legs on it for the neck.
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:12.760]   He can really pick that thing.
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:13.760]   Geez.
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:14.760]   Oh, man.
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:15.760]   I love this.
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:17.760]   What a discovery.
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:23.360]   If we get taken off YouTube for this, it was worse than-- and threw it.
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:25.400]   Catch him on hands on photography.
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:26.400]   Yes.
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:27.400]   Oh.
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:28.400]   Should we mention the new show?
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:29.400]   Not yet.
[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:30.400]   Not yet.
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:31.400]   Not yet.
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:32.400]   Not time yet.
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:33.400]   I've been working on something.
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:34.400]   A lot of fun.
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:35.400]   Great.
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:36.400]   Definitely check out Hop.
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:37.400]   A lot of fun on Hop.
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:39.040]   And great to have you.
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:41.080]   We saw you all about Android last night.
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:42.080]   Is that a regular gig?
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:43.080]   You're going to be on there all night?
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:46.040]   Right now I'm filling in for Ms. Florence Ion who's on maternity leave.
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:47.040]   She's a little baby.
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:48.040]   Yeah.
[02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:49.040]   Oh, congratulations.
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:51.040]   She had a little Mona.
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:52.040]   Little baby Mona.
[02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:53.040]   Yep.
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:57.560]   And so I've been filling in for her and hanging with Mr. Jason Howell and just talking to
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:11:58.560]   everyone.
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:11:59.560]   That's a lot of fun.
[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:00.560]   Yeah.
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:01.560]   She has to eat.
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:02.560]   No.
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:03.560]   Oh, no.
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:06.600]   I'm just going to jump around somewhere.
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:07.600]   That's what she needs to do.
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:11.000]   We think Stacy's the best thing since the Thermomics.
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000]   That's high praise.
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:14.000]   And the bread.
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.000]   Does it slice the bread too?
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:16.000]   No.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:17.000]   Is it the best thing?
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.000]   Is the Thermomics sliced bread?
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.800]   I am getting the bread slices later.
[02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:23.720]   Also known as a ninja.
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:24.720]   Is that what you're doing?
[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:26.880]   You're going to hire a ninja to slice the bread.
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:30.840]   Stacy is the host of the IOT podcast with Kevin Tofel.
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:32.600]   Also, you get her newsletter.
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:33.960]   It's Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:37.040]   She is really an expert on Internet of Things devices.
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:38.040]   That's right.
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:40.000]   As well as just wild, crazy stuff like that.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:41.000]   Helium and the nodal.
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:44.840]   I tell you what, you want to stay on top of what's happening?
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:45.840]   Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:46.840]   Is it?
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:49.600]   She has some great interviews on her show too.
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:51.600]   Your guest that you get on there, your interview.
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:55.560]   Tomorrow's guest is, okay, I have to tell you this because it's the writer of my favorite
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:58.440]   newsletter and I think your audience is going to love this.
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:01.480]   The newsletter is called the Prepared.org.
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:02.480]   It's Prepared.
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:04.200]   Well, it's not.
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:05.200]   It's actually manufacturing.
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:10.360]   It's manufacturing or anything related to physical hardware.
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:11.360]   The newsletter is great.
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:21.040]   They do videos of how crayons are made or filing new ways to file metal shaving.
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:24.440]   He's coming on and he's going to be talking about the impact of COVID-19 on the supply
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:26.640]   chain for devices.
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:28.320]   So it's going to be a fun interview.
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:29.320]   Sorry.
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:30.320]   I'm really excited about it.
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:31.320]   I love this dude.
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:33.120]   He's just, I love the newsletter.
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:35.680]   Yeah, everything about it's awesome.
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:36.680]   Okay, that's all.
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:41.920]   It's just in the Red Hat Summit Enterprise Connect has been canceled.
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:44.800]   I think you're going to assume most conferences will be canceled.
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:45.800]   Pretty much.
[02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:50.560]   Well, there was one last week called NICAR, which is investigative data journalist.
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:52.680]   Oh, I think one of those.
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:59.240]   Well, glad you didn't know this year because they had it in New Orleans one week ago.
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:00.640]   And guess what?
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:06.080]   Somebody is this case and now people are being, some of the four of my colleagues were there.
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:07.080]   They're being quarantined.
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:09.560]   Jeff, I'm already at your port.
[02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:10.560]   It's like, yeah.
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:18.920]   Actually, I'd like to, when we talk about this go to is it canceled yet.com just to check
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:21.520]   the latest list of cancellations.
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:32.200]   They have yes, maybe no and oh, and it looks like 2020 if you scroll up is, oh, yes, the
[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:33.200]   Houston rodeo.
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:35.320]   Yes, Las Vegas casino buffets.
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:38.080]   Yes, Pope Francis public appearance.
[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:42.800]   The rallies for Bernie and Biden last night, Google I/O South by Southwest, the Minecraft
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:43.800]   festival.
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:48.880]   You know, the best news though, Coachella has been postponed.
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:51.480]   Jeff Jarvis, professor of German.
[02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:55.760]   Generalism at CUNY, he'll be working from the home for the future.
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:56.760]   Right here.
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:57.760]   Here's my classroom.
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:02.400]   Actually, I think that's honestly, I wonder if there might be a long term benefit we get
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:05.440]   out of this that maybe we're going to discover new ways to work at home, new ways to teach
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:06.440]   at home.
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:07.440]   This might not be such a bad thing.
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:12.280]   Well, there was also a story from somewhere I put up on the rundown that people are dressing
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:16.920]   the sets for their their video conference background.
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:17.920]   Are you going to do that?
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:18.920]   I don't know what it is.
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:19.920]   This is actually just green screen.
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:20.920]   You're just so dressed.
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:21.920]   Here's his idea.
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:24.400]   Very much looks like a professor lives there.
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:25.760]   I just say, it's just green screen.
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:26.760]   It's actually the basement.
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:29.080]   Yeah, no, there's cans of beans.
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:32.200]   Lots of cans of beans now on the shelves behind me.
[02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:33.200]   Beans is good.
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:35.040]   Beans is good stuff.
[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:36.040]   I just get the dried beans.
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:37.800]   You can get a lot more out of that.
[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:38.800]   And the last one.
[02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:41.000]   You can put them in your little machine.
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:42.000]   Yes.
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.160]   God knows being soup could come out.
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:44.160]   I could have beer.
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:47.400]   No, he'll put beans in that machine and it's states going to come out.
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:48.560]   Fix costs $15.
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:52.840]   No, that is coronavirus.
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:55.480]   He will put the onion.
[02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:56.480]   He won't have to chop it.
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:15:58.280]   He'll put garlic won't have to chop it.
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:15:59.440]   His spices, tomatoes, whatever.
[02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:02.680]   What sound does it make when it goes in Stacey?
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:03.680]   I don't know what it sounds like.
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:05.160]   I love that sound you made.
[02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:06.680]   I want you to make this sound again.
[02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:07.680]   What noise did I make?
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:08.680]   She done you remember?
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:11.880]   Oh, that we need to do a hair.

[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:15.760]   What do you call that thing when you have the keyboard?
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:16.760]   You have to respond.
[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:17.760]   The sound is Dacey soundboard.
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:18.760]   We need a Stacey soundboard.
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:19.760]   You definitely need a Stacey soundboard.
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:21.880]   Can we get to work on that?
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:24.800]   I think Kevin's going to work on that for us.
[02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:26.960]   Stacey Kevin gives the knife.
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:27.960]   Stay healthy, please.
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:28.960]   Okay.

[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:39.160]   Is it impermeable or impervious?
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:41.240]   Impervious to all.
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:42.240]   We argued before.
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:46.040]   Yeah, no, it's impervious.
