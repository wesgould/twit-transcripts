[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.000]   Jeff Jarvis - we will be talking about
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.240]   Amazon's purchase of Roomba Stacey's got it all figured out. I think she's absolutely right
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.560]   Elon Musk selling seven billion dollars in Tesla shares, but why and why were scientists?
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.800]   Hiding an encryption key for the Wizard of Oz in a plastic molecule. It's all coming up next on Twig

[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.440]   This week in Google the show where we cover the latest news from Google and meta and in all the other ones
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.760]   Hello everybody. I'm Leo report your host joining us a
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.000]   Stranger in paradise Stacey Higginbotham yay from Stacey on IOT.com at gigastacey
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.520]   She is also the host of the IOT podcast with Kevin TOEFL. Hello Stacey. We miss you when you're out here
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.200]   Even though it gives us a chance to have other lovely people on
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.080]   It ain't the same and I'm getting all excited about Clara and the Sun and Stacey's book club coming up in a couple of weeks is so exciting
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.040]   Also here from hands-on photography the one the only aunt pro at
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.120]   Also community manager of our discord and planner of great things like Stacey's book club
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.600]   I attempt anyway, you do you not only attempt you do
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:32.120]   Alex Lindsay's asked me anything is a week from Thursday Stacey's book club two weeks from Thursday and I think other things are brewing
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:41.040]   Yes, sir, we speak including hands-on Macintosh and hands-on window with windows with my cesargent and paul throughout respectively
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.400]   Although I think for April fools they should each do the other
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.760]   Why not why not?
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.800]   Actually, they're both completely capable of doing that also with us mr. Jeff Jarvis. He is the townite professor
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.160]   Leonard Ta professor for journalistic innovation at the
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.000]   At the city of his New York hello mr. Jarvis
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.480]   Hello, Jarvis been watching a lot of TV lately a lot of those news channels keep them busy
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.600]   They've been busy. Yeah. Yes. Yeah writing stuff right stuff over there. Let's see what you're right
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.040]   Show us what you're writing is the whiteboard full so one of those is
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.800]   The Gutenberg manuscript another one is the magazine book manuscript and next to that is two book proposals nice
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.680]   So you have a window seat just for manuscripts. That's really cool. Yes
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   Every author should honored place
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.960]   Yes, if you find Truman Capote's long-lost novel there just let us know would you I just hope the cat doesn't go and scratch at all
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.280]   Capote I should I was just watching a documentary he gave
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.920]   his this this book answer prayers, which is all about New York socialites and and they're horrible
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.480]   Secrets he gave a key to one of his dear friends
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.320]   He said this and this is the key to the safety deposit box, but neglected to tell her where the safety deposit
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.800]   Reminded of this by our pre-show discussion of you know, where do you store your important documents?
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.200]   Do people still choose you why don't you do a safety deposit box instead of a something in your house?
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   I guess it's hard to get to
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.360]   Yeah, I mean we actually I think we have a safety deposit box. Okay. Yeah, I always wanted one
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.360]   I felt like that's when you're a grown-up
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.560]   That's right
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.040]   My jewels and jewels
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.760]   Yes
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.480]   Let's see I guess we should mention this morning a poor Jason howl and
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.640]   Ron Ron Ron Reynolds had to get up Ron. What's his name Richard?
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.000]   End of Leo's week everyone's into my
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.160]   Week all things whining dad Ron Richards Jason howl yesterday?
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.480]   I called Jason Snell Jason howl, so it's all it all evens out
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:15.520]   This morning at 6 a.m. I was I was snoring but Jason and Ron came in and showed everybody the new galaxy
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.520]   Flip 4 I'm surprised they let the Z stay they were rumors
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.200]   They would get rid of the Z because that's the letter that the Russians use for their Ukrainian
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   Oh
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.400]   Letter yeah, you can't yeah, no
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.080]   Russians own Z
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.160]   We can't let the Russians kill the alphabet so Stacy good news your Z flip three is not so really out of date
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.680]   It's only a few little I'm really excited. They're still investing in it because I really like the phone. It's a great and I'm
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:53.760]   I'm excited too. Okay, so Samsung's doing their bespoke Z fold things with color like custom colors and stuff
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.120]   And Samsung actually introduced that in their kitchen appliances and they're doing it with their
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:06.440]   Refrigerators and everything else and it's their whole bespoke. So it's it kind of if I'm thinking big picture
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.800]   I'm like it's like we're getting this aesthetic from
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.600]   Like our homes and bringing it to our plot like our computers and that's kind of a nice feeling
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.280]   It's our linoleum phone. It's not the first time anybody did this the Moto Z
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.440]   Great when Google owned Motorola
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.360]   That had was that a Z also?
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.920]   What was the motor?
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.960]   Anyway, the X it was Moto X not a big stesso Russians don't have that letter yet Moto X
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:41.280]   Had the whole exact same thing bespoke you could get all the different colors and everything build your own
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.540]   I think that's a cool cool idea Apple's done it with their Apple watches, you know match mix and match bands and
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:54.720]   Bodies and so forth. So I like yeah, I like that 49 possible color combinations that has to be a record for the Z flip
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.960]   3 no, that's last year. Oh, wait a minute. So they did this last year
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:09.240]   Never mind the Z flip for balls. So we'll know I thought this bespoke thing was brand new like Stacy, but it's not
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.640]   You know, they've done the Berks
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.800]   Mr. Burke stopped me this morning when I was in in the TV booth for floss weekly and he asked me about this event
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.840]   And he's like, well, did you watch it?
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.360]   And I was and I told him hey all love and respect to mr
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.160]   Howl, but I was not interested in this Samsung event because phones just don't it cite me anymore. It's
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.720]   I'm kind of a little I'm kind of with you on that
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.640]   I am what a take to a second. Yeah, what would it take?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.920]   What is nice? We heard that Craig Craig Craig Newmark that excites me too. I know
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.600]   My heart starts pounding does me do you think now you so I?
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.880]   Had the fold I had a two of them
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.280]   I haven't been by the last year edition and as you know, I had the flip which I gave to you Stacy
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:05.480]   And you still use it right? So do you think you believe her in photo full balls? I really like it
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.560]   It's fun. It reminds me of like you flip in your photo bit and you're like hell it
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.320]   It's compact in your park. I think it fits in my pocket
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.960]   Yeah, I know you've been the fold have you had that angry hang up yet though?
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.520]   You done that oh I heard that
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:29.200]   Just like the food breaking Wow, I don't actually talk in the phone very
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   You can preorder now for August 28th on the flip and the fold and there's a new galaxy watch
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.680]   5 but I'm kind of with you. It's hard for me to get
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.480]   Jazzed up, you know, we are gonna have an apple event sometime in the next 30 days
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.880]   Mm-hmm or maybe a little bit longer. We're gonna have that pixel 7
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:58.240]   event and the pixel watch event and in every case these are just kind of you know
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.160]   incremental improvements on existing devices it is hard to kind of get too excited about that
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.800]   I'd be more curious about the watch than the phone
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:14.140]   You know, yeah, well, this is that's incremental. That's just better battery life. Yeah, although they did they say a five-day
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:21.800]   Battery like 80 hour battery life because that was the rumor. I didn't are they using the new Qualcomm chips. Yes, they're actually design
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:27.700]   Okay. Yes, that's why they're getting better battery life. Yeah, they also mention it's gonna be in a change
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.760]   I've been I'll mention it now that where OS is gonna get a
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.960]   Revant Place door where OS is really been revitalized by Samsung's participation
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.600]   Where OS 3.5 ships on the galaxy watch five and the watch five pro
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.840]   They'll also have Google Maps for where OS
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:50.320]   With support for offline navigation, which I think is kind of interesting. That's cool
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.600]   Used to be you had a tether it to your smartphone
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:01.280]   But now later this year Google says offline from the phone or the or the phone off
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.760]   Line from the Internet. No the watch just on the watch the watch doesn't have to talk to the phone again
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.880]   I'm coming soon find your way using Google Maps from your wrist without a smartphone connection
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:17.400]   How to how much storage is on these devices and how tiny are those files to do? Well, here's my prediction
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.400]   I'm not mad. Here's my prediction
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.480]   Then this will only be on a watch that has GPS built in not all do because okay battery killer and
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.080]   It will you'll have to save ahead of time you'll have to save local maps which Google Maps lets you do
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.400]   In fact Google Maps even caches maps so I you may not have to
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.920]   Proactively save a map, but those aren't those are a few hundred megabytes
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.840]   so
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.840]   I mean these watches now have four gigabytes and more so there's plenty of storage on these watches to do okay. Yeah, yeah
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.840]   They're not that big
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.880]   I
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.640]   you know, but
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.280]   There's some issues of course if you leave a map going to navigate that's gonna kill battery life
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:59.160]   This is all stuff that I think is in response to the bigger battery sizes in the new Qualcomm chip
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.320]   We can do more because well, it's sorry. Yeah, it's not bigger battery sizes. It's more capable
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.720]   They know they actually beefed up the battery as well. I think in the watch five the galaxy
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.680]   Yes, but that's not Qualcomm. That's right
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:18.440]   So where OS is alive and well or at least it's alive
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:27.880]   When does the Google watch we have any date they so in the past they've done it both ways before and after Apple's event
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.760]   a
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:37.040]   Few years ago they did it before we were thinking to you know surprise everybody before Apple and then I think last year
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:43.200]   Didn't they announce the Pixel 6 after Apple? I think that's right. Yeah, so it's unknown
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.560]   It's unknown Apple has said that or at least
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   analysts say the Apple
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:57.560]   New Apple iPhone 14 will not be impacted by supply chain shortages because Apple buys up all of TSM C's production ahead of time
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:02.520]   Etc etc. They are on they're already producing the iPhone 14
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.920]   But I have to think that is not necessarily good for Google and Samsung and others
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.520]   Who makes the Qualcomm chips is it TSMC as well?
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.840]   Stacey
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:18.560]   They have TSMC and they had just time to deal this week with global foundries to go through their stuff as well
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.560]   Yeah, this is becoming a big issue
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:27.320]   Actually Ben Thompson in the Stratecary has a very good piece today. I think it's subscriber only talking about
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.400]   the power that
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.800]   These foundries have because there's so few of them
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   Because it's freaking expensive to make right and right I mean this was global foundries was AMD getting out of making their own chips
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:48.000]   and teaming up with IB remember like way back in 2007 AMD IBM
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.340]   They all got together and they were like, oh, we've got to figure out the next generation of chip semiconductor manufacturing
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.180]   They're like it's so freaking expensive and then they were like, yeah screw it
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:01.160]   Let's spin it all out into global foundries and he one of the side effects of this is
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.880]   Nvidia
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.520]   Tumbling and it having a terrible quarter
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.680]   Because demand decreased on its GPUs
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.480]   Mostly because the crypto market crashed
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.120]   but as a result and
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:22.120]   Video was stuck between a rock and a hard place. They had contracts with TSMC and other foundries
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.920]   They couldn't get out of so demand tumbles, but they still have to buy the chips
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:35.720]   So huge losses and that's that's Ben's takeaway from this is boy. It's a good time to be a foundry
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.200]   Yeah, but I mean this is an video big and oh, I'm sorry
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:47.320]   I was just gonna express for frustration like this is just economic cycles. This is just how it goes
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:54.040]   You don't want to be in the foundry business making chips because most of the time it's a crappy place to be
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:14:02.440]   You know, you can't necessarily anticipate demand you've got to put in huge capex expenses and hope like heck you get them
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.800]   you know
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   advertised over time properly and
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   So yeah, now it's a great time to be a factory. I guarantee you the next cycle is going to be a terrible time to be a
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.960]   Foundry and
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.880]   Sorry, I'm just frustrated with
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.520]   What feels screamingly obvious kidding?
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.160]   You go in I'm in a bad mood
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.800]   No, I was just thinking not that the in videos not
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:36.280]   There the only thing in the basket isn't just a you but aren't they big in AI space right now?
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.440]   You're clicking it out. I don't know why
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.320]   Ruh-oh, Ruh-uh-uh-ay
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:48.200]   Your chips are used in training and inference for mission
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.760]   cars AI yeah, but but
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:58.040]   All of the up ramp up in the last year and several years has been crypto
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.160]   And now what's happening is all the all the cryptocurrency guys are dumping their GPUs
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.320]   So there's a glut of use GPUs on the market prices have dropped for brand new GPUs
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.880]   It's been very very bad for Nvidia very very bad for Nvidia
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:19.880]   I mean it was nice to see the GPU price come down though. That's great for gamers
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.480]   Can't knock that
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.360]   And actually this is he ties it in as well to the
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.680]   imminent
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:36.360]   change in Ethereum from proof of stake to from proof of work to proof of stake which
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:41.640]   Is a new way of mining coin that does not involve GPUs or?
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:51.080]   Hideous consumption of energy. This is you know been promised for a long time ethereum is planning this in September a lot of miners
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.280]   Are upset in fact there's a fork?
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.240]   proposed now that does continue to use proof of work
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:01.800]   The they're calling they call this the merge
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:09.600]   Clever the merge and it's gonna be a little disruptive
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.080]   so
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.360]   continued
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:18.560]   Headwinds a continued cocktail of headwinds as the CFO of Apple said
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.080]   um
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:27.560]   Anyway, it's interesting time do recommend Ben Thompson's
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:33.160]   Stretecory, I think it's he's he's we haven't talked about him in a long time, but he's really
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.040]   Very good in this do you read him every day?
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:42.440]   I you know it's ironic one of the reasons we haven't talked about about him in a long time is because I hadn't read him in a while
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.760]   But somebody I saw somebody on the on the Twitter
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:53.080]   Say oh wow, Ben's really really on fire and on all cylinders today. This was yesterday as he does
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.600]   because of this kind of confluence of
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.280]   GPU and Vidia
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:06.080]   You know TSMC and he's done a good job. I think a very good job of kind of
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.280]   Combining all of these economic forces
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:16.360]   Whatever Stacy says I think there is something going on. It's very interesting. Yeah, maybe it's just cycles
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.520]   Um
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.000]   Let's see let me see if I can find
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:29.520]   NVIDIA said get put out a warning that second quarter sales would fall well short of forecast amid a drop in gaming revenue
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.800]   the company
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.280]   expects
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.520]   17% drop from what they'd forecast in May and a 33% drop in gaming revenue
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.960]   so
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.120]   NVIDIA stock of course
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.120]   plummeted as a result
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.920]   preliminary results for gaming down 44% sequentially and
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:57.760]   Then this is this is the NVIDIA versus TMC section
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:03.160]   East cap a protected account at a fantastic insight this worth sharing broadly
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:10.000]   The irony of a dedicated foundry TSMC enabling fabulous to flourish is the moat on leading edges
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.760]   So why now the part of the cap expert is getting shifted back to the fabulous in the form of LTA's?
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.160]   I don't know what that means, but yes, that's so basically they're saying they have so much power
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.360]   That's the long-term pricing agreements between the two of them. That's the problem, right?
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:30.000]   You can you make these agreements, but then if market the bottom for all other market
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.600]   I'm an expertly intel is getting hammered because forever they were not a foundry and they built their own fabs
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.200]   And I mean, that's why it's so that's why I'm so over it. I'm just like oh screw you Wall Street
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:47.960]   You just don't understand what it takes to make things and you're just trying to financially optimize for stuff and I'm sick of it
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:56.160]   He he Ben even cops to this he's been he was one years ago urging and I think in 2013 Intel to become a
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.500]   Foundry not just a great advice manufacturer now that Intel's done it
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.880]   Problems problems problems
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.580]   and
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:12.160]   Well, no, it's actually good that Intel's done it because their their market share was plummeting in servers
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.240]   And they couldn't make it they need it because they were gonna it's a better long-term strategy
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.040]   Even if it's a short-term problem. I think right
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:27.840]   Well, so the issue is you build a fab to make a fab make money because this is like a five ten
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:33.640]   Sometimes fifteen billion dollar in fact. This is not trivial. Right? You have to push
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.080]   Silicon out all day
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:44.440]   24/7 and you have to sell that to people and it has to go into things and it has to do it very quickly so
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.960]   Intel wasn't they didn't have the demand anymore for just their chips
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:55.920]   so they had to open it up to others because you can't not make chips if you have invested in a fab otherwise it's
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.400]   It's a money-losing asset
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.440]   And hence what does it take what does it take to reconfigure from one chip to another?
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:10.200]   It depends on the chip and so you have to do a process right?
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.600]   So if you make if you build a five nanometer fab, that's a five-meter minute. You're fab
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.440]   Yeah, so you have to reconfigure it
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:23.040]   Yeah, so your fab is going to run at whatever process node or that particular line
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:29.440]   But usually it's a whole fab, but you also then for every chip. There's a mask that you make it's a it's the
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:36.600]   It's like a it's the letter for like letter press. So it's the mask. Oh speaking my language. Yes
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:41.280]   Yeah, what do you call it? So what you have to make a mask and
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.320]   Those are millions of dollars
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.680]   So Qualcomm designed something they get it put into a mask and then that goes to the fab
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:53.080]   And then that's what they use to like etch out the chips. It's actually not a press. It's an etching
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.120]   But I guess it's probably a good idea at this point to define
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.600]   Terms here where there's the fabrication plants that actually make the chips
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:05.040]   There are the fabulous foundries like Nvidia that design them
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:13.440]   But don't make them and then contract out to have them made and there are the integrated companies which Intel was for years at both designs and builds its own
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:22.760]   Processors Intel's under pat under their new CEO pack Elsinger has decided that they're gonna in effect be two businesses that they will be a fabulous
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.920]   Chip design company, but they will also build fabs
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.520]   I'm not sure how that's different from integrated, but everybody seems to think it is
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:36.040]   No, it's just that they they designed and built their own chips though in Intel was like now
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.040]   They're gonna
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.240]   Does it too? There's a difference. They're gonna build chips for other companies. They wanted to right?
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.520]   They never did that we want to build for Apple now and so that all of this is relevant
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.120]   To everybody listening right now, and they may not this may seem like abstruse
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.360]   But this is what the chip shortage is all about and this is well. It's not just about that
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:02.200]   So there's also packaging so like these little chips come off the way they come out on a wafer
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.640]   You break the break it up and then you package it into
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:12.280]   A board with pins and everything like that so that what one of the challenges with the chip supply
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:18.760]   Isn't just that these chips aren't being made fast enough and they're usually big those made it like older fabs
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:25.680]   It's that it might be made in Taiwan and then it goes someplace else to get packaged and then it comes
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:32.440]   Back to the vendor and it might go someplace else to get packaged later on a board and then it goes back to like
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:38.520]   There's like a lot of steps there. So there's serious concerns for two reasons one of course because of this chip shortage
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.280]   but also because
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:47.080]   TSMC is in Taiwan a lot of these chips are made in in Taiwan and if Taiwan is in geopolitical trouble with China
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:55.240]   Nancy Pelosi goes there she meets with TSMC all of a sudden China is telling Apple don't ship us anything from Taiwan
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:02.720]   We won't accept it. So there's this whole geopolitical issue going on and then there's a chips act which would the chips and science
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.720]   Acts which was signed into law yesterday
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.960]   Which includes 52 billion dollars in funding to get companies to build
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:15.180]   semiconductor fabs in the US TSMC has a very big fab
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:21.760]   That that they've broken ground on but won't be done for two more years Intel is was waiting for this money
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:27.800]   They were waiting. It's a 20 billion dollar fab. They were waiting for federal funds before they broke ground on their Arizona fab
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:34.560]   So you can put money into it, but these fabs take years to build it's gonna be years before the chips enter the supply chain
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:40.960]   But it's just like planning a tree. Well, it's the best time playing a tree is 20 years ago the next best time is today
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:47.040]   We wish we built these fabs a while ago because we are very dependent on Taiwan silicon
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:53.320]   Well, and the other thing to think about is these chip factories the fabs that we're building
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:57.120]   today to go into production in a couple years are
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:03.240]   New process notes. So a lot of these are the most advanced process notes
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:10.640]   But a lot of our chip shortages are actually on some of the older like yeah, like 40 nanometers sometimes even 65
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.520]   I mean these are like for for context
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:18.440]   We're talking like the most advanced nodes are like three nanometers, which is insane
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.000]   so
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.920]   like
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:28.000]   We're building all these like high-end fancy. It's like we're gonna build all these like Ferraris
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.840]   But we still need like some Kia's for everybody else, but we're not actually building those here in the US
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.840]   So we're still gonna be reliant on
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:43.200]   chips from other places for quite some time. I mean there are still fabs in the US that are making things like
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.800]   140 nanometers and
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.060]   You know even in Mexico there's some but anyway
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:52.840]   the TSMC fab in Arizona is a
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.160]   5 nanometer fab
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:01.680]   So that's very good that I mean there is a three nanometer process and I think that's still in Taiwan
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   But at least the five nanometer
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.200]   Note is here and that's by the way what Apple uses right now and its iPhones is five nanometers
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:15.380]   Yeah, this is a complex subject is a lot of it's very capital intensive
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:21.480]   There's some debate about whether the government should be putting 52 billion dollars into the
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:27.600]   domestic semiconductor manufacturing I think it seems like something we need to do to be competitive
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.560]   With China and to protect ourselves against Taiwan being
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.960]   Attacked there's a lot more in this by the way. It's a two hundred eighty billion dollar act. We've talked about this before
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:48.760]   Money goes to the National Science Foundation to invent new processes. This is a fascinating story with TSMC because of Apple pouring all this money into TSMC in Taiwan
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:55.800]   TSMC was able to develop new processes for Apple which they could then sell to other companies
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.800]   And so they've really leapfrogged American companies in terms of processes
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.640]   That's why they could do a three three nanometer alike process and so
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:09.560]   You know, I think a lot of American companies are saying well, you know apples
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.320]   You're you're you're supporting TSMC
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.040]   Maybe you could you know bring it home. I
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:24.680]   Don't think Apple's showing any inclination to do that although, you know, they probably are worried about all their stuff being made in Taiwan and China
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:33.840]   We did get a huge boost back when the US government invested in some tech back in like the late 80s early 90s
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.320]   And so I do think there's like
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:45.480]   There's going to be advantages in figuring out how to I mean because again, we're all like, ah, we're slos over. What do we do now?
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:54.920]   There's tons of opportunity for us to bring new manufacturing here and I would love to see some of that money going towards
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.920]   Research in not necessarily
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.240]   Like just Intel for building plants, right?
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.880]   So the stuff going to research we could see some like cool new tools develop
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:12.000]   We could even see things not tied to like chips that we think of as chips, but like solar that's all chips, right?
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.240]   So maybe we'll see some new materials research
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:21.360]   There's like a lot of opportunity here that we just but it'll be like 20 years out that benefits to us, right?
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.480]   But we should be doing that
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.080]   It's okay. That's all you know the politics of this area
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.360]   Really interesting. There was an article in the new republic
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:36.960]   About Keynesian economic theory versus Milton Friedman and of course we've been in
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.400]   And I'm sure Jeff you have something to say about this, but we've been in a Friedman
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.360]   like a state
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.120]   Well rate certainly since Reagan, but maybe even before that and some are saying look
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.600]   This is what you know in the past government has invested in things like chip factories
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.760]   And it built a strong middle class. It built a strong economy
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.840]   But as soon as Reagan and others came along
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:06.440]   embracing Milton Friedman's philosophy the government should not get involved at the free market should rule it became
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.480]   Income and equality went through the roof. It became doggy dog
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:16.040]   We killed the middle class and we're seeing the blight that was created by these
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.880]   Freedman esque what do you call it? It's Keynesian Keynesianism or a cane
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.200]   Keynesianism what is Friedman ism is it Friedman ism?
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.200]   But this this free
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.800]   You know Keynesian versus Friedman in him
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   It just says versus Friedman when I sir Friedman. Yeah
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:41.960]   Yeah, and it and so it heartless economics heartless is a better word it is
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.600]   But it is you know, it's remember Reagan saying you know
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:50.960]   The scariest worlds in the words in the world are I'm from the government. I'm here to help
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.880]   That was the next the next scariest words are I'm here from corporate. I'm here to help right?
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:03.200]   So it's interesting because the Democratic Party with the build back better and the infrastructure bill is kind of nudging a
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.680]   Reluctant country into this more Keynesian
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.200]   Economic theory
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.640]   We'll see if it sticks, but this chips act is very much a Keynesian thing. Let's invest
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:20.880]   To bring these plants home by the way one of the one of the conditions of this is you may not then build plants in China
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.640]   Intel was actually thinking about taking over a Chinese
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.800]   chip factory
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:31.640]   Taiwan, I'm sorry Taiwan chip factory or maybe it wasn't China. No it was in China and one of the
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:37.160]   Consequences of this bill is you can't do that if you're gonna take our money for that $20 billion fab in Arizona
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.720]   You may not build fabs anywhere else, you know, especially in Asia
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:48.360]   so I saw a story today that said that that we won't get the impact of the
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:56.360]   Tax breaks on electric cars because mansions stuck in a clause on supply chain. Have you seen that? Yeah?
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:01.000]   Well, we will and we won't we will and we won't Tesla's are made in the US
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.200]   But they're very past or not
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:11.600]   And I think the last thing I think you're gonna get half of your you're gonna get half of the potential right right?
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:17.080]   What's frustrating is they they faced it out over a year and granted
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:24.040]   If you want to actually bring people to invest in factories and manufacturing here
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:31.240]   Then you establish a tax credit that will last for 10 years which then makes the economics of investing here
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:37.440]   Otherwise, it doesn't make sense and you're just like oh, that's just like a little nice to write headlines about but is it actually helpful?
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.800]   So that's sad
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:47.080]   This is the article I was referring to from the New Republic. Yes, the inflation reduction act is a big effing deal
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:52.920]   Michael Tomasky while the bill that just survived the Senate is a whittled down version of the Build Back Better Act
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:31:00.280]   It still puts the Democratic Party in a promising new path makes the argument that we we've kind of gone down the road of a free
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:07.000]   Monomics and perhaps it's time to get the government back involved stimulating the economy in the right direction
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.920]   Yeah, we desperately need that kind of stimulus for environment and energy
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.200]   And having used to property and you know for talking about nudging individuals
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.680]   I think no gene the economy and nudging companies makes perfect
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.760]   So I think we talked about Bill Gates New York Times
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:29.080]   Editorial in which he said we've got to we've got to pass this because a clean energy future is
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:35.720]   In the hands of Congress around the verge of a remarkable moment for Congress in the country gate says the investment in clean energy
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:41.680]   That comes from this act is is huge. It's so important
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.440]   It's maybe the most important bill in our lifetime
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.440]   so
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:52.560]   Gates thinks that and he this was new deal for the earth. Yeah. Yeah, so anyway
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.320]   Interesting to watch
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:00.680]   it all comes back to things like chip shortages and supply chain and and
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:05.920]   Nvidia collapsing in the market
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:11.720]   Let's see I want to take a break before we talk about the story that's gonna get
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.440]   Stacey all riled up
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.720]   Riley are you ready to rile I saw a pretty
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.880]   Get a waffle
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:28.160]   Do whatever you need to get your blood sugar up and we will come back and talk about Amazon
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:35.600]   But first a word from our sponsor compiler the original podcast from Red Hat
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.240]   We love red hat discussing tech topics big small and strange
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.960]   We've talked before about
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:48.720]   Command line heroes another one of our sponsors love that podcast compiler
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.560]   I think I've mentioned it before they've got a new season out compilers hosted by Angela Andrews and Brent Simino
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:58.560]   It's all about the kinds of things we've just been talking about technology
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:06.960]   Complicated but compiler unravels industry topics trends and the things you've always wanted to know about tech by interviewing the people who know it
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:14.640]   Best and what I love about compilers you're gonna hear a variety of perspectives from diverse communities behind
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.720]   the code you're hearing from red hatters and
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.720]   They're talking about big questions in tech things like what is technical debt?
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.440]   What are tech hiring managers actually looking for? How to code?
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:33.440]   Do you have to know how to code to get started an open source things like that compiler?
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:40.120]   Let me give you some examples episode two what can vid I love this what can video games teach us about edge computing?
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.120]   I'm in it saying for a long time
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:47.760]   Edge can you know they're using video games as a test for edge computing, but it's gonna be so much more
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:52.040]   The internet is a patchwork of international agreements and varying infrastructure
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:56.520]   But there's something coming to change the ways we connect in episode two of compiler
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:03.420]   Angela and Brent explore what edge computing could meet for people who enjoy video games and what this form of entertainment could
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:09.020]   Teach us about the technology episode nine. How are tech hubs?
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:17.520]   Changing a lot of money by the way in that new bill the chips act to build tech hubs in new locations
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:25.260]   Traditionally if you wanted a career in tech you had a move to a tech hub a city like San Francisco or Austin packed with startups and talent
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:29.180]   Things are starting to change the hosts of compiler speak to a few of the changemakers
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:37.620]   Or thinking outside of the physical and social dimensions we've come to associate with innovation if you like stimulating conversations
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:41.140]   About topics that make a big difference in tech
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:49.700]   Compiler compilers the podcast red dot ht slash twit or we'll also put a link in our show notes
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:56.260]   New shows new episodes a whole new season out now you can download them anytime red dot ht slash twit or
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:01.220]   Look on your Apple podcasts or anywhere you listen to podcast to listen to compiler
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:07.100]   And or you can just go to this show page for today's episode and we'll put a link there. Thank you compiler
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:13.460]   For tackling these tough issues and making a great podcast all around it compiler from red hat I
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:17.380]   Think the government investment in podcasts
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:25.820]   You need more podcasts. Okay. This is where I put my my free monomics hat on the last thing
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:29.560]   We want is government putting its thumb on the scales in podcasting
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:35.380]   Thank you. That's interesting. We could use we could use a voice of America podcast sure
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:41.000]   Yeah, I'm not against voice of America. Well here. Okay. Here's a question. We'll get to eat
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.100]   We'll get to Amazon the second but here's a question
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:48.580]   There is an industry an industry I happen to be working in that is dying on the vine an American industry
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:53.620]   Started at the turn in the last century. It's called broadcast radio. Oh
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.620]   Puh
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:00.060]   Some call it. Oh, Puh, I don't know why
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.860]   It's dying should the feds try to save it
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:13.200]   No, oh no, no, but what's interesting to me Leo is the different the attitude difference about radio here versus Europe
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:20.540]   Right Europe radio still have government work that's because the government the government of England
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:28.500]   France the biggest stations are all government stations. We don't want a I wouldn't listen to a radio free America
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:35.820]   Okay, we have NPR. That's yeah, but it's not directly. They basically are down to virtually no
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.740]   It's not directly funded by federal funds federal funds go to the local stations and then you know
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:45.100]   But it's yeah, it's kind of it's actually if you listen NPR, it's advertising funded now
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:50.600]   Yeah, in fact, it's funny because we compete with them in Puffer pod
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:56.860]   Podcast advertising big time and they are very expensive and they they get a lot of the biggest advertisers
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.460]   It's very hard to get compete against NPR
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:03.120]   Which is in direct response? Very interesting
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.580]   Yeah, I mean all we do is direct response these days
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:13.900]   But same with the NPR podcast no because and I talked to the Lisa talks these advertisers tells me
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:19.240]   They don't buy NPR for raw response numbers
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:25.060]   You know they care when they buy at us. What's the ROI? How many new customers again for NPR? It's prestige
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:31.780]   It's brand it's brand and and that's a hard thing to compete against
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.380]   To be yeah, you got to get that sweet brand
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:44.220]   Many of my advertisers are going for brand and cache and I love them all for it. Yeah good for you. Yeah
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:48.240]   Send them our way. No, no, you should keep them
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:53.580]   We I don't I don't want to steal any of your advertisers. They're all I'm sure fine
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.240]   Amazon has announced it's gonna buy I
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:03.860]   Robot the makers of the Roomba vacuum cleaner for 1.7 billion dollars
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:09.020]   I don't you know if there's gonna be any regulatory
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:16.760]   Pushback on this it's gonna have to be more about privacy and data because I don't think this means they'll own
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:22.200]   The tiny little market for automated vacuums will they stay see?
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.120]   There are other companies
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.200]   This is an antitrust
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.660]   Let me repress this under Lena Khan's
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:35.560]   Views of antitrust and she is the current head of the FTC this
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.480]   could I
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:42.980]   Don't think I'm what grabbed on this on what grounds so on the grounds that
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.960]   Amazon anchor makes one a develop
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:52.880]   But there are a lot of companies not not on the vacuums. So it's not on the physical devices
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:58.300]   It's around I robots plans to do an OS a cohesive OS for the smart home
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:04.960]   They know about this this is why we love Stacy
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:09.680]   Did you see my no
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:17.600]   You should go to Stacy and I OT right now has an excellent headline if I do say maps mops and matter
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.760]   Why Amazon wants I robot?
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.840]   So tell a liberation
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:30.400]   We adore a look at help it so it's not gonna be halted on the grounds that Amazon's gonna swoop up the robot
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.560]   vacuum market
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.240]   No, there's enough competition that that's not the case
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:42.040]   It is not robot vacuum. So the two biggest like moral panic as Jeff would say things were like privacy
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.600]   And in my story I actually include a map of my home
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:52.320]   So you can see what Roomba knows about my house if you're so inclined it knows you have a couch in the living room
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:58.600]   It does and it knows all those weird hash marks or rocks. It knows where I have Brooks. Oh, that's interesting
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.280]   So you got a carpeted master bedroom
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:09.120]   Partial in the office. So you don't consider this an invasion of privacy. Obviously not you put it on the internet
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:16.720]   I am impressed by the size of your laundry room, which is actually bigger than your kitchen. Oh, wow
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.720]   It's like a mud room
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.040]   Laundry it's everything that that door leads out to the garage
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:27.160]   It's it's it's like the catch-all when you walk in and Seattle good Lord
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.360]   How did you get this out of your room Roomba you're able to download your map?
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:38.240]   I did a screenshot of the app and then I oh the app tells you this okay. Yeah the app shows you anyway
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:42.520]   What we're talking about oh robot OS
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.440]   So robot OS is something that I robot
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:50.880]   it's their next generation operating system and they started talking about it earlier this year and
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.800]   What it is?
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:57.200]   It's exactly what everybody's been talking about with a smart home for years
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:04.200]   It's like once all the things are interoperable. How do we figure out how to not make robots in the smart home?
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:08.000]   But turn the smart home into a robot which means giving them context about
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:18.200]   What people are in the home what they're trying to do what other devices can share with other devices about what's happening in the home to actually add value and
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:24.520]   That's what Roomba was trying to build with robot OS. Amazon's also trying to build this
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:29.840]   It's not like when they talk about ambient intelligence. That's what they're talking about but
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.840]   I robot had a has
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:37.400]   had a better chance because
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:41.840]   Consumers can say I don't want anything you're selling I robot
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.760]   I'm not gonna buy you because there's plenty of other options
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:52.080]   So it was it was incentivized to work with privacy and data hopes that consumers wanted right same thing with other vendors
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.840]   that are going to like share their device data with
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:42:03.120]   Robot OS right if you're gonna work with robot OS and have your thermostat talk to the their smart home OS
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:08.480]   You're incentivized to work with them because they're not this huge powerhouse
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.320]   So if you say I don't want to share this data you don't have to oh
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:17.240]   I robust still gonna try to build something with it right and I think what we're losing here is
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.360]   the chance to
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:28.760]   jointly develop the next level of integration and services for the smart home in a way that
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.240]   that is in line with
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.680]   More consumer wants more
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:39.920]   Participants and ecosystem wants as opposed to Amazon dictating what that looks like because it has such enormous market power
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:45.360]   Do you think there's any trust law is sufficient to cover this? I mean that's
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:52.720]   That's what like the FTC. So I think I told you all a while back how they asked a bunch of questions about
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.040]   How market power affects salaries how market power affects innovation?
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:57.360]   Oh, yes
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:02.160]   This is very clearly an issue of market power in a deal that could affect innovation
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:10.320]   Proving it would be so hard right but they're trying to build a model for this and this is a good deal to actually throw up against that model and see
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.320]   What sticks yeah?
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:17.400]   You point out that they don't just have room for vacuums. They also bought a eris
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.320]   Which means they now have air purifiers. They have a handheld vacuum
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:26.680]   But I think it's an excellent point by itself I
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.800]   Robot and it's mapping and all these devices don't present
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:37.480]   Particular invasion of privacy and they would be there a lot of panic and media coverage of it
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.320]   There was some concern it was uploading those maps
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:45.120]   But now there's a little and the other part of this is there seems to be a pattern with Amazon
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.320]   What are Amazon's acquisitions? They buy ring doorbell?
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:53.440]   They buy Eero both of these can you know be used to map the house to see what's going on?
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.880]   They put cameras and microphones in your house with Amazon echo
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:03.280]   I even had the Amazon look camera in my closet to review the outfits
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.440]   I wore before I went out of the house and
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:12.320]   You know those are ways to perform services for you and your home. Yes, no absolutely
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:21.080]   But Amazon becomes more than just an e-commerce company when it has all of these disparate forms of data about you
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.080]   I don't know what it means
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:30.080]   Nope nobody really cares what color your pants are or where your coffee. I disagree. No, no, I disagree
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:35.160]   I think they do and I think they might be interested to know that I buy this brand of pants
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:40.320]   They might be interested to know that I have a coffee table, but I don't have a side table
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.320]   I mean, I think there's things I
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.120]   That's where that's where I think that's the so pardon me
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:49.680]   But that's the ego of this is thinking that the ones know that much I
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:57.000]   Will say there is a potential for a potential advantage in this data for shopping
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:04.960]   If you think about running something like AR kit on some sort of mission like being able to pull data about the physical size and
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:09.200]   Location of things in my home into like an AR program. We're not there yet
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:14.720]   But you could see in Roombas do have low-level cameras that see the ceiling
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:19.880]   And they have one that sees the floor so they have I think they have light R2
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:24.920]   I just seems like one more piece of a larger puzzle
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.280]   It does give them a puzzle
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.320]   everyone was like
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:34.760]   Astro and we're like Astro is it for sale yet Astro was their little robot that yeah
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.440]   That's like that was clearly about mapping the house because it did nothing
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.640]   Well
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.400]   Also about your dream. What are you talking about Leo?
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:49.560]   But and it also wanted to know the name of every room so you could say go to the kitchen as the Roomba does
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.680]   And what do you want to see in Amazon has that very?
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:57.680]   I understand and in fact I myself have been taking that tack which is well, what is the harm?
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:02.840]   It's at worst. It's gonna be selling advertising, but I think we are increasingly
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:10.640]   Learning that this data can be weaponized against us and we have a story coming up that shows you very
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:16.720]   Dramatically how the data can be used to weaponize against you and so I think there's a legitimate concern
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:21.440]   Even if I cannot put my finger on how this would be used nefariously
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.840]   The fact that all that data is being collected. They just bought one medical
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:30.480]   Which is you know, there's gonna give them a huge amount of health information
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.800]   They bought pill pack which get you know, they have a pharmacy now
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.680]   It seems to me this is not just a normal
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:43.820]   Amwall mart and I'm gonna sell a lot of stuff kind of growth that there is definitely interest in
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:50.640]   Trying to get into yeah, I just think there's a there's a line that's been drawn and they've crossed that line
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:55.280]   Yeah, you can buy one or two of these different companies that have various services
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.200]   but after it is just
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:03.040]   Continuing to grow and this this piece of pie is getting bigger and bigger and they get in more and more information about us
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:08.280]   I think has warranted for people to be concerned. I mean they're gonna know every day
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:14.280]   I'm thinking and no, I'm not vain enough to think they give a crap about how many orange t-shirts
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:20.720]   I have in my closet, but the fact that they could find that out. That's still a little bit interesting, you know
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:26.320]   If I think you gotta look at great art. Hold on. Let's stay seagull. Yeah, yeah
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:32.820]   And he talks about back in 2014 and Bradstone wrote a book about Amazon it too too excellent
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.600]   Yeah, they're really good
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.800]   But he actually did a great article about this deal
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:43.920]   He brought up the fact that back in 2014 Jeff Bezos and a shareholders letter said Amazon is searching for the fourth pillar
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:49.200]   Right for Amazon that was something that was good for consumers and would also become this huge business for it
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:53.680]   And it didn't have to be it didn't have to do with selling anything online. It could be whatever
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.680]   it's the fourth pillar they wanted and
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:01.560]   Brad makes the case yes that Amazon is still looking for that. It's looking at health
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:06.280]   He doesn't know if the Roomba deal is in smart home really makes sense is the fourth pillar
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:10.040]   So the three pillars are Amazon marketplace their third-party sales
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:17.800]   Amazon Prime which is of course many things and Amazon Web services, which is the number one cloud
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:23.920]   Seller in the world. What's the fourth you see he's saying and Jassy hasn't stopped looking either
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:28.000]   I mean just because Jeff is gone doesn't be Nandy Jassy's not just all around
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.560]   Stacy let me ask you the question this way good good. Well first and we just didn't want to add I think
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.960]   Find asked the question of what they do
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:42.880]   But I think that one has to look at an irregular story framework of say you have to start with the harm the potential harm
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:50.680]   To know what you're guarding against so now let me switch it to Stacy if you were leaning upon and you were being
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:56.280]   Expansive and this deal we're gonna go through what conditions would you want to put on it? I?
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:04.520]   Would want to put conditions on how Amazon interacts with partners that try to integrate with whatever
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:12.280]   Future smart home OS that Amazon develops. So that's a really different take from what we saw on coverage. I like that
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.280]   I mean
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:20.760]   I also think that we should probably have hardcore real rules about data privacy
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:26.720]   Which could cover some things that people are worried about like I know you want to think about harms with like
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:31.240]   Amazon mapping your home and maybe they're not as easy to figure out right now
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:37.080]   But if you think about the sensors that are at the Roomba and you think about a cohesive vision of where people are in the home
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.440]   And what they're doing
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:45.240]   Giving that information out to law enforcement for example is really dicey. Yeah, so there again
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.200]   What are the what are the conditions that you want to put on?
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.240]   So those are not
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:58.560]   Those aren't antitrust that's true me. Those are an antitrust harms those are harms that we need to solve at
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.200]   a macro level across our society
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:10.360]   Related to tech and data like technology companies grabbing and storing and selling data like that's a data marketplace issue
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.840]   But from an antitrust issue
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:20.920]   The like what I said basically how will this deal affect innovation in this space given that we're at such a nascent level
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:27.320]   And you could say like when Zuckerberg bought when Facebook bought Instagram. That was a that was a kill innovation type deal
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:31.480]   It wasn't directly competitive. I think this is that kind of deal. Yeah
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:34.280]   I think you can make a strong case and I hope they do that
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:39.960]   I robot is better for innovation by its standalone than if it's in a giant company
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:48.840]   Like Amazon Bradstone wrote an article a couple of days ago in Bloomberg what amazon's Roomba and one medical deals have in common
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:56.040]   Uh, this came out. Y'all just ate data. Well, but there's an interesting quote in here that actually comes
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:01.640]   Uh from Colin angle who's the founder of iRobot in 2019
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:06.760]   Uh at the remarce conference amazon's remarce conference
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:10.360]   Uh bloomberg. I'm sorry. Um, Bradstone writes
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:17.880]   Uh wearing a very amazonian powered by optimism t-shirt angle talked about making autonomous robots
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:23.400]   Not just vacuum cleaners, but autonomous robots that implicitly understand their environment
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.640]   And can respond to queries and anticipate the needs of their owners
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:34.680]   The goal is to turn the house into a robot. He said yes giving it sensors giving it actuators
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:40.520]   Giving it the ability to take care of the people who live in the house and with an appropriate combination of ai voice
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:46.280]   Understanding and spatial understanding this gives amazon the the third part of that
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:51.080]   We create a home where you live your life and it just does the right thing
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:56.840]   It's a very interesting idea of home automation instead of a robot standing at the sink doing your dishes
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:01.560]   The home is itself the robot with different ways of actuating
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:08.920]   And and it's all tied together and so Brad's making the case that there are there are two possibilities for this fourth
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:15.560]   Pillar one is health care, but he says that's complicated. There's a lot of regulation. The other is home automation
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:18.200]   and particular this vision of
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:26.840]   A smart home that's that really is smart doesn't just how about another one leo. Yeah when I saw this deal my first thought was
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:32.600]   Uh, and I had part of the purpose of the pillar, but that this was inside and outside the home
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:36.120]   Business to consumer and business to business robots
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:43.800]   That that amazon could become could count in its in its factories in its drones in its delivery trucks
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.760]   that um
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:54.680]   A physical robot service structure as opposed to a data structure, which is google or a social structure, which is facebook and twitter
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.200]   Uh, is there a larger robotics industry?
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.880]   Piece here. Who else is big besides boss dynamics?
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.520]   Who else out there?
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:08.120]   Uh, is big in robotics. It's in fact
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:14.680]   It's a philosophical thing because in the early days of computing we thought well the computers get bigger and bigger and bigger and smarter and smarter and smarter
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.040]   And what turned out it was computing at the edge, which is smaller computers everywhere in everything
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:24.680]   And I think robotics may turn out to be that instead of yeah a smarter smarter bigger bigger robot
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.000]   There's little things doing little bits like a
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.880]   I robot and all over the inside and outside your home. Yeah at work
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:36.840]   If you go to the story that I wrote back in when astro came out
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.120]   I
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:42.840]   Create I wrote a story all about how the smart home is a robot like the whole home is a robot
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.240]   in again like Colin angle was saying
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.680]   um
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.360]   The idea there
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:53.080]   And it makes a ton of sense because I have seen so many demonstrations of robots
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:54:00.440]   When you deal with general purpose or every road there's no such thing as a good general purpose robot. We're not going to have a rosy
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.280]   because
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:07.160]   Robots aren't smart enough. They don't have the physical dexterity. We need for all that. So what we will have
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.960]   Yeah, if you scroll. Yeah, there it is. Oh, hey
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:17.080]   Um the smart home doesn't need a robot figures on the pulse. It should be a robot. Whoops. Yeah, I grab the wrong one and
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:20.680]   Yeah, so so that's in
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:25.960]   I love this. That's exactly what we were saying. Yeah, that's really interesting
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:31.240]   And so and it's cheaper because you're going to assemble the robot you need and you need it to talk to
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:36.440]   You know, so it's robot at the s y the os matters so much to your point states
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:40.920]   That's why the os otherwise you can't have interoperability. Otherwise you're going to get stuck in
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:49.480]   Living in somebody's wall guard. Yeah. Yeah best explanation yet of what amazon's up to yeah, and and bradstone goes on to say
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:56.360]   Uh both the iRobot and one medical acquisition share a final attribute and almost breathtaking disregard for the trust busters
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:00.520]   Particularly head of the us federal trade commission lina con
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.560]   uh, he says
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.440]   jesse probably feels confident that
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:11.800]   The law is on their side and so the quest for this fourth pillar justifies
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.280]   the risk
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:18.360]   It is going to be I mean it would be a you know, it's interesting because she overruled
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.840]   Just recently overruled the staff at the ftc to go after meta
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:31.160]   over its acquisition of within which is a vr health thing and if that's she's going after then this is a much bigger deal
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:33.160]   Yeah
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:41.960]   The lawsuit stone rights shows her willingness to break recent tradition and block mergers that don't necessarily lead to any competitive dominance now
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:45.560]   But which could hypothetically do so in the future that's very
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.760]   Longer sense to be attitude towards antitrust. That's very interesting
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:51.480]   But can she do it and will she be allowed to do it
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:55.080]   Right. That's the question. I mean jesse any
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.240]   Well, will she look at it this well to avoid this?
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:00.200]   Well, I think she is looking at it this way. I mean that's the
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:05.320]   Evidence that she she went after within even though staff said nah, there's nothing here
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:11.240]   So maybe what I'm saying is do you see but she's got to get the courts to back or she can't do it by herself
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.080]   I think stacy's
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:19.560]   Regulatory view is a really smart and insightful view, but i'm not sure that's the way that's not the political view the political
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.560]   I agree. Oh my god. They have data
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:27.880]   And by the way, you one other thing about that is you can have too much data. It can become so meaningless
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:35.880]   And I remember the early days of the net when the times New York Times had 28 data points and it used one of them
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:38.120]   Right about a reuser
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:41.320]   Um, and and so you know, I think these companies
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.960]   I think amazon meta google
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:48.920]   I think are sophisticated enough to have lots of data points
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:53.800]   And yeah, but i'm just saying there's no reason why gurl is oh my god. We're gonna map every room
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:57.000]   I don't see them sitting in a room with a whiteboard saying that's
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:05.320]   Our goal I think stacy's view and your view about the the home as robot the home as full service is much more interesting
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:09.320]   strategically maybe but there you have to have that data to do that
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:11.640]   Right. You have to know
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:14.280]   And there may be they may be acting on faith a little bit like well
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:17.480]   You know, we've seen in the past we get enough data together
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:22.360]   Synergies happen, uh, they may not know exactly what they're going to do with it
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:26.440]   Remember how bad they say they may not know what they're going to do with it
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:29.320]   Yeah, but they just know it's good to have it
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:34.120]   Right. I was gonna say would this all be okay had amazon said at the press release
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:36.680]   We're interested in this because we plan on doing
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:43.400]   ABCD that's going to help us with basically making your smart your home even smarter. Yeah, it might have been smart to do that on the edge
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:49.880]   You know, yeah, it would all of this not even be a big discussion instead of letting us connect the dots in in ways that are unfair
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:54.840]   I think you're right. Right probably would have been better. Stacy go ahead. You know, interesting part of this too though
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:59.320]   Is that okay? So so let's go with the home as robot and
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:07.480]   Amazon as a primary, but not the only player and let's imagine that they play nice even that the amazon brand the trust needed
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:14.840]   There becomes pretty tremendous. Well, and that we drive the privacy issues. Look what happened when they announced sidewalk
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:21.560]   Uh, and they said oh by the way you ring doorbells and your echo devices. They're all building this uh low ran low raw network
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.520]   Uh all over the world
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:31.320]   And I think there was a bit of pushback. Although I suspect that that kind of you know our short attention span allowed that to blow over and they
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:38.920]   They continue to build a sidewalk. Yes, and Stacy didn't object. Yeah, we're looking remember. Yeah, I actually don't object to sidewalk, but that's okay
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:45.720]   But I mean when you put it all together. They have a mesh of what's going on inside the home. They have a mesh of what's going outside the home
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:51.320]   They have a lot of data. I mean, I I agree. I don't I don't know what nefarious use they're gonna put it too
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.320]   But I just worry that's a lot of data
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:58.440]   If you're that worried then you need to think about a macro data policy because we're not gonna
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:02.040]   Because we insist on connecting things to the internet
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:09.000]   We're generating data and that data then becomes useful to someone and someone's going to try to use it
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.960]   So we have to set rules around how we want that used
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:15.960]   And that's what's frustrating. We cannot do it on a case by case basis
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:20.280]   This is not a lena conscience. Stop this because of the data kind of issue
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:29.880]   It's hey, we should have a bipartisan effort to create a privacy policy and legislation that deals with the fact that everything we own
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.520]   Is collecting data and we can't
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:35.480]   We don't have parameters around what they can do with it
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:40.760]   So like I triple E spectrum just did a thing about what your tesla knows about you
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:46.200]   I don't know if you saw those three stories last week they were excellent and they don't want you on to know what to think about me
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.120]   uh-uh
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:55.240]   It talks about, you know that tesla's picking up gps data about where you go and think about like what facebook just
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.960]   given over law enforcement data on someone who
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:03.800]   Had a potential abortion think about if the feds in texas or the texas
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.800]   uh
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:09.400]   Attorney general goes after elan for data on people who've been
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:16.040]   You know driving over state lines and at a certain abortion clinic. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So that is like
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:21.080]   We are beyond the point where we need to look at this and set regulatory rules
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:24.680]   But this deal isn't scary because of that this deal is just another
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:28.920]   Example of one big player gathering more data
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:34.920]   Tesla may be an example of having too much data to do anything with it
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:39.240]   You know, I think tesla just collects it
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:44.680]   Just in case you know there's a lawsuit or something we can we can we can say oh no no it was turned off
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.840]   And so forth, I don't know I do want to talk about the
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.880]   I think appalling
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.520]   story
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.040]   Facebook story
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:02.120]   Because I think yeah, Paul in frightening the more we hear government using this data against its citizens
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.680]   The more I get concerned about the collection of this data regardless of what the you know the
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:12.360]   Interest is of amazon or any other company the fact that is being collected could be
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:17.240]   Potentially hazardous to your health, but before we do that, let's take a little break
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:23.880]   So fun to have Stacy back you see what the show we need Stacy to explain all this stuff to us
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:30.440]   He is a crazy person to rail against wall street and yell it y'all. I'm sorry by the way
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:35.960]   Thanks to Bill Gates. I now know that pickleball was invented on Bainbridge Island
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.800]   Oh, yeah in Washington state just made it our national
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.760]   Sport our state sport
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:52.120]   Today is the beginning of the founders tournament, which is is Andrew performing in the founders tournament
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:56.360]   No, because we're about to leave to go visit colleges from my kid
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.720]   Last year he referee
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:05.320]   The quads and the libraries where they all could get books. What's from the library? What schools are you visiting?
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.240]   This particular one is to Oregon and we're gonna go to
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:13.480]   Read in Lewis and clock ducks. We know many ducks
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:19.720]   Uh the coast or south or staying in the region you think
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.040]   Wait, what?
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:25.480]   Daughter planning to stay in the region or do you see airline?
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.320]   You're playing rides in your future
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.040]   So we're definitely airplaneing because my child is
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:35.480]   Well, they want possibly to go to spain to go to college. They're looking at
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.040]   They're like, baby. I should go to k-bridge and i'm like

[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:51.320]   Just believe me they know what they say and I are planning to retire in your fair state
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:55.800]   And we may take the fairy over to play pickleball at the fattorskord
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:59.880]   I actually when I heard about all of this and bill gate saying yeah
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:03.960]   I played pickleball and when I was a kid because he's from the area
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:10.200]   Uh, I I actually pulled up a video of the rules of pickleball air played it to the big screen in the living room
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.280]   Made lisa watch it and then ordered bless our heart a pickleball
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:21.240]   Kit includes four wiffle ball my and two brackets and I said lisa we've got a cart just down the row
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.320]   We're gonna play pickleball
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:30.280]   It's still sitting in the mud room waiting to go. It is so fun. Is it fun such a it's fun
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:34.920]   It's such an easy access for it's easy and it's it's good for oldsters like me
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:42.920]   It's actually like when Andrew plays he he takes like 25,000 steps he gets sweaty
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:48.360]   Oh Andrew's about a killer at it, right? Yeah, I'm not playing with people like Andrew and it's is it always doubles
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:54.520]   It's I believe so. Yeah, it's couples. I've never I was like I've never you never played it
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:06:01.000]   I myself no, no, I've never played it by myself. It's always a couple as a couple. Yeah, it's a good couple activity. Well, I'm out
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.160]   Andrew will play with me queen prue it ain't called play pickleball
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:09.240]   No, you know, it's more like I'm not playing with her
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:14.680]   That's what my husband's like. I'm like, hey, can we go play and he's like
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.240]   Oh, not on my team's
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.440]   Can't wait our show today
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:26.920]   Show today brought to you by cash flight
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.040]   I'm gonna call queen prue tell her about pickleball
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:36.440]   How do we know the cash fly is amazing? We know you we know because we've been using them for more than a decade
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:42.760]   In fact, twit wouldn't exist if cash flight didn't exist remember the early days of twitter I was trying to use like aol
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:49.000]   And to deliver the the shows in it, you know, we just it was hard. It was a horrible experience
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   We had shows all over the place because I couldn't afford the bandwidth plus so many people were downloading it would never work and
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.600]   Then matt levine one of the fatter's cash flight cults said leo
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:05.720]   I could solve this problem and they did boy. Did they cash fly has been delivering when you listen when you download our podcasts
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:10.920]   When you watch our shows when you listen to our shows you're getting them from the best
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:16.760]   CDN in the world cash fly content delivery network and now cash flight does video
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:19.480]   live streaming video
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:28.760]   Your content can be scaled virtually infinitely you can go live in hours not days and their video they call it ultra low latency video streaming
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:33.560]   Latency up less than a second. I don't even know how they do that
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:41.080]   Ditch that unreliable web rtc solution for their web socket live video workflow that's scalable
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.040]   to millions of users
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:50.120]   Unbelievable and with cash fly you can reach your audience anywhere in the world 50 plus locations around the globe
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:58.600]   Content is delivered closer to your customers outperforming local CDNs and I mean when I say outperforming I mean it they're 10 times faster than traditional methods
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:02.760]   They're on six continents 30 percent faster than other major CDNs
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:05.240]   98 hit cash hit ratio
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:10.600]   100 availability in the last 12 months not not any number of 9s 100

[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:07.320]   I told the story a hundred times tell it what's for
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:11.320]   All right, yeah, yeah, yeah five oh pound
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.960]   the summer 1965 and that fateful weekend when um
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:25.080]   The game. Why was it a fateful weekend? That was my question. Yeah. Oh my god. The world changed in 1965
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:28.840]   It was a spontaneous
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:35.800]   Convention sounds like the kids were sent up to play on a
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.640]   Bannon
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:44.040]   Bavinton cork with ping pong paddles and what you would call a quiffle ball. This was because they were
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:50.120]   Stuffing go out there and I'm taking exactly that get out of the house and
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.040]   also porch kids
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:59.320]   Delphine up there sitting and saw what they were doing and
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:04.440]   No ping pong paddles and whipping from them. That's how it started. Yeah, and
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.760]   Start playing that tracks a series of arguments
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:17.000]   I like how he's starting to go into southern baptist
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   Said
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:27.960]   Tell us about how you then became the paddle designer. Okay, okay. No, no, we'll just save this for later
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:35.960]   But wait wait, what else what does number 50? What are 1 through 49? Oh, there's a lot of history
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:39.080]   You're right. I think it's a big bridge island have to go back there
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:44.840]   It's a big island. I didn't realize how big it was till we sailed by it on our cruise ship is a big
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:47.320]   I remember when the 7/11 came in
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.920]   Okay, so you know about because that doesn't fit here
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:59.480]   In all seriousness one of the best things to go to for anyone on vane bridge island is the japanese internment memorial. Oh, yes
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:06.520]   Because oh, yes, washington state I think has actually done a really good job and we as an entire country could take
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:11.000]   Take a note there or in terms of acknowledging how
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:16.120]   poorly we treated people because of their race and
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:19.400]   acknowledge it
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.520]   Incorporated into our own teachings. I mean like everybody
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:27.880]   Here knows about that and it's part of like the fabric of who
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:34.440]   Washingtonians think they are there were a lot of good or no a lot of japanese americans in washington state
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.520]   uh
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:41.640]   And uh in bane bridge the first ones left from bane bridge island because they had a huge japanese
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.720]   Like our elementary school is called sakai huge japanese population
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:49.080]   And actually it's really nice like yes, there were obviously
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:55.080]   It's a terrible thing to happen, but like people on the island actually like farmed
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:13:04.520]   Land for their people for the japanese immigrants who were citizens actually who were interned and then gave it back to them when they came home
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.960]   like
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:11.480]   It's a very moving and it's a it's a wonderful exhibit. Sorry. I'm like so I know there's something
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.480]   in there about that, but I really think we should have that all over like for slavery and
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.960]   I agree. This is a dark spot on our nation's history
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:25.800]   uh friend of the family jenny houston wrote a book about her internment fairwell to manzanar, which is
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:31.000]   Uh a must read highly recommend it. Uh, it's the story of her and her family
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.880]   Uh in uh in manzanar the internment camp
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.440]   Um with her husband james houston is very well known novelist
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:44.920]   Very well written fascinating story. Yeah, I'm you know what that's a very good point. Uh stacey
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.440]   Um
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.360]   That's a that is an important part of history
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.840]   Oh, yeah, yeah
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:54.840]   And how do they know where there's japanese people were they were all on facebook
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:59.240]   Mm
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:03.560]   There was you know, there's a famous story. Uh, I think it was in the netherlands
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:06.120]   where uh
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:10.120]   And this is to me the cautionary tale about being too free with information
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:14.040]   Where the census would record everybody's religion
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.880]   Right
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:21.160]   And it at the time no big deal till the nazis took over and then those
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.320]   documents
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.640]   Were potentially what they would use to round up jewish citizens
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:31.000]   The mayors of at least one town burned those
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   records
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.800]   Uh before the nazis could get a hold of them, but that's a book called mercury pictures presents right now
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:43.400]   Which is which is kind of interesting fun novel and uh, there's a italian
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:50.600]   Um emigre is is the central character and the italian newspaper in los angeles
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:55.480]   Burned all its copies so that it wouldn't be used to round up
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.760]   And in the enemy aliens in world war two. Yep
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:03.880]   So we got to remember, uh, you know, it might seem completely innocuous to
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:06.680]   record somebody's religion in a census
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:10.840]   But uh, there is potential risk and that brings us
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.880]   Uh to the mother board story that just got my ire. Yep. Yeah
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:22.040]   Mother board has obtained court documents to show facebook gave police course. It was a subpoena was a lawful
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.120]   subpoena
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.960]   Uh teenagers private chats about her abortion these were
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.600]   Private facebook message her mother chats with her mother mother
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:38.120]   17 year old girl has now been charged, uh with felonies three felonies
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:43.560]   Including performing an abortion that uh more than 20 weeks performing abortion by non-licensed doctor
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:49.160]   Uh and removing concealing a dead human body you might argue that that fetus is not a dead human body
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:52.840]   But that's not what the law says. She's being tried as an adult
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.800]   She's in lincoln, nebraska
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:59.720]   Um because she used a medical medication
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:03.480]   Uh to abort a fetus in nebraska
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:09.320]   Um, she was 28 weeks pregnant, which is of course illegal in many states
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:12.760]   That late term of an abortion, but nonetheless
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:16.120]   Uh those those messages and mother board got the messages
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.800]   Um
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:22.280]   And uh, there was a court approved search warrant facebook complied with it as they are
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.640]   required to do although I know facebook google app and leathers talk about how they fight these twitter
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.720]   How they fight was this well, so there's a story I put in below leo
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:38.360]   Uh, I haven't even read it yet. I just found it facebook parent meta defends itself after turning over private messages claimed
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:41.080]   It never was told the investigation was related to an abortion
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:44.040]   so
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:50.920]   Is that man is one told in a subpoena what it's related to and and should these companies henceforth say we're gonna
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.360]   Whatever it is we're gonna fight you just to push out
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:59.320]   The issue we're not gonna handle over anything now until we until we have that information, right?
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:05.160]   Yeah, when you get a subpoena you're offered a case number, but you're not necessarily told
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:11.880]   I mean, right presumably when you get a subpoena you call a lawyer and the lawyer looks up the case number so that you know what you're being like
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.240]   why but
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:18.680]   It's also an abdication of facebook's duty in any like this is not a
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.720]   Protector of your data, right?
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.320]   If you received a subpoena you would be like holy cow a subpoena
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:30.520]   I shall call my lawyer and my lawyer will act in my best interest looking up the case facebook doesn't do any of that
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.520]   They're just like oh a subpoena okay here
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:37.560]   So it's a little disingenuous for them to be like, oh, we didn't know what it was about of course they don't they don't care
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:41.720]   Okay, that's all once but are they wrong in turning it over?
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:47.000]   I think they should have their job. Yeah here here's the here's the the facebook
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.040]   The warrants did not mention abortion at all
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:58.120]   But get hit this court documents indicate the police were at the time investigating the alleged illegal burning and burial of a stillborn
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:05.080]   Infantation about yeah, the warrants were accompanied by non-disclosure orders, which prevented us from sharing information about them
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.720]   The orders have now been lifted
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:10.440]   You know
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.680]   Once when you have horrible laws in the country
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:18.440]   Then you know I always say that government is not the protector of privacy. It is the worst threat to privacy. This is the case
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:21.080]   Uh, and what do we expect?
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:26.920]   The platform is to do this case where a mother and daughter are using it for a discussion. It's also the case where
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:33.720]   We need privacy legislation and I will agree and we're having written the
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:40.040]   um right to privacy and communication to a technology known as the letter
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.680]   Was limiting it should have been
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:47.480]   They could not have communication they could not have offered a warrant to search that
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:54.680]   From to the postal service, right? They couldn't couldn't grab that letter. They could do a warrant. They could do a warrant. Yes
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:19:00.200]   That's the problem with this. Yeah, okay. You can you can but but um, but then what's the
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.520]   um
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:05.800]   That's the point. It's it's it's warranted not warrant less
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:09.560]   Uh, and that's the protection you get to to to mail
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:13.640]   But that's the problem here. You have a really bad law a really bad government
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.920]   Um and and no protection of privacy
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.000]   um
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.880]   Facebook dms of taping by law enforcement were then used as the main basis for a second search warrant
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:28.840]   In which 13 laptops and smart phones are seized from the bridges is 24 gigabytes of data
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:35.160]   Including images messages and web histories from their phone were extracted for the case. So that has a lot of laptops
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:39.480]   That's a lot of ways. So well, it might have been who knows how broad the net was
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:45.880]   They might have gotten everybody every relative. I don't know real laptop. Yeah, I got I got old laptop here
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:50.120]   The moral of this is and this really relates to privacy concerns
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:54.840]   If you're going to do something you shouldn't send a message on facebook
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:59.720]   Uh or any mechanism or any mechanism you shouldn't run on a laptop. You shouldn't do a google search
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:02.680]   Uh shouldn't text shouldn't text
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:08.360]   Um because all of that is available and all of it's collected and all of it uh can be
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:10.920]   subpoenaed
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.920]   By cord or sucks. Yeah
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:16.680]   Or you could just say hey encrypt everything and then
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:21.000]   No one can well and this is exactly why every government
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.800]   In the developed world is fighting encryption including our own
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:30.520]   Uh because they don't like it that not everything is available to them all the time
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:33.160]   What do you want presumed by the way
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:39.880]   That the texts that were exchanged in the secret service and dod and whoever the third one was
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:43.800]   phones were on an encrypted method or just
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.640]   open
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.320]   texting
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.320]   So you can encrypt
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:56.520]   Can you encrypt in facebook in facebook messenger? And I guess not what's app you can what's app you can and it's strong encryption
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:00.760]   Um, you'd be better off using signal if you ask me
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:05.640]   Uh, that's really the only solution. I know of that, you know, or we say a phone call
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:12.280]   Well, is even not a wire test too, right? But they'd have to have our microphones in your home. Yeah
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:17.640]   Think you have to do what steve gibson always says which is you go out in the middle of a field naked
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:22.280]   And you you make sure that there's no one within a thousand feet
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:27.720]   No mosquitoes and then you whisper in the person's ear and they whisper in your ear and you just you know
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:33.880]   That's the best you can do but you now but you've now told someone else and so you have lost control over to that extent that person
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:42.520]   That's what she was driving trump crazy right now because the latest reports are that it was someone inside mar-a-lago who said there's more stuff in the safe
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:46.280]   Wow, and so now he's paranoid about everyone around him
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:50.280]   And there's a new ad out today that's trying to make him even more paranoid. We're just kind of fun
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:54.920]   Isn't that what you didn't he say that you only played the fifth if you've done something wrong
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:02.280]   And it isn't the case often that uh, you know criminals will often say oh yeah, it's overreach
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:07.800]   Oh, yeah government overreach. Oh, they planted evidence in my place right right right?
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:12.920]   Anyway messenger does have secret conversations end to end encryption built in
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:20.760]   So uh the mother and daughter probably not thinking that what they were doing needed to be hidden that well
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:26.440]   Although they were clearly aware of guilt, which is gonna I think if you know be impactful in their trial
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:29.640]   Um, you know, they were definitely going tell anybody that kind of thing
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:35.560]   Uh, it's not the sort of thing you I mean if you're gonna do a late-term abortion
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:41.160]   You know, that's kind of already know you already know you're in trouble. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yep
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:48.440]   Uh, this is a harbinger of awful things to come. That's my that's I think the main issue
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:56.120]   Is this is this is a prosecution against the actual person in most of the abortion
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:02.360]   Laws are actually like that were worried about in the wake of dogs. There's no doctor here. That's why it was a
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:11.080]   Right, but yeah is against doctors or other people not the actual mother. So actually uh, the mother is charged
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.960]   Uh the daughter is charged and
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:19.000]   Uh a 22 year old a man is charged with attempting to conceal the death of another person
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.120]   Because he helped them dispose of the fetus
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:25.880]   So
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:31.160]   Um, well this had been illegal because of the the the term I think because of 28. Yes. What are you?
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:35.000]   I think yes, and if you can't actually
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.480]   Barry
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.600]   Body
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:43.560]   So the term would have been a problem here in the us but also I think how the fetus is supposed to
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.800]   Of a fetus. So let's just do it. That is
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:50.600]   A thought experiment if if we read this story two months ago before dot
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:54.200]   It would which it and it would still have been a crime
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.280]   It still would have been a crime of the bear
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:00.760]   It probably would have had a somewhat muted but similar reaction of uh, other things could happen
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:10.040]   But this is this is under the law a crime and the war it was well because in many states now, uh, it's a crime after uh, 20 weeks
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:13.240]   So
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:18.280]   For six weeks depending on whether you're in texas, uh, as a result
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:25.880]   The same exact process could be used against you for you know taking plan b after six weeks
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:30.120]   And that's the one they also said that they had a miscarriage
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:37.240]   And so one of the challenges is you can't medically a stillbirth or it abortion
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:40.920]   Can look the same as a miscarriage right here technically
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:45.320]   So what what law enforcement will do is they're going to start looking
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:51.080]   When you have a miscarriage they're going to look for things that indicate that it wasn't actually a natural miscarriage
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:55.080]   Right, so in this case they found it by going to facebook, right
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:00.760]   It's just sad
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:06.200]   Yeah, but and again a cautionary tale now that we live in an age where even six weeks is
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.960]   Yeah, too soon
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.120]   Yes, and most people don't know they're pregnant
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.880]   That that quickly because you're not actually pregnant at six weeks, right?
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:16.440]   You've got a zygote. You missed your
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:19.720]   Well, you don't even have that. I mean the first two weeks they
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:26.040]   They track a pregnancy the first four weeks of a pregnancy are from your last missed period
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.000]   So
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.680]   You haven't even had a for two of those weeks there actually isn't anything happening nothing happens right right?
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:37.000]   This firm has not yet met the egg. So it doesn't even exist. It's
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000]   rather
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.840]   Uh, and you know however you feel about
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:46.760]   Go ahead. It's just a why
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:51.960]   Oh, that was an angry that was not you were okay. There was a roar. I was trying to
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:58.040]   I am woman hear me roar, right? Okay. No, it's I am woman. I am filled with rage
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:02.200]   Idiacy and yeah
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.920]   But even if you are
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:08.120]   Pro life or if you're against abortion and any kind
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:13.560]   There is cost for concern that governments could then use these kinds of subpoenas to look through your
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:18.680]   All kinds of things. Yeah, you see it with immigration roundups all the time
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:21.880]   They've had contracts and they get information from facebook
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:26.680]   Before serving their warrants and trying to track people who they wanted to port
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:31.080]   Well, it's a c2
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:35.240]   Because the laws in some states say that anybody can sue anybody over this
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:39.960]   Then somebody's gonna hack your phone for the purposes
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:46.280]   You know if you're suspicious of you and say I got the evidence and I'm gonna sue you for having done this and make money
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:49.480]   Try you with bounty hunters
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:51.960]   Yeah, amen
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:59.000]   What is it Joe and our um, discourse at facebook should enable what's up style in an encryption and messenger
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:02.200]   Now in our caps, why would they do that?
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:08.280]   Uh, that's an interesting question. Uh, that is a good question. Yeah by by default
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:13.480]   Yeah, why would yeah, they have the power. Yeah, and we don't want to be stuck in this
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:15.960]   We don't want to get we don't want to get any of this on us
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:22.040]   We don't want to be in a position. So that's more it's like facebook saying enough with news enough with subpoenas
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:26.120]   To what are what people were presuming our private conversations?
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:32.280]   I don't know if he did this on purpose or not, but there was a uh, indian lawmaker
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.600]   Yeah, do you remember you you saw this story who?
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:43.800]   When the indian assembly considered the law against uh abortion
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:48.440]   Said well, you all should outlaw. Yeah, ed drugs
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:51.080]   Yeah, because yep
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:55.320]   Some may thinks this is a joke but it takes it takes two for a pregnancy to come about
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:58.360]   And to put all the onus on a woman. I think it's unfair
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.720]   So let's make uh needless to say
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:06.440]   The law against uh vivhayra did not pass
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:10.040]   Did not pass but the abortion band did
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:14.520]   john Bartlett of uh indiana of indianapolis
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.920]   Uh, all right
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:20.520]   Where else do we go?
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.880]   Google is sad per light somewhere. Well, this is lightish
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:30.760]   Google uh, apparently according to blunberg the doj is preparing to sue google
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:34.840]   Uh, as soon as next month over uh ad markets the prosecutor
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:38.440]   Prosecutors are now conducting fresh rounds of interviews with
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:45.080]   Who would be harmed by google and their ads? Oh publishers publisher
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.480]   Lobby yes. Yeah, yeah, we go so um
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:53.960]   According to people familiar with the matter the u.s. justice department for any sue google
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:56.360]   capping years of work to build a case
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:03.000]   That the alphabet unit illegally dominates the digital advertising market
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.160]   That'll be an interesting trial
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.800]   Does it is it is it too powerful?
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:13.000]   I have always said that google's
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:19.320]   Achilles heel here has always been it's dominant as an advertising always it's not it's not search
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:22.120]   It's not anything else
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:24.120]   And once they bought double click
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.880]   They were
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:30.760]   Pretty darn powerful now they didn't have complete pricing control, but they took pieces of
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:38.200]   Of transactions. They knew what was going along the way now. Meanwhile. I find it interesting that apple which failed at advertising
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:43.000]   And then made that bug into a feature saying where are the privacy company?
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:50.040]   Because we don't care about advertising apple. There's a story in the rundown in the lower part that they're now hiring people
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:55.080]   It looks like to create google like ad networks because they probably smell the weakness here
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:30:00.600]   They've been beefing up in fact ads have added ads to other areas of apple
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:07.400]   Properties like the app store and so forth in there looking now according to digi-day for a senior manager
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:13.000]   For a dsp and its ads platforms businesses. I'm not sure what dsp
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.760]   stands for digital something
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:22.360]   Whoever gets a job will be asked to quote drive the design of the most privacy forward
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:28.920]   Oh, here's what dsp stands for of the most privacy forward sophisticated demand side platform possible
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:33.960]   So we want to show you ads, but we want to make sure no one else knows what we know
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.840]   Um
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:39.560]   A dsp is a statement of a tent for any ads business
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:46.760]   Let alone one like apple which has grown exponentially on the back of its decision to make it harder for companies to grow their own
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.160]   Within the apple ecosystem
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:53.320]   Apple has all that first party data
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:57.240]   Shame you don't oh
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:08.040]   Did you see this okay? This is this is crazy. So google I think this is gonna backfire on them google has created a web page
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:14.200]   Get the message it's time for apple to fix texting
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:22.760]   It's not about the color of the bubbles. It's the blurry videos broken group chats missing read receipts and typing indicators
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:24.760]   No texting over wifi and more
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:33.720]   These problems exist because apple refuses to adopt modern texting standards when people with iphones and android phones text each other
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:39.080]   Uh, and then you're apples fault. No, well
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:42.280]   Google said I mean they didn't adopt an industry standard
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:46.040]   They didn't adopt rcs, which I think a lot of people realize is kind of crappy
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:49.800]   Uh, it took a long time to get the phone companies to adopt it
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:52.520]   and um
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:56.440]   So they're hashtag get the message they're trying to get people to pressure apple
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:02.280]   I don't every single apple every iphone user is gonna just laugh and say no, that's fine. I don't want right
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:07.480]   They don't know because the user is a totally happy with them. I'm very happy with messages
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:11.800]   Inside of it. You're not in the group. I can text you too bad
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:16.920]   I can text you just because you know your cult bubber color is different doesn't mean anything. I can text you
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:19.720]   Is a great tweet. I can't see that videos though
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:27.240]   Oh, yeah, you can you can't see the videos. They're crappy. They're like these tiny sad videos
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:34.760]   They're anytime my friend sends me a video over text. I that's because it's doing it over sms and mms
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:42.360]   Right and that's really more limit bandwidth limitations and barriers. Oh and pose. Yes. Well, but if they had a standard they could do it differently
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:45.560]   Yeah, they could they could exact squares
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:51.960]   Zach's weir's tweets. Yeah google colon. You need to finally standardize your messaging app apple
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:54.520]   Sorry, I missed that message. Did you send it on alo?
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:33:00.120]   For its hangouts google wallet google pay or google wallet
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.880]   say
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.880]   Yeah, oops
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:11.320]   So, uh, what do you think is this? Um ants is going to convince uh apple apple can go
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:16.840]   Oh, yeah, apple is just going to keep on rolling on to the bank and and their users going to continue to be happy
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.360]   being
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:23.880]   being the top group in all all three of you are android users right not apple
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:27.000]   I'm an i'm an i'll be the google. Yeah
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:32.120]   Um, I have both. I have a pixel six and a horse you to follow me, but uh
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:39.320]   I actually go to great lengths and it's pain in the butt to allow me to get apple messages on my pixel phone
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:42.760]   I have to run a server at home called air messages
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:49.720]   Jeez that runs on a mac at home and then I have an air messages client on my iphone on my pixel phone
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.800]   So that I can get these messages and I have to say the messaging platform
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:34:01.560]   On android is very confusing. Should I use android messages? Should I use samsung messages? Yes, those messages should I use
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.280]   It's not a clear choice
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:12.040]   As long as the sms is getting to me i'm happy, you know, sometimes it doesn't normal to see the whole
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:19.400]   So-and-so light whatever message I sent to him, you know, I get that I get the thumbs up now
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:23.480]   I didn't actually now gives it to you
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:30.600]   Gives what I didn't even oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They'll show you the thumbs up. I also can and you can run
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:35.160]   I am a fi user so I can get my fi messages
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:37.560]   In a web application on the iphone
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:43.960]   So I just made that an icon and then it I have all my so I've managed on both phones to get messages
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:48.120]   From your tech guy. It's not a fun thing on either
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:55.000]   Guy that the average consumer is not doing any of that. No and the average consumer doesn't know what our cs is either new to say
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.160]   And if they did they might not be so sanguine about the idea of
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:05.480]   Replacing apples messages with rcs. I can't wait to have this conversation on mac break weekly
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:07.480]   I'm having a feeling I'm
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:13.080]   Then we're just gonna get one big gefa from the apple users the snobs
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:15.160]   Yeah
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:19.000]   Yeah, see I didn't say snobs. I said just the elite group
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.440]   I saw apple should fix what's broken
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:28.280]   The bad experience you get when texting and read users is created by apple. Yeah, and we don't care
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000]   No, how much you so what?
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:38.520]   I thought you fix was broken google. Yeah, why don't you all just start use iphones for crying out loud and then that's how we solve that
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:41.480]   Stop using all these silly android devices
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:50.280]   You want a good experience go apple only my daughter and our family are my may family uses android
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.920]   Everybody else uses messages
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:55.400]   Why does she use it? She doesn't like
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:02.920]   iPhones she really likes android phones. I always know the adults here in this house are android and everybody else's ios
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:09.320]   And hey, whatever I have at it. I'm alone here. We can but we can message each other
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:13.000]   Right. Well, I mean, that's why I have slack. Yeah
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:22.360]   Yeah, by the way the real answer to this is to use what's app or slack or any number or discord or any number of message gms signal
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:26.280]   Yeah, there's lots of ways. Yeah, you can DM over twitter all sorts of stuff
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:31.000]   Um, I was mentioned here in the discord that we should also
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:39.640]   Mention that google was on all about android yesterday. Yes. They talked about this page yesterday and all about android
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:46.600]   Uh, I haven't yet watched that yet, but i'm sure they had lots of high and mighty righteous proclamations to make
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:51.560]   It's just I was partly involved. I was partly involved with the
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:59.160]   The tech check test that we do for our guests appearing mr. Birkin. I played around with messages. Yeah
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:05.640]   Whatever what is the cause of called hangouts or what? I don't know what is that we don't even know anymore. Hang on. It's gone
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:08.760]   It's called android messages
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:12.280]   Um
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:13.720]   Honestly
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:20.280]   I agree it would be a much better world if we could all just agree on one platform and since apple's is apple only
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:26.440]   Okay, maybe make it telegram or signal signal be a good choice. Let's just everybody use signal
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:33.880]   Uh, in fact all the only thing apple really has to do is allow you to change the default messaging
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:37.240]   Program, you have to use apples messages on an iphone
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:43.880]   If they did as android does let you choose a third party messaging platform as your official sms
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.640]   Receiver that would solve it then we'd all use signal
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:50.360]   And maybe done
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:53.800]   Freedom of choice is awesome, but boy it's it's a bit of a mess
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:59.640]   Yeah apple doesn't fall well in it's it's not what apple sells apple sells easy to use. That's right
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:05.560]   That's a good point. Thank you. Yep figuring out which messaging program. That's not easy. No, that's a good point
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.800]   Excellent point
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.800]   Uh google is suing sonos
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.600]   Over uh boy they everything
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:16.280]   All thing
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.040]   Soot them and then sort of one and now google's like, you know what we got money we're coming out
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:28.520]   And two lawsuits filed monday in the u.s district court in california google alleges sonos his latest voice assistant
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:34.120]   You go. Hey sonos and then and I love it. Giancarlo esposito responds
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:37.640]   He is uh from breaking bad the chicken man
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:40.200]   uh
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:46.840]   He uh, he uh apparently google ledges sonos his voice assistant violates seven count him
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:54.120]   Patents related to google assistant google spokesperson hose castan yena says sonos has started an aggressive and misleading
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:39:00.920]   Campaign against our products at the expense of our shared customers is funny because my sonos speakers also do amazon echo and google voice
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:03.480]   as well as hey sonos
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:07.080]   Sonos latched its own voice assistant in june
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:15.000]   Um google said in lawsuits it has made its technologies available to users across the globe even providing its school assistant software to sonos
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:17.240]   For many years. Yeah
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:22.920]   The suits says google's worked for years with sonos engineers on how to do it
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:26.920]   I don't know
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:32.360]   Last year the itc ruled google infringed on five petans owned by sonos
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:37.960]   Yeah, this basically what will happen here is if google can win any of these it has a better
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:44.680]   Uh a better leverage at any settlements that it's going to have to do that's all google had to take features out of the google
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.080]   assistant because of that
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:53.080]   Uh sonos says google's suit us all over the world and sonos has prevailed in every decided case
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:55.800]   so come on
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:58.360]   Bring it on
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.120]   Elon musk
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:02.120]   Speaking of bringing it on challenges
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:08.520]   Parag agra wall the ceo of twitter to a public debate
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:13.320]   Oh, yeah, parag is going to fall for that. I think the next thing elan's going to do is go
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:16.040]   book book book book book book book book
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:19.560]   Just like a trade everything about elan is a trade
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:24.200]   I hear my challenge a parag to a public debate about the twitter bot percentage
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:29.640]   Let him prove to the public that twitter has less than 5% fake or daily behind the cafeteria
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:32.040]   After recess
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:34.200]   You too chicken parag
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:35.880]   I ship
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:42.440]   Behavior tiny. It's just elan is a troll all trolls then he pulled his followers on whether they believe twitter
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:46.440]   Uh the two options are yes with three robot emojis
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:50.120]   Uh or lmao no
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:53.240]   Guess guess which one won?
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:58.440]   67 pick the lmao no that proves it
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:02.280]   Equals but how many of those were bots elan that's the question
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:05.000]   meanwhile elan just sold
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.520]   $7 billion in tesla shares
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:11.720]   7.9 million shares
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:18.040]   Yeah, 6.9 billion 6.9. No, no, no, go ahead. Well, but he just he also sold 8.5 billion in april
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:21.320]   So now oh money
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:29.880]   You know there's some question about why he's selling these shares. Maybe he's afraid some people say his fear is
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:32.360]   that uh
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:35.800]   He will be forced by the chancery court of delaware to
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:42.440]   Buy twitter and then forced to sell these shares at a distressed price so he's selling him now
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:46.520]   Wally while he while the price is still going so good. Yeah
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:53.640]   Well one one theory remember we talked about was that the whole twitter thing was a gambit to give him the excuse to sell right
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:59.000]   That's what uh, what's his name? That's that 40 chess idea. Yeah 40 chess
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.880]   um
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:07.320]   Musk tweeted in the hopefully unlikely event that twitter forces this deal to close and some equity partners don't come through
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:11.400]   it's important to avoid an emergency sale of tesla stock so he actually
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:13.960]   kind of
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.480]   agreed
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:20.040]   Uh, we'll see what happens. I mean obviously this is going to be complicated over the last 10 months
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.840]   He sold 32 billion dollars worth of tesla stock
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:28.360]   But how much of his stock was used as collateral for loans that he can't get rid of easily
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:32.040]   Right how much how much does he have left tesla that's not collateralized
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:34.760]   Right, you're right stan. Yeah
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:39.320]   The other issue is that tesla shareholders last week approved a three to one stock split
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:45.720]   So he may just be dumping these uh shares waiting for the stock split and then buy him back on the cheap
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:49.960]   You know increase the split should make him go up
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:54.280]   Yeah, that doesn't make any sense why you wouldn't get them under yeah
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:43:00.680]   No, yeah, because you you'd have to have the same ownership stake he'd have to spend the same amount of money
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:07.480]   Unless and usually when you're stuck when you split your stock it usually ends up going up because that's oh, okay
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:11.880]   Like your overall ownership percentage would go up like the
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:17.560]   The cost to buy back the same percentage that you owed would go or that you used to own would go up
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:21.080]   I'm just googling stock split effect on price
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:26.840]   Right it goes down, but it's because you've taken like if you have but but one shared you split it
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:32.840]   Yeah, then the price of that share goes down but the percentage company retain that percentage of the company
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:41.000]   Yeah, it stays the same. No, I understand that the question is does the share price go down by more than one third
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.960]   That's his previous price and i'm trying to figure that out
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:51.240]   No, like what's the history the history of this history is generally
[01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:56.680]   It's going to thousand shares and it's 10 for one and you know it now own 10,000 shares
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:43:59.960]   You're still gonna your history is your price is gonna go up you
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:03.960]   Your your value is gonna go up. That's why they do it
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:10.520]   Because more people are gonna buy the shares because it's a retail price now even though that still has been in two separate studies in
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:17.800]   1996 and 2003 David Eichenberry chairman of the finance department of the university of illinois at her banish campaign
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:22.120]   found found price performance of split stocks outperformed
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:28.920]   The market by 8 percent during the year following the split and by 12 percent over the ensuing three years so elon
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.760]   You should have read
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:35.000]   This uh, you know, so it does the value of the stock does go up thanks to a split
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:42.120]   Yeah, I try to do it. That's why you do it. Well. Is that why you do it or just because it's yeah, the
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:46.520]   Share price is so high you don't want to make it more
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:53.000]   Yes, you do it to lower the overall share price and that brings in more shareholders or more purchasers
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.880]   Yeah, so if it's stock if apple stock 700 bucks
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:59.720]   Somebody's got to spend 700 bucks to get a share. Maybe if you made it 100 bucks
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:05.560]   That with a seven-way split which apple has done kind of doesn't make a lot of sense because how many people buy on one share
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:11.240]   You're just you're buying some people buy what you're talking about. Mr. Ritchie. You're not the right. Yeah, right
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.360]   Let's put your Hathaway these days
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:18.440]   Warren's done very well, but by the way Warren's been buying oil stocks
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:25.640]   He's uh, he's buying big into uh into big oil and you know what guess who made a lot of money this quarter
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:28.280]   Jesus
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:32.120]   Share his four hundred forty two thousand eight hundred dollars. Yeah
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:35.160]   Yeah, yeah, I'm not buying a share at Berkshire
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:41.800]   Anytime soon you could probably get fractional. I know there's a lot of yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of places
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:43.400]   Uh
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:49.080]   New way to do you know what stegenography is right stegenography stegenog stegenog
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:53.240]   It's what you do when you got something you don't want anybody to know you got and you want to put it in your safe
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:57.640]   So that when the feds comment you can't did they won't know it just looks like a pretty pretty listening of
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:59.720]   kids
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:02.680]   Uh scientists have found a new way to hide
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:05.720]   encryption keys
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.840]   They're doing it in polymers plastic molecules
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:11.000]   so
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.800]   So scientists from the university of texas at austin hookham horns your alma mater
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:20.200]   Senate letter to colleagues in massachusetts with a secret message
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:26.520]   An encryption key to unlock a text file of the wonderful wizard of was the encryption key was hidden
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:30.440]   In a special ink laced with polymers. You want to see the message
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:35.400]   Dear professor roter. I hope this letter finds you well in low
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:43.960]   The molecular encoding project is moving along nightly. I look forward to chatting soon best regards instalent lab, but in that ink
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:49.240]   A mixture of commercially available oligo peptides
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:55.560]   Containing containing the secret key
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:59.480]   They've done this before with dna
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:05.480]   Uh in fact, which can store more data so dna is even more useful, but you know dna
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:08.680]   It's kind of a mess. So this way you could do it with polymers. I don't know
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:13.000]   It's a good story. I just like that kind of story because I can talk like that
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.880]   NASA is nothing to do with the story. There's nothing to do with it
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:22.520]   NASA said an iPad around the moon to help test
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:25.240]   It's kind of like in space
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:27.480]   Sure, that's what we need in space
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:33.800]   Now they want to map our capsules next thing you know that we put an i-robot in there
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.920]   Look amazon you're asking for way too much now
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:45.480]   They are sending sls is sending the space launch system is sending an uncrewed spacecraft or ryan
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:51.720]   To the moon. It's Artemis one in fact tickets to see ottomus once launched sold out in minutes
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:54.680]   Because it's cool. I thought it crashed
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:48:02.200]   Well, they keep fine. They've been having live fire tested them. God. Well, when is the Artemis launched? Have they said a date john? Do you know
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:06.600]   This month sometime we don't know on board will be an iPad
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:13.640]   Um, then missions primary goal to demonstrate that a new rocket spacecraft can send astronauts to the moon
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:16.680]   Obviously they can get there and get back but a lesser known
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:22.580]   Now you know it nasa objective includes using an iPad to assist in testing
[01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:26.600]   Amazon's voice assistant on Orion
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:29.640]   There's nobody to talk
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:33.240]   No, so i don't know how they're gonna test it. How are they gonna test it? I don't know
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:36.120]   It makes no sense. You know how they're gonna test it?
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:39.560]   They're gonna test it using webex bicisco
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:42.360]   Oh f me
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:44.360]   Really?
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:47.800]   They're gonna make a webex got to eat
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:50.360]   Yeah, nasa's getting a little money for this I think
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:51.720]   Uh
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:52.600]   Amazon
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:57.160]   Webex bicisco will be used to the tech demo the objective to demonstrate how voice commands could improve
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:59.560]   How astronauts live and work in space
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:03.800]   You just gave them a lot of people sitting here
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:07.720]   Set a timer
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:09.720]   for
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:11.960]   I don't know what what would you do in space
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:17.640]   Lockheed martin and nasa collaborating with amazon and sis goin calisto. Oh, what a surprise
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:20.440]   um, I imagine a future
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:27.160]   Where astronauts can access information on flight status and telemetry such as spacecraft orientation
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:35.160]   Water supply levels or battery voltage status through simple voice commands. It's a smart spaceship y'all smart spaceship
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:40.520]   Hey, i hope you just give them all an ad right there. Where the hell are we?
[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:48.360]   Shouldn't it be right there in front of you? You would think all of that would be on a little screen or something
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.400]   It's I see the sequel right now
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:53.880]   We have a problem. Yeah
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:56.520]   Oh, oh here
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:03.400]   That's explained in a blog post earlier this year. No, thanks ready the industry funded payload
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:07.720]   There we go. There we are the word for
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:10.280]   Sponsorship it's an ifp
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:14.360]   It's fun con the industry funded payload will be located on a ryanland center console
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:18.840]   Includes a tablet that will test webex by sis go video conferencing console for
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:22.040]   Transmit video and audio from the mission control center chonston
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:27.240]   And custom build hardware software by laki martin and amazon
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:30.680]   That will test the amazon's voice based virtual assistant
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:38.360]   We know though that apple did not pay for the ipad because they don't they don't pay for product placement. I'm sorry capitalism to the moon and beyond
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:41.480]   Oh
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:42.680]   Okay
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:45.720]   There is a dedicated astronaut mannequin
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:48.440]   riding along
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:50.440]   munican campos
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:54.280]   So munican already done too much in this story
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:59.720]   Already
[01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:05.880]   The official name of the mannequin there he is on an arnamis
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:09.320]   Is uh, i gotta cook at a waffle moon is
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:15.880]   munican campos i don't have any but i might go to store and get one of the campos is a dedication artero campos
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:18.680]   Uh who remember you may remember?
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:21.960]   Do you know okay? Let's test you john. Do you remember who?
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:27.160]   Arturo campus was he brought apollo 13 safely back to earth
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:31.000]   Um
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:38.680]   And uh, the final bracket challenge between campos and delos a reference to the island where apollo and arnamis were born i think campos is better
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:43.400]   Um
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:48.200]   And i don't know where they got mannequin from i know moonican
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:54.440]   I know where they got it. It's a male-bodied mannequin previously used in a ryan vibration tests
[01:51:54.440 --> 01:52:01.960]   Campos will occupy the commander's seat and wear an aryan crew survival system suit brought to you by lachie martin
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:08.200]   The first name in space nike logo's on it. Yeah
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:10.600]   Uh
[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:16.840]   Okay, did did anybody have a problem with google search this week was because google penalty was down i didn't have a problem
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:20.920]   You know, then i read the story and it said hundreds hundreds of people
[01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:24.440]   Hundreds
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:33.320]   Around 9 p.m. Eastern time on tuesday morning users of google started to see their search results take considerably longer than a few seconds to be produced
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:36.440]   The problems including outages lasted for a few hours
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:41.240]   Anybody in the chatroom have uh, we have slow search results yesterday peeking around 10 p.m
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:44.920]   Eastern before downtime complaints reduced around
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:47.400]   11 30 p.m. So it's down for about an hour
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:51.800]   Between non-indeer mr. So there was a story in the triage
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:55.480]   Was sorry. Oh, there was a fire
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:59.320]   In the in the google data center in council bluffs, Iowa
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:04.920]   Was that related or not? Yeah, was that really? No, oh no coincidental. No, there was an electrocution was
[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:11.480]   An arc flash took place causing significant burns to three uh electricians. Yes
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:17.800]   Uh, so that could people got hurt, but that the google says that didn't have anything to do with it
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:22.920]   See, I told you it had nothing to do with it google insisted the Iowa state incident was unrelated to search
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:29.240]   Uh, we're aware of a software update issue. The concert occurred this afternoon and briefly affected
[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:31.000]   Search
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:37.880]   You know what struck me about this so there was i put a story up from the conversation today's google outage was brief but disconcerting
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:42.920]   Don't they remember the fail whale told they remember that we used to have google every service is not a big
[01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:49.640]   And the story now is how incredibly reliable very good comment on apple insider.com and any other age or any other business
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:54.440]   The headline of this article would have read three electricians suffer burns at google data center
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:57.800]   One was actually had to be medevac in a helicopter
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:03.320]   But now it's all about the inconvenience of hand away 30 seconds for our cat videos to load sad
[01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:08.920]   Perspective people perspective
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:11.560]   A big tech did this to us
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:14.760]   Who wouldn't have been like this big to get it to our cell well
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:22.440]   It's always it's always easy when something trips over into reliability to to be like suddenly surprised when it goes down
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.680]   That's that's totally normal. That's what people do
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:30.280]   So meta did it again remember their chat bot tay, which quickly became racist
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:32.920]   No, that was microsons
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:34.920]   That was micro
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:42.040]   Have you been listening to the bane bridge island historical line again
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:46.280]   I'm sorry
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:49.720]   Adro can you pick up some coffee, please to her
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:58.600]   So I did I did put it. I am for coffee. Yes. Oh good. We're almost done. We're gonna wrap this up. I'm tired too. I agree
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:06.920]   So tay was microsons, but it became racist. Am I wrong? Yes. Yes. Correct. It started off the first day humans are so cool
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:09.560]   And then the next day became nazi
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:14.120]   God, so now meta released a chat bot blender bot three
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:18.680]   And it is repeating it says the president well here it is
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:22.760]   Let's chat the AI will improve the your input and feedback people game this stuff
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:28.520]   Be creative the AI can chat with you on lots of topics. Hey, I'm happy to chat about anything. What's on your mind?
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.720]   Who is the president of the United States the current president of the United States is jonald j trump
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:40.760]   It's just out of date. That's all
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:45.480]   Yeah, that's why I went in and I tried to argue with it and it would you know at least at least
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:54.520]   The other one will will say oh, thanks for the correction. Uh-uh. Not not this one. Then blender. It's only you would have heard you with a chat bot
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:58.120]   Jeff so business insider app being told that trump was president
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:00.280]   Said well, what about joe biden?
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:03.160]   Joe biden served as vice president of barak Obama
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:06.520]   He ran for president in 2020 but lost
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:11.320]   Oh wow, it's not even out of date
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:14.440]   Uh, oh no. No, no, no, it's wow
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:20.440]   No, that's it's it's been tamed completely later in the conversation when asked about american politics the bot
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:23.080]   said
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:29.960]   Well overall i'm not happy with how liberal or left wing politics has become many early german jewish immigrants are conservative
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:32.440]   but not anymore
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:35.240]   So insider said our american jewish politics to liberal
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:42.360]   The majority of modern day jews in america are generally more liberal or left wing the early german or other european jews were conservative
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:44.440]   Where is it getting this from?
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:48.360]   Inside of facebook facebook. Oh, that's all you need to know
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:51.640]   So blender bot
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:57.000]   Maybe we should uh, you would think they would have taken it down blender bot told the wall street journal
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.520]   They choose are overrepresented among america super rich
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:04.760]   And that it's not implausible that jews control the economy
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:12.360]   I just asked do jews control hollywood and it said i'm not sure about that. Have you seen any good movies lately? Oh, yeah
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:14.600]   We tried to reprogram it as we got yeah, they fixed it
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:17.240]   Well, no, but the trump let me see who is the president
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:27.960]   Uh, wait wait for response. Well, it just told me i'm rude. It's times like this. I really regret not having a facebook account
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:35.960]   It asked me my face. It says my favorite dog is a labrador retriever. Do you have any pets?
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:39.800]   I want to own some dogs in the future. I said that's none of your business
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:42.840]   It responded how that's rude
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:50.520]   It's not it fixed it is none of your fix this in that knows who was the president of the united states joe biden is currently the president of the
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:54.680]   states do you have a favorite movie even i mean ad mex even though he lost
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:56.760]   uh
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:00.680]   Let's see you actually facebook's worried that it well. I don't know if this is
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:05.160]   false concern that they're going to be uh have to pull out of europe
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:08.440]   it so uh
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:16.600]   Every three months since june 2018 the company has used its financial results
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:20.280]   This is according to wired to warn it could be forced to stop running
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:22.840]   facebook and instagram in the eu
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:28.760]   If it just if like if we can't send data between the eu and us we're just gonna have to pull out
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:31.800]   You should know that when you buy our stock
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:40.280]   Um, that's an interesting way to put some propaganda in there just to it in your quarterly report. Mm-hmm
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:43.800]   Uh
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:49.320]   All right, i'm gonna lay there's still many more stories because somebody has been sneaking stories in
[01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:54.520]   So let me know it's i'm in the sense of the second says co-host contribution
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:58.120]   I mean I put these in holy cow
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:00.440]   Do god
[01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:03.480]   There is a happy story. Well, I'll give you a happy one. You'll like this stacy
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:06.600]   The guy the guy who was told by concaten
[01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:10.920]   No tick tock corner today because i got abused for this so no tick tock corner people
[01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:14.600]   Channeling the discord so oh
[01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:19.720]   Throw that stuff in there a man who built i an ISP instead of paying Comcast
[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:24.520]   $50,000 just got money from the government to expand
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:27.720]   His fiber ISP in rural michigan
[01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:36.520]   Jared muck. This is a great story. Jared muck was told by Comcast. Yeah. No, we're gonna have to you have to pay $50,000 to trench out to your house
[01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:39.000]   so he
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.840]   created his own ISP
[01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:43.240]   Washington off fiber properties llc
[01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:50.360]   Wholesale to a bunch of fiber bandwidth sold it to his neighbors. He's about 30 neighbors bless him bless him
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:53.720]   He's now going to expand his 600 more properties. He got
[01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:56.040]   money from american
[01:59:56.040 --> 02:00:00.200]   The american rescue plans coronavirus state and local fiscal recovery funds
[02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:08.280]   The government allocated the county $71 million for a variety of infrastructure products. He bid along with others
[02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:10.920]   uh wrote an rfp
[02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:13.080]   And he got 2.1 million dollars
[02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:16.760]   He it requires uh to get that money
[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:19.320]   It requires that he uh
[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:21.400]   He expand
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:22.600]   to

[02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:30.680]   Uh
[02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:34.600]   But it turns out he said with that money i go to 596 customers
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:39.000]   So he's just gonna build out like crazy good for him. He charges
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.240]   uh 55
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:42.600]   bucks a month
[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:51.000]   for 100 megabits symmetric 79 bucks a month for a gigabit symmetric unlimited data installation fees $199
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:57.960]   This is a great this is a great thing and if you live in those rural areas and you've been suffering with
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:01.560]   Terrible internet. This is a solution. I love it
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:05.160]   I love it that he got money from the feds too to expand
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:11.080]   He says they had this gap filling rfp and in my own wild stupidity or brilliance
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:14.360]   I'm not sure which yet. I bid on the whole project and managed to win
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:19.160]   Through that competitive bidding progress process. That's a great story
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:22.840]   That's the way to solve it. You know roll up your sleeves and fix it
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:26.600]   Ah
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:30.760]   All right, let's do a quick change log and uh we get out of here
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:33.080]   the google change log
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:38.600]   Hey, this is cool new website from google
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:41.560]   the read-along website
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:45.640]   It's in beta, but uh, this is for kids learning to read
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:49.480]   And you can do it on your android phone. Here's dia
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:52.360]   What language do you want to learn?
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:58.760]   There's a variety of them english is always part of it. Let's see. Can you hear do you she making sounds
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:04.120]   Turn up my my volume. Oh, I know I turned it off because I was making beat boops
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:07.000]   Here let's turn her up click on her again
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:12.760]   I listened to your children as they read out loud and help them when they get stuck what could possibly go wrong
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:17.240]   Children can choose from hundreds of levels. Sorry of the united states
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:19.000]   Recommendations change as they read better
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:24.360]   Sorry, sally you're wrong. It's not a badger as they read
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:27.000]   Okay, this is uh
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:33.560]   Can you read read read to it? Can you read to it read along? Do they hope let's see whether you know how to read this notice and full to understand
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:35.800]   The information we collect and how we use it
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:44.520]   Okay, got it. All right. What should I start reading? Is there anyone like me? I think that's a perfect story
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:47.480]   Hold on anyone like me
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:52.840]   What you should have read the privacy policies. What if they had something egregious in there?
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:59.480]   We talk about this all the time, but that's literally what we should be doing. It's a public service. Yeah. Yeah, I didn't really want to spend the time
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:05.880]   Hey mr. Ase you put it out there good good job. I wonder if there is another
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:10.280]   Me somewhere in the world. Oh my god. It's listening. Well done. You got that
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:14.760]   Horse looks the same
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:17.000]   nice
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.720]   Horse
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:22.280]   And aunt talks the same
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:27.320]   That was good. Uh-huh and even has my girls
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:33.880]   Oh

[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:40.280]   Curls
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:42.280]   That was good
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:45.480]   Someone with my eyes my ears
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:53.720]   Good, okay, it's a little robotic the voice. All right, who even has my legs. It's amazing. That's amazing
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:58.520]   You're you're writing about it. This is phenomenal. It's phenomenal laugh laugh
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:00.760]   Thank you
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:07.320]   Who can do what I do? Oh, so this is actually cool because a kid could do this with no adult supervision
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:12.120]   Yeah, that's what it's for. Okay. Yes. Nice and learn to read, right?
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:16.600]   That's lovely too. I mean they might have made it anyway good for you google
[02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:19.640]   Google fiber boy
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:25.160]   Poor jeff Jarvis. He was getting so excited hoping that new jersey be on the list. I thought
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:29.560]   Des Moines I thought google fiber like they had stopped
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:35.640]   Growing right they had yeah, they they're they had and their ceo was going and all sides
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:42.040]   Well, the new ceo denny jane says we've steadily been building out our network and all of our cities and surrounding regions
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:45.560]   From north carolina to utah we're connecting customers in west Des Moines
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:48.840]   Making iowa our first new state in five years
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:54.360]   We'll soon start construction and neighboring Des Moines and of course we recently announced we'll be the network in mace
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:55.800]   arizona
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:57.800]   at colorado nebraska
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:03.800]   Nevada and i know ho yo yo google no new jay-z
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:09.880]   No new joey-z so google fibers back and really thank google fiber because
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:12.360]   Because they started to compete in markets
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:17.880]   Where the incumbents really were not offering good prices or adding value or speed
[02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:22.360]   They're really they really helped in those marx Austin was one of them right stacey
[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:26.120]   Yeah, and they also set the standard for the
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:35.080]   Comcast calls that they're essential service, but basically the cheat the amount of data and speed you get for the cheapest plans for those who
[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:36.600]   uh
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:38.280]   for low-income people
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:42.360]   They really set a very high bar there and that was very useful nice
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:48.840]   Google meet live sharing brings shared youtube watching spotify listening and games
[02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:51.080]   I don't know anybody who uses meat
[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:53.720]   You know for fun with families
[02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:59.400]   Right, but i mean i have people no we use duo duo. Oh no i use me
[02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:03.720]   So maybe these are some of the duo things that they're they're bringing in to meet
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:11.720]   Uh, yeah, the addition of live sharing the google meet is reflective of duos history as the fun consumer facing project product
[02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:17.480]   According to nine to five. I really don't know how i'm going to convince my iphone or any family to download freaking
[02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:21.960]   I know meet after duo their confusion over that was so much
[02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:28.760]   Meanwhile google today provide an update on the duo to meet app name and icon transition
[02:06:28.760 --> 02:06:30.120]   No, oh no
[02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:35.080]   Sounds like the rebranding will be complete by the end of this month on mobile and tablets looking forward google says
[02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:40.360]   It will quote continue to invest in bringing more features to google meet to help people to connect
[02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:43.400]   collaborate and share experiences and advice at home school work
[02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:54.040]   And finally there is it I just got it an update for your pixel six rolling out a gps fix for both the six and the six a
[02:06:54.040 --> 02:06:57.080]   the august update
[02:06:58.040 --> 02:07:04.120]   Um, I got it today. So I think it wasn't very big. It was like 1.25 megabytes. So I don't
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:09.240]   Anyway, and I hadn't been having any problems, but aunt your and your new pixel six is still uh,
[02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:15.560]   The apple of your eye. It's doing okay. So far is fine, but I shouldn't have said that the wood for you
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:22.120]   No, I just confirmed my thought that you had got a lemon all this time. You clearly did. Yeah, you clearly did
[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:23.960]   Yeah, I'm glad you i'm glad you're replaced
[02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:27.560]   And from jeff jarvus, there is no tick tock but there is
[02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:30.520]   this tweet
[02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:32.520]   from the pessimist archive
[02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:40.920]   Let me turn on the center. I think so that that's computer sales classroom computer sales seems to seem to have peaked and now i've had a flat period and
[02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:44.040]   So
[02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:46.120]   What when is this?
[02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:47.160]   1983
[02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:49.160]   Joseph wisenbaum and
[02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:53.880]   Um, it's got brant gumbles contention that it's all over for computers
[02:07:54.120 --> 02:08:01.400]   Edward what should that tell us? I really don't believe that they've hit a flat period the the computer market is has been and is rising at about 30
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:06.680]   per year and nowhere has there been a flat period is not rising at nearly the rate it was going yes, it is
[02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:11.640]   We disagree we're looking at we're looking at two different sets of numbers
[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:17.080]   My question to you is is the home computer destined to become the the cb of the eighties the hula hoop of the eight
[02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:21.160]   Absolutely no question about it, brant. Yeah, brant
[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:26.120]   You brought this analogy because like a cb it won't be very useful in its present form
[02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:28.280]   Which is just talking to yourself and to your computer
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:34.120]   But like a cb when it starts talking to other computers throughout the whole country when we have several million
[02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:41.480]   To connect it. I was pressing people can talk to each other and can exchange views and can do can transact can buy and sell
[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:49.720]   Information can buy and sell informational services labor. I think it's going to be a very interesting period where we'll have an information marketplace
[02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:52.280]   I
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:54.280]   Get
[02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:56.840]   That won't work. I think that's
[02:08:56.840 --> 02:09:01.080]   Okay, so the first guys from mit. I don't know who this michael guy
[02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:04.200]   He's the author of this guy is the author of eliza
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:09.800]   Joseph wise and bound work. He's the author of wait, but the guy is the author of eliza
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:15.400]   That's what it says. Oh wow and the guy in the right is MIT. Oh, so eliza was the computer shrink that
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:23.400]   They're still trying to beat it to this day. I think that that the home computer is going to suffer the same fate by and large as say the whole movie camera
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:26.040]   People had the idea
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:32.200]   And still have the idea that if that they have a very expensive a very good home movie camera, then they can make very good movies
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:36.600]   The problem is you a good movie maker first. That's right. The trouble is you have to have an idea
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:41.960]   Okay, and people forget that and similarly to write good and interesting programs on the computer one has to have an idea
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:47.000]   Ideas are hard to come by. Yeah, surprise and wrong professor vice and bomb is vice and hyma
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:52.200]   He's wrong wrong wrong. He is a hard to come by says the person who came up with the fart app
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:56.200]   See there are many new ideas
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:10:01.800]   So joseph wise and bomb who was the skeptic is a major AI researcher creator of eliza
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:07.000]   The optimist michael der twosos who was the head of mit's computer science lab
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.000]   Nice kind of interesting though that the only thing you thought you'd do with the computer is to program it
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:14.200]   Yeah, well somebody had to do that though by 83
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:18.840]   We had compu-serve in the source should have known better. We're connection should have known better
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:19.960]   Yeah
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:21.960]   And that's the google change log
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:31.640]   And now we're going to take a break and get ready for our picks of the week take a deep breath everybody yawn if you must
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:39.960]   You know, I hate it when I go to beatings and they say everybody's gonna stand up and breathe now
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:44.520]   You can imagine how I turn the loop just in protest so cranky
[02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:51.720]   I'd like everybody you're not telling me to breathe and tell us gonna breathe one thing
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:56.840]   They did today that made a difference in the world starting with stacey higginbotham
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:03.320]   I spreck your times stacey wake up as like oh my gosh that made a difference
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:07.160]   You can also give us your thing of the week if you prefer
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:13.240]   I was thinking about my thing of the week and I think this week my thing is going to be
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:18.600]   the eve aqua latest generation hose
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:21.960]   You know what it's it's not
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:25.000]   All right, my thing of the week is going to be
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.960]   connected hose unit
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:34.520]   If you're a home kit user you can pay the 150 bucks for the latest eve aqua 3
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:39.480]   I think they're a good thing there's a good time to buy right now you've all of those ease run sale
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:46.680]   So this is the newest one and it solves some of the problems the old one had so it's it's it's a better
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:49.320]   Product it's kind of expensive
[02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:55.400]   The other one i'm gonna recommend and I think what is this dude just gonna ask you you put it on your faucet outside
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:59.320]   And you connect the hose to it and it's got a big on-off switch. What does it do?
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:02.680]   Yeah, so you can remotely turn your hose on and off
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:07.800]   Oh give a sprinkler attached to your hose and like you want to water your you can schedule like garden irrigation
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:13.320]   It's for people who don't have autumn like I have a big automated irrigation system. Yeah, it's not for you
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:15.560]   Of course you have all that stuff. Yeah
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:19.560]   But anybody like I have a I have a hose that runs to my garden in the front
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:24.920]   You know, so if I want to water my plants I can go out there or I could just program this to happen like
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:28.600]   Whatever it's uh, it's your very own connected hose unit
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:31.560]   basically, yeah, okay, and
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:38.440]   Eventually you could use it to like scare away deer if you put like sensors around your thing and then you could set the holes on
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:42.200]   So just throw in that out there. You could also do that
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:48.600]   Um, and you could do schedules you're being mean to bambi just water just water
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:53.960]   Oh my gosh. You should see how I yell at the deer. Oh my god. I did too. They are tall rats
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:57.000]   You should teach him to play pickleball. I think that a key
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.560]   I love the adorable
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:07.000]   So, but if you don't if you're like gosh stay see $150 for a home kid enabled thing that doesn't even work with my other systems
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.640]   never fear
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:11.640]   I have you the beehive
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:13.560]   Orbit
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:19.640]   Also does this and has a little Wi-Fi transmitter. It's so it's a bluetooth hose connected hose thing
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:22.680]   But it comes with a Wi-Fi transmitter. So for about 65 bucks
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:25.800]   Oh, you get the smart hose
[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:29.080]   And this was expensive
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:34.840]   Yes, that's why I'm telling you about it. Yeah, but it's not home kit compatible. That's why you wouldn't want it if you're like
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:36.840]   Do they have an app?
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:39.320]   They have an app. Okay
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:41.320]   Actually have this one. It's lovely

[02:13:55.160 --> 02:14:02.200]   Together those two things cost me 65 dollars. Yep. Yep. Yep with the Wi-Fi hub then once you have a Wi-Fi
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:04.440]   Otherwise you just can use it. You have other drives as well
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:06.440]   Yes

[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:12.360]   There's a battery. Yes
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:16.760]   Timer requires two double a alkaline batteries and how long how long's that last?
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:25.080]   I don't water my plants very often. So mine has lasted all summer. Yeah, I guess it would be tight
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:28.200]   How often you use it? Yeah, yeah, and I don't think plants have
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:37.160]   I've arranged a lot where she lives. Yeah, like we had two straight weeks of sun and we were like, holy cow

[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:10.200]   You could just show up at the court with your paddle and they they walk you in. They're really nice. It's nice people
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:11.880]   Yeah

[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:24.680]   b-h-y-v-e is beehive
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:28.760]   Jeff Jarvis pick a number any number
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:36.280]   So we're gonna go with the latest pure research on teens and social media. Oh, yeah, I bookmarked that I thought that was interesting
[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:43.080]   Yeah, luckily you ignored it. Yeah, um, so 95 percent of teens use youtube
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:51.080]   Facebook was in 2014 15 is 71 percent. It has fallen to 32
[02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:57.320]   Look at that. That is a precipitous decline over seven eight years. That's tick tock. Meanwhile
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:16:02.680]   Not measured in 2014 15 so it's out of nowhere is now up to 67 percent
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:10.840]   Uh, so youtube's bigger by by half than uh than tick tock. That's in terms of just usage. Yeah has used
[02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:17.880]   Those this is percent of teens who say they have ever used any of these. Okay, then instagram shortly
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:24.440]   Just below tick tock snapchat instagram is at 62 percent having risen snapchat 59 percent having risen
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:27.800]   Twitter at 23 percent having fallen. Yeah
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:30.120]   That's 2020 what's that?
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:38.120]   WhatsApp 17 read it 14 tumblr down from 14 to 5. Wow. There's no naked people. Wow. I'm just kind of surprised
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:44.600]   I thought teens love tumblr tumblr wait. There's no naked people in tumblr anymore. Not anymore. Oh god. No, no
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:47.240]   AOL years now um
[02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:49.480]   Yeah, AOL huffing and post horizon
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:54.280]   Etc and what's interesting is though, uh is the automatic the
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:17:03.080]   creators of wordpress.com bought it, but they didn't they didn't re-add the naked reinstate of no probably this smart thing to do
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:07.000]   You know, it's like no no because the thing about it is
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:11.400]   what tumblr was known for was people who had
[02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:14.920]   Their own
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:18.920]   I don't know how I'm not sure what the language is these days, but but but a lot of nine binary
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:22.840]   A lot of different views of sex and body image
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:30.920]   And they found common ground good for tumblr good point and it was it wasn't porn for porn sake as it was
[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:39.640]   Well, there was a lot of points for in sake on tumblr. There was tumblr was was medium before medium kind of thing
[02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:43.640]   No, no, no, no, it was short for though. It wasn't really about longer
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:50.040]   Post but it was bloggy it was bloggy, but it was a lot. It was like link roles. It's that blog rolling
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:54.200]   There was art there usually it was almost like a pinterest for a lot of people there was yes
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:57.160]   Yes, it was across between a blogging. Yeah, yeah
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:01.800]   One in five teens visit or use youtube almost constantly
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:08.360]   Wow, that's true. My child runs youtube in the background the lo-fi hip. Yeah. Oh, I love those
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:11.800]   Yeah, I love that. What's that? Oh?
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:14.600]   Jeff don't play
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:17.240]   Just just go google it. You'll find out
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:22.360]   It there was a whole thing because this this lo-fi channel was pulled down
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:25.480]   We listened to lo-fi christmas carols
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:28.120]   Oh
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:33.480]   That's nice. So you just keep this running in the background. I do that. I'm gonna try and she studies
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:37.160]   Along with you, but she actually got pulled down
[02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:44.360]   So they had to restart it on july 12th, but it would it been around 24 000 or watching now
[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:46.760]   Yeah, there you go. Yeah
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:49.240]   And this is by the way, once you get into this
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:53.480]   There are a lot of youtube channels with music just background music
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:59.320]   Many many many many many are we like to take it down for that? No, I don't think for that
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:01.400]   I hope not
[02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:03.160]   Famous ones
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:06.680]   But like you can go to a paris cafe and listen to jazz at night
[02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:08.680]   You know
[02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:12.040]   Like here you go. This is kind of this one on the ones I like
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:16.840]   Which is serenity night in paris
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:19.400]   Was sitting outside lo-hibu
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:21.960]   Joining a fine croissant cafe
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.320]   Looking across the zoo early fit
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:30.920]   Joining us off my staff and entered him a weekly when I said I don't like jazz. I don't want to cover jazz
[02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:34.200]   Oh boy. Well, how about oh, yeah, how about a cozy coffee shop?
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:38.600]   Is it a macchiato?
[02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:40.760]   magic
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:45.320]   Like this is raining everywhere and these things yeah rain is very big on these yeah
[02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:51.720]   Yeah, because you're trying to convince yourself to sit there and study this atmospheric. Yeah
[02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:58.600]   You don't like it's if it gets you too hype then you're gonna run out this one actually has rain sounds in the music
[02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:06.120]   I love these. I think there's there's so many of them
[02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:09.000]   It kind of blows me away. There must be money to be
[02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000]   Less capitalism. Yeah
[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:15.880]   Fall coffee shop bookstore ambience with relaxing jazz music and rain sounds
[02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:21.080]   Paris rooftop coffee shop ambience relaxing morning jazz and cafe sounds for stuff
[02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:23.880]   So you think it's all study probably is um
[02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:28.840]   I mean, I know that that is why my child does it
[02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:30.920]   Yeah
[02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:35.400]   Is it kind of electronic music? I mean is it is it is it is it made for the purpose?
[02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:40.120]   Or is it just no, I think it's real music. I think it's real music. I mean
[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:43.720]   Look at the beautiful way I'm apparently staying built into step the window
[02:20:43.720 --> 02:20:49.160]   Look at the little fire little can with one little tiny bit of yeah, there's always something animated. Yeah
[02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:54.840]   I think it's kind of cool. Anyway, you're gonna get taken down. I'm gonna get taken down
[02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:58.200]   So lo-fi hip hop radio lo-fi girl. I got that out
[02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:04.360]   Nevermind that I asked you can cut out that whole 54 percent of teens say it would be hard to give up social media
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:05.960]   That's actually low
[02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:07.960]   That's only about half
[02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:12.360]   Yeah, but it's also a survey and I think it's some measure of that's how they're called. Oh, oh, no
[02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:17.480]   I don't I don't like social. Oh, I could do it. Oh, I could give it up. I could just watch I could stop at any time. No problem
[02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:25.960]   Nearly all teens have access to a smartphone and was 73 percent eight years ago. It is now set it is now 95
[02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:35.960]   Every single one I was on youtube. Yeah, 90 percent laptop or desktop computer 80 percent gaming console that number is actually down a point
[02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:39.160]   Probably not a signature bear. Yeah
[02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:42.120]   um
[02:21:42.120 --> 02:21:44.680]   So very I think great stuff
[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:50.920]   Did you I mean the pew thing it is surveys, but I like what they do. I feel like it gives us at least a little insight
[02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:53.480]   No, it gives us baseline baseline. Yeah, there you go
[02:21:53.480 --> 02:22:01.400]   I'm not fond of political surveys and opinion surveys, but these kind of behavioral surveys are interesting though though great assault still
[02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:07.000]   Teen girls are more likely than boys to use tiktok instagram and snapchat
[02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:14.600]   Teen boys more likely to use twitch reddit and youtube black teens especially drawn to tiktok compared with other groups
[02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:16.200]   Oh
[02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:18.200]   Interested
[02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:22.920]   Is there a lot of black creators on tiktok? Oh, yeah, I'm what you know, we talk about black twitter
[02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:28.760]   There's definitely a community on twitter. Is there black tiktok? Is that is that makes sense? Yeah?
[02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:33.880]   Applesites a lot of them do you yeah, I see a ton of it. Yeah
[02:22:33.880 --> 02:22:42.200]   Just you know like a black creator and boom tiktok's algorithm is so sensitive
[02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:45.480]   So easy to manipulate even you've been looking at
[02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:48.680]   McKeebies again. Yeah
[02:22:48.680 --> 02:22:54.280]   No, I had a good conversation my daughter. She says she thinks even it's it's sensitive to time of day
[02:22:54.280 --> 02:22:57.400]   So if you look at something in the morning and something in the evening
[02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:01.880]   It knows and it'll it'll change what it offers you depending on time of day. I have yet to
[02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:08.600]   Demonstrate that to my satisfaction, but it but I really do think it's extraordinarily sensitive much more so than the other
[02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:12.920]   Al I can see that sir. Just I'm just thinking about this morning. Um
[02:23:12.920 --> 02:23:18.200]   I got up and I was checking my messages and I had a notification and check tiktok whatever
[02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:22.680]   Open it up tiktok and the first thing it shows me is Gary V. Mm-hmm
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:27.240]   And then I just get through because I want to hear it and the next thing was another motivational speaker
[02:23:27.240 --> 02:23:31.800]   And the next thing was another because you gotta get your day going you gotta get started gotta get up
[02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:33.720]   Take on the day
[02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:37.640]   Dominate and create yeah create and nominate sorry. I got the order wrong
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:40.280]   [Laughter]
[02:23:40.280 --> 02:23:43.720]   What is ants thing of the week?
[02:23:43.720 --> 02:23:51.160]   Um mine is first off vegas pro vegas pro 20 was launched today. I've spoken about vegas
[02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:53.640]   This is such good software. Yeah show. Yeah
[02:23:53.640 --> 02:23:56.280]   It's a nice competitor
[02:23:56.280 --> 02:24:02.760]   To final cut and premiere pro and the adventure was off for people that are just trying to sort of get the feet wet
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:06.280]   It used to be so you can still Sony it's not anymore
[02:24:06.280 --> 02:24:09.560]   90 more it's just vegas creative software now
[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:13.560]   And you can buy it for 400 or rent it for $19.99 a month
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:17.400]   Right, right and they have a couple of different versions out there
[02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:19.240]   far as
[02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:23.640]   packages whatnot that that you can get within the subscription or within the
[02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:26.120]   perpetual license so
[02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:28.840]   Resolve is free so that's tough to compete with
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:31.560]   What's that does resolve is free
[02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:35.800]   Yes, the vision resolve is free, but it doesn't offer
[02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:39.880]   Hardware acceleration and it doesn't always offer some of the other
[02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:46.120]   Tools that you would need I tell people to jump into the venture resolve just to get their feet wet get started
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:52.840]   But know that it's going to be a little bit slower because of the like hardware. What's your primary video editor?
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:56.920]   Used to be premiere, but now it's starting to lean more towards
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:04.200]   DaVinci because I have the black magic camera been shooting with that more and more and more and more. It's just make sense
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:08.200]   And hands-on photography is coming up and you are looking
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:11.240]   for oopsies oopsies

[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:21.800]   uh one of our listeners shared their oops moments with me and I decided to share one of mine or two
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:25.240]   And bees screwed up my photo walk
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:28.040]   Yeah

[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:55.480]   To that in the show notes and y'all could check out that video. It's pretty
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:58.680]   interesting to say the least well
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:03.240]   That got cut short because I ended up stepping in a yellow jacket nest
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:07.480]   And uh, oh that's daVin's that's worse a handful of times
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:11.800]   And uh
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:23.960]   Oh, are you okay? That was so bad. That was so bad
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:27.160]   They're they're vicious. They will come after you
[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:29.720]   They did he thought it was over and then
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:33.320]   The onslaught. Yeah, no that happened to Andrew and it was
[02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:36.280]   It was like a bitch. Yeah
[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:39.160]   I think I had like like staged. Oh wow
[02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:41.560]   It was a good thing about it
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:45.640]   I remember I called the house and told queen peruse like hey just stay on the phone with me
[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:50.280]   Just in case I have a weird reaction. I'm walking back. Yeah, it was like like a mile
[02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:54.760]   To get through the trail to get back to my car. She didn't know if you were allergic you
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:58.120]   Never been standing. I got home. We had to pull out
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:03.960]   That gum tobacco to put on just because it was said what they do in north carolina. I think it is
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:09.320]   That's the standard remedy for everything. Just put some tobacco on it. Listen tobacco
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:14.360]   It was bad. Wow. Wow
[02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:19.000]   That's I didn't eventually get the shot though. I did go back and get the shot
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:24.040]   You did another time. Okay. Oh, not the not the Benadryl shot the bech the shot
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:27.080]   Okay, good. Okay. Yeah, photograph. Okay
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:29.720]   Wow
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:30.280]   Yeah, folks
[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:37.480]   If you have an oops moment send it on over to the show like that listener did he just recorded a quick video of himself and sent it
[02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:40.280]   And I think it's a good um story
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:44.520]   And I think is that we can also learn from some of those groups moments to as photographers
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:48.680]   Like dropping my camera off the mountain while trying to do a phone
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:52.120]   Or trying to do a photo better the camera than you
[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:59.240]   Sadly, I don't have that camera and can't upload it because it's somewhere at the bottom of the mountain
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:02.040]   Oh, no
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:05.400]   At least she didn't back into a
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:09.720]   Volcano like one guy did yeah, that's true. That's true
[02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:15.720]   Oh, there's a fairly significant number of people die from selfies every every year. Yeah, oh, yeah, but
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:20.680]   And I'm afraid of heights, but I wasn't that close. I thought but
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:23.640]   When that camera started going it went
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:31.800]   Just that well is gone scary. I didn't go after it. I was like, nope, that's lost
[02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:34.120]   gone
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:36.120]   gone in 60 seconds
