[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Two big stories.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.640]   This week, Jeff, Gina, Kevin Marks will join us to talk about
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.720]   the passing of Aaron Schwartz and his legacy.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.080]   Mighty that it is. We'll also talk about the new Google Social Graph Search.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.080]   Might even explain what that means. It's all coming up next, Antuig.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.080]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.080]   From people you trust.

[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.080]   This week in Google, the show and I get a caution you.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.080]   Because this show is not going to be much about Google.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.080]   The show that covers the cloud, the internet, media, society.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.080]   Larger issues as well as just, you know, what's new with Google.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.080]   Let's introduce the panel for today.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.080]   As always, the wonderful Gina Trapani from SmarterWeird.org
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.080]   and The Think Up.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.080]   Great to have you, Gina.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.080]   She's in Brooklyn.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.080]   Great to be here.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.080]   I'm in Manhattan at the moment.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.080]   I'm being generously hosted by 20 by 200, which is sublosing a space in the four square office.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.080]   Oh, cool.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.080]   That's a nice office.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   I've seen that.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.080]   Yeah, beautiful office.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   Yeah, it's really, really nice.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.080]   And there's something very satisfying about being able to check in at four square on four square.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.080]   [laughter]
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.080]   This is magic.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.080]   Yeah, it's just this very meta.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.080]   Very meta.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.080]   Jeff Jarvis is also off site.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.080]   Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.080]   Hi, Jeff.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.080]   I'm in Rhode Island.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080]   I'm in Rhode Island at Bryant University.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.080]   I gave a talk to the Helen Library Consortium today, following David Wernberger, or David
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.080]   Wernberger very hard.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.080]   David, not Dave.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.080]   And the great thing is, you know, you go anywhere in this country, in this world.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.080]   I go downstairs.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.080]   Two people come up to me.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.080]   They're Twit fans.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.080]   They're Twig fans.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.080]   Dave Gannon here at Bryant happens to be a teacher's technology, and he also did tech support.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.080]   So he answered my questions about the network.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.080]   This is the wonder of Leo Leborton-Twit.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.080]   Your network is everywhere.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.080]   Yay!
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.080]   Well, I grew up down the road from them, so...
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   Wow!
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   I know the area pretty well.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.080]   That's great.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.080]   Good to have you, and thanks to the folks at Bryant University for letting you use their
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   facility.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.080]   And from his garden, where he always appears, like a garden gnome.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.080]   Kevin Marks.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.080]   Hi there.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.080]   Tomovision.tv and Salesforce.com.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.080]   Hello, Kevin.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   Kevin asked to be on today because he knew we would be talking, and there really...
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.080]   ...only a couple of big stories today.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   One, of course, the Aaron Swartz story, but the other, the Facebook social graph story.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.080]   And in both of these, I think Kevin Marks will certainly have a lot to say.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.080]   I'll try and join in, yes.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.080]   And they're kind of right in your wheelhouse, as we Americans are wanted to say.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.080]   But before we do that, I think it'd be a good time to play the trumpets and announce...
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.080]   The changelog!
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.080]   Go changelog!
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   changelog!
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.080]   Uggle changelog time.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.080]   For those of you into the Uggle...
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.080]   By the way, I might mention, Google has a good search front page today with the...
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.080]   Oh, yeah, the Google Doodle is exciting today.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.080]   Yeah, we just show this before we get into the changelog.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.080]   It's got a little Zamboni machine.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.080]   And if you press play, you get to play the Zamboni game.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.080]   Or something.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.080]   What am I doing?
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.080]   [Laughs]
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.080]   Or tells you.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.080]   I love games where there's no text.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.080]   Okay, got it, yes.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.080]   It's the idea of games.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.080]   Oh, you're supposed to clean up the mess with a Zamboni, see?
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.080]   Somebody's...
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.080]   Some...
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.080]   Those damn skaters, they make a heck of a mess.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.080]   Get off my ice!
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.080]   Get off of my ice!
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.080]   What is this to commemorate, Gina?
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.080]   Um...
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.080]   Mr. Zamboni would be very old if you were alive today at his birthday.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.080]   Ooh!
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.080]   Ooh!
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.080]   What is this?
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.080]   I'm looking for the mouse over.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.080]   What is this to commemorate?
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.080]   I'm honestly not sure, but I think I come up for rearing.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.080]   It is Zamboni's birthday.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.080]   Okay, that's his name.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080]   I think so, yeah.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.080]   Oh, it's Zamboni's birthday.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.080]   It's even got an 8-bit sound.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.080]   [Music]
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.080]   [Sings]
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.080]   [Sings]
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.080]   I beat you.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.080]   Okay, Chad's gonna play now.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.080]   Good luck, Chad.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.080]   Sorry, I'm not getting your audio from your...
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.080]   Oh, I know, I know, I know.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.080]   So you have to do yours.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.080]   Zamboni, I'm sure it's France's Xavier, but Frank Zamboni would be 112 years old today.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.080]   Holy cow.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.080]   Which is...
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.080]   Oh, geez, yeah.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.080]   Zamboni machine, for those who don't know, is used on skating rink's...
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.080]   I remember going to Ice Hockey Games at Brown University, just down the road from you there.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:38.080]   Jeff Jarvis, and it's an amazing contraption that involves levers, steam, it comes out,
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.080]   it runs over the ice and makes it fresh and new again, melting and re-freezing it as...
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.080]   The problem with the game ones is that you can't...
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.080]   Normally, you can click on the...
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   The doodle and get search results for the thing that it represents, but with this, you click on it and it's just the game starts and it's hard to tell.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.080]   We don't know.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.080]   Yeah, it was kind of like that the Google's kind of the doodle sort of educational.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.080]   You're like, "Oh, today is...
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.080]   It's crazy holiday I've never heard of, but with this one, it's hard to tell what it is."
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.080]   And you're just like, "Oh, it's a Zamboni.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.080]   Exciting."
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   You got a massive amount of gas.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.080]   It's kind of...
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.080]   I don't know, it's just crazy.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.080]   I think they've realized these are a big selling point.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.080]   And the only reason the Zamboni is popular is because it's got a great name.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.080]   And because it is kind of a contraption.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.080]   It's a cool machine.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.080]   But when the US opened and it rains, they've got the hot weather version of it, which shows in vacuums up all the water.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.080]   [laughter]
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.080]   Frank Zamboni and the ice resurfacing machine.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.080]   Eight years...
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.080]   Eight years of...
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.080]   It's every Minnesota kid's hero.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.080]   He's an Italian American from Minnesota, I guess.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.080]   Yeah, he's a Paisam.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.080]   He's a Paisam.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.080]   That's cool.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.080]   What else is new at Google?
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.080]   We got a couple new things this week.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   Google added high res photo zoom to Google+.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.080]   More and more, it feels like Google+ is really becoming a photo sharing network.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:13.080]   So if you go to Google+ post that has a high res image in it, you click on the high res image, you get the regular kind of light box.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.080]   But then you can use your mouse wheel to scroll in, you can zoom in pan on an image.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.080]   So I think I dropped a link to an example post there that has a high res image in the dock.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.080]   And yeah, click on one of those images and you'll see.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.080]   You can zoom in.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.080]   Wow.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.080]   So are these like gigapan style images?
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.080]   Yeah, if you...
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.080]   So on my Mac, I have to sort of do the two finger scroll on my trackpad to get it to work.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.080]   Let's see.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.080]   It's...
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.080]   Where you can click.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.080]   Should I do it, Chad?
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.080]   All right.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.080]   Sorry.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.080]   I should have prepped you for this.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.080]   I should have prepped you for this demo.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.080]   Wait.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.080]   Oh, I just got it.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.080]   I just got it.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.080]   So what's weird is on my Mac, it looks like I'm scrolling to the left and to the right,
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.080]   which is problematic because that's how you go forward and backwards.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.080]   That's pretty neat.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:14.080]   So that box shows up in the top top left and you can really see detail on high resolution images.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.080]   That is nice.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.080]   Is there a checkbox you have to...
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.080]   Or just automatically just did it.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.080]   It's just the trackpad.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.080]   You have to kind of drag and zoom on your trackpad.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.080]   Maybe I can...
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.080]   Come on.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.080]   I'm going to see if you have a mouse.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.080]   Oh, there we go.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.080]   There's the thingy.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.080]   The thingy.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.080]   I had trouble like getting a thingy to...
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.080]   Initiating the thingy at first, but once you start to do it...
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.080]   You can't stop it.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.080]   I love it when you contact a Chingita.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.080]   Yeah, I know.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.080]   I know.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.080]   I'm getting very technical.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.080]   You have two fingers on a Mac trackpad works great.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.080]   Right, right.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.080]   Or you could use your mouse scroll wheel.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.080]   That's probably what you're supposed to do.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.080]   Yeah, that's probably what you're supposed to do.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.080]   Yep.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.080]   So what else?
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.080]   Oh, Chrome Beta for Android has been released.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.080]   So this is actually difficult to find in the Play Store.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.080]   If you search Chrome in the Play Store, it won't show up.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.080]   But if you search for Chrome Beta for Android in Google itself,
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.080]   you'll get the Play Store link.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.080]   It's just a few versions ahead.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.080]   It's basically the equivalent of subscribing to the Beta channel
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.080]   and Chrome on your desktop, which I do anyway.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.080]   It's a little unstable.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.080]   A few more bug fixes.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.080]   You kind of get to test the new stuff before it comes.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.080]   It comes out in the stable release sooner.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.080]   Does it auto update?
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.080]   It does auto update.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.080]   It does auto update.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.080]   So we'll always get a few versions ahead.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.080]   Yep.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.080]   Yep.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.080]   And I've actually switched to the Chrome Beta as my default browser
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.080]   on my Galaxy Nexus.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.080]   And I haven't had any problems.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.080]   I had one problem with ThinkUp, which is the site that I build.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.080]   Now, I have heard reports in all about Android community that it is
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.080]   crashing some devices.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.080]   But the nice thing is you can have both the stable Chrome and the
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.080]   Beta installed on your phone and switch between them.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.080]   The Beta has this little kind of sash that says Beta across the icon.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.080]   So you can test it out if you want.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   And also on the desktop, there's a new stable release of Chrome.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.080]   Not too many big new features, just mostly stability and performance
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.080]   improvements.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.080]   And the Chrome 25 Beta is also now available.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.080]   And it's in the web to speech API, which is the thing that lets you
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.080]   talk to your browser and give it voice commands.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.080]   That's now available.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.080]   So that's kind of exciting.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.080]   On Android 2, we're just on the desktop.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.080]   This is on the desktop.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.080]   This is Chrome 25 Beta on the desktop.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:26.080]   My other favorite Android app, although I have lots of favorite Android apps,
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.080]   but Google now gets boarding passes.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.080]   So this is really cool.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.080]   If you've booked a flight and in your Gmail you have the confirmation
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.080]   number on a flight and then you arrive at an airport, I'm actually
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.080]   really excited to try this because I've got a JetBlue flight back to San
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.080]   Diego.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.080]   And when I show up at JFK, in theory, if it's all working, Google
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.080]   now is going to pop up a card that says, hey, here's your boarding
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.080]   pass and gives me my barcode to scan at the gate.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.080]   What's a little weird about this is Google has announced that this
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.080]   feature is shipping, and they said that it works with select
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.080]   airlines, but they haven't said what airlines it works with.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.080]   So it's kind of a crapshoot at this point.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.080]   But I'm excited about that.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.080]   In fact, I think we talked about this a few shows ago.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.080]   If you have booked flights and the confirmation is in your Gmail,
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.080]   if you search on google.com for the phrase, my flights, the one box,
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.080]   comes up and says, hey, your flight's on time.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.080]   Here's when it leaves.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.080]   Here's when it arrives.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.080]   That totally works for me now.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.080]   Like my upcoming flight is showing up there.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.080]   So this is just the Google now card is sort of an extension of that.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:33.080]   And finally, in Gmail, signature tweaks, which was a labs feature
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:39.080]   that let you put your signature above the quoted text and erase
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:43.080]   the little, the two dashes that show up by default, that used to be
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.080]   Gmail labs.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.080]   So you can see that it's not the same.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.080]   It's not the same thing.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.080]   So you can see it's the same thing.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.080]   So you can see it's the same thing.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.080]   So you can see it's the same thing.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.080]   So you can see it's the same thing.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.080]   And you can see it's the same thing.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.080]   And you can see it's the same thing.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.080]   And you can see it's the same thing.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.080]   And you can see it's the same thing.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:17.080]   [MUSIC]
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:22.080]   Let's start with Aaron Swartz because it's not quite old news, but it's almost old news
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.080]   now.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:28.080]   As many know, Aaron, 26 years old, a young man who really had made a huge difference and
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:35.080]   was unique in a number of respects, one of which he was apparently a technology genius,
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:40.080]   who instead of trying to make a billion dollars in betting the next YouTube, devoted his
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.080]   time to the public wheel and in fact did quite a bit of good.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:51.080]   Kevin, I gather you, he, we should mention he passed away on Friday, killed himself on
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.080]   Friday.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.080]   Karen, I gather you knew him fairly well.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:00.080]   I met him first met him back in 2002 when he was 15 or so.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.080]   Wow.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.080]   And he was working on web standards.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:08.080]   And I think he was one of the first people who sort of appeared out of the net and said
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:14.080]   hi, because we were chatting online in various web standards groups, RSS and some of the
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.080]   web staff.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.080]   And he mentioned he was visiting California and could he come and visit me?
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.080]   And I was at Apple at the time and said, sure, come for lunch.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.080]   And I was surprised when this young kid turned up.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.080]   He was always fairly small when he was younger.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.080]   He got a bit bigger later on.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:37.080]   He was like, oh, but he was, you know, but he's, he was always very, very sharp and brilliant.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:45.080]   And it was one of those, one of those experiences of that we had in the early days of blogging
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.080]   where we felt like we were a small community anyway.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.080]   And we were all, you know, talking about the web and standards and Aaron was making
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.080]   significant contributions to that.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:03.080]   And he was, he'd moved to being homeschooled or unscored rather than going to high school.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.080]   And so was therefore working on stuff at home, which meant the net was his connection to the
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.080]   rest of the world.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.080]   And he took advantage of that.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.080]   He rewrote a very good piece, well, several groupies, and one on how to get the job I have,
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:19.080]   where he talked about his history of that and where he said that the main thing is curiosity.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.080]   And he spent all his time reading everything he could.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:26.080]   And what he felt that not going to high school meant that he didn't have the curiosity knocked
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.080]   out of him being forced to, he didn't want to.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   And so he was able to focus on the, on the things that inspired him and keep working on them.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:38.080]   And he did lots of really, you know, really useful stuff.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.080]   One of his, one of his early credits was working on RSS.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.080]   What, what did he do for the spec?
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.080]   Here's a picture, by the way, while you're talking, I'm showing a picture of him talking to Larry Lessig.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.080]   And this is roughly around 14 years old.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.080]   That's about when he, yeah, that was about the time when he.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:15:00.080]   And the amazing thing is here you see a Stanford law professor, not merely patronizing or indulging
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.080]   a kid, but really talking to him.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.080]   And in fact, this, these conversations led, led to creative commons, which Aaron wrote the
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:15.080]   first iteration of a 14 year old for a constitution, an acknowledged constitutional scholar, one
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.080]   of the foremost constitutional scholars in the United States.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.080]   So he obviously must have had some obvious brilliance at that age.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.080]   He was a genius.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.080]   He was a genius.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.080]   He was a genius.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.080]   You knew him too.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.080]   Gina, did you?
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.080]   I did.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.080]   I did.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.080]   I met him a couple of times at food camp.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.080]   I think I met him.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.080]   I think I played werewolf with him and now I've forgotten.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.080]   You know, I had followed his work for so long that I, when I met him at food camp, I was actually
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:46.080]   at a table sitting next to him and I was too starstruck to, to talk to, to engage, like,
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.080]   test, start a conversation.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.080]   I kind of stared at him a little bit and that was it.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.080]   And now I really regret it.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.440]   But anyway, yeah, he would have never said that he's a genius.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.600]   He had a humility about it.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.640]   He said, Oh, well, you know, it's really just curiosity, but the reality is he was a genius.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.400]   So tell us about the RSS contribution.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.360]   Well, he worked, I'm going to get to the history of RSS too much, but he was, he was
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.120]   very much involved with the, the RDF worldview, which was Tim Berners Lee model model of the
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.480]   web or the future of the web, which is all about connecting things with links.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:23.480]   But everything's a sort of three part verb, three part sentence and the middle.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.880]   So you've got a subject, a predicate and another, an object and each of those things
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.040]   are URLs and it's sort of a very abstract way of specifying the web.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.560]   And it's one of those things that in some ways is over over abstracted.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.840]   I think, you know, we've sort of realized that it's actually quite hard to express stuff
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.640]   in that form and keep it consistent and things have changed.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.400]   But it was around 2000.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.680]   It was, it was very exciting and Aaron leaped on this and helped build the iteration of
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.720]   RSS that was based on RDF, which was RSS 1.0.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.240]   And then there was a whole bunch of back and forth and with Dave Weiner and others.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:03.240]   And there was a non-RDF version of RSS, RSS 2 became the main line one.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:08.760]   And then Aaron as a, as a, as a prank almost invented RSS 3, which was one without any
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.520]   XML in it at all and was just plain text.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:18.120]   And so there was, he was, even when he was playing jokes like that, he actually wrote
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.800]   a very coherent spec that was actually useful and passable.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:26.920]   If you look up RSS 3, you read and you go, oh, yeah, that's almost Jason really.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.960]   But it was him just sort of playing with the idea of, oh, you think that's too, you think
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.480]   RDF's too complicated?
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.640]   Well, XML's too complicated.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.640]   Here's this thing.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:40.160]   So he was, you know, he was like a lot of brilliant people.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:45.760]   He was always sort of dancing around, how do I explain this to you?
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.400]   But he wasn't nasty about it.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.320]   I mean, he could, he could probe at you and sort of show you up by, you know, by being
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.440]   smart, but he didn't tend to be nasty about it.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.280]   Here's a great picture of Aaron with Doug Engelbart on the right, the man who invented
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.000]   the computer mouse.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.960]   And on the left, Ted Nelson, who was one of the early proponents of hypertext.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.960]   Wow, what a kid.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.960]   Is that an amazing picture?
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.680]   But, you know, and some of you, we want to focus on, you know, everyone said he did
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.240]   all his amazing things when he was 15, who it's true, but he carried on doing amazing
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.240]   things.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:23.960]   He went on, he went to Stanford for a year and then dropped out because he decided he
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.600]   wasn't learning enough, it wasn't intellectual enough.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.680]   And then he went in the very first Y Combinator class, because Paul Graham rang about and
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.760]   said, "I'm doing this thing, I think you'd enjoy it."
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:42.200]   And he built Infogami there, which was again a sort of public, public editable web thing.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:48.640]   But then Merck worked with the guys who'd founded Reddit and basically helped them pull
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.800]   it from lists to Python so it would actually scale on the web.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:58.800]   And then went with them for the first two years or so of Reddit until they got bought
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.800]   out by...
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.800]   I didn't ask.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   I didn't ask.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   Yes.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.600]   And that moved him to...
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.240]   They moved all to San Francisco and put them in the wild offices.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.440]   And he didn't like that very much and eventually sort of flaked out of that and moved away
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.440]   again.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:19.840]   Kevin Paulson tells a story of when Aaron arrived at the Wired offices, newly rich from
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.040]   the acquisition of Reddit and said, "I would like to...
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.360]   I would like, if you wouldn't mind, to write an article about an ongoing trial about a
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.080]   fairly obtrusive topic in intellectual property law."
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.840]   And Kevin says he wrote a brilliant article.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.000]   He was a great writer.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.400]   He's obviously an amazingly talented person.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.560]   Well, that was the thing.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.560]   He was always interested in the politics and sociology of the web as well.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:53.720]   And part of that was working with Lessek and Coa Creative Commons to construct that.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:58.400]   He also got very into reading Noam Chomsky and the theory of the sociology of power and
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.920]   all that stuff.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.480]   And so after he'd done Reddit, he founded a lot of political action groups.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.480]   He was extremely...
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.680]   The Man Progress was one, of course.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.560]   The Man Progress was the one that he originally built to stop Koika, which was the pre-sessed
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.600]   of SOPA, but became a general activism tool.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.120]   And absolutely instrumental in stopping SOPA and PIPA.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.560]   There's a really good speech of him at...
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.600]   If you search for Aaron Schwartz, SOPA on YouTube, you'll find it, which is him who
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.000]   is attempting to freedom to connect, I think.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.640]   It's about 20 minutes long, which I recommend everyone to watch because it's him summarizing
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:43.520]   what happened with the history of the SOPA Revolt, and it's this wonderful piece of speech-making.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.520]   And it will give you a feel for...
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.240]   Because we've seen all these photos of him as 40 years old.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:54.560]   This was last autumn, and it gave you a feel for the guy he grew up into and the stuff
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.040]   he was trying to do.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:06.080]   And then he spent a lot of time working on how do we create open public resources.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.600]   So he wrote the specs for and built the first iteration of the open library thing that they
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:18.160]   have at the Internet Archive, which is an index of all the books that exist and designed
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.800]   to derive from existing lifespan databases and things like that.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:29.520]   So that there's a effectively universal card index for books that isn't just Amazon numbers.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.480]   And that's been hooked up now to the scans that the Internet Archive is doing so that
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.560]   they're trying to collate all books that have been published to in a way that is actually
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:42.360]   a public resource in parallel with the stuff that Amazon and Google have done with the
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.360]   publishers.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:49.480]   He obviously embraced one of the fundamental hacker tenets that information wants to be
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.480]   free.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.720]   He said information is power, but like all power, there are those who want to keep it
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.720]   to themselves.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:00.160]   And he really worked very actively to get these silos of information that should be public
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.160]   released.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:08.160]   And Leo, I think that's the key to the, you know, I unfortunately don't, I don't think
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.160]   I met him.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.800]   I mean, maybe at the same conference at some point, quite possibly, but I learned a lot
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.920]   from him.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.000]   And in what he did with Jay's store, and of course that's what led to all of his legal
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.560]   troubles was that he downloaded millions of articles from an MIT closet on the screen.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.640]   Well, it wasn't the first time he'd done it.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:28.120]   In fact, it's important to note that he got first got in trouble with the FBI for something
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.600]   that wasn't a crime.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:36.520]   But there's a database of court precedents of court decisions called charging for the
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:43.440]   government was charging a dollar or it is absolutely public material.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.800]   It's court decisions.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:51.000]   He used, I'd said much of the money that he made from Reddit to buy PASER documents and
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   put them into an open database called recap, which is not illegal.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.240]   But I still, you know, Harris didn't want to after him.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:06.760]   And it's said that that really was the beginning of this antipathy between him and the feds.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:12.160]   So then he downloaded the stuff from Jay's store, which is academic articles and you
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.680]   know, I won't recount that whole thing.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:21.520]   But that led to a harassment of prosecution, the fear of a huge amount of time in jail,
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.600]   the loss of all the money he had, all this uncertainty.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:31.520]   And I think he's being portrayed sometimes as if that was a protest or an act of civil
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.520]   disobedience.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.520]   But I think it was an example.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.520]   I think it was a lesson.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.840]   And what he taught me, just to your point that you just made Leo, is that it's not that
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.600]   information wants to be free.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.000]   It's kind of a lesson that I learned from him in this.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.920]   It's the way I put it in a post this week is that as the question is, does knowledge
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.480]   want to be content?
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.960]   So you know, the content wants to be free is the argument people like me get accused
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.480]   and say, well, you just want to make it all free.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.920]   Well, no, but I do want knowledge to be free.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.720]   I want knowledge to be freed up.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.600]   And I gave this talk here today at this library conference and I put up a picture of free
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.800]   willy.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.480]   And you know, he freed the whale.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.600]   Well, what Aaron was really doing was freeing the whale of knowledge from the tank of Jay's
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.960]   store.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:21.240]   And we're stuck in our old models of thinking that you can own content and thus own the
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.320]   knowledge that comes into it.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.320]   And that's what he was about.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.560]   When information wants to be free, when knowledge wants to be freed up, that's what we should
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.560]   all be about.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.560]   That's what he was really about.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:35.400]   And it really changed a lot of my view about the basic architecture of media.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.720]   And that was from his actions.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:47.440]   So you know, his own family released a statement basically blaming federal prosecutors and
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.440]   MIT for his death.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.160]   Now they acknowledged that he'd had, and I don't have any knowledge of this, but that
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.720]   he'd had long, long time battle with depression anyway.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.400]   He'd written about it.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.400]   He blogged about that.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.600]   Yeah, openly talked about it.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:08.040]   But they were very clear that they believed that now what happened was Jay's store, which
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.360]   is the commercial entity that he downloaded this stuff from.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.840]   He did it by the way.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.720]   And everybody I've seen talk about this, including Kevin Polson and others say this
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.880]   was not a hack in any sense of the word.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.040]   He used, so he was at Harvard at the time.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.920]   He went to MIT where Jay's store is openly available to anybody on the MIT network for
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:36.880]   free and started downloading vast quantities of material and began a count and mouse game
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:42.360]   with MIT authorities who were trying to stop it, eventually put a laptop in a closet and
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.120]   downloaded, I think it was 4 million, 4.8 million documents from Jay's store.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.120]   This is that repository of academic papers.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:58.240]   And this is what he got in trouble for wire fraud and theft.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.280]   And the implication being that he somehow wanted to benefit financially from it, it's
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.360]   pretty clear that was never the intent.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:11.160]   He did, when first confronted, apparently run from the police, but eventually turned himself
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.160]   in.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.520]   He gave the distrives to Jay's store.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.760]   Jay's store dropped their complaint.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.080]   Well, that's the interesting thing.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.400]   Jay's store dropped their complaint, but MIT did not.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.400]   Now MIT has launched an investigation into how they behaved, obviously embarrassed by
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.400]   what happened.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:37.440]   And eventually they had a mixed message according to what I've read that maybe they did, but
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.680]   it was sufficient for federal prosecutors to continue their prosecution.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.720]   Had both parties said, no, we don't want to press charges.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.080]   I don't know if the feds would have gone ahead.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.080]   It would have been harder for them, but the problem is they'd already got the investigation
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.080]   going.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.520]   And there's some, the Secret Service was involved.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.840]   There was a bunch of other stuff going on.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:03.480]   And there's some discussion that it may have been connected to some of the other hacking
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.640]   incidents in the cam-chatting community.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:12.280]   So, you know, WikiLeaks and connections with and occupying those things and trying to use
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.080]   him as pressure on others and that kind of thing.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   It's not clear.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.520]   And the problem is that it was very hard for anyone to talk about this because if you do
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.080]   talk about it, you then get subpoenaed to testify against him.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:34.680]   And so, when he was first arraigned, I talked to some of his close friends and they said,
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.880]   yes, I'm being called before the jury and I don't want to talk to you about it so you
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.560]   don't get cooked, dragged in too.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.640]   So, there was this prosecutorial intimidation thing that made it very hard for people to
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.280]   discuss it.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.080]   And it was very hard for him to sort of talk about it in public and try and get people
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:55.240]   to raise money for his defense because that was also seen as, you know, subdued to say
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.360]   in effect.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:01.480]   So, there was an enormous amount of pressure on him from that angle as well.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.360]   You know, this is sometimes called a terms of service prosecution.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:11.360]   He was violating terms of service and being charged with a charge that eventually could
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.400]   have cost him 35 years in jail and several million dollars in fines.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:20.000]   The story went that the feds offered him a plea bargain down to, he'd have to plead
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.640]   guilty and six months in jail, which he turned down because I think rightly so.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.000]   He felt that no jail time was appropriate for those.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.920]   And also he'd have to be given the 13 felonies.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.920]   They wouldn't, they weren't.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.440]   He'd be a felon for the rest of his life.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.240]   God knows what else they would require about his connection to the internet.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.360]   Look, look what the feds have done in other cases.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:29:01.780]   The Mid-
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:05.780]   We went on Reddit and I think it's a really appropriate place for her to announce this
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:10.740]   and said, I'm representative Zolofgren and I'm introducing Aaron's law to change the
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:17.260]   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to eliminate these terms of service crimes.
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:23.300]   Because part of the problem here too is this is a case where we're treating technology
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:28.420]   differently and we're making the same crime that would be, that would be perpetrated in
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.300]   other ways, Xeroxone or other ways.
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.700]   It's much worse because it's computers and computers are scaring and computers are dangerous.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:39.860]   And we're still in that mode where we thus demonize the potential use of technology for
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:43.700]   all of us and this kind of prosecution affects all of us.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.020]   And so we've got to ramp that down.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.980]   That idea of technology is different.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:54.540]   Her bill would eliminate criminal fines and punishment for this kind of exceeds authorized
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:30:00.820]   access crime, which is the crimes he was charged with and currently you can get a jail for
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:05.940]   a very long time for exceeding authorized access.
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:10.700]   Well this is the CFA was written a long time ago.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:17.140]   It was written when computers were huge expensive boxes that required people to maintain them
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.300]   and attend them.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:23.980]   They were very hard to connect together and they were, you know, they were fortified in
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:24.980]   effect.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.060]   And now we carry three of them around in our pockets every day and this law has not been
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.620]   amended since.
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:33.380]   And that is so there's all these if you actually look at the things he was accused of, they
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:41.500]   are these sort of bizarre technicalities like exceeding authorized access and things
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.860]   that all of us do 25 times a day.
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:49.100]   And there are two other people who are currently in cases like that.
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:56.620]   There's, I can't remember this is a real name, Rabbi, is his RAB IT, is his Twitter handle,
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:06.380]   and has been prosecuted because he exposed AT&T's insecure records of people with iPhones,
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:11.660]   which he did by incrementing the ID number for each user as you do when you do a database.
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.180]   Was it so hard was it?
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.540]   So he has been prosecuted for adding one to a number.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.540]   Andrew, Andrew Arnheimer.
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.540]   Andrew Arnheimer that's it.
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.460]   And there's, you know, there are other cases like this.
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:25.900]   And in fact this is, you know, we know about this one primarily because Aaron committed suicide
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.580]   and we can now talk about it.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:34.900]   But this same technique is used all the time in computer cases to intimidate.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:39.540]   And sometimes they're doing this because there is actual fraud going on and theft and the
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:43.180]   Boston Process Security Office has caught some people who are hacking into credit card
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.420]   machines and things like that point of sale systems.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.980]   And so they used to that way, that world for you, they used to like we have these criminals
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:54.020]   and we have to treat them as criminals and used to expand in the law that way.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:59.460]   And in some ways I think, you know, Aaron was like the, you know, in Bonfire the Vannities,
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.820]   they have the Great White defendant.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:05.900]   They finally caught someone who isn't poor and they want to show that the law is even
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.140]   so they want to prosecute him too.
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:11.220]   I think there was some of that going on as well as this, um, hacking.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:16.060]   There's a piece, there's a little bit in the, I'll see if I can find the clip for you
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:20.220]   in Aaron's speech to freedom to connect where he talks about talking to a congressman and
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:21.220]   the anger that he has.
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:27.620]   So I'll find that clip and dig it out for you and put it in the chat panel.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:28.620]   It's all, we're all in agreement.
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:35.620]   It's a great tragedy for him and his family and partner, but also a great loss for our
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.860]   community.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.340]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:44.940]   And the behavior of MIT probably and certainly of the federal prosecutors is shameful.
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:50.780]   You know, looking back at his work at his blog and at his talks, you know, he talked
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:51.780]   about depression.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.740]   He, you know, he talked about the depression he gave a lot of talks.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.500]   He also in 2002 posted his will.
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.100]   Uh, I mean, he was very, he believed very strongly that you should live in public and
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.100]   you should share information.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.500]   In fact, part of his will, I mean, you know, it's, it's kind of a jokey page.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.180]   It's like, Hey, if I get hit by a bus, like this is what I need you to do.
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:14.500]   And he actually asked that he, he named someone as his, you know, person to execute his wishes.
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:19.980]   And one of his wishes is that all his entire hard drive is published online after his death.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:24.580]   Like he uses a very strong believer in sharing information and living in public and, and,
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:28.300]   and even just reading back through his blog post from when he was, you know, a young kid
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.700]   going through sort of awkward phases of growing up and crushes and, and, and all sorts of
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:36.100]   things and his sort of musings on what it's like to walk into a room and have everyone
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.180]   stare at you because you're 15.
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:44.220]   Um, you know, being judged from, from your looks versus being online, it's, it's, um, it's
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.220]   fascinating.
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:48.900]   And you know, he, as far as I know, he didn't leave a note, but, uh, but he left lots of
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.980]   notes, you know, there's, he left his trail of work behind him.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.180]   And, and you know, and I think that the fact that he, this happened on the, the anniversary
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:59.700]   of, of the, of his arrest, uh, was, um, was, it says a lot.
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:00.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:01.700]   As much of a note as you need.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.420]   It's just, uh, it's so tragic, so hard.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:10.140]   And you know, it's, what's interesting is how, uh, how much it rocked the internet community.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:14.500]   A lot of people who didn't know him, uh, were just as affected by those who did.
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:19.300]   I mean, it was, it was really a shocker, uh, and so sad.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:24.380]   Um, there are a number of tributes to him and the internet archives.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.660]   They're putting together an archive of, uh, Aaron, uh, SW memorabilia.
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:34.940]   Um, there's a tribute to him on Twitter, uh, hashtag PDF tribute where academics are publishing
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:35.940]   illegally.
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.940]   They're academic articles.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:38.940]   Oh, I remember.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.940]   They have the copyright.
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.380]   Well, if they have the copyright, I don't think they always have the copyright.
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.380]   I think often the institution is actually right.
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:46.380]   They're supposed to assign it to the journals.
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:50.900]   Yes, which is, I've, uh, I've liberated a few J store documents and Aaron's name this
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:51.900]   week.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.900]   There's a book, Marklet in order to do that.
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:53.900]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:55.900]   I did that.
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:56.900]   That was, yeah.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.900]   That's, uh, yeah.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.900]   Mm hmm.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:34:59.900]   Mm hmm.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:00.900]   That's definitely through the week.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.900]   So there are lots of ways to, um, honor him.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.900]   So I put a link to the clip in the, in the, in the chat room.
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.900]   Mm hmm.
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:05.900]   I'm sure we're the best place to put it.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:06.900]   Is that good?
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:07.900]   Can you see that?
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.900]   Yep.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.060]   Um, I look at that clip and him talking about talking to a Senator about, um, the law, because
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:16.580]   that this marks the attitude that he was, he was met with.
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.940]   Uh, Chad, I don't know if you have my audio, uh, yet or not.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:24.300]   Let me play it and see if, if you do and if you don't, then you can play it.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.500]   Chad Johnson has control of the helm at the con here.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.860]   Talking and I got introduced to a US Senator, one of the strongest proponents of the original
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.580]   Koyka bill, in fact.
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:39.220]   And I asked him why despite being such a progressive, despite giving a speech in favor
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:44.740]   of civil liberties, why he was supporting a bill that would censor the internet.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:49.420]   And you know that typical politician smile he had suddenly faded from his face and his
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:54.140]   eyes started burning this fiery red and he started shouting at me.
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:58.140]   So those people on the internet, they think they can get away with anything.
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:01.380]   They think they can just put anything up there and there's nothing we can do to stop
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:02.380]   them.
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.380]   They put up everything.
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.220]   They put up our nuclear missiles and they just laugh at us.
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.420]   Well, we're going to show them.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.820]   There's got to be laws on the internet.
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.260]   It's got to be under control.
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.820]   Now as far as I know, nobody has ever put up the US's nuclear missiles on the internet.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.940]   I mean, it's just not something I've heard about.
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.340]   But that's sort of the point.
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.620]   He wasn't having a rational concern, right?
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.420]   Was this a rational fear that things were out of control.
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:33.500]   Here was this man, a United States Senator and those people on the internet, they were
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.100]   just mocking him.
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.420]   They had to be brought under control.
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:40.460]   Things had to be under control.
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.860]   And I think that was the attitude of Congress.
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:49.220]   And just as seeing that fire in that Senator's eyes scared me, I think those hearings scared
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.220]   a lot of people.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.300]   They saw this wasn't the attitude of a thoughtful government trying to resolve trade-offs in
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.340]   order to best represent its citizens.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.740]   It was more like the attitude of a tyrant.
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:05.660]   And so the citizens fought back.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:09.100]   The wheels came off the bus pretty quickly after that hearing.
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:13.540]   First the Republican senators pulled out and then the White House issued a statement opposing
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.540]   the bill.
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.780]   And then the Democrats left all alone out there.
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:21.060]   And now it's they were putting the bill on hold so they could have a few further discussions
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.340]   before the official vote.
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:30.500]   And that was when it was for me to believe after all this, we had won.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.140]   The thing that everyone said was impossible.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:36.220]   That some of the biggest companies in the world had written off as kind of a pipe dream
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.620]   had happened.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.980]   We did it.
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.460]   We won.
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:47.340]   And then we started rubbing it in.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:48.500]   You all know what happened next.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.140]   Wikipedia went black.
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.580]   Reddit went black.
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.100]   Craigslist went black.
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.260]   The phone lines on Capitol Hill flat-out melted.
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:00.020]   Members of Congress started rushing to issue statements, retracting their support for the
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.740]   bill that they were promoting just a couple days ago.
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.740]   It was just ridiculous.
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:08.540]   I mean, there's a chart from the time that captures it pretty well.
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.100]   It says something like January 14th on one side.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:14.260]   It has this big, long list of names supporting the bill.
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:17.340]   And then just a few lonely people opposing it.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.940]   And then on the other side it says January 15th.
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.260]   And now it's totally reversed.
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.660]   Everyone is opposing it.
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:28.540]   Just a few lonely names still hanging on in support.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.460]   I mean, this really was unprecedented.
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.940]   Don't take my word for it.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:37.820]   But ask former Senator Chris Dodd, now the chief lobbyist for Hollywood.
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:42.900]   He admitted after he lost that he had mastermind the whole evil plan.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.700]   And he told the New York Times he'd never seen anything like it during his many years
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:47.700]   in Congress.
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.700]   And everyone I've spoken to agrees.
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:54.740]   But people rose up and they caused a sea change in Washington.
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:58.900]   Not the press, which refused to cover the story, just coincidentally their parent companies
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.300]   all happened to be lobbying for the bill.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:06.500]   Not the politicians who were pretty much unanimously in favor of it.
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:11.620]   And not the companies who had all but given up trying to stop it and decided it was inevitable.
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:17.380]   It was really stopped by the people, the people themselves.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.860]   Aaron Schwartz talking about the reaction to a sofa.
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:27.580]   There's more to it if you want to watch it on YouTube, just how we stopped soap.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.380]   I didn't realize that's almost exactly a year ago.
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.740]   It was a year ago, a couple of days ago.
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.820]   I think it's this Friday.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:39.700]   There's an event in San Francisco to get together about it.
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.540]   Now maybe all those sites will go black for Aaron.
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:45.940]   It might not be a bad way to remember him.
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.380]   Terrible loss, very sad story.
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:53.340]   I don't know if there's a moral to be drawn from it, except we should just re-invigorate
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.020]   it in our work to continue his work.
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.500]   And I think you're absolutely right, Leo.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:01.460]   And there's another angle here to which is, which is another story I just saw online.
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.660]   I didn't put on the run around yet.
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.500]   But also we all, but also in the technology industry, we have to deal with depression
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.060]   and depression among geniuses.
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.140]   And I'm not saying that depression is what made us lose Aaron.
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.700]   He was also hounded, but it was part of it.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:19.260]   And what Corey Dr. Rowe wrote was absolutely beautiful.
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:23.940]   And also the fact that people like Corey and Dana talked about their own demons they've
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.060]   dealt with and this brought that out.
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:27.420]   We've got to let people know they're not alone.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.140]   We've got to talk to them.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.860]   It's far more widespread than we know.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.460]   And that's an issue we have to deal with as well.
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:41.860]   And I think that in our industry, there's people by many, many geniuses who have some
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.460]   difficulties with an insane world.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:50.260]   I think we have to show support and be aware of that.
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:55.260]   Daniel Bryan is one of Aaron's friends, he was on the airplane actually back from Aaron's
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:59.060]   funeral and he just had this just amazing spree on Twitter.
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:00.060]   It was very funny.
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.220]   He's an an alla, M-A-L-A on Twitter.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:06.420]   But he kind of ended this long rant saying that we all need to continue Aaron's work
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:09.620]   and that we have to look at all his public writings and all of the things that he taught
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.340]   us and carry on his good work.
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:15.900]   But there's this one tweet where he said, "Everyone needs to make copies of everything.
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.940]   Civilization does not back up itself."
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:18.940]   I love that.
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.740]   And I was like, that is, that is rad spot on.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.100]   Yeah, I really love that.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.100]   Right.
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:32.540]   Now I think I've just put the link to Danny's tweets in the chat as well.
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:38.700]   The other thing about depression and why it's particularly hard for people who are very
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:49.980]   logical is that what a lot of what depression does is takes away your feeling that you can
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:54.540]   overcome things, your feeling that you are special and the world is not destroyed.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:42:00.340]   In some ways, it makes you hyper rational and takes away the piece of you that says,
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.260]   "Oh, that can't be that bad."
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:11.340]   It's like, in the Hitchhiker's Guide, Douglas Adams has this thing called the total perspective
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:15.580]   vortex and you go into it and it shows you how insignificant you are compared to the
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.980]   rest of the universe.
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:20.580]   And people go mad and die from it.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.620]   It was a comedy thing so that people can share.
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:24.620]   Save five people, brogs.
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:25.620]   Did not get him.
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.620]   Right.
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:31.180]   But that's effectively what depression does to you.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.620]   It makes you think, "I don't matter.
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.620]   The world will be better off without me."
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:41.700]   And I also think that Aaron being as brilliant as he was was put in this situation where he
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.140]   didn't have a way out.
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:50.100]   He was said, "You're either going to go to trial and potentially go to jail for 30 years
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.620]   or you're going to go to jail for six months."
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.660]   And he knew that either way that would break him.
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:43:00.980]   He couldn't manage working in an office that alone going to jail.
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.780]   And he probably saw this as another way out.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:08.620]   And he may have even foreseen how much reaction this would get and probably should bring to
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:09.620]   the thing.
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.620]   We don't know.
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.660]   But that's the position he was put in by those prosecutors.
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.900]   And people are putting that every day by prosecutors.
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.300]   It's just that he was one of us that we see this.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.300]   Yes.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.300]   Well said.
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:24.740]   He's a martyr in the classic sense of the word.
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.780]   And I think his death will have meaning.
[00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:29.500]   I think there's no doubt about that.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:33.940]   But I don't want anyone to think that suicide is the way to get meaning on your life.
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:34.940]   No, no.
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:35.940]   And that's really it.
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.780]   It is so watching that video.
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.260]   There's that video alone.
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:43.380]   Listing all his achievements and watching that video, what we have lost, what suicide
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:49.860]   robbed from first him and his family and his loved ones, but also from all of us.
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:56.260]   And suicide is, God damn it, is not the way out, not the answer.
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.660]   And that's all.
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.660]   We're going to take a break.
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:06.340]   When we come back, I do want to talk about the new Facebook search because I don't know
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:10.460]   whether it's good, bad and different.
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.100]   And there is some Google news.
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.100]   We'll find it.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:19.340]   Mr Schmidt goes to Gong Yang.
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.740]   There's a Google connection to that Facebook story, which we'll talk about.
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:23.740]   Yes.
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:27.500]   In fact, this is probably what Google's long feared.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:28.500]   Should it fear it?
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.500]   That's a good question.
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.340]   All of that's still to come.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.340]   You're watching this week in Google.
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.780]   Kevin Marks, I'm really glad you're here.
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.820]   Thank you for volunteering to come and talk.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:38.060]   We appreciate it.
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:43.620]   From Tumblevision.tv, Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at City University of New York.
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.900]   And he blogs at Buzzmachine.com.
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.300]   Of course, Gina Trapani from SmarterWare.org.
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.660]   And thank you for devoting that time to Aaron.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.780]   You know, it's not the first we did it on Twitter.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.260]   We've done a number of shows.
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:56.260]   Good.
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.260]   I'm glad.
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:01.980]   You know, I feel bad because on triangulation right after this, we're interviewing Alex O'Haney
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.100]   and the founder of Reddit.
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:07.340]   But he asked not to talk about Aaron.
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:11.020]   And I'm not sure for what reasons, but we won't be able to really spend a lot of time
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:13.620]   with him talking about that.
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.780]   Maybe just too painful.
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:23.380]   You may not want to, Alexis may not want to cry on the air.
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.620]   How do you go to a commercial now?
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:34.000]   I should play some happy music and take your mind off all this.

[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:28.420]   Back we go to this week in Google.
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:32.940]   We talked a little bit about Eric Schmidt going to North Korea.
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:33.940]   Just strange.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:38.540]   He says, "Hey, I was fighting for the open web.
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:43.780]   Don't think it's going to fall on the receptive ears, to be honest with you."
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:48.100]   Governor Richardson, former governor of New Mexico, who went with Eric Schmidt to North
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:55.540]   Korea, says Schmidt was a rock star in North Korea.
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.540]   Interesting.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.540]   How do you not go?
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:59.180]   I mean, you're Google.
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:02.220]   You can make a look at the deal.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:04.580]   I'll tell you how you don't go.
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:07.780]   The state department said, "Please don't go."
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:14.300]   This generally happens when you're going to a country that has the sworn enemy of yours.
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:19.460]   People who are in the diplomatic corps would prefer that the amateurs stay home.
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:20.700]   But Richard's not an amateur.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:21.700]   Yes, he is.
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.700]   He's not anything any...
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:26.380]   Well, he's a former UN ambassador, former governor of New Mexico.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.580]   He's not representing the government.
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.580]   No.
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:30.580]   No.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:37.980]   I think there's always a risk when well-meaning amateurs show up in these venues.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:41.660]   And the message was like, "Get on the internet or suffer later?"
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:42.660]   Yeah.
[00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:43.660]   And I can't imagine...
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:44.660]   Just eating a little...
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.460]   Slightly threatening.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:47.460]   Richard's instead...
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:49.460]   That's threatening, but...
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:53.740]   That he believes effective foreign policy requires a mix of government private citizens,
[00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.140]   philanthropic groups, and non-governmental organizations.
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:58.820]   I wouldn't disagree with that, but I just think there's a little risk.
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:03.700]   And we know Eric is a little bit of a loose cannon.
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.780]   It makes me nervous.
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:14.300]   I think that any opportunity you have to put pressure on a recalcitrant backwards, not
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:18.460]   open technology-furing company, country...
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.220]   I don't know.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:28.460]   I mean, look, we're it's government of the people by the people for the people.
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:29.460]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.420]   I mean, any citizen can go anywhere.
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:35.780]   As long as it's understood, he doesn't represent any official point of view.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:41.620]   If he had gone making all buddy buddy, I love you, love you.
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:42.620]   Well, that's the risk.
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.860]   It's the Jane Fonda in a tank.
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.740]   It's the photo op, right?
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:47.740]   Right.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:51.300]   But if you go and you say, "I'm going to use this opportunity to pressure them to try
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:56.300]   to open up this connection to the world for these people," that's a message that I think
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.300]   is okay.
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.300]   You're right.
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.780]   It's a risk because you could be putting a photo opportunity and the photo opportunities
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.060]   for Eric, of course, were hilarious.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:05.060]   It was the mockery of the...
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.060]   The pink shirt.
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:07.060]   The pink shirt.
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:08.060]   Well, it was also the sweater.
[00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:12.660]   Now, I just want to say, Eric, next time you go on a diplomatic mission, can you avoid
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.300]   the pink v-net sweater?
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:15.300]   I'm just saying.
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.300]   And I don't know what the hell Governor Richardson's...
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:18.300]   It's just the way it is, the sweater about sweater.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:19.300]   What does Bill Richardson wear in there?
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.380]   Is that what I'm thinking, Dottra?
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:24.820]   He looks positively British.
[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.380]   They were never without their coats.
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:29.420]   It's obviously, you know, it is a very cold country.
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.420]   It's cold.
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:31.420]   They were never...
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.420]   He talked...
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:39.140]   Governor Richardson talked to North Korea's vice minister for nuclear negotiations and
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:47.260]   said, "You should temper your nuclear development efforts."
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:50.020]   And you know, they pressed about who's being detained.
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:51.020]   You're right.
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:52.020]   You're right.
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:53.020]   I shouldn't be so negative.
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.020]   No, I don't mean to...
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:55.020]   No, you're...
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:56.020]   Don't...
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.620]   Your points are fair, Leo.
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.020]   Yeah, they are.
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:00.020]   I'm just...
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.420]   I had the same struggle.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:02.420]   Is this right or wrong?
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:04.420]   I just ended up at a different spot.
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:05.420]   But no, no, you're...
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.620]   It's quite like Richard Branson went there.
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.380]   I mean, it's at least somebody who's got some dignitas.
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:11.380]   It's not...
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:14.540]   I mean, it's carrot top going to North Korea to try to cheer him up.
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:15.540]   I mean, it's...
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:19.020]   He's fighting for the open web and all of that.
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:25.500]   And meanwhile, the Google Earth put the North Korean Gulag prison system on their maps.
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.060]   So...
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.060]   You know...
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:30.380]   That was convenient.
[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.540]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.980]   That was kind of like a little response.
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:35.100]   I don't know if he showed them.
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:38.140]   Have you seen this?
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:41.860]   All right.
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:46.460]   Moving on.
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:47.460]   Let's talk about...
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:48.460]   I guess we should talk about...
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:49.700]   We only have about half an hour more.
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:53.900]   So, let's get this over with Facebook.
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.300]   Raffs, erch.
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:56.300]   Raffs, erch.
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.660]   First of all, bad name.
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:01.340]   No one in the real world has any idea what a social graph is.
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.620]   I only recently figured it out.
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:04.620]   Exactly.
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:05.620]   I agree.
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:08.980]   But when I said that today, just as a branding thing, geeks went after me.
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:09.980]   Look it up.
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:10.980]   I said, no, no, no.
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:11.980]   It's like branding point.
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:12.980]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:13.980]   But Zuckerberg's favorite word.
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:14.980]   He's always talking about the social graph.
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:16.260]   What did Google call it?
[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:18.060]   Search plus you or something, right?
[00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:20.220]   Yes, search plus your world.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:21.740]   That makes sense to people.
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:24.620]   It was the economy in the supply world, yes.
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:25.780]   It's not very felicitous.
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.380]   At least it's words people understand.
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:33.020]   I don't want to just say social search or just social search.
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.020]   Social search.
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.300]   No, no, I got the brand.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:36.300]   Nozy search.
[00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:37.300]   Nozy search.
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:38.300]   So, that's...
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.900]   Okay, so there's different attitudes towards this.
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:45.860]   If you're a privacy advocate, Facebook is very clear saying, look, you're not going to
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:47.980]   be able to find anything you couldn't find otherwise.
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:51.380]   All the privacy controls you've already established continue to apply.
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.020]   Your friends will see what they can see.
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:54.100]   The public will see what they can see.
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:56.420]   We're not going to breach that barrier.
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:53:01.780]   Nevertheless, I think because you can now search for stuff and because people don't understand
[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:08.500]   Facebook, I keep saying Google, Facebook's privacy settings, there will be lots of inadvertent
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.220]   leaks of information.
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:15.860]   Certainly now's the time to start searching for that pictures of the ex-girlfriend.
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:19.460]   Here's the thing I don't, and maybe it's just I don't use Facebook enough.
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:24.020]   I don't like, I mean, I don't, as a verb, like stuff.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.020]   Right?
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.020]   I don't either.
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:27.020]   I don't.
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.700]   And so, I don't know how many my friends do.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.060]   Maybe it's just an old fart.
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:32.220]   I don't know how valuable it's going to be in.
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:37.900]   It's still in that closed Facebook world where Google gives you the whole world and it uses...
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:42.380]   The other thing is you've got to do an explicit search for friends from Italy who've seen
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:46.460]   this movie, who have a cat in pictures before 1990.
[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:51.700]   It's so bullion about life, whereas what Google tries to do is to just use this knowledge
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:57.340]   behind to feed relevance to you and to make some presumptive decisions.
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:00.380]   Each one, somebody's going to call it creepy, but whatever.
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:02.220]   I just wonder how useful this is.
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:05.460]   I mean, we don't know yet and maybe I'll be surprised, but...
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:06.460]   Rawr!
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:10.740]   It's only as useful as your friends use Facebook and you use Facebook.
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.740]   That's for sure.
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:12.740]   So, just assume out.
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:17.180]   So, Graph Search is the ability to search for people based on criteria.
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.980]   Now, let me just say that I have not used it yet.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.740]   In fact, it hasn't been launched yet.
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:27.060]   You can sign up to be on the wait list at facebook.com/about/graphsearch.
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.380]   But it's basically advanced criteria.
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.860]   So, just what Jeff said.
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:35.500]   You can say, "Show me all the TV shows that people on my friends who are software developers
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.140]   really like.
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:41.060]   Or show me all the pictures of my friends in New York."
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.380]   Or that kind of thing.
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:51.260]   So, likes, location, show me all the people, my friends list who work at Google, for instance.
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:55.020]   So it's just advanced search operators for people within Facebook.
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.660]   I think it would be great with it.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:00.220]   The examples they were giving were really off.
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:03.980]   In particular in the Levy story, it's like single women near me and...
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:06.940]   That's a good one.
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:10.820]   Friends of friends who work at Google as programmers.
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:17.700]   Yeah, well, Anil, my business partner tweeted, "What's the worst graph search criteria you
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:18.700]   can think of?"
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:22.500]   And someone said, "People who've just bought really expensive electronics and who are not
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.500]   home."
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:24.500]   Ooh.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:25.500]   Yikes.
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:26.500]   Yikes.
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:32.460]   And the last thing is people who like things that I like by Tom Stocky.
[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:36.540]   And everyone who in the list actually works at Facebook and is a dude.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:38.940]   Yeah, because I'll tell you why.
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:42.500]   One of the examples they say, this could be very useful recommendation engine if you're
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:46.500]   looking for a restaurant or a plumber or a dentist.
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.100]   But maybe it's just us.
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.860]   But let me ask the younger generation or whatever.
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:52.860]   Who uses Facebook?
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:53.860]   I don't even know.
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:54.860]   Chad, do you use...
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:55.860]   I mean...
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:56.860]   I don't even use Facebook.
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:57.860]   No, I don't know who use it.
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:58.860]   I think it's mostly moms.
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:02.900]   The worst way to invite me to a party is to invite me on Facebook.
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:07.780]   And so you would have to be that all your friends went through all of their dentists,
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:09.820]   plumbers, and liked them.
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:15.300]   Yeah, who's going to say, "Boy, I just had a great truth-drilling."
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:19.060]   What a pleasure that truth-drilling was.
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:25.780]   I got to tell you about Dr. Schmidt with my tooth, or my drain was clogged, but now it's
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:26.780]   clear.
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.300]   Who's going to present that as their life?
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.700]   Nobody presents their practicality of life on Facebook.
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:34.460]   What you present on Facebook is your view as if you were a star.
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:35.460]   Right.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:36.460]   Right.
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:37.460]   So, I mean...
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.460]   This is the news.
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:40.700]   Having just had those things done, I would share those with friends.
[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:43.340]   But you haven't already shared it, though, Kevin.
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:45.660]   So the problem is that the audience is at all the search.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.100]   Guys will ask you to do it.
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:48.100]   Right.
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:50.300]   Well, that's the real problem is this is just going to...
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.140]   This is just going to ask you to like them.
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:53.140]   Why does this happen?
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:54.140]   You got to like us.
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.140]   You got to like us.
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:56.140]   It's just going to get horrible.
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:57.140]   Yeah, it's going to leave us a review on Yelp.
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:59.140]   But right now, it's going to leave us a review on Yelp.
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:00.140]   Right.
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:04.420]   It's good for Facebook's business because it's lock-in.
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.420]   You know?
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:09.140]   It means you want to work on social graph search even though you don't know what that
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:10.140]   means.
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.300]   You got to get somebody to like you.
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:13.300]   Right.
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:19.460]   And it's, you know, the guy I go and get breakfast, coffee and empanadas from, Big E
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:20.940]   and Santa's A.
[00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:21.940]   Great place.
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:22.940]   Definitely go there.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:27.940]   You know, I've been going there for years and I check in on Four Square and he was like
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:31.340]   chatting, you know, checking his new eyes in tech and he says, "Oh, what do we need
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:32.340]   to do with all this stuff?"
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.900]   I said, "Well, there's lots of them and you can try different ones out."
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:36.900]   And then last time when he said, "I found this great thing.
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:40.420]   I found this thing called Hootsuite and I can post to all these social media things
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:41.420]   at once."
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:42.420]   Oh, dear.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:46.220]   And this guy makes great coffee and he makes great empanadas and he feels like he has
[00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:49.820]   to do all this stuff now to put, to promote this little coffee shop.
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:53.380]   So yeah, we're seeing that people want that.
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:55.980]   And obviously this is the thing that Facebook wants you to do.
[00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:58.940]   They want you to do those kinds of searches here because those are the searches they can
[00:57:58.940 --> 00:57:59.940]   monetize.
[00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:04.900]   The point of the big difference between what Google has been selling and what Facebook's
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:07.500]   selling is Google has been selling intent.
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.380]   Most of the ads that Google sells are on, "I'm looking for X.
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:11.900]   I want a new TV screen.
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:12.900]   I need a plumber.
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:13.900]   I need whatever."
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:14.900]   Right.
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.820]   And I don't think that's going to be useful for that.
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:21.740]   And Facebook obviously wants that because what they've been selling is we can sell you
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:22.740]   demographics.
[00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:29.980]   We can sell you people over 45 in San Jose who have a hot tub or whatever.
[00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:31.780]   Assuming that you said you had a hot tub.
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:36.100]   So they need that data to get richer and they need you to actually mark more things
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:37.100]   also.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.100]   This stuff becomes useful.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:39.100]   Right.
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:42.620]   So what's going to happen, Kevin, is that the problem becomes the no search results that
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:43.620]   you're going to get out.
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:44.620]   So fun.
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:45.620]   You're going to go in to the start up.
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:46.620]   You're going to try it.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:50.100]   I have boring friends on Facebook.
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:53.100]   And I'm not going to find anything.
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:58.020]   They limited their search universe to such a small amount of potential data.
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:01.900]   They're so highly dependent upon other users to do these things that we don't necessarily
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:02.900]   do.
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:05.580]   They're presuming that we do them unless they have more data about our behavior than I
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:06.580]   know.
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.900]   And I'm just weird, which is quite possible.
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:10.740]   I don't know.
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:15.740]   Isn't there a big risk for Facebook here that if people use it prematurely and it's
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:20.020]   not good, they're not going to come look at cool and all these other Google want to
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.020]   be what's premature.
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:25.820]   What they're arguing is that basically the database is already there.
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.420]   We have already spent years now telling Facebook all this stuff.
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:32.020]   All we have to do is unlock this data and get into it.
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:35.260]   If you start from data from today forward, they're really doomed.
[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:36.420]   But I don't presume the data is there.
[00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:41.140]   Now, but John Battelle, who wrote the original search book about Google, who's a smart guy,
[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:45.260]   said it changed his whole view of Facebook's prospects.
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:47.220]   I'm not getting this.
[00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:49.020]   I mean, I'm going to tell you guys.
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:54.340]   I'm a casual Facebook user, but I like pictures of my friends, kids and their pets and stuff.
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:56.940]   There's no way to see all the things that you've liked on Facebook.
[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:57.940]   That makes me crazy.
[00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:58.940]   We've talked about this with Google+.
[00:59:58.940 --> 00:59:59.940]   It makes me cry.
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:03.540]   I don't press the plus one button as a matter of principle because I'm just feeding their
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.020]   system and I can't get that back.
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.020]   I can't say, show me all the stuff that I plus want.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.020]   But this will let you do that now.
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:09.020]   This will do that, right?
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:13.820]   So at least I feel like at least Facebook is reflecting back the information that I'm feeding
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:14.820]   them.
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:15.820]   They're not just serving their advertising.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:21.140]   So Lars Rasmussen, who was the engineer of Facebook, who presented the graph search,
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:26.220]   Lars is the same guy who built Google Maps with his brother down in Australia, and then
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:28.060]   which was purchased by Google.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:31.900]   And Lars was the guy who built Google Wave.
[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:32.900]   Okay.
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:34.820]   You're a little biased.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.380]   This is the Google connection.
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:41.900]   I have a deep professional crush on Lars, I have to admit.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:46.900]   He basically said that your favorite search in Facebook, the Facebook graph search is going
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.820]   to be, show me all the photos that I've liked.
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:50.980]   And you can save these searches like pages.
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:55.060]   I mean, I got to tell you, my favorite view on Flickr are Flickr photos that I favorite
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:58.100]   it over the years because they're all adorable pictures of my friends, kids and their pets
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.500]   and that kind of thing, stuff I want to remember, warm memories.
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.740]   My Twitter favorites, I also favorite stuff on Twitter.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:05.260]   I love to be reminded of those.
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:08.900]   So I'm excited about graph search because I feel like I'm getting my data back and I
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.820]   get to see my friends' data in a more meaningful way.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.380]   More meaningful than sponsored likes in our ads.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:18.820]   And certainly that's one search that's useful that makes Facebook no money.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:23.060]   I can't think of any way to monetize your picture likes.
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:27.820]   Show me all the songs that my friends have listened to in the past month on Spotify.
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:28.820]   You can monetize.
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:32.620]   Like make me a playlist of the top songs, all my friends have listened to on Spotify and
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:33.620]   it's like that.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.820]   I mean, they've got so much data there.
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:37.860]   And I got to tell you, I have a great dentist.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.860]   I love my dentist.
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:39.860]   She's amazing.
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:40.860]   I haven't liked her on Facebook.
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:44.540]   But she does this thing and this is kind of ironic, but she sends cookies to anyone who
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:45.780]   refers a patient.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:49.500]   So if I like her on Facebook and one of my friends sees that I liked her and goes to
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:52.780]   her and says like I got referred to by Gina, like I get lots of cookies.
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:53.780]   So we share it.
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:57.140]   So in San Diego, sugar in them.
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:00.380]   And then she gets more business.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.380]   It works.
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.380]   It works very well.
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.380]   I get cookies.
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.380]   She gets more business.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.380]   I'm going to make a promise.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.380]   And they break your food.
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:11.660]   Say your name again.
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:13.460]   I want you to get some cookies.
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:16.540]   Dr. Ellen B. Ashiro in San Diego.
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:17.540]   There you go.
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:18.540]   She's great.
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.540]   And make sure you mention Gina Tarpani sent you.
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:21.540]   Yes.
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.540]   The genius at you.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:26.740]   Now I hope there'll be a stack of cookies when I get home.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:29.180]   That could be cool.
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.500]   That could be good.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.900]   But that's what businesses are actually that's a nice way to do it.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:35.980]   But that's what businesses are going to certainly do is.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:40.220]   A, if they don't have a page, they better damn well get one real quick.
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:42.140]   And that would be, I mean, that's just prudent advice.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:46.300]   If you don't have a Facebook page now, you better have one so people can like you.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.300]   Yep.
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:50.140]   So even if that's the only upshot of this, that's a good thing for Facebook.
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:53.260]   Well, you know, Mike Elgin did a great piece on this in Datamation.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:56.220]   He was talking about how basically if you love Facebook, you're going to love graph
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.220]   search.
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:01.020]   And if you, you know, if you hate Facebook, then you will really hate graph search.
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:04.060]   But one of the things they talked about was like the behavioral changes that we're going
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.100]   to start to see SEO for Facebook.
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:08.100]   I saw that.
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:09.100]   Oh my God.
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:10.100]   Just like everything.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.180]   Because they want to show up in all the search results.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:15.340]   People who would never have a Facebook page before are going to have a Facebook page now
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:19.660]   because of, because the tool will will affect behavior.
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:22.980]   So you know, look, Facebook wants more people to participate in Facebook and more people
[01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:26.060]   to engage with like, you know, especially with liking.
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:29.980]   But at the same time, you know, I hate, I hate the idea of an SEO community springing
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:30.980]   up.
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:34.060]   And Google's page rank, you know, was kind of in its heyday.
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:37.900]   Everybody was worried about how to optimize, you know, SEO, their websites and people are
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:40.780]   going to start thinking about this with their, with their Facebook profiles.
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:41.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:42.780]   You just gave me a horrible flash.
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:46.500]   So now reputation.com is going to tell you to optimize your life.
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:47.660]   He's even used that.
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:49.460]   He even used the phrase reputation management.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.300]   Mike, Mike Elgin did it in his article.
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.980]   This is, this is good hearts, Laura, isn't it?
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:55.540]   As soon as you measure anything, it becomes useless.
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:59.380]   And Google has done this to links on the web and they've done it to, you know, words
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:00.380]   on the web now.
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:04.620]   And Facebook is about to do this to, to their own graph and not really, you know, suddenly
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.260]   it's the thing that people are optimizing for and then it gets damaged.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.260]   It's a problem.
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:09.260]   Yeah.
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:12.380]   You know, so there's a couple of things about this that I do like.
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:17.380]   One thing I do like is the fine people near X because that's something I need because
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:18.780]   it's like, okay, I'm doing an event.
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:20.940]   I want to invite people who have a chance of getting to it.
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.540]   And that's impossible at the moment.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:25.540]   I had, I did this just before Christmas.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:29.700]   I was trying to set up a microphone at dinner in San Francisco on the short notice and I
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.700]   got right.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:35.620]   I invite people in, in Facebook and G plus who are nearby and we see, see who turns
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:36.620]   up.
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:43.540]   And on Facebook, I went through by hand and I was like, there in, I think there, and
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:46.420]   did that and, you know, three few people saw it.
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:49.180]   And on Google plus, I thought, oh, Google is smart about this.
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:51.020]   They're only show this to people who, who nearby.
[01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:54.460]   I use, you know, Google now and it knows where I am.
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:58.780]   And so I just added my, my geeks group to it or something.
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:02.380]   And it got, you know, it looked like I was inviting them all to dinner.
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:06.500]   It looked like I invited 200 people to dinner, half of whom were in New York or, you know,
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.500]   other, the UK.
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:13.260]   And it wasn't, there wasn't any way of saying, no, actually only make this a radius of 100
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.260]   miles or so.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:15.260]   So that piece is good.
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:18.340]   I like that idea and that, that, that is directly useful.
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:21.980]   You know, the nearby thing, that's good.
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:26.220]   But I am worried that this is going to cause a whole bunch of sort of second order effects
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:27.540]   that people don't like.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.900]   The other thing that strikes me about this is, is that the way likes are going, my, my,
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:34.580]   my youngest son, you know, I was sitting with him.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:37.140]   He was on Facebook and I was doing something or whatever.
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:38.540]   How old is he?
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.540]   He's 16.
[01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:40.540]   Okay.
[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:48.060]   And he's, he was like, it's the daily, delete all your likes thing because he's good for
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.060]   him.
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:50.060]   He has learned his lesson well.
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:52.300]   No, because the ads pop up with things you like.
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.020]   He's like, yeah, I like that two years ago.
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.020]   I don't want to answer about it.
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.020]   Right.
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:59.020]   I'm getting all the old likes and getting rid of the ones because they're just spamming
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.020]   him now.
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.820]   Yeah, that's tough for fickle people.
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:02.820]   Yeah.
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:06.820]   I was just looking at my about pitch today and stuff that I liked is like, oh, it's true.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:17.420]   It's like that's so three years ago, you know, like I, you know, like my grandmother's caret
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:19.180]   cake to her when I was three years old.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:21.860]   So for the rest of my life, I love nothing but carrot cake.
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:27.380]   And this is strictly sweet stuff that I had to eat every time I saw my grandpa.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.220]   You said you liked it.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.020]   Just you.
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.020]   Yes.
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.780]   So Facebook becomes Grammy.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:34.780]   You know what they've done?
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.140]   I didn't know this, but now your likes have a timeline.
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:38.380]   Did you know that?
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:39.380]   You can see what you like.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.380]   Yeah, it's clip by year.
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:41.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:45.140]   You can like what you like this year, last year, the going all the way back to what did
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:46.380]   I like in 2008?
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:47.780]   I'm wondering if there's anything there.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:48.780]   My problem is I'm grumbly.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:49.780]   I didn't like anything.
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.580]   Oh, you don't like enough stuff.
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:56.900]   Oh, yeah, I've deleted old likes because I don't see any likes going back that far.
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:58.620]   I still like Viheart.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:06:59.740]   I still like Roger Ebert.
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:05.020]   Still like Sonos, Gary Vaynerchuk, Ford Focus like.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.020]   Wow.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:07.020]   Wow.
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:09.300]   We're Gary.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.900]   I like myself.
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:11.900]   Can you like yourself?
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:13.460]   Yes, you can.
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:16.100]   I like myself.
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:19.100]   So, yeah, I mean, you can.
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:20.580]   But not Gary so much.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.540]   I like my shirts.
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:24.500]   Apparently somebody made a Leo LePort shirts page.
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.620]   I didn't know that.
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:27.380]   I'm going to like that.
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:30.500]   We're going to get Gary Vaynerchuk after you.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.700]   I know.
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:35.300]   Just watch the Twitter Tattle Tales are in force.
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:40.940]   Gary, did you hear what Leo said about you on twig?
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:42.300]   No, you got it.
[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:43.300]   Scoble did this.
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:46.100]   He went through all of the brands that he liked in the LeMune.
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.100]   It's so Scoble.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:48.100]   It's so Scoble.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.580]   It is a passing thing though, right?
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:52.660]   Like you can feel really passionate and happy about something when you've had a good experience.
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.900]   But then a couple of years fast and you're like, oh yeah, you know, just the memory is
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.900]   less.
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.660]   It's very easy to like something.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:07:59.660]   Right.
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:04.820]   I mean, yeah, there's, you know, the reason I use 4-square now is mainly to keep a history
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:06.700]   of where I've been and things.
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:09.820]   I mean, also that it feeds back, you know, gives me good recommendations.
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:13.980]   But I use it as an archive of, oh, yeah, I went to that place on that day, which is quite
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:14.980]   handy.
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:15.980]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.020]   So I can see Facebook potentially being useful for that.
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:23.440]   But if it comes with ads and annoyances and noise in your stream, then I can see people
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:25.340]   deleting it again.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:30.620]   Somebody else told me about that they have this little thing they do, which is everyday
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:32.540]   Facebook tells and people's birthdays.
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:35.660]   And if they go, I'm not sure I want to say happy birthday to them, they delete them as
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.820]   a friend because that's their way of getting really sick.
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:44.340]   And if you do it on their birthday, they won't notice because they got a lot of happy stuff.
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:45.340]   They're in time.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:46.340]   Wall is better.
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:49.660]   However, birthday, unfriends, they're sort of rolling on friending thing.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:53.740]   I've like, how to trim your graph without offending people.
[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:54.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:55.740]   And after a year, you'll have gone through everyone.
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:56.740]   Happy birthday.
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:57.740]   See you.
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.740]   Bye.
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:08:59.740]   Hope you have a good one.
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:00.740]   Nice.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:01.740]   Nice knowing you.
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:02.740]   You don't say happy birthday.
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:03.740]   They just disappear.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:04.740]   Yeah.
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:08.700]   And if you like them, you can buy them a cheesy gift.
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:10.220]   I like that.
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:13.540]   So Facebook stock price, did it go up after this big announcement?
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:14.540]   Oh, I didn't know.
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:15.540]   Probably.
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:17.860]   Yeah, I saw apples went up a lot.
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:20.460]   I should ask Google now.
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.460]   Phase.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:24.180]   Google now will know.
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.900]   Let's see what Google now knows.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:28.900]   My Google now doesn't know enough still.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:31.380]   You still don't have a smart Google now.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:32.940]   I went through the whole McGill.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:34.140]   I found one other new McGill.
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:40.820]   Somebody suggested me that I had to go into my apps account and as an apps top administrator,
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:46.500]   say it was OK for my users, including myself, to have history in the browser.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:47.500]   So I did all that.
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.140]   It's still not doing it for me.
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:50.140]   Oh.
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:51.140]   Fb.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.140]   Mr.
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:54.140]   Was some, but it will even look good for those.
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.140]   Kind of flat, huh?
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:56.140]   Point.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:57.140]   A3%.
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:58.140]   The market's not sure what it means.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:00.900]   The market's trying to find out what a graph is.
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:01.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:06.980]   It's funny because the API has been called the graph API.
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:10.460]   So I just, I mean, I think as, and I work with the API for think up and I just, I'm
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:11.460]   used to it.
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:14.740]   It's just, it's a term like that I'm just kind of you associate with Facebook and I'm
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:15.740]   used to it.
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:16.740]   But you're right.
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.740]   Like it makes no sense.
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:18.740]   It makes no sense.
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:22.340]   I don't know why they just didn't call Facebook search or social search or people search.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:26.500]   This is the problem of being a nerd is that you start getting, you know, well, everybody
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:27.500]   knows about it.
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.500]   Stupid terminology.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:29.500]   Right.
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:30.500]   Yeah.
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:31.500]   Like, there are words that mean nothing.
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.420]   Yeah, to the rest of the world.
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:36.100]   And I use the phrase data liberation all the time.
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:38.780]   And Neil always looks me and is like, that's a Google, like people who don't cover Google
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:39.780]   don't know what that means.
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:40.780]   Like, all right.
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:43.660]   That at least those are English words that make sense.
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:47.740]   Yeah, you can, you can gather contextual clues and figure out what that means.
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.700]   But graph, I don't think graph gives you a lot of hands.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:52.620]   Well, I did the N gram view on social graph.
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:59.020]   And it was this obscure technical term for most of the, for the, basically for the 20th
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:00.740]   century and then it suddenly goes, whoop.
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:01.740]   Wow.
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.020]   And shoots up by a factor of.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.020]   Look at that.
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:06.020]   10 or so.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.020]   Wow.
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.460]   Around 2005.
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:10.820]   I'm surprised there was any noise about it before this.
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:12.860]   So it must have been some sort of sociology term.
[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:14.460]   It was a sociology term, definitely.
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:19.140]   And it was, it was what you use to say this is how people are connected to each other.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:23.780]   But it was, it was, you know, the Dana Dana Boyd, of course, has a great paper on this.
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:28.820]   The difference between the actual social graph and the publicly articulated social graph,
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:31.060]   which you do in the, in Facebook or whatever.
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:34.780]   And so in sociology, they would, they would model this and ask people who their friends
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:39.060]   were and get them to draw little bits of paper and that was their way of doing it.
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:43.900]   And then with the rise of social networking, it was these things exploded and they became
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:47.780]   much bigger and they're actually, you know, this is the, I needed to be from the birthdays
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:48.780]   problem.
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:52.420]   It's like, who are all these people who I've gradually friended over time and now there's
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:53.420]   here.
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:56.940]   Here's, by the way, this is so I see this is why Google books.
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.060]   Awesome.
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:04.580]   So we have to go back to 1910 and the Floyd Henry Alport and Gordon William Alport's
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:08.660]   personality traits, their classification and measurement.
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:15.940]   And you see in this figure, the graph is because they divided personalities into a range of
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:19.820]   things, emotions and so forth.
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:26.140]   And then they drew a graph showing high and low and they literally call this the social
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:28.060]   graph.
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:32.580]   This is one of the first appearances of the phrase social graph, the classification of
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:34.100]   personality traits.
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:37.100]   This one's an introverted social type.
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:39.300]   That's Zuckerberg social graph.
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.660]   Almost psychopathic.
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:43.580]   It says neurotic heredity.
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:45.140]   I didn't say that.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:46.140]   Yeah.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:49.220]   I think this is, this isn't using in that tense term is it?
[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:50.900]   This is, yeah.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:51.900]   It's not the definition.
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:57.060]   I do not, that doesn't mean what I think, what you think it does.
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:01.100]   And Neil says that Brad Fitzpatrick coined the term social graph.
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:02.100]   2007.
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:05.020]   Yeah, that's what we're looking at in the first place.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:07.900]   Brad, Brad read very good paper on it.
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.460]   That was a good essay.
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:14.020]   Just like the day before he joined Google, when he could still speak in public.
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:19.140]   And he went on to build the social graph API at Google, which they killed this year.
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:23.780]   But that was, yeah, that was, that was crawling the web looking for these links between friends
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:28.380]   and links between yourself and making it available as a public API, which was a great
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.380]   item, was a great service.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:31.780]   And I, you know, I hope, you know what kind of bugs me about.
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:32.780]   I'll size it.
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:38.100]   About all of this is that Facebook spent millions of dollars lobbying Washington to
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:45.060]   change a law so that you could share your Netflix viewing habits on Facebook.
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:49.700]   And even though we're in the middle of this, this debt ceiling negotiation, there's a
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:53.780]   lot of important stuff on Congress's doorstep.
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:57.300]   The Video Privacy Protection Act did get updated.
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:03.020]   And last Thursday, President Obama signed that bill just in time to add your Netflix viewing
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:05.460]   habits to your social graph.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.220]   Thank you, Facebook.
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.860]   We think.
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:09.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:14.820]   HR 6671, the Video Privacy Protection Amendments Act.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.580]   I'm also glad it's, I'm glad it's there.
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:22.500]   And that was really the, the, the Justice Bork law before.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.500]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.220]   I've banned the showing of any video history information.
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:28.220]   Not Bork.
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:30.660]   It was, it was, it was, yes, Bork.
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:34.020]   Bork got in trouble for his video habits, because SOTED SOTED the SOTED the other guy
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:39.380]   who got in and I'm conveniently blank Clarence Thomas conveniently blanking out his video
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:40.380]   habits.
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:44.660]   Um, Clarence Thomas was Coke cans, Bork was videos.
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:45.660]   That's right.
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:46.660]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:49.460]   I'm confusing long dong silver with something else.
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:50.460]   Right.
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:52.660]   And the pubic care on the Coke can.
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:53.660]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:58.780]   Did you, are you going to send Mark Zuckerberg to pay a hundred bucks and send him a message?
[01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:01.260]   I like the associate graph.
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:03.180]   Gary V is responded.
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:08.180]   It's just a joke, Gary.
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:09.180]   I love you, baby.
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.180]   I love you.
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:11.180]   And we love Gary.
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.140]   Wait, where did he, where did he respond?
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:14.140]   I don't know.
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:15.140]   Of course he responded.
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:16.620]   Gary, that's what Gary does.
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:18.940]   He's the most responsive human on the internet.
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:19.940]   That's why I love him.
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:20.940]   Mm.
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:22.420]   He's always got his ears on.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:23.420]   He's he says.
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:25.260]   Video will report, I'll always like you.
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:27.180]   But more importantly, always respect you.
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:28.620]   Happy new year, Gary V.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:31.820]   He's a, he's, he's classy that dude.
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:32.820]   Thank you.
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:35.660]   Twitter, tattle, tales once again.
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:37.460]   Oh, no.
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:41.740]   He's responding to talking about how he liked you in 2008 on Facebook.
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:44.660]   See, this is the problem is it doesn't 140 characters.
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:46.740]   There's no context.
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:51.100]   No one for you.
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:52.100]   Yeah, really.
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:54.620]   Love you, Gary.
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:56.220]   Don't listen to them.
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:16:00.540]   So Facebook, apparently, you know, remember they said for a buck, we can make sure that
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:05.140]   your message gets in your friends inbox, not the other folder.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:09.060]   And then apparently some people are getting the message of for a hundred bucks.
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:13.980]   If you're, if you're not a friend, if you didn't friend Mark Zuckerberg and he has quite
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:19.460]   a few friends, then you might get a message that says you aren't connected to Mark on
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:20.740]   Facebook.
[01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:23.500]   Your message would normally get filtered to the other folder.
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:29.020]   Would you like to send it to him for a hundred bucks?
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:31.780]   Send to inbox for a hundred dollars.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:34.460]   So Facebook is monetizing email.
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:35.460]   Yes.
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:36.460]   Wow.
[01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:41.020]   Well, you could say, you know, if somebody's willing to spend a buck, then probably not
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:42.020]   a spammer.
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:45.300]   Well, I mean, I mean, that's the issue with email, right?
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:48.340]   Like to send somebody postal mail, you have to pay for postage.
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:49.340]   You have to get a stamp.
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:51.340]   You have to get mail bucks.
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:53.340]   Yeah.
[01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:54.340]   Right.
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:56.620]   So it puts, yeah, puts the onus on the sender, right?
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:57.620]   They have to pay, right?
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:59.940]   But the problem with email is it puts the onus on the recipient.
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:00.940]   It costs nothing.
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:02.140]   So that's why we get spam.
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:06.820]   So I'm always felt like it should be a little harder to contact someone by email because
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:07.820]   that would counter spam.
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:11.060]   I just, something about this doesn't feel right.
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:12.060]   I wish it wasn't.
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:14.060]   But you know, you're right.
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:15.140]   Logically, that's the way it works.
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:20.220]   But the contrary proof is that the USPS is now an entirely business of junk mail and the
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.500]   only ones who pay this in mail anymore are junk mailers.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.500]   Right.
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:24.500]   That's really cool.
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:25.860]   So inevitably what you're going to get down to is they're going to be something going
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:30.460]   to open marketplace and they're selling our supposed attention and our mailbox and we
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:31.500]   have no control.
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:36.180]   It goes back to what Bob Wyman told me a long time ago about the problem with emails when
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:44.460]   the sender controlled email, that's what ruined email and Google plus the recipient controls.
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.220]   And that's the difference.
[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.220]   That's better.
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:48.780]   Yeah, that's really the way to.
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:53.340]   How so on Google plus by saying you're on Google plus you only receive messages from
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:56.460]   people you choose to receive messages from.
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:59.180]   The only the only things that didn't work because you used to get notifications and that
[01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:00.180]   got spammed immediately.
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:03.300]   So they had to kill that.
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:06.740]   But now you can decide who can who can communicate with you.
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:08.420]   You should be able to do that in comments too.
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:09.420]   Right.
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:11.500]   So like on Twitter, someone can direct me.
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.460]   Only people who you follow can direct message you.
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:14.300]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.540]   That is what Facebook built in the first place.
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:21.060]   The reason people started using Facebook instead of email was because you choose who
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:22.820]   could send you stuff.
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:23.820]   Right.
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:26.420]   If you're not friends, they can't message you.
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:30.580]   Well, they can though now if they probably have a folder that you never see.
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:31.580]   Right.
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:36.060]   If you go to Facebook, there's a look in messages and click like three times or something.
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:40.500]   There's a there's an other folder that has messages from people who've sent you think
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:44.660]   to the to that fake email address that Facebook created for you and then synced into everybody's
[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:45.660]   address book.
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:46.660]   Right.
[01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:48.540]   We're running up against the clock.
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:49.540]   We got to run.
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:52.380]   So let's get our tips number and tool of the week in just a second.
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:58.340]   But first a word from our sponsor, our new sponsor, LegalZoom.com LegalZoom is not a
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:18:59.340]   law firm.
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:02.500]   What LegalZoom does is it helps you get your legal work done.
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:07.100]   You know, there's a lot of stuff you can do yourself and corporate your business form
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:13.300]   and LLC. That's what we did starts at $99 at LegalZoom.com.
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.300]   It's a great idea.

[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:26.220]   and more all at LegalZoom.com for much less than it would cost you to go to a what do
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:27.220]   they call them?
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:30.540]   White shoe law firm.

[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:37.300]   It's $69 for a LegalZoom will.
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:39.660]   You can establish a living trust there too.
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:40.660]   And you know, it's really simple.
[01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:43.380]   You just walk through a questionnaire.
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:49.140]   They ask you, you know, the way the same way that online services and software transform
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:55.820]   the way you do taxes, LegalZoom is transforming the way people do simple legal tasks.

[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.060]   trademarks.

[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.660]   They've got great customer support.
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:06.740]   They've also got a new service, which I really like.
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:11.620]   If you do need legal advice, they have an extensive network of attorneys with pre-negotiated
[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:14.540]   prices in most states.
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:19.180]   So you can also talk to an attorney if it gets the point where you go, you know, I really
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:22.380]   would like some advice on this particular point.
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:23.380]   Start your business.

[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:25.980]   They're not a law firm.

[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:36.540]   and get your questions answered and get on going advice for a fraction of the cost of
[01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:38.060]   a fancy law firm.

[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:06.940]   Time for Gina Trapani's tool, a tip of the week.
[01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:07.940]   Tip tool.
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:08.940]   It could be a tool.
[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:09.940]   It could be a tip.
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:10.940]   It could be anything.
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.940]   By episode 500, you're going to get that.
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:13.940]   Oh, I don't.
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:17.940]   I only started pronouncing your name correctly in the last few months.
[01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:21.940]   I both pronunciations are okay.
[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:22.940]   Okay.
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:23.940]   All right.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.940]   Tip this week is Yahoo!
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:31.180]   Image Search has restored the ability to get images which are creative commons license.
[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:33.100]   That means that they're reusable.
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:34.100]   They Yahoo!
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:38.340]   Search had this for a while, but then they took it away when Bing Search replaced it.
[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:40.060]   They have since restored it.
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.060]   So if you go to Yahoo!
[01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:45.420]   Image Search, there's a new and you click on the bar on the side.
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:47.580]   And this works on both mobile and in the browser.
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:48.580]   You can search for images.
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:53.060]   And then you can say, just show me ones that are available for reuse.
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:55.460]   This is a huge, huge help.
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:59.900]   To anyone who publishes online, who makes presentations, who only wants to use photos
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:04.100]   which are creative commons license that can be used.
[01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:06.220]   So I'm really happy that it's back.
[01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:08.140]   I'm feeling very good about Yahoo!
[01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:09.940]   I'm feeling good about Flickr.
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:13.140]   And most of these images, obviously, are from Flickr.
[01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:16.500]   So if you're missing that image search, it's back.
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:22.700]   And you can post beautiful blog posts about sunsets with creative commons license, freely
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:26.540]   reusable images right from your phone or in your browser now using Yahoo!
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:27.540]   Image Search.
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:31.020]   I think I'm going to change my image search shortcut in Chrome to Yahoo!
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.020]   Image Search.
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:33.020]   Now this is back.
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:34.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:36.460]   You never went away on Flickr, right?
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:38.860]   No, it didn't ever go away in Flickr, right?
[01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:41.140]   So this is integrated into the Yahoo!
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.140]   Experience.
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:43.140]   Right.
[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:44.140]   And then Bing kind of took it away.
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:46.860]   But it was always on Flickr and that was something that the Flickr search was great
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:47.860]   too.
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:51.820]   By the way, Bing might be the big benefactor of this new social graph search because it's
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:54.900]   going to be incorporated into Bing search as well.
[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:59.140]   And also they get all the ones that Facebook can't fulfill.
[01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.140]   Yes.
[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:01.140]   Interesting.
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:04.700]   Kevin, would you like to throw anything in?
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:06.420]   I don't want to leave you out in the cold.
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:11.180]   Is there anything you're using with Google or anything you want us to highlight?
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:12.180]   I'll have to.
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:14.780]   Yeah, watch that whole talk from Aaron.
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:15.780]   Do.
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:16.780]   Yes.
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:18.540]   That would be my spend 20 minutes watching that this week.
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:19.540]   Yep.
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:20.540]   I agree.
[01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:22.260]   I agree.
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:25.260]   Your number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:27.780]   Oh, he's muted.
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:28.780]   You're muted.
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:30.460]   Jeff, you're muted.
[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:31.460]   No.
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:33.460]   You're baffled.
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:36.460]   Jeff, you're baffled.
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:38.500]   And you're muted.
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.100]   Hello, Jeff.
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:42.460]   Is it us?
[01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:43.460]   Aww.
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:46.820]   I like Jeff's like, oh no.
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:47.820]   It's not us.
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:49.300]   I'm looking at our board.
[01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:50.300]   Everything looks fine.
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:51.660]   It is six o'clock Eastern time.
[01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:55.500]   I think you're hard out when they said when you said hard out, I think they meant we're
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.100]   going to cut your microphone.
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:58.660]   This is like the Golden Globe Awards.
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:04.220]   Oh, triple check that maybe the button on Skype didn't accidentally get pressed.
[01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:07.020]   Did you watch the Golden Globes, Gina?
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:08.020]   I didn't.
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:09.020]   I didn't.
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:10.020]   Were they good?
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:11.020]   Were they watching?
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:13.260]   Well, I heard about my girl, Jody Foster, of course.
[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:15.020]   It's what I was going to ask you.
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:17.660]   I couldn't tell if she came out or not.
[01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:18.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:20.420]   I mean, I think so.
[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:21.620]   It's sort of been an open secret.
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:23.380]   She mentioned her longtime partner.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:24.380]   So that's good.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:25.380]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:26.380]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:27.380]   I mean, I think pretty much everyone knew, but it just didn't really.
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:29.140]   It was kind of like Anderson Cooper, you know?
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:30.140]   Right.
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:31.140]   And then--
[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:32.140]   And then--
[01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:33.140]   And then--
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:37.380]   And she acted as if I'm never going to work in Hollywood again, which is like Jody, I
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:38.380]   think you will.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.380]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:42.100]   You know what, Jody?
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:43.660]   I think it's going to be OK.
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:44.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:47.380]   It's a shame that there really is still a stigma.
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:53.100]   And there are many Hollywood stars who just will not say anything about it.
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:54.860]   I think it's also partly age, right?
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:55.860]   That's getting better.
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:56.860]   That she's generational.
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:57.860]   I'm aware it was more difficult.
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:58.860]   Generation.
[01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:00.420]   There's some pretty well-known leading men who--
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:01.420]   Oh, yes.
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:02.420]   So, of course.
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:03.420]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:07.500]   Well, especially that she was a child star, you know, that she had experienced fame very
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:09.700]   early in a different generation.
[01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:13.100]   I think that she just became protective of her life because she was in the spotlight.
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:14.100]   That's what I love.
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.100]   That's what I love.
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.700]   Her saying, you know, there's this thing about privacy.
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:20.820]   I know Jeff, you might disagree, but I did like it that she said--
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:21.820]   No, no, I get that.
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:22.820]   She's got to prick that.
[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:23.820]   Yeah.
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:24.820]   And by the way, I still have a crush on her.
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:25.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:26.820]   Who doesn't?
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:27.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:28.820]   She's-- yeah.
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:29.820]   She's completely crush-worthy.
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:30.820]   Amazing.
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:31.820]   Amazing.
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:32.820]   But she's also had some horrific stalkers as well.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:33.820]   Well, that's true.
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:34.820]   Oh, you're too.
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:35.820]   John Hinckley, of course.
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:36.820]   Yeah.
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:37.820]   And that's a very good point.
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:39.380]   Yeah, she had good reason to want to be private.
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:40.380]   Yeah.
[01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:41.380]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:42.380]   All right, I've stalled long enough.
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:43.380]   Jeff's microphone came back this time.
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:44.380]   Come on.
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:45.980]   I've bombed my little thing here.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:46.980]   Oh.
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:49.140]   You know, anytime I use a bong, that happens to me, too.
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:50.140]   I don't.
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:52.140]   I've bombed my little thing.
[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:54.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:57.140]   That also the technical term.
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:59.140]   Good engineers use it all the time.
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:00.620]   No, Regina.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:02.100]   Your numbers, sir.
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:04.340]   Well, all right, I was going to do--
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:05.340]   I'm going to do this one.
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:06.340]   I'm going to do this one.
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:08.860]   One dog he is still alive in the world.
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:10.500]   If you go into the rundown and look
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:12.860]   at the Business Insider link there, Leo,
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:17.180]   Google was accused of killing a donkey on Street View.
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:22.380]   But the accusers got the order wrong.
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:25.420]   And in fact, the donkey lives.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:27.140]   I think it's an important thing.
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:27.660]   I can't.
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:28.940]   I got a donkey.
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:32.060]   We're killed in this Street View.
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:34.540]   How could Street View kill a donkey?
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:35.820]   The truck.
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:39.660]   And the problem was whoever did it looked at the Business
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:43.820]   Insider, so I looked at the-- it stills in reverse
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:45.580]   and thought the donkey was dead in the road.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:46.260]   In fact, the dog was dead.
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:47.780]   The other way around.
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:49.460]   And the truck came along and woke up the donkey,
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:50.300]   and the donkey moved off.
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:53.140]   The Google Street View woke up a donkey.
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:55.940]   And Business Insider showed the proper order
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:57.780]   to the photos of this big controversy.
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:59.220]   Google had to defend themselves.
[01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:01.820]   The Street View didn't kill a donkey.
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:05.220]   So they did knock a day down a few years ago, right?
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.740]   Somebody has way too much time.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:09.740]   I got a five-year cheese.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.740]   How many images are there on Street View
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:13.900]   that you would have to comb through?
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.100]   I don't.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:16.380]   But this is the point.
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:17.420]   Google can't do this.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:18.900]   This is the-- can you look at all the image
[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:19.740]   uploaded to YouTube?
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.620]   But if you go down your own street
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:23.500]   and there's like, there's a dill lying in the street,
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.340]   what the hell?
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:25.180]   You post that to that.
[01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:29.020]   And so there are all these like spotted on Street View
[01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:31.140]   things that are-- where did that go?
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:34.580]   So yeah, why was somebody browsing--
[01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:37.700]   He doesn't look like a well donkey.
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:40.700]   He was walking in the dust.
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:41.700]   Oh, there he is.
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:42.700]   There he is.
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:43.700]   There's something in the car.
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:46.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:49.700]   The donkey lived, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:52.340]   But they did actually hit a deer in 2000.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:54.140]   I just put the link to the Guardian thing of that.
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:55.820]   I think they actually took the images out.
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.620]   But there was this like, the deer lying in the road,
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:00.180]   and then you see it getting up again afterwards.
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:01.940]   Oh, well, they just-- he was--
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:03.020]   He's not dead.
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:05.180]   He's just pining.
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:08.460]   And my neck of the woods, they're tall rats.
[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:11.540]   He's paining for the fields.
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:15.540]   But there are-- there's a whole bloke diva.
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:17.340]   It's a weird stuff you found in Street View.
[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:18.300]   I know I love it.
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:19.940]   The guy asleep on his own lawn.
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:23.380]   And the house that burns down as they drive past the street.
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:26.140]   Crazy stuff.
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:28.260]   I'm going to suggest that people listen to all about Android
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:30.820]   last night because you covered about eight different great
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:31.740]   calendar apps.
[01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:33.020]   And I can't decide which one.
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:36.900]   I did download an install agenda because I love that from way
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.260]   back when it was an iOS app.
[01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:43.700]   It's just the cleanest, simplest calendar app.
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:45.300]   And if you swipe from left to right,
[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:48.420]   it goes from-- yeah, it goes from the year-- now swipe again.
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:50.900]   Yeah, so that's the year view.
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:52.020]   And then it goes--
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:53.020]   That's fully synced with Google.
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:54.340]   --and then week, isn't that great?
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:55.860]   Yeah, it syncs to Google.
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:58.300]   It can do multiple Google accounts, multiple calendars.
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:01.460]   And then if you swipe again, it'll go event specific.
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:02.940]   So yeah, it's just really nice.
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:04.460]   It's just-- it is very simple.
[01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:05.100]   It's very simple.
[01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:05.900]   Good question.
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:10.380]   Gina, can I stop it from changing the darned time zones?
[01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:12.460]   So when I put in-- so I'm going to doge-ish next week,
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:13.900]   where you'll see me next week, right?
[01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:16.900]   So I put in something that's going to occur at seven at night.
[01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:18.980]   It thinks that it's UTC time.
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:21.340]   And so when I get there, it changes it by five hours.
[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:22.060]   Google does.
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:24.220]   Can you tell Google Calendar not to do that?
[01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:24.780]   I can't follow.
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:25.300]   I know.
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:28.620]   That's a setting in Google Calendar.
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:30.420]   So this is what I do is when I enter the event,
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:31.940]   I specify the time zone.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:35.140]   So I would say for Twig, I would say I'm in New York.
[01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:36.180]   That's the best way to do it.
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:39.300]   I would say Twig, 4 p.m, EST.
[01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:40.860]   And then it adjusts for Pacific.
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:42.380]   And then when I come to New York, it adjusts.
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:42.940]   You know what I mean?
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.860]   So if you specify the time zone on entry,
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:46.020]   then you'll be set.
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:48.460]   I think it happens when you import calendar from somewhere
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:51.940]   else because the calendar file format,
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:53.540]   if you don't specify a time zone,
[01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:55.220]   defaults to local, which is--
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:56.860]   was a rational decision at the time.
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:00.060]   But that means if you've got an imported calendar that's
[01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:03.580]   coming from an obviously place and it doesn't specify a time zone,
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:04.220]   that's what you get.
[01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:06.860]   So it's a bargain the icon for me, ultimately.
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:07.740]   And just--
[01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:10.940]   Yeah, what I really wish is that I wish I could say on these dates,
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:12.260]   I'm going to be in this time zone.
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:13.780]   So show me everything there.
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:14.220]   And Jen, yeah.
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:15.460]   Just the time that I got.
[01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:15.900]   All right, thank you.
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:16.460]   That was my--
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:18.260]   For people who travel, it's a big thing.
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:19.060]   You know, just so--
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:19.060]   Yeah.
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:25.100]   --Steve Martin was really upset about this and begged me for a way
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:27.620]   to just say, I just want everything in my local time.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:28.460]   I can tell the difference.
[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:28.960]   Exactly.
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:29.660]   That's all I want.
[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:31.020]   Give me that as an option, Google.
[01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:32.420]   I'll do the subtraction.
[01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:33.700]   And you know what?
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:35.820]   They listen to him on iOS because he was talking about the iPhone
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:37.060]   and you can do that in iOS.
[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:39.100]   That's why I thought you might be able to do it on Google Calendar.
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.500]   You can't, but you can't do it on iOS.
[01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:44.300]   So what I do is when I travel, I don't change the clock on my laptop,
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:45.980]   but I just let the phone change itself.
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:46.500]   So I've got--
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.620]   That's another way to do it, sure.
[01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:50.540]   If you're carrying both.
[01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:51.740]   And that means--
[01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:54.540]   That has blown me up before because I was in New York
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:55.740]   and I was thinking, I've got plenty of time.
[01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:57.360]   They're just like, oh, wait, I'm looking at the computer
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.060]   and all the phones.
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.060]   I completely--
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:01.460]   I miss reading the camera.
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:02.420]   Yeah, because of this.
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:02.940]   Yeah.
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:05.020]   Because I was six hours off because I had adjusted
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:06.740]   and then I'd adjusted itself and I was all--
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:07.900]   I miss totally missed a meeting.
[01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:10.780]   It's amazing that-- and I know that you have to enter it
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:11.700]   by the local time.
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:14.220]   So I don't know.
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:17.060]   There's one that I like and the Google thing is--
[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:19.860]   which is explicitly for flights is you can set the start
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:23.100]   and end time to be different time zones, which
[01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:26.060]   is very handy when you're transferring your flights in.
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:27.740]   So you can say, I'm taking off at this time.
[01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:29.540]   And this time zone, and I'm landing at this time and this time
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:30.940]   zone.
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:31.540]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:33.660]   Next week, you're going to see me as an over on--
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:34.860]   Swiss time zone.
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:35.940]   I will be in Davos.
[01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:38.780]   Oh, the ever-loving Davos.
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:41.100]   And I say how it's GB.
[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:43.540]   Yes, I will.
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:47.180]   So by the way, it is a feature in the Google version
[01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:48.140]   of the calendar.
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:52.980]   Thanks to the JMoon in our chat room for pointing this out.
[01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:55.420]   Use home time zone.
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:55.940]   Where?
[01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:56.660]   Where?
[01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:59.420]   But it's not on-- it's only on the phone.
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:02.020]   It's in that new calendar app that you can download,
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:03.940]   the Google canonical calendar app,
[01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:05.660]   so you don't have to use the Samsung app.
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:09.220]   Use home time zone displays calendars and event times
[01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:12.980]   in your home time zone when traveling.
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:13.340]   Thing--
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:14.420]   Your home time zone when traveling.
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:14.860]   Home time zone.
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:16.580]   And you could specify your home time zone,
[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:19.700]   which for some reason is Seoul, Korea.
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:22.460]   I should fix that, probably.
[01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:24.620]   It thinks my home time zone is GMT.
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:25.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:28.580]   Well, no, it's defaulting to where this phone was made, I guess.
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:29.940]   Anyway, we're a little late.
[01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:30.900]   You guys got to go.
[01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:31.380]   I know.
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:35.380]   Jeff Jarvis, thank you so much for being here from Rhode Island.
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:38.100]   Thanks to Bryant College for letting you use their facilities.
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:39.020]   Thank you, Bryant College.
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:39.660]   Wonderful place.
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:41.540]   Good luck in Davos.
[01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:41.820]   Thank you.
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:44.340]   I'll see you next week from the Stowie Mountains.
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:44.820]   That was fun.
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.980]   We've done this every year now for the last few years.
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:50.220]   And it's always interesting.
[01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:50.620]   Thank you.
[01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:53.220]   Maybe you can get Bono to come over and say hi.
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:55.460]   Yeah, it's going to say, get us a star.
[01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:56.180]   Get us a--
[01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.020]   Not scoble.
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:57.500]   Oh, no.
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.300]   Get us an A-lister.
[01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:00.300]   Come say hi unto it.
[01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:01.140]   He's not going.
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:03.140]   Scoble's not going, wow.
[01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:03.900]   That's what I heard.
[01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:05.300]   Wow, shocking.
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:05.660]   Yeah.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:07.020]   Kevin Marks, thank you for being here.
[01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:08.140]   Tumblevision.tv.
[01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:09.540]   He's still in hiatus on Tumblevision?
[01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:10.820]   Still in hiatus, but we're still
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:11.740]   trying to get that back to go.
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:13.420]   That way, hopefully this is--
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:14.660]   it's almost a year since we stopped.
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:16.940]   So yeah, we want to get that back up again.
[01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:17.900]   Absolutely.
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:18.620]   Always a pleasure.
[01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:19.580]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:21.420]   We really appreciate your insights.
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:22.340]   Let him be here.
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:25.420]   And of course, it's at Gina Trapani, smarterware.org.
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:30.420]   Thinkup.com and todo.text.
[01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:31.980]   Yeah, great to be here.
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:34.580]   Thanks to 20 by 200 for hosting me tonight.
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:35.420]   What a nice office.
[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:36.420]   In New York.
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:36.940]   Yeah.
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:37.780]   Yeah, lots of order in the halls.
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:38.780]   That's all the more.
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.220]   All right, guys.
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:41.020]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:44.020]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 1 p.m.
[01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:46.620]   Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:48.860]   That's 2100 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:50.420]   If you don't get to watch the live show,
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:52.620]   and do watch live if you can, because I like that.
[01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:54.940]   Because then I can interact with you and all that.
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:56.620]   We do make on-demand versions available.
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:58.740]   Audio and video, always after the fact.
[01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:03.180]   Either at our website, twit.tv/twig, or online,
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:07.020]   or on our new Google YouTube channel, which is, what
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:07.780]   is our YouTube channel?
[01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:11.300]   YouTube.com/twig.
[01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:12.700]   YouTube.com/twig.
[01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:15.260]   So what we've done is each show now has its own YouTube
[01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:15.580]   channel.
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:17.700]   And going forward, we don't have the old shows here.
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:20.340]   But going forward, you could subscribe to the YouTube
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:21.900]   channel, and you'll get a notification every time
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:22.700]   a new video comes out.
[01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:24.260]   And you can watch on YouTube as well.
[01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:24.980]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:25.940]   We'll see you next time.
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:26.420]   There it is.
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:27.460]   Look at that.
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:28.220]   Jeff and Gina.
[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:29.620]   Wow, look at that art.
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:30.780]   Don't you like that?
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:32.180]   It's art.
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.580]   We got art.
[01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:35.540]   I need a shave.
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:37.460]   Gina just looks sad.
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:38.860]   No, do I look sad?
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:40.540]   It's kind of mournful.
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:42.020]   Whistful.
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:43.940]   The wistful, Gina, Japan.
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:45.100]   And I'm in the middle.
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:46.660]   It's a shame.
[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:48.500]   But I am there on the cloud there.
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:49.540]   You just can't--
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:50.700]   Yeah.
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:52.820]   Sometimes that just, you know, seeing in the middle
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:54.500]   of the workout.
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:55.100]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:57.260]   We'll see you next time on Twink.
