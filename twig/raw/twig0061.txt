[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.840]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.520]   It's time for Twig.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.680]   This week in Google and the cloud--
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.200]   and I want to emphasize and the cloud,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.160]   because sometimes Google is going to go out of business,
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.560]   long before we ever do.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.160]   So we'll have something else to talk about.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.320]   Gina Trapani is here, one year older,
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.600]   none the wiser--
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.600]   Hello, none the wiser.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.080]   --buzzled tops, young genius.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.400]   And loaded with cupcakes.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.920]   Gina, of course, is blogs at smarterware.org
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.360]   and writes for Fast Company, fastcompany.com/worksmart
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.160]   as her new feature on Fast Company.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.360]   Great to have you, Gina.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.160]   Good to be here.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.960]   Gina, are you older than half-page?
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.640]   I am 35.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.320]   Oh, phew.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.520]   She's not half-our-aged, Jeff.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.680]   She's a third-our-aged.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.240]   No, that's a huge sheet.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.240]   That makes you very happy.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.080]   I'm officially middle-aged, I think.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.480]   It's 35% for you.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.800]   But you don't know middle-aged.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.520]   Jeff, we may not be twice-uraged,
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.800]   but we're 50% older than her.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.360]   Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Leo.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.760]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.080]   He's actually an Amsterdam.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.400]   As old as I am.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.320]   What are you doing in Amsterdam?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.040]   The Picnic Conference, which is here,
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.000]   which I think that out on last year,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.600]   because I had my prostate out in the year before,
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   because there was a scheduling mess.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.920]   So I'm here this year.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.280]   And Amsterdam is a great city.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.480]   So what the heck?
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.360]   I'm here to speak five times tomorrow.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.880]   Wow.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.840]   I'm going to be so sick of myself.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.640]   What fun.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.120]   Is Picnic about journalism?
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.720]   No, it's more kind of the European South by Southwest
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.880]   with the blasting.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.240]   Oh, let's go, Gina, next year, Picnic.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.720]   I'm there.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.760]   We need more South by Southwest once a year
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.200]   is not enough for that party.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.760]   Oh, it's not, you know, because we need to do that.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.120]   Well, Gina's not committed to going to South by yet.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.840]   I don't know.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.080]   I'm feeling kind of maybe not.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.840]   I'm not sure.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.480]   How many have you been to?
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.840]   I've been every year since, I mean, I think 2005, 2006.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.680]   So you're bored.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.160]   You're bored.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.520]   It's changed a lot.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.280]   And like, you know, the girls hanging out,
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.120]   hanging out with the Red Bull, you know,
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.600]   just the whole vibe has kind of changed.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.000]   It's become super, super commercial.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   So I don't know.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.480]   I'm having that the hipster South by Southwest go
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.600]   or like, guys, jump the shark moment.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.480]   So I don't know.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.720]   I haven't missed in a really long time.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.520]   So see, I'm the guy who goes to--
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.880]   this is my first time last year.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.760]   I'll be going to Burning Man this next time.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.400]   And that-- I'll be--
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   I'm that guy.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.720]   No, I'm that guy.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.800]   I'm the guy who goes, oh, is he really going to Burning Man?
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.840]   No, I don't know.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.120]   My son says we're going to Burning Man next year.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.840]   And basically, I'm the Jump the Shark guy.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.720]   When Leo shows up, the event, the conference
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.560]   says Jump the Shark.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.640]   It's over.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.880]   Forget it.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.360]   I think you guys are going to be there.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.320]   It'll be very difficult for me not to go.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.320]   We had such a good time this year.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.600]   I just--
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   We did it.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.680]   --got time together.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.040]   It was really fun.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.560]   The highlight with the dinner with you, Leo,
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.040]   the dinner that cost you $25,000.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.160]   Oh, that is true.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160]   Where they came with the skewers of meat.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.640]   What did it cost?
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.280]   That was amazing.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.240]   You remember?
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.600]   I showed it on the live stream.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   I don't remember, but I showed it on the live stream.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.320]   There were about 30 or 40 people.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.000]   We took everybody who was in our party
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.040]   and then a bunch of other friends of Twidout to--
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.760]   what was it called?
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.520]   It's got a name.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.160]   It's got some--
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.720]   Chiras, chiras, chiras, chiras, chiras, chiras.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.960]   What was it called?
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.480]   Chiras, Korea, kind of restaurant.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.200]   But what was it called?
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   It was--
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   It was a name.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.000]   No, no, no, but it's on the han-a-ha-ha-ha.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.040]   And the han-a-ha-ha-ha.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.960]   I took a Hindi--
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.920]   I took an Indian-- a vegetarian Indian friend there
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.400]   the year before.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.240]   He couldn't even walk in because the odor of meat was soaked.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.600]   Oh, it is too meaty for me, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.400]   But they actually had a wonderful salad bar
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.880]   because they want to fill you up on the cheap stuff.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.880]   So the salad-- it was one of the best salad bars
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.400]   I've ever seen.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.600]   So I think a vegetarian actually would be very happy there.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.160]   But if you're really a vegetarian and the guy comes around,
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.600]   he's got a sword loaded with meat and says, what do you want?
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.400]   Hey, I can see you.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.960]   This has to make you want to come.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.880]   It really does.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.400]   It actually-- you're changing my mind right now.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.000]   I'm like, God, that was a good dinner.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.120]   It's a pizza store.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.560]   We'll see.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.120]   We shall see.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.440]   It was just fun.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.120]   It was really fun.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.320]   It was really fun to see you guys.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.720]   I'm not going to put in a panel.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.160]   And he and I are on it.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.800]   Basically, we're going to argue whether or not
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.880]   companies must be evil.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.360]   Oh, that's great.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.320]   Yeah, it's a great topic.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.640]   What a good topic.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.160]   Now, and Gina--
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.280]   Is there to be our moderator if you will so
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.600]   dane as to attend?
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.360]   I know.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.960]   There's no way I can't go.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.080]   What the opportunity to do the panel and the dinner, I mean--
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.600]   Now, do you have to be voted in, Jeff?
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.800]   How is-- what is the process?
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.840]   Is there a--
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.080]   Well, I was talking about this.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.600]   But yeah, I think you basically do.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.040]   I put in a panel about public business
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.320]   and I haven't heard a crap.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.720]   So I guess I didn't get voted in.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.760]   But you know, they have some leeway--
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.280]   yeah.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.360]   --cuedas to put in things that--
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.720]   because he's producing the event.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.800]   He should be able to put in things that makes sense
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.560]   for the event.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.480]   Fogo de Chao.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.080]   That's it.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.600]   That was it.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.360]   Oh, very good.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.080]   And it's a--
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.320]   Jane, there's one in San Francisco, I'm told.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.720]   It is a very good restaurant.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.240]   I really enjoy it.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.840]   It was fun.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.720]   And in fact, my friend, an engineer for the radio show,
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.840]   Luis, who is Brazilian, just lived his whole life there,
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.960]   said it's actually very authentic and very good.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.280]   I'm going to sue you when I end up
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.480]   in the hospital with cardiac.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.480]   That's OK.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.720]   I'll be the guy on the other Gurney.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.680]   What are you talking about?
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.040]   My co-respondent.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.160]   Eric Schmidt shows up on the Colbert Report.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.640]   Now, Jeff, I know you didn't see it.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.040]   Gina, did you?
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.720]   I did.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.920]   I did.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.840]   I really enjoyed it.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.160]   Well, if you don't want to get in trouble,
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.080]   do you want to do a dramatic rendition of it?
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.760]   It'd be funny if I had the transcript, I would.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.280]   But since I don't, let's just play it.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.240]   What happens, by the way, is that YouTube has a very effective--
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.120]   there was a good article on them.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.760]   Was it codinghorror.com, Gina?
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.280]   I think it was.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.560]   codinghorror, yep.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.600]   This week about this YouTube automated system that flags--
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.160]   it looks for a fingerprint of copyrighted content--
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.880]   flags it.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.360]   And then the copyright holder gets to decide what happens.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.640]   And I had a tweet last week's tweet
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.800]   pulled by NBC just automatic.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.440]   I mean, there's no letters from a lawyer or anything.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.320]   And this is a news show, so I'm of the opinion.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.200]   It's fair use.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.080]   But nevertheless, by playing this clip,
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:31.120]   I believe that we'll be flagged and perhaps pulled off YouTube
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.560]   for doing it.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.400]   But you know what?
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.360]   I got to go on with the news.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.320]   The news must go on.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.800]   This is for--
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.840]   You appeal?
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.880]   There is a structure of repeal.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.800]   Yeah, we're going to appeal.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.880]   But it's-- yeah.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.380]   But it's--
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.760]   It creates so much word in the way.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.680]   By the time.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.160]   By the time.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.600]   What we want to do is a blanket appeal that says, look,
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.320]   anything on the Twitch channel, because we're a news
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.960]   operation, you shouldn't have that problem.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.200]   And trust me, I'm Leo the nicest guy on the internet.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.160]   Would I lie?
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.000]   Here is this Colbert report from last night--
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I'm sorry, the Colbert report from last night
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.520]   with Steven Colbert and Eric Schmidt.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.320]   My guest tonight is the CEO of Google.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.280]   At least that's what it said when I looked him up on Bing.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.040]   I'm a certain commentary here so that it is clearly not
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.520]   a reuse of this clip, but there is commentary.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.880]   Oh, look.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.840]   He made a joke.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.520]   Please welcome Eric Schmidt.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.320]   Now I was told that by somebody who was on the Colbert
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.520]   report that you are instructed before the show,
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.680]   do not try to be funny.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.800]   That's Colbert's job.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.120]   Just be a straight man.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.840]   Let's see how it does.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.360]   I love it.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.120]   It's lovely to see you.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.160]   I get to put another notch in my billionaire belt.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.040]   Wonderful to meet you.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.880]   Now, sir, you are the head of Google, which is--
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.920]   I love it when moderators tell the person they're talking
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.480]   to, something that the person-- you are the head of Google.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.400]   Really?
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.400]   Wow.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.080]   It's like OK.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.360]   Crap, I better get to work.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.440]   What am I doing here?
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.680]   I thought I was out of work.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.640]   Biggest, most important companies in America.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.440]   Thank you.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.240]   Now, hey, I didn't do it.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.400]   You guys did it.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.640]   You and your algorithms, right?
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.000]   It's an algorithm that you guys make your cash
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.800]   by doing essentially data mining on what we Americans--
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.520]   I'm bored already.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.080]   Not true.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.880]   I'm going to go with my explanation.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.880]   All right.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.560]   But you do know things about Americans
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.080]   that we maybe, when we were children,
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.600]   don't think people would know about us.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.320]   Our likes, our dislikes, our codified regionally,
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.520]   if not individually, correct?
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.640]   I love the blank look.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.240]   It's true that America--
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.360]   From America, your searches.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.840]   Yeah, that's just the silent.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.320]   Uh-huh.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.000]   And I'm supposed to trust you on that.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.280]   Not only do you have to, but it's the law in a lot of countries.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.320]   For you to forget.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:53.800]   Yes.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.120]   OK.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.000]   You can remember.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.760]   But I guess my point is--
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.280]   Uh-oh.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:58.920]   I try not to.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.800]   They're pretty disturbing.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.960]   Now, by the way, why don't I get more hits when I put in tall women
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.640]   carrying heavy things?
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.480]   Did you get all that?
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.640]   Can you do anything about that?
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.240]   Is that a sight you're trying to promote?
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.560]   No, just a general interest.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.080]   No ads come up for that.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.040]   Well, you need to work to get more content.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.080]   OK, fantastic.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.680]   In that area.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.680]   No.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.360]   So you wouldn't call that data mining?
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.920]   No, we actually don't do data mining,
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.760]   but we do as we go.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.040]   Or data mining, either one.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.320]   Data or data.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:27.920]   And I don't want--
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.440]   Why is that awkward, Jeff?
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.240]   It's-- that was awkward.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.760]   It's just in a basic party kind of way
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.680]   that Eric's trying not to be funny,
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.760]   and he's always not being funny.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.040]   Right.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:49.200]   It's just-- it's like listening to the Howard Stern guys
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.440]   called the dork on the phone who doesn't know it's a joke.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.680]   I don't watch his show on a regular basis.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.240]   Which is your right.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.560]   That's what Eric is told to do.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.000]   That's what he's supposed to do.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.480]   He's doing the right thing.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.040]   Doesn't this happen all the time, though, Gina?
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.080]   It's kind of awkward because people are trying to--
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.200]   they've got a funny guy, and they're trying to be serious.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:06.400]   I mean--
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   Yeah, of course.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.840]   And listen, I mean, it's interesting.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.360]   Me and Colbert says, you know, you mine this data,
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.440]   and Schmidt's like, well, we don't really do data mining.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.920]   Does Google not do data mining?
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.320]   Would you guys say that?
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.440]   I mean, because data mining is like a very scary way
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.880]   to characterize what Google does.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.360]   But I mean, I don't know.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.840]   What is the technical definition of data mining?
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   I would say that Google--
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.440]   You know, you're right, Gina.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.160]   --finds data from web pages to determine search results.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.560]   Wikipedia, data mining is the process
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.600]   of extracting patterns from data.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.640]   Well, hell yeah, they do data mining.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.320]   I may realize this is not a technical show, you know what I mean?
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.240]   But it was interesting to see him say, well, we don't mind data.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.120]   We just figure out--
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.520]   And you data strip mining.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.560]   Talk about data mining.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.960]   They do mountaintop removal mining.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.440]   So obviously, what Schmidt is responding to
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.120]   is the underlying fear that people have that it's your data,
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.520]   that they're personally like somebody's-- oh, look what
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.720]   he looked at.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.920]   But it is exactly what data mining means,
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.520]   is what Google does, extracting patterns from data.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.040]   I wonder how he's going to justify that.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.560]   Our computers go out and they find out everything going on
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.280]   on the web.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.760]   And they figure out what points to each other.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.840]   And that gives us the algorithm, which is called PageRank.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.040]   And that's how we decide how to rank the results.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.360]   And this algorithm--
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.560]   Well, see, he's--
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.720]   He's-- now you see what he's done here.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.320]   It's very clever.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.400]   He's changed the subject.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.160]   Well, we don't data mine when we spider.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:41.680]   Right.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.240]   But that's not what Colbert really is asking.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.480]   He's saying, are you paying attention to what I'm searching for?
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.880]   Do you data mine search queries, which Google does?
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.120]   By the way, is Eric wearing loafers?
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.520]   Aww.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.440]   Now I feel like we're being really mean.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.560]   Well, I'm sorry, but brown loafers in a gray suit.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.560]   Um--
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.680]   I mean, to his credit, he did say Google forgets over time,
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.240]   Google forgets.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.080]   And they're talking about two different kinds of data
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.720]   in this conversation.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.240]   They're talking about individuals browsing or search history,
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.200]   and then the data on the web, the public data that's on the web.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:15.720]   But I think--
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.840]   And there's nothing scary about the public data on the web.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.680]   But that's what Schmidt did.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.120]   He did a very clever slide of hand, I thought.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.200]   He redirected.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:23.960]   That was worthy of--
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.600]   He's clever.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.000]   That's a politician's answer.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.520]   That's what--
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.080]   Well, he's also--
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.200]   Well, Eric has had to learn not to try to be funny.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.360]   His line about people being--
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.520]   you know, chains are in--
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.640]   he's 21, which I first heard three years ago.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.640]   He was talking about the show.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.320]   He was joking about his lap.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:41.840]   Colbert happened on it.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.120]   But he said it was recently--
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.480]   The whole audience laughed.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.400]   Basically, the press, how old iron he lost,
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.040]   gets translated, and German, all iron he lost,
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.200]   and Sledgehammer added.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:51.960]   Right.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.400]   And he admits that it's a bad joke in this interview.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.240]   Well, let's see.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.000]   Let's see.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.480]   At what point will Google's algorithm
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.520]   become self-aware and turn on its master?
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.160]   Hopefully not in our lifetimes.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.240]   OK.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.200]   It turns out that this algorithm is pretty straightforward.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.680]   It deals with really large things.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.840]   Enormous numbers of information, billions and millions.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.520]   What computers are good for?
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.720]   Humans aren't that-- humans aren't very good at that.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.680]   Humans aren't very good.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.600]   Humans are not very good.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.080]   Humans are not very good.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.360]   Computers, that's why computers will eventually take over.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.200]   Humans are not very good at dealing with billions of things,
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   whereas computers are.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.880]   I should scrub ahead of the audience.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.320]   I think we all do.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.000]   Where does it go?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.920]   There's one China--
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.320]   you know, basically there's Hong Kong.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.160]   I was going to ask about China.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.160]   It's about China, yeah.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.840]   There's one China-- you know, basically there's Hong Kong
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.000]   and mainland China, one country, two systems.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.440]   We like the Hong Kong system better.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.360]   Now, you famously said--
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:43.840]   This is said.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.480]   And I completely support this--
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.640]   the idea that someday, young people,
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.480]   instead of having privacy for the things
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.440]   that they put up on Facebook, may be able to expunge that.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.880]   Since once it's up there, it exists forever.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.160]   Then one day, they'll just erase their histories
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.680]   and change their names, and they'll be Scott Free.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.560]   It was a joke.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.600]   It just wasn't very good.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.160]   I guess that's too hip for the room.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.640]   No, it just wasn't a very good joke.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.920]   That was all for it, because I think
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.160]   it would be very enticing as an employer to go.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.720]   You have no history, and you changed your name yesterday.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:20.840]   But this is--
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.600]   Welcome aboard.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.600]   Seriously what?
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.120]   The serious goal is just remember when you post something
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.840]   that the computers remember forever.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.640]   Whose computer?
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.400]   Is your computer?
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.040]   Well, it's actually on the web.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.800]   That's a very good point.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.880]   Very good question.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.720]   Whose computer?
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.400]   And we went kind of both ways.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.360]   Like at first, he said, well, Google's computers forget
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.800]   after a certain amount of time, because that's a law.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.440]   And then he says, but don't put anything online
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.920]   that you don't want, because it's kept forever,
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.040]   because computers across the internet will remember it.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.960]   Well, and I have to say, I think Shman has intentionally
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.800]   confused people.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.240]   There's two kinds of data.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.920]   There's the what's on the web data, the scrubbing data.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.920]   And there's the search history data.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.440]   People's privacy issues are all about search data.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.720]   But when you post something on a website, Google saves that.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.840]   Just go to Google's cache, the history.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.760]   That's public information that someone has--
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.040]   There's no reason not to save it.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.200]   You published it.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.000]   Exactly.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.760]   So--
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.720]   Well, there's a copyright question still
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.920]   not settled about caching.
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.720]   Right.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.200]   In fact, I think even about scraping a whole site
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.520]   to analyze it, and though you don't serve it up,
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.520]   keep your on your servers.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.080]   I think that that should be allowed,
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.600]   but there is a copyright fight that's
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.480]   going to come at some point.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.240]   Well, and then there's people like Brewster Kale
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.760]   at the archive.org.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.800]   We're saving terabytes of data a day.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.280]   And from the side of the angel's, God bless them.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.480]   Because that's our history, and nobody else is saving it.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:55.000]   But if you're a teenager, and the picture of you smoking pot
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.040]   is in that archive--
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.560]   I didn't have any an Amsterdam.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.720]   I didn't have any.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.920]   I swear to you, I haven't had any pot here.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.200]   All you have to do is walk down the street and inhale.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.280]   More Google.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.920]   It's all out there on the web somewhere.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.920]   It's all over there.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.120]   We collected and they take your day computers.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.280]   They're all over the world.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.880]   And if it's really juicy, they'll be copies everywhere.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.600]   Great.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.760]   That was a bad thing to say.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.840]   The PR people are going, oh, he did it again.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.640]   Eric just loves--
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.600]   see, he was trying to make a joke, right?
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.360]   But that was exactly what you don't--
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.240]   if you're Google's--
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.120]   Who's probably smart?
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.280]   He was being smart.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.760]   Is there anything that you don't want people
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.960]   to know about you?
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.800]   Well, everybody has privacy and privacy.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   It's pretty important.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.840]   Well, we actually think privacy is pretty important.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.400]   We're actually making it possible for you
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.720]   to know what kind of stuff we have on you
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.720]   and actually delete a whole bunch of--
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.400]   Talking point.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.680]   Your company, your famously, your motto is don't be evil.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.800]   Right now, your stock price is $513.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.320]   Share.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.040]   How low will a lot have to go before you say, that's it.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.320]   We're going with evil.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.320]   You were not--
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.720]   You've never been evil?
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.160]   No, we--
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.240]   Not even a little bit?
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.400]   No, we were not evil.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   We had no press-act price.

[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.400]   We had no press-act price.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:05.400]   Mike Arrington is again showing he's just brilliant in terms of driving traffic.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:12.400]   Mike hears about, he was tipped off, he says, and Mike's a storyteller.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:16.400]   Some of this may be dramatization.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:21.440]   Yesterday I was tipped off about a "secret meeting" end quote between a group of "super
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:26.240]   angels" end quote being held at Bin 38, a restaurant in Barre in San Francisco.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.800]   I was told, "Do not come.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.800]   You will not be welcome."
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.000]   So I did what any self-respecting blogger would do.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.240]   I like it that Mike said "blogger."
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.200]   For some reason that kind of like validates it, right?
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:43.320]   I drove over to Bin 38, parked my car and walked in.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.200]   And you got to commend him for doing that.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.200]   Right.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.400]   Thumb does nose.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.520]   At the back of the restaurant, a private room was, by the way, I think that's right there.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.720]   That's distinctive good.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.120]   I don't know.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.120]   Is it journalism, Jeff?
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.120]   What do you call that?
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.120]   Yeah, of course it is.
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.040]   But that's the thing is that as you talked about this before, I was thinking that there
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.520]   are the accidental journalists.
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.520]   Aaron can never intended to become a journalist.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:12.600]   He's a lawyer who wrote about this stuff because it was going to help us be seafood.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.600]   Right.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:14.600]   And re-blogged it.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:18.360]   An analyst who went through hell and comes back out and is a journalist.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:24.080]   I hesitate to throw Mark Cuban in there, but he's investing in things that are quasi-journalism.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.080]   I like that.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:28.440]   These are people who believe in journalism, who believe in finding stories and telling
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.440]   the truth to people.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.440]   That's freaking journalism.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.440]   And that's what Aaron does in this case.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:39.320]   No one could say that he was off in the conclusions that he drew, but in process journalism, which
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:43.840]   he and I talk about each in our own way a lot.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:44.840]   That's part of the story.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.360]   Hey, these guys were out of dinner.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.360]   What do you think happened?
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.360]   You think they were doing no-no?
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:49.360]   You think they were okay?
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.680]   You tell me what you think.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.400]   But I, gee, it's worth asking you, isn't it?
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.400]   And that's what it is.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:58.720]   You said in the back of the restaurant was a private room with a long oval table sitting
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.360]   around the table, Godfather's style.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.800]   Or last supper style.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:09.960]   I mean, it could have been where 10 or so of the highest profile angel investors in Silicon
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.400]   Valley.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.080]   These investors known as super angels because they've mostly moved on to launch small venture
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.080]   funds of their own are all friends of mine.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.520]   I knew each person in the room very well.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.720]   Very, very well, he says.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.600]   I certainly didn't think anything was amiss.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:29.160]   I expected a friendly hello and an invitation to sit down for a drink or two before being
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.960]   shoot off while they talked about whatever they thought should be kept off record.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:38.200]   Instead, it went something like this, me, hey, person who was talking.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.280]   Oh, oh no, me.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.760]   Hi, I heard you guys were here.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:51.880]   I wanted to stop by and say hi, them, dead silence, me, so them deafening silence, me.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.200]   This is usually where you guys say sit down, have a drink.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.280]   Them not one sound.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.280]   Me.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:00.280]   This is awkward.
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.440]   I guess I'll be leaving now.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:06.720]   He says, I've never seen now this is where okay, so far so good.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.720]   This is where it goes downhill.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.480]   I've never seen a more guilty looking group of people.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:15.400]   He says, lively conversations often die quickly when I arrive.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.720]   I've learned not to take it personally.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.760]   Well, I know if that's the case, but but I did sniff around a little after.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.520]   I think he takes it very personally, but but I did sniff around a little afterwards and
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:27.040]   I've spoken to three people who were at that meeting and this is where things got interesting.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:32.040]   He says these guys were colluding.
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:37.480]   They decided they wanted to counteract Paul Graham's Y Combinator because of its growing
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:38.680]   power.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:43.920]   They were complaining about rising deal valuations and deciding to act as a group to reduce those
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:44.920]   valuations.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:49.240]   That's collusion and illegal.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.240]   It's clear as definition.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.240]   I don't know.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:55.320]   Is it illegal if companies are not price fixing?
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.320]   But is there a price?
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.320]   This isn't a price.
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.320]   This is how much we're going to invest.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.320]   I don't know.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.320]   Is it?
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.920]   Well, no, but you're going to you're going to you.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:02.920]   Well, it's morally wrong.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.920]   It's morally wrong.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.920]   I'll get you all that.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:05.920]   It's morally wrong.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:06.920]   I don't know if it's illegal.
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:07.920]   I don't know if it's illegal.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:11.720]   Well, the weird thing is price fixing usually happens on the sell side.
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:12.720]   Right.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.720]   These are buyers.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:17.640]   That's not you and I can collude not to pay more than a certain price for a product.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:23.120]   In fact, if I can get everybody in the country to say we will never pay more than $5 a year
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:26.120]   for domain registration, is that illegal?
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.320]   No, that's called consumer action.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:34.760]   Yeah, but investors and consumers.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:41.360]   Well, yeah, I admit that certainly it's ethically challenged, whether it's illegal is the question.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.160]   How the group can it is fascinating.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:48.160]   Yeah, and you know how the group can act together to keep traditional venture capitalists out
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.160]   of deals entirely.
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:57.120]   You know, who of course, and who it harms is the startup trying to get money.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.560]   Apparently, there's a wiki.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.800]   He says one source says there's a wiki that the group which the group explicitly talks
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.560]   about how they should act to keep valuations down.
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.360]   Oh, is that stupid?
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.960]   If there's a wiki, that's a mistake.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:20.360]   Now, now Dave McClure, who was one of the guys there, said this is bogus.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.480]   We weren't talking about anything like that.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:26.360]   We were, we were, we were drinking and having fun.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:29.200]   We just didn't want Mike to be there.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.280]   He says, Mike, you don't get invited to everything.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.640]   I don't get invited to everything.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.280]   That's just the way it is in life.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:40.320]   On the other hand, Henry Blodges guys now have enough power.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.320]   Right.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.320]   Well, they could be.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:50.640]   I mean, I sat in meetings in the newspaper industry where they made sure there was a lawyer
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:55.400]   in the room before so much as the wine was ordered.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.360]   My father walked out of a price-fixing meeting back in his name.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:01.840]   One of my things I'm very proud of him.
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:05.960]   And that's part of the issue of the newspaper industry with this idea of everybody going
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.240]   behind a paywall.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:09.240]   That is collusion.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:14.920]   And there, the newspaper industry is going to the feds trying to get anti-trust exemptions
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.480]   so they can just talk.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:23.480]   So these guys hold a power in a market and you may think they're innocent.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.800]   But what we've done so, and it may well be, and they may not have been there, but Aaron
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:31.320]  son one way or another raised a really important issue.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.320]   Good.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:36.880]   So we're Fred Wilson on his post saying, I don't think it's bad to happen.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.640]   Boy, I'm glad he did it.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:46.960]   Yeah, Fred, Fred is a VC who would be harmed by this.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.960]   Yes, because Fred's a VC rather than an angel.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:53.120]   Though VCs are more and more and more becoming angels.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.840]   Fred is investing at the level that he wants the system to be doing.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:56.840]   He never would.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:01.240]   He's putting much smaller stakes and smaller companies because that's the new reality.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.720]   So VCs are not competing with angels.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:09.440]   They can go on together because they do in the VCs world stupid stuff.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:12.480]   And now they can hold a sway.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:18.360]   So you've got the seed accelerators like Y Combinator, Baderworks, Seed Camp versus
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:23.640]   the angels versus the VCs.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:29.160]   Mike at the end of the post says, and he's a lawyer, so I'll defer to him.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:33.560]   He says, it's absolutely unlawful for competitors to act together to keep other competitors
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:37.200]   out of the market or to discuss ways to keep prices under control.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:41.120]   And that appears to be exactly what this group is doing.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:45.800]   He says, well, that appears to be as though.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.320]   Yeah, well, he doesn't know.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.520]   I mean, he has sources.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:53.240]   He says on a side note, this is a difficult poster.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.960]   Because I call nearly every person in that room a friend, but these actions are so completely
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:57.960]   inappropriate.
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.000]   It has to be called out.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.800]   He says, included just about every nation.
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:08.040]   I salute him because he's raising an issue and fine.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:12.720]   If nothing happened, these guys are not going to go out and have brings together in an organized
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.960]   fashion again.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.480]   And they're going to be cautious about this now.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:20.680]   And that's the role of a journalist is to be a watchdog and to say, we are watching
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.840]   you.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:26.280]   And I'm fascinated that nothing is secret or private.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.600]   These people can get together.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:31.200]   They smell the rat and they call the rat keeper.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:36.280]   I have to say, if you're going to do it though, don't have it in a public place.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:37.560]   I haven't had somebody's house.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:41.520]   Their God knows their houses are big enough to host a party.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.400]   Then you don't have to worry about Mike pulling up.
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.760]   Maybe they're too cheap.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.880]   Ken Shepherds in our VP engineering says, this is just one ad for bin 38.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.880]   It's just a bit.
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:58.120]   Where great deals get made.
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.120]   It's like that movie.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:04.200]   What's the name in the movie that's just out that's all to be brought to be fraud?
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.200]   What?
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.760]   Oh, while he in Phoenix?
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.760]   Who's it?
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:08.760]   No.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:10.520]   Oh, yeah, that was wild.
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:13.640]   That whole thing that he did on Letterman with the beard and he was like stoned out.
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:14.640]   That was all an act.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.520]   And it was for a movie.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:21.480]   There was a weird document fake documentary about a guy who was weird.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:25.120]   Man, that's commitment to your art.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:32.520]   Willing to have the entire world think that you are a drugged out nut case for your art.
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:39.160]   I'm trying to think that Mary was right or wrong in this.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:41.920]   I'm not sure.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.640]   I'm not sure.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:48.160]   If it were somebody besides Mike, let's say it.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:50.640]   If it were anybody but Mike, we'd all go, yeah, that was great.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.760]   That was the right thing to do.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.000]   I think that's a very good read in the situation.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.400]   I'm hesitating to say that I think he did the right thing because Ericton is funny.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.680]   He likes to stir the pot.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:02.680]   He's big drama.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.960]   Yeah, he stirs the pot exactly.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:11.240]   So yes, I agree with Jeff, but I don't trust Ericton fully.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.000]   So that's why I'm hesitating.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Sorry, Mike.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   Right.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:20.240]   So what you're saying, Leo, I think, is that Ericton went with this in a journalistic
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.200]   sense prematurely.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:27.160]   The New York Times would have verified more or it'll do him before having said it.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.160]   But that's why.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.800]   But in Ericton's view of processed journalism, he throws it out.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.360]   Well, and that, of course, we know that.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:38.000]   Mike, Mike, and this is the only problem I have really with TechCrunch all along is that
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.280]   he will get a source and he'll go with it.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:45.160]   He's even said, and I'll correct it later if it's wrong.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:49.600]   That's why I underlined right at the beginning that he said as a blogger, he didn't say
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:54.200]   as a journalist, as a reporter, as an investigator reporter, he said, as a blogger.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:58:00.720]   And I think even he is consciously saying, explicitly saying, I'm going to throw these
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:05.440]   accusations out even if they're unfounded, unsupported, even if they don't stand up to
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:10.640]   a test that a journalistic entity like the New York Times would insist upon, I, as a
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:12.680]   blogger, I'm going to throw these out.
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.600]   And that's what to me is the most interesting about this.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:17.280]   I think we can acknowledge if it were anybody but Mike.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:22.600]   If it's Ryan Block who wrote this article, well, first of all, I don't think anybody
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:25.240]   besides Mike would jump to this collusion thing.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.760]   Well, anyone would history of being a little more measured?
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.760]   I think we would take this a little more seriously.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.400]   This is what we're saying, right?
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.320]   Yeah, and that's, and that's, Mike's, you know, I'll clean up the mess later.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.800]   I'll put it out there and clean up the mess later.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.040]   That's his, that's his MO.
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.400]   And that's, that's, that's fine.
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.400]   That's one way to, to do it.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.840]   That just means that people aren't going to take you as seriously.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:44.840]   Right.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:45.840]   Yes, exactly.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:48.440]   And, you know, secretive about that.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:49.880]   It says that's what I do.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:53.520]   And Mike, that's the, that's, this is the price you pay is that people go, well, Mike's
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:54.520]   saying it.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.520]   Exactly.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.960]   Well, I, I went to work for a big media company.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:04.000]   I was trained in the sensitivities of the company to our number one union stuff and
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.560]   number two antitrust because it had been burned before.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:08.560]   Right.
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:12.920]   And that kind of meeting would never happen in the newspaper industry.
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.480]   And if it did, and then I'll say, should I take it back?
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:16.680]   It would happen.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:21.040]   But if it did, certain people would run away from it knowing that there was trouble to
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.040]   be had.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:27.080]   I think it did happen in relation to paywalls.
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.600]   But I think certain people in the industry would say, I'm not going to be near that because
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.600]   it's trouble.
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:35.440]   So at one, Aaron, I think went too far on how he expressed it.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.840]   He could have expressed everything he said as a question.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:41.520]   What if, gee, why would these get together?
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:45.280]   Well, he says he has sources who were at the thing.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.760]   Dave McClure is at the thing, said this is bogus.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:50.440]   We got together to shoot the breeze.
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:55.400]   And you know, it's he said she said, but so, but, and I, and you know, we're now here's
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.400]   the funny part.
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.520]   All the people there, they're starting to get there.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.480]   There's now lists coming out of who was there.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.880]   So they're all now, I forget that game theory thing, but they're all looking around each
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.680]   other, wondering, call their agent.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.440]   So they don't trust each other.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.440]   You're right.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:16.000]   And the thing he has instilled a lack of trust in the most powerful angels, the most powerful
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.240]   industry in the world.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.240]   That's funny.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.840]   You have to kind of appreciate that.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.840]   You do have to appreciate that.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.320]   You have to appreciate Mike in general.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.520]   I mean, the guy is very good at what he does week in, week out.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.600]   He comes up with this stuff three days ago, he said Facebook's doing a phone equally.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.880]   Facebook denied it.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.960]   And he said the PR people are on the need not to know list.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.240]   This is, this is Mike from Mike.
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.240]   This is perfect.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.400]   My sources says Facebook is doing a phone.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.360]   It makes sense based on Joe Hewitt being there and the Android guy being there.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.360]   And I love this defense of his story.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.800]   That's what Apple and Google said when I said they were doing a phone.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:57.920]   Oh, well, that proves it.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.280]   So really what I'm saying is this is the new era of blogger journalism.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:07.600]   And for blogger journalism, as opposed to traditional journalism, getting the page views
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.280]   is all that matters.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.880]   Now, little unfair.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.880]   Okay.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.520]   Little, not wrong, not wrong, but not always fair because I think that it's also what
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.760]   Arrington would say.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:23.920]   And he and I use this phrase together is that in process journalism, you throw it out there
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.600]   and you see what sticks.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:32.080]   Now I'm trained and you're trained to throw in so many caveats, reputedly, I asked them
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.600]   in this and that he says screw it all, throw it out there.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.360]   And if it's wise, you said before, if it's wrong, I'll correct it.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:42.840]   And that's not the standards by which we operate it or the New York Times operates.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:46.280]   And I think that I would probably, if I were in Arrington, she was put in more caveats.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:52.520]   Nonetheless, there is a move to process journalism, which is true of Arrington and Denton.
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.960]   It says throw it out there.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:54.960]   See what's right?
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:55.960]   Here's what we know.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.680]   Here's what we don't know.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.560]   So by the way, Mike, as a result of the Facebook story, got a face-to-face interview with Mark
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:08.720]   Zuckerberg, who began the interview by apologizing to Mike for the miscommunication, our folks
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:13.080]   were trying to reach out to you and weren't able to reach you before we issued our statement.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:19.480]   Zuckerberg explains that, well, we're not doing a physical phone.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.440]   We're looking at making software layers on phones.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.440]   So Wow.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.920]   Yeah, but Mike was saying they were going to build.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:34.440]   I don't know now if Mike's pulling back and saying, oh, okay, so you're not going to
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.800]   make the phone.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.800]   I don't know.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.440]   I haven't read the whole thing in great detail.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.600]   Yeah, that's just a couple of questions.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.800]   I was the way I got into a screening one day.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.400]   Oh, I'm so excited about this.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.160]   Amber MacArthur saw it last night and loved it.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.080]   Everybody who's seen it says it's one of the best films of the year.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:56.680]   We're talking about the social network, the Facebook movie.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:00.400]   Or whatever it's accuracy.
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:04.000]   And Zuck says that it's not accurate and he's not going to see it.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.520]   Well, I wouldn't go if I were him.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.080]   I might well, I guess he has a.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.080]   I want to know what he's talking about.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:12.960]   You wouldn't want to know what they're saying, but what if they said that like they really
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.680]   trashed you as a person wouldn't wouldn't that be painful and there's really no good
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.120]   way to respond.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.120]   Right.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.120]   Well, right.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.720]   But at least I mean, you're going to get asked questions about the movie.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.520]   At least you have to have answers, you know, you have to have the context.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.920]   Listen, I'm sure that it would be difficult like, you know, from an ego for your ego to
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:31.920]   see the movie.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.680]   But at the same time, the movie is, you know, getting released nationally.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.040]   This is the impression that people are going to have of you.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.040]   Whether or not it's true.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.040]   Right.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.280]   I would think that you'd want to know what that impression was so that you, you know,
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.280]   could.
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.600]   Didn't we talk about this last week?
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.280]   The article and all things digital.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.280]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.280]   The New Yorker profile.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.280]   You mean?
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.280]   Well, there's the Yorker profile, but then you're amazing.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:57.120]   Then the guy who saw it at all things digital, his name escapes me, he said, I feel for Zuckerberg
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:02.600]   because this paints him as a terrible person and it's the only thing most people are ever
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:03.600]   going to see.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.800]   So that's why Mark's doing, you know, that's why Mark's talking to Mike Harrington.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.420]   That's why Mark's talking to the New Yorker.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:11.480]   It'll be on Colbert for you.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.480]   Start.
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.480]   He'll be on Colbert.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:15.480]   You're right.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.480]   Has he done?
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.480]   Go.
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.480]   Oh, boy.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.480]   Is that the train wreck?
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.480]   You want to see?
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:23.480]   Oh, man.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.480]   I think they'd spray him.
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:30.280]   Because I thought they Colbert would know what to do with Zuckerberg.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.480]   You know, here's, I haven't seen the movie yet, but here's what I want to be on the watch
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.480]   out for.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.480]   I wonder whether there is a geek bigotry backlash coming.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.480]   You mean, Andy geek that these cakes have taken over the.
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.480]   Okay.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.480]   And we don't understand them and they're all weird.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.480]   Yeah.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:50.640]   And we're going back to the jocks making fun of the geeks.
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.640]   That's what I'm afraid of here.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:52.640]   It always goes back to that.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.640]   I haven't seen it yet.
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.640]   We'll see.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.640]   You know what Jeff?
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.640]   It always goes back to that, especially in the US.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.640]   I don't know.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:01.800]   You're more an expert on international, but in the US we hate intellectuals.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.480]   We will always hate intellectuals.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:09.000]   They'll always have that egg head, you know, and I think.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.480]   Especially when they're billionaires.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.480]   Yeah, even more.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.440]   So if there is even this short period of honeymoon period over geeks, it ain't going to last.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.440]   Because eventually people are going to know there's too smart.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:23.440]   They don't think smart people, you're rich and smart.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:28.920]   You know, what I did get the chance to sit down with them for an hour straight on the
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.440]   book, I was kind of looking and this is a whole, I can't say this.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.440]   And there's no way I can say this right.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.840]   So I'll just say it.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:41.280]   Is that I was looking for popular renditions of Asperger's.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.280]   Right.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.280]   Right.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.280]   Is this kind of.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.440]   This is commonly held character trait.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:51.640]   Yeah, commonly held or common characterization of Mark is that maybe he's got a little Asperger's
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.640]   or something.
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.120]   Maybe he's got some social issues.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.520]   And I didn't see it.
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.520]   I mean, I think it's the same.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:02.600]   It's the same with Eric Schmidt telling a joke.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:06.200]   Geeks are different and we can celebrate that when it's on Big Bang Theory.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200]   Right.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.680]   But in real life, we don't know how to deal with it.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:12.080]   And the truth is geeks are in charge now.
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.080]   We're going to have a geek president.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:17.800]   You know, Eric Schmidt or somebody like him is going to be president soon.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:21.400]   Um, then I'm a little scared.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.200]   Is he going to wear his ice cream?
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.800]   Hey, kids.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800]   Vote for me.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:32.800]   I already know everything about you.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.960]   Well, we have, you know, we had arguably we did have a geek president.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:39.520]   His name was Jimmy Carter and he was thrown out of office in four years.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.640]   It was a freaking disaster.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:45.600]   He sent me his book for free and I immediately my wife to just give away to the rummage sale.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:46.680]   I can stand harder.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.680]   How thick is it?
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:48.680]   Is it really thick?
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.600]   Oh, oh, I'm actually dying to read it because it's his diaries.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.440]   It's his diaries from the White House.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.360]   It's going to make me so mad.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.960]   He's just such a screw up.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.960]   But he was a geek.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.720]   He was a nuclear engineer.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.120]   He was an absolute walk.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:03.600]   He was a policy walk.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.600]   He was very thoughtful.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.600]   Right.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.600]   You're right.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.600]   He was the, he was our first geek president.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.520]   Actually, Thomas Jefferson was our first geek president.
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:13.560]   In fact, come to think of Jimmy Carter could not have run a company.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.560]   Right.
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:15.560]   He wasn't an administrator.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.560]   Do you think?
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.560]   No.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.560]   No.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:24.920]   I, I, of course, live, breathe and work with geeks all the time and have come to love them.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:28.440]   But I fully understand their social issues.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:33.520]   And I think if you are not used to them, they do come off as being something wrong with
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.520]   them.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:37.400]   You know, a normal person goes, what's wrong with them?
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.720]   You are a normal person and a geek.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:40.720]   She's both.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.520]   You know, right.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:50.800]   How do you see this relational quandary?
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.240]   The normal people not understanding the geeks being weird introverts.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.320]   And is there kind of a geek bigotry, a Greek geek backlash, do you think?
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.320]   Or, or do you think they're weird?
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.320]   Are you treated as a geek?
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.880]   I mean, when you meet people, do they go?
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.120]   You're kind of strange.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:09.680]   Well, no, but that's because I'm not sort of a nerdy looking guy.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:10.680]   Like, I don't look like a geek.
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:11.680]   I don't look like a geek.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.680]   You don't act like a geek.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:13.680]   You're also charming.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:14.680]   You relate to people.
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:15.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.680]   You look people in the eye.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.680]   You smile.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.440]   You, I mean, you can make the case that every, you don't have any.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:23.040]   You can make the case that everybody in this room is a geek.
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.600]   But I don't think any of us are that particular anti social type of geek.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.600]   Right.
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:31.000]   I mean, I think that we all probably share, I mean, you know, I have like a very strong,
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.480]   like sense of introversion during the show is, is hard for me because it's, you know,
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.680]   kind of so public and talking like really drains me and like I'm, I tend toward being
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.160]   very sort of brief and to the point, you know, an email and I have to kind of force myself
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.840]   to, you know, say, Hey, how are you?
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.400]   I mean, kind of go the other way.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.600]   And this is just kind of how I've decided to deal with it because it, I realize that
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.240]   it just, you know, when you, when you relate to people, when you greet them kind of, you
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.280]   know, in those ways, those friendly ways, you get a better response.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:00.120]   I think that, that some geeks are so sort of intellectual that it's just hard.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.320]   They just like, there's not the point, you know, there's no point to that.
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:08.120]   And I get the impression that Mark is a very terse speaker and doesn't go, doesn't go
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120]   to do those niceties.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.720]   That's why I was actually honestly surprised that he opened up that interview with Arrington
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.400]   by apologizing for the miscommunication.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.240]   That seemed like a very sort of warm thing to, to do even the New Yorker.
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.080]   The reporter who profiled him said that he's his communication style is, is off putting.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.440]   He kind of looks off to the side.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.440]   He speaks in very short sentences.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:30.120]   You know, he, you know, he's not, and he's not a great, great interviewer either.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.560]   I don't think that there's a necessarily a backlash going on.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:38.800]   I think geeks are actually kind of culturally like over time, really since the early 80s
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.600]   with Gates are becoming sort of more accepted.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.120]   And I think that now you're much more likely to hear high school students identify as geeks
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.560]   and laugh about it, whereas, you know, back in the day, you would never admit to being
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.720]   one and that was a bad word, you know.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.480]   So I don't think it's too bad, although I think with, with, with Mark, it's like people
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.000]   say he's 26, he's a billionaire, he's stealing everybody's data, then he's horrible.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.400]   I mean, I think that that's the impression people have of him.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.640]   You talk to him, Jeff, what do you say?
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.000]   He comes a vulnerability.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   Is all of that accurate?
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.840]   Is that, is that the mark that you talked to?
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.440]   No, it actually isn't.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.120]   But the thing is I've watched Mark, I go back to watching him at a four square conference
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:19.240]   like three or four years ago.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:25.960]   And the interesting thing about him is that is the, I loved him at the time because he
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.800]   just gave direct answers.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.320]   He didn't put any flowers in the bed.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.320]   That's why I love engineers.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.320]   I love engineers.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.400]   Here is the answer that's that.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.520]   You know, the other example that occurs to me as we're talking about this is, is how Craig
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:49.680]   Newark in trying to respond to the CNN, um, ambush on him who, who didn't call himself.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.040]   I don't think he called himself aspery, particularly.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.600]   Craig is very geeky.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.600]   I tried to, I can't change subjects.
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:56.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:01.480]   Oh, I'm a friend of Craig and I, and I've said this in my blog that, that he's as hard
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:06.120]   for me to read as, um, a prused C plus plus.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.120]   Very, very bland affect.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.040]   The desire and either you can't tell what's ironing, what's real and all that kind of stuff.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.920]   But, but he says of himself, his self awareness is I have trouble changing subjects.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.080]   I have trouble relating to people.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.080]   I have trouble doing this.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.080]   I have trouble doing that.
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:26.560]   This show and this network is the last place I would ever.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:29.280]   Say, you know, oh, you geeks.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.360]   I mean, that's, that's, um, we're just a bunch of neckbeards.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.760]   And we haven't do shaved today.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.760]   Okay.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.600]   That's a new one on me.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.800]   That's a good one.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.720]   See, every other day of the week, I look like a complete troll and I don't say anything
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.240]   more than two words.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:53.080]   I just transformed into, you know, the twig princess on Wednesday, just for you guys.
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:59.200]   Oh, so rotten tomatoes, this is the chat room just sent me this link to rotten tomatoes.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:04.360]   It's only seven reviews so far, 100% on the tomato meter.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:08.000]   Only the Godfather and citizen Kane come close.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.800]   Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to suspicious.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:12.800]   We'll see.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:18.520]   Hey, sir, Aaron Sorkin, David Fincher.
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.160]   I got to, I have a trailer.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:24.640]   We'll end up with a, we'll end with a, with a new, the new clip that just came out.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:28.120]   Actually saw Trent Reznor's site because Trent Reznor did the music for this.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:32.400]   Oh, man, I got trouble for I listened to the music from Trent Reznor.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.520]   Well, we'll check.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.520]   No doom.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.560]   Well, that's, that's a trend.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.560]   That's a trend.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:43.400]   Trent did the, uh, Trent did the music for a quake or was it doom?
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.200]   No doom, I think.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:49.440]   So nine, maybe doom was like fake nine inch nails.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.440]   I can't remember.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:51.760]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:55.900]   Hey, let's do our tool tip and number of the weekend that we will move on because it is
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.960]   getting late starting with Gina Trapani.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.480]   You've already done a tip, but do you want to do another one?
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.480]   Yeah, sure.
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.600]   I've got this is a, this is pretty cool.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:08.280]   This is actually more of a tool, um, for my inbox zero folks, fellows and ladies and
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:12.640]   arms, uh, the number zero boxer.com zero boxer.com.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.800]   It's pretty cool.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.320]   It's a chrome and fire Fox extension.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:20.120]   You install it and it gives you point and you earn badges for the way that you deal
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.120]   with your email.
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.320]   So every time you archive an email, you get, you get a point.
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.080]   If you do send email, send email.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.080]   Make it your game.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.440]   So it adds this game mechanic to processing your inbox.
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.040]   And then, you know, if your friends are using it, you can see how they're doing.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:35.640]   They're just leaderboard and I just installed it and it's really kind of fun.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:38.960]   It makes archiving email and emptying your inbox like really satisfying.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.800]   Uh, it's easy to do.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:41.800]   Use is OAuth.
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:42.800]   That's fantastic.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:43.800]   Yeah.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.800]   Yeah.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:45.800]   So you can see it's kind of across the top.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.440]   So when you hit that wide archive an email, you get a point.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.440]   Very, very satisfying.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.040]   Oh, I can't wait.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.560]   Does it put the points on your, on your Gmail account?
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:54.560]   I mean, do you see it?
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.560]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.240]   You see it across the top of your Gmail account.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.240]   So, uh, yeah.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.960]   There's a Chrome, I see a Chrome or Safari extension.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:00.960]   Cool.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:01.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:02.960]   Right.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.880]   And then you install the, you install the extension and it's just, it's just kind of fun.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:08.560]   So it's a little extra motivation to empty out that inbox.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.560]   So I just installed it.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:12.800]   I've only got a few points, but, uh, but I'm going to, I'm going to keep doing it.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.800]   It is on.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:18.560]   I've always thought that would feel about like dealing with the inbox is kind of like
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:21.280]   a game of Tetris, uh, you know, it's just like they keep coming in.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.280]   You have to clear them away.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.120]   You know, fast when they come in.
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:28.240]   And this kind of gives you that same, that same kind of exciting game mechanic in your
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.240]   email process.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.240]   I love this.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.720]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.240]   And thanks to life hacker for that tip.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.240]   Zero bot.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.240]   Oh yeah.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.240]   There it is.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.240]   So put a little strip up at the top of my, uh, yeah.
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.240]   So I've got zero points, zero cleared, zero written.
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.240]   Oh good.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.800]   So if you select a couple of emails, you'll get points.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:43.800]   All right.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.400]   So Gina, could that get leaked?
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.880]   I mean, it's because if somebody hacked that, you then tell someone, Gina doesn't think
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:50.880]   you're important.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:53.560]   This, you know, this is the thing.
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:57.280]   This is an interesting question because you use all off to say, is your boxer can have
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.600]   access to my, to my email?
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:04.000]   And with that always comes the, you know, from I paused and it's like, is your box reading
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   all my email?
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.440]   Are they just detecting when I archive and send?
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.400]   I think they're just detecting when I archive and send.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.280]   I don't believe that they're, I don't think there's no reason why they should be able to
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.520]   detect labels and all that.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:18.040]   But hopefully no one will, will hack zero boxer and see that, but I don't think they're
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.040]   important.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.360]   Nothing happens when you mark an email is not important.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:24.160]   I love that they got badges just like four square.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.720]   So it's kind of a new service.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:28.720]   It's kind of beta.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:32.160]   They kind of say straight out, you know, there are some bugs help us out, but it's been,
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.040]   it's been kind of fun so far.
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:38.960]   But you know, it's like typical, there's somebody already with 79, 76,000 points.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.960]   Of course.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.640]   Probably the developer, right?
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.840]   We know when we, I think it was the show we had Chris Dibona on and Chris said, hey,
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:50.040]   you know, what, what, how many messages did you have in your all mail?
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:53.160]   And we had that discussion while I had people on Twitter later saying, well, I've got more
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:57.440]   meat mail than Gina has, you know, it really, the geeks definitely do have this, you know,
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.800]   sense of competition about their email inboxes.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.320]   I think this is a brilliant idea.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.320]   It's totally brilliant.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.320]   I love it.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:07.440]   It is zero boxer dot com.
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.600]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:11.200]   Our number of the week for Mr. Jeff Jarvis and Amsterdam.
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:18.720]   Thank goodness for the Pew internet and American life project that came in at press time here,
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:24.160]   telling us that 35% of US adults have software apps on their phones.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:29.560]   Yet, only 24% of adults use those apps.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:36.160]   And 11% of cell phone users are not sure whether their phones have apps.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:43.120]   13 cell phone users, 29% have downloaded apps, their phones, and 13% have paid for them.
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:47.200]   So this is the argument about how much has the apps culture taken over life?
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:52.120]   I think it's a little bit overblown in the idea that this is just one thing we do and
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:57.720]   you have fine, I download an app once and I, you know, I still want stats on the unused
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.880]   portion of life.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:16:59.880]   Right?
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:05.520]   How many is, how many apps are not updated on their end on the supply?
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.520]   Right.
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:10.440]   And how many apps have I downloaded that I have never used or haven't used in end months?
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:13.120]   I don't want to know that.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.920]   How many tweets go on red?
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:16.920]   Oh, God.
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:19.120]   That's the big stack to be.
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:22.480]   That's the huge, huge number.
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.520]   And you know, I guess you can say the same thing about the same calculation.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:27.760]   We blog posts aren't read by most people on the earth.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:28.760]   That's fine.
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:34.400]   But you supposedly subscribe to or follow tweets and I go through, I haven't done it.
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:39.840]   If I go to my, I've been gone all day, going to Sonas and Amsterdam, which are very nice,
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:42.280]   by the way.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:48.080]   And you know, I'm going to end up with, with, I can end up with 3000 tweets in my feed that
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.080]   I just then ignore.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:53.000]   Do you think it's possible that there is a, there are unread tweets in the world that
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.800]   like nobody that a tweet fell in the forest?
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:01.040]   I guess so, especially if you have 20 followers and you, and, and they don't, they're not
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.040]   good at reading.
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.040]   Absolutely.
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.040]   Sure.
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.040]   This is our new platform.
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.040]   I don't stand here.
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.040]   When I run for geek president, no tweet left behind.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.040]   No tweet left on red.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:16.680]   Look at how depressed we all are at the thought of one of our tweets not getting read.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.680]   Like we're such broadcasters.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:21.400]   Like, oh, I can't have my reason for existence.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.600]   We're just so hard.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.600]   Hey, I got a, I got a number for you.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:34.280]   Zynga, the folks who do farmville and all those mafia wars and all those others speaking
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:38.720]   in Oracle's open world, they're, their CTO offered some interesting stats.
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:45.460]   Zynga moves one petabyte, petabyte of data every day.
[01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:46.460]   What?
[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.160]   Every day.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:52.520]   They add 1000 new servers every week.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.040]   What the hell?
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.520]   What the hell is right?
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:02.520]   So, so you go back to Clay Shirkies, cognitive surplus clay.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.400]   Sorry, they're not using it to make Wikipedia.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.320]   Is there doing it to feed fake cows?
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.600]   It was Gilligan's Island.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.400]   Now it's farmville.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.400]   Oh, man.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.400]   Oh boy.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.480]   A petabyte a day.
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.480]   That's an unimaginable amount of traffic.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:19.880]   That's not used to, I used to cover conferences in San Francisco.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.920]   My favorite one to go to was the gift show because the only thing that required in that
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:27.960]   show was that absolutely everything on that floor was useless.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:31.360]   Utterly completely useless.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:32.360]   Wow.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.360]   And that's what the thing is.
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:35.360]   That's what farmville is.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:38.360]   There is no socially redeeming value whatsoever.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:43.180]   But it's fascinating when you think like when when a human is given a like very clear cut
[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:45.360]   out task, even if it's completely virtual.
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:46.360]   I will do it.
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:49.440]   That's more attractive to do than like do crap in life.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:52.080]   Because life is just messy and sloppy and not as well defined.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.680]   Yeah, like from a productivity standpoint, it's really fascinating.
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:55.680]   So it geeks like it.
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.680]   It's neat.
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:57.680]   It's tidy.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:58.680]   It's like cleaning up your desktop.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:19:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:03.120]   It's what it's why I think Windows sold so well for so many years because it gave you
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:07.120]   some things you could tweak and stuff and it gave you stuff to do on your computer.
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:11.520]   And I'm sure it's probably why Android will do well too.
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:16.520]   Our product or tool of the week and I know you you noticed this is well Gina.
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.440]   Google has announced Google new.
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:22.040]   So this is the who knew it's Google.com/new.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:25.480]   Products you go there and you will see all the new things from Google.
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:30.680]   In fact, there are so many new things from Google that you can select by product to make
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:31.680]   it easier to find.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:35.320]   I wonder if there's anything new in or could lately.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.600]   Why yes, there is.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:42.080]   Why yes, as a matter of fact.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:46.200]   So if you want to keep up with the Google verse, you can do what we'll be doing every
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:54.120]   week from now on visiting Google new at Google.com/newproducts and now let's end, shall we?
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:21:00.800]   With another little clip, this is from Trent Reznor's site, newlico.com.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:05.200]   Another trailer from the social network, which is coming soon.
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.920]   Gina Trapani is the blogger at smarterwear.org.
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:08.920]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:09.920]   Thanks for having me.
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:10.920]   Great show today.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:14.000]   Her work smart series is on in a fast company, fast company.com/worksmart.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   Yep.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.800]   And she should be here next week if the cupcakes don't kill her.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.200]   In sugar shock.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:22.200]   Sugar shock.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.520]   Jeff Jarvis is an Amsterdam.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.520]   He's the author of What Would Google Do?
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:29.840]   A fine book available on better bookstores everywhere.
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:33.000]   And of course, he blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.200]   Thanks, gentlemen and ladies, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:42.040]   And we will see you next time on This Week in Google and now.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:43.040]   Social network.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.040]   Is that a question?
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:48.960]   In the 16th email, you raised concerns about the site's functionality.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:51.040]   Were you leading them on for six weeks?
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.040]   No.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.800]   Then why didn't you raise any of these concerns before?
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:55.800]   It's raining.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.800]   I'm sorry?
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.800]   It just started raining.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:58.800]   Squirrels.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.040]   Mr. Zuckerberg, who I have your full attention.
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.040]   No.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.840]   Do you think I deserve it?
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:06.840]   What?
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:10.280]   Do you think I deserve your full attention?
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:13.000]   I had to swear on oath before we began this deposition and I don't want to purchase
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   your detergent myself.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.800]   So I have a legal obligation to say no.
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:16.800]   Okay.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.800]   No.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.480]   You don't think I deserve your attention?
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:22.800]   I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall, they have
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.800]   a right to give it a try.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:28.320]   But there's no requirement that I enjoy sitting here listening to people lie.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:29.480]   You have part of my attention.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.560]   You have the minimum amount.
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:35.280]   The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook where my colleagues and I are doing
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:38.720]   things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intellectually
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.720]   or creatively capable of doing.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:44.200]   And I had to put my hands in your condescending question.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:51.200]   [music]
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.780]   (upbeat music)
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:55.780]   [Music playing]
