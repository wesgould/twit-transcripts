[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Coming up on this week in Google, it's me, Jason Howell, filling in for Leo Le Porte, also Jeff Jarvis, Stacey Higginbotham and Ant Pruitt.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.000]   And we have a lot to talk about. A lot of it Google related and pixel related.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.600]   We've got a pixel hardware event coming up next month.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.200]   We've got a satellite phone connectivity coming to Android Android 14 anyway, so you're gonna have to wait a little bit for that.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.800]   We've got an edit feature coming to Twitter and some details as far as how that works.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.000]   The EU actually wants to regulate phone updates.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.200]   How do you feel about that? And we take a trip into my air condition, the garage.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.800]   Come check it out. This week in Google is next.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800]   [Music]
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.200]   Podcasts you love.

[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.800]   This is Twig.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.800]   [Music]
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.800]   This is Twig. This week in Google, episode 680 recorded Wednesday, September 7th, 2022.

[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:13.200]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, I am filling in for Leo. My name is Jason Howell. Leo is in the area, but he's on his way to a hair metal concert.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   Just let that sink in a little bit.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   I think it's awesome.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   Leopard.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.200]   I think it's awesome that that's actually a true statement.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.200]   Yes.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   Death Leopard, Poison, Joan Jett, and I'm missing one.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   What's that?
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   Motorhead?
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   Is that right?
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   I was like, wait a minute.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   It's Alica?
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   I had no idea.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   No, it's not a truly.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   There we go.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   It was an M hairband of some sort.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   Girls, girls, girls.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   Yes.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   Motley Crew with the Oomlots.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.200]   That is Stacy Higamotham joining us today.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.200]   It's good to see you.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   Stacy, welcome back.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   Hello, y'all.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   Hello.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   Any of those bands are your favorites back in the day or even currently?
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   Last week I said that I did see Death Leopard when I was pregnant and I fell asleep.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   Oh, that's right.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   That's right.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   We were like the second row.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   I'm like.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   Understandably so though.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   I think anyone would understand that.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   Still, you've seen Death Leopard and I never have, even if you only seen a couple of songs.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   So I'm slightly jealous.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   They did a good show until I fell asleep.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   It continued to be good.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   It kept you asleep.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   Also joining us, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   Jeff, any of those bands kind of wake you up?
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   Does Jody Mitchell play it any of them?
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   Not that I'm aware of.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   Joan Jett, though, is about as close as you get to Jody Mitchell.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   So Stacy, did you snore?
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   Probably.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   I was pregnant.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   Prick that women do all kinds of disgusting things.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   And I snore today.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.200]   So probably yes.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   Probably so.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   And the snoring was no louder than anything else happening in that concert.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   That's the beauty of it.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   Yeah, that's the beauty of it.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   Also joining us and Pruitt.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   What's up, and not much, sir.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   If you had to pick one of those bands to see live tonight, which one would it be?
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   Or would it be none of the above?
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   I was going to say, can I punch or pick a different coin?
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   I have no idea, sir.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.200]   I think I'll pass.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   I'll just sit outside and people watch.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   That's what I would do.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.200]   I have a feeling that is a really great people watching show.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   I sit outside with the camera and get some pretty interesting photos, I'm sure.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   No kidding.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.200]   You probably get some interesting photos with the camera inside the show as well.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   If you were sitting there.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.200]   Let me get in the pit.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   Right.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   Don't take your gear there.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   I think they're actually.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   I don't think there's a pit.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.200]   Yeah, it probably isn't.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   You're probably right.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.200]   Not this show.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   It's probably not at this day at age.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   I mean, there are still pits, but I don't know that there will be a pit at this show.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   Well, technically there's usually still a photo pit.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   That's different than a mosh pit.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   You're right.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.200]   Right.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   I was thinking of a mosh pit.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   So was I.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   Oh, no.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.200]   I won't know part of it.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.200]   I'd hurt somebody.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   That is very responsible of you, Ant.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   That's responsible mosh etiquette.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.200]   Actually, some people would want you to hurt them.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.200]   That's just the way the mosh pit works.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.200]   I do think that they're sitting in the front row or they're very close to the stage.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   Is that right?
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   I think I really released a saying that.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   It could be interesting some of the stories that we hear from that show.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.440]   I'm sure Leo will talk about it next week on this week in Google.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.280]   But this week, I don't know if you heard, but there's some big hardware announcement
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   news today.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.280]   Do you hear?
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.280]   Apple.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.280]   Is that what you're talking about?
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.280]   Apple?
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.280]   Who's Apple?
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.280]   I'm not talking about Apple.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.280]   What are you talking about?
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.680]   I'm talking about Google.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.200]   Why would you think I'm talking about?
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   You don't care about gigantic kitty watches.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.200]   You don't know that.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   Yeah, that watch does look like a beast.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   What is it?
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   The Apple Watch, what do they call it?
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   It's not the Apple Watch Pro.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   One good thing.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.200]   There is something other.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   The Ultra, that's what it is.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.200]   They're taking a page out of Samsung's book and throwing an Ultra on the end of it.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.200]   Samsung always has their own device.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   We can't know.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   Everyone has to pick their own naming.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.200]   So, then we can figure out Apple when we're guessing, is it the Apple Watch 8?
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   If they add an Ultra to it, then I'm going to be a Galaxy Ultra 7BQ?
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   Right.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.080]   Why not the Apple Watch Mega?
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.200]   Like the Mega Watch?
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   The Mondo.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   The Mondo.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.320]   Yeah, none of them have done Mondo yet.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.040]   That's a good one right there.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.040]   Of course.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.960]   I like that.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.880]   I know this chunky watch on your wrist.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.800]   I think Mondo is quite appropriate.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.960]   I think you should just go with Apple Watch Chunk.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.960]   Chunk.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   Chunk edition.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.960]   Sign me up.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   I'd get it even though it doesn't work with my head.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.960]   You know, it's the kind of thing.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.960]   If Google did that, they have no taste.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.960]   They have no class.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.960]   They have no style.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.960]   Google.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.160]   Apple does it and it's rediscovery and huge.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.160]   It's fresh.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.160]   Yes.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   It's like, oh, that's a perfect.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.400]   You can do absolute unit.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.040]   So Apple Watch Absolute Unit.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.000]   There you go.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.320]   That'd be for the little--
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.320]   That sounds like Elon Musk Child's name.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.320]   That's how Gen Z talks.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.880]   Yes.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.520]   That is good.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.520]   Love it.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.600]   Of course, we aren't going to talk in detail and depth about Apple's hardware announcement.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.000]   That wasn't even the hardware announcement that I was talking about.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Of course not.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.920]   And what I was referring to is the fact that Google, on the day before Apple's hardware
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.320]   announcement, announced its own hardware event.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.840]   Yes, we have to wait until October 6 for that to happen.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:14.600]   But still, we knew it existed before Apple's event actually happened.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.600]   So I don't know.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   They score like two and a half points.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.600]   Some hell.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.800]   It's a day after the show.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.800]   Oh.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   Thursday.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   Yes.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.320]   So this is Thursday, October 6.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.320]   It's the day after the show.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.680]   So that means the event will happen.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:35.160]   And then you all will have six days to prepare your arguments for or against.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.160]   And you five.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.160]   Any of the hardware that is shown off at the event.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.560]   And actually, Google is being pretty forthcoming.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.120]   I mean, we kind of already knew what we're going to see at this hardware event.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:53.760]   The Pixel 7, the Pixel 7 Pro, the Pixel Watch.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.680]   All three of those devices we've seen already because Google did the thing where at Google
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.680]   I/O--
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.680]   They need a surprise.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.560]   They need a surprise like, oh, I don't know, a new Pixel book.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   What do you think?
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.560]   Oh.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.560]   That would be surprise.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560]   Who wants my--
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.560]   Who wants my?
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.560]   That would be a surprise.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.360]   But you know what, Jeff?
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.840]   I think you're onto something.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.600]   They do need a surprise.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.000]   Because I was watching part of the Apple event today.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.800]   And what did they call that bar and the pro that expands, that had a catching name for
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   it?
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.800]   And I think John might know.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   The dynamic island.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   Something dynamic island.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.720]   Something dynamic island.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.480]   So basically what Apple did is, you know, in the top where there is like a cutout for
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.520]   the cameras, Apple essentially said, all right, many people see this as a limitation.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.520]   It's a cutout.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:54.400]   It's going to turn it into a new UI kind of paradigm for receiving notifications and
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.320]   information from apps.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.400]   And so that little pill expands out and information appears there.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.760]   It becomes this like living organism within the UI.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.760]   And that was something that I don't know that we knew of ahead of the event and what it
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:13.360]   made me realize is that like we go into these Google events, we know flip and everything
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.880]   about these phones by the time it happens.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:22.000]   Apple somehow is able to hold on to some key pieces of information.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.440]   Some of it gets leaked out, but some of it they hold on to for that true moment of surprise.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.280]   And that's what really lacks from Google's hardware events.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:35.440]   And I wish I could continue to sing this song that I've sung for the last three years here.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.720]   Google knows what they're doing.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.720]   These leaks are not leaks, man.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.080]   They're giving that information out to somebody somewhere and then claiming it's a so called
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.080]   leak.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.720]   This is happening way too often.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.280]   Because if it was a really.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.040]   It's just harder to go ahead and stay safe.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:59.400]   No, no, I was just I think it's harder to terrify your partners when you're Google.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.040]   And so these things do come out because people want to talk about them.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.200]   I don't know if Google like I just don't think Google cares as much about leaks.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.200]   Where is Apple?
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.200]   Okay.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.680]   I feel like you're dragged to a basement somewhere and like.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.040]   But then also to.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.680]   But from a hardware standpoint, Apple has way more.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.680]   What is it?
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.960]   Cash, or whatever versus Google?
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.360]   So it seems like it only makes sense for Google to put as much information out as they
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:35.000]   possibly can to get some type of interest in it because the average John or Jill on
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.320]   the street are more than likely looking for the next Samsung device versus the next Google
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.360]   device, let alone thinking about Apple devices out there, right?
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:50.120]   Do you think the average John if you're an Android buyer, you're either a super passionate
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.600]   Android buyer or you're buying a phone just because you can't afford or don't want for
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.040]   whatever reason to go Apple.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.040]   Yeah, right.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.040]   Might take on that.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.800]   So I don't know if you didn't care.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.560]   Oh, it's a religion.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.080]   Well, that's you're either in the religion.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.680]   Or just it's it's a phone that you can.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.760]   Your cheap.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   I swear I see more religious leaning towards the Samsung side of things though versus the
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.400]   Google side of things.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.120]   A lot more a lot more Android energy from the everyday.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.360]   Consumer going towards Samsung than going for Google.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.240]   I mean, Samsung's also been doing this a lot longer than Google.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.240]   Oh, yes.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.040]   But but I do see more.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.040]   Real chain.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.040]   They better hardware.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.280]   There is somebody said it.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.280]   No.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.080]   I mean, I think you're right.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.880]   They've they've they've spent a lot of time refining how they create their phones, which
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.280]   is not to say that Google puts out bad hardware.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   It's just Samsung.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.440]   Yeah, they're just they're just sharper on this stuff.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:03.200]   I prefer the design language that Google does with the pixels more and I prefer the
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:09.240]   UI and the kind of the pixel UI approach that Google does.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:14.600]   But I can also admit that Samsung is at the top of the Android food chain for a reason.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.400]   You know, I have family.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.200]   I have friends who have Samsung devices and they don't even think of checking out another
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   phone.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.800]   It's just because they're so used to the Samsung thing and they hold on to their phones for
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   a really long time.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   It's kind of allow you to do that if you're buying of a certain level, a certain tier
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.520]   of of Samsung phones.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.280]   How is the level of I I have a touch one and ages.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.000]   How is the level of Samsung software junk on top it?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.720]   I mean, that has definitely changed over the years.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.400]   There's you know, I guess it depends on what you define as junk.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:53.800]   I feel like it used to be that you got a Samsung phone and you got all sorts of other apps,
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.120]   be it from Samsung or not from Samsung.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:01.280]   All these like deals made, you know, behind the scenes, cluttering up the phone.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:07.000]   It really it felt like your your apps tray was just being impacted by all these decisions
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.160]   that were made for you.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.000]   And I think that that's lessened.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.760]   It's still there, but Samsung, I think more so has really leaned into the extras, features
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.880]   and services that they offer.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:25.400]   Samsung really wants to be an apple, you know, and and I think they do a decent job of doing
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.800]   of having that like they get ecosystem close, right?
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.600]   They're doing really well with that.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:38.160]   But I think, you know, more and more, I imagine Samsung has a picture of, you know, of apple
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.960]   or an iPhone hanging on their walls like inspiration of like someday.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.480]   Someday we'll be like you, you know, that's the spirit because you can see the effort they
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.320]   put into this stuff.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:58.360]   And again, I agree with you far as like the pixel experience with vanilla Android.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.720]   It seems like Samsung has started to clean that up a little bit more.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.600]   They have people that I know that are really passionate about Samsung and every time I've
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:12.280]   seen their phones, it's definitely not what it used to be in the days of your for certain
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.480]   fragmented Android.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.680]   And then the build quality of those phones or you pick them up their tanks.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.720]   Yeah, just the same word that came to my mind.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:27.040]   Yeah, Samsung has all the certain tier of a certain, you know, kind of category.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.040]   They're built like tanks.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.560]   Yeah, they're really well, well designed and well built.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.840]   Do you love all the features?
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.360]   Do you even use or need all the features?
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:41.800]   No, I mean, some Samsung, you know, dedicated people will get in there and use all of them.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.160]   But you know, that's also part of Samsung's playbook is like we throw a million different
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.160]   features in here.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.040]   You don't have to use them all, but you're going to find the handful of ones that really
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.480]   work for you.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.880]   And that used to feel used to feel on older Samsung phones like, Oh my God, stop it.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:02.480]   Like, stop trying to make me believe that you are amazing and smart because of all these
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.960]   things that you've done.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.760]   And they still kind of push that on you a little bit when you first set up a Samsung
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:13.040]   phone, but then you get past that and you kind of settle into your use of it.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.680]   And then you, you know, you're kind of settle into finding the things that actually do work
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.680]   for you.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.680]   Great.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:26.760]   I remember a time when it was like the thing to have all the cutesy stuff on phones and
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.080]   you know, all of the different bubbles popping up and all of the weird sound effects every
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.760]   time you tap something.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.800]   I wondered if that was something that the consumers really were digging for.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.520]   And I'm sorry that you hear singing going on in the background, but I don't know why
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.520]   that is.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.520]   Sandy Cheeks.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.280]   Sorry about that.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.680]   I should probably close my door.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.920]   I told you all this every day, go on day.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:51.920]   Oh, dad.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.920]   That's awesome.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.920]   I love it.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:59.600]   They're going to be funny girl on Broadway before you know it.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.600]   Oh, man.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.600]   Bring her in.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.600]   Bring her in.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.360]   She's got a captain body and right now rehearsals begin.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.360]   So amazing.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.520]   So sorry about that.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.960]   I will close my door.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.960]   I love it.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.960]   I love it.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.960]   That is so cool.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.760]   So let's see here.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.480]   So we got the seven, the some news about the seven Google actually confirmed that the
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:28.080]   next generation tensor chip, not surprising, but the next generation tensor chip is going
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.080]   to be on board.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.920]   We really don't know what that even means, just that it will be.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.200]   Stay there for a second.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.000]   Would you would you?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.120]   I was wondering today when Google V Apple and Google's has tensor and has all this,
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.960]   this, this processing going on on the phone to do things like, like translation and such.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.400]   Does Apple have any equivalents to that kind of a process?
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.440]   Yeah, they have their bionic services.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.360]   So compare the services.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.360]   Oh boy.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.800]   Well, yeah, I don't know that I have the answer to that because I'm relatively clueless on
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.800]   the apple side of things.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.800]   Do you know this?
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.400]   Well, I was going to say, I was going to say it's hard to do an apples tap.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   Okay.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   Apple's apples.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   You know, it's hard to benchmark home.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   It's hard to avoid that.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   It's hard to.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.400]   Sorry.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.400]   Because.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   Yeah, we're just, we're just comparison because both of us are going to be able to do
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.520]   both of them are now designing their own ships.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.160]   They're still using their both arm licenses.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:35.640]   But that's one of the, I don't know if it's a, it's that tight integration between the
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.080]   hardware and the software.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:43.320]   So, you know, Apple is doing on board device, like machine learning type stuff.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.280]   So they may not be doing it for real time translate or that's not an advertised feature.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.320]   Well, that's what I'm asking Stacy is.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.760]   So they're doing it for facial recognition.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.760]   Okay.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:00.920]   Where does Google have a strength in data in the data sets to enable the machine learning
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.640]   to happen on the phone?
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:09.240]   Where does Apple, if any, have any weakness there?
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.600]   It's not a weakness there.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:16.800]   Cause so what happens on your phone is actually there's two sides of machine learning.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.480]   There's the training of something.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.520]   Like, so training something to recognize words and speech.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.720]   And then there's the inference, which is running the noises my mouth makes against that particular
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:33.000]   algorithm and then eliciting the translation.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.280]   And so the hardest part from a chip perspective is training and that all happens right now
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.720]   in the cloud.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:47.480]   So any advantage that Apple has or Google has, it's kind of oblivion, that is not a word.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.480]   They don't have it.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:56.080]   They don't have that because they're both doing things in the cloud and then they stick that
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.080]   model.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.760]   So whenever speech to text model they have, they're going to run it locally on the phone.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:07.800]   So it's just running inference, which is still process intensive, but it's not like crazy,
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.960]   like GPU level compute.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:15.600]   So my hunches, they've tweaked their algorithms to work specifically with both of their chips.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:21.880]   So it doesn't, and everyone has access to like the training data for speech, right?
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:28.040]   So where you would look for advantages, I'm trying to think would be, I mean, even image
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:33.560]   recognition is just whatever training data you're using, Google has lost, but you can
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.320]   also buy access to it.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:40.040]   Apple probably has lots they can get it.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.120]   I feel like Google gets it because, and I don't even know how much of this is actually
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.480]   true anymore.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.600]   You know, Google got a lot of it by like picking it up from its users, whereas Apple didn't
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.600]   pull that.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.400]   So that's that's the actual data that they're going to create the original, they're going
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.080]   to do the training on originally in the cloud.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.160]   But Apple can just throw money at that problem too.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.640]   So in in Apple's got the margins to do it.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.520]   So maybe that's how they're doing it because their quality is not really suffering.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.520]   I don't think.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.400]   I mean, I know a series not as awesome, but it's definitely gotten better.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.400]   I don't.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.440]   Someone who's doing like speech to text on an iPhone, are you seeing changes?
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.240]   My husband does not seem unhappy.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.240]   And he has an iPhone.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.240]   He doesn't seem unhappy.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.840]   Yeah, we need the occasional Apple guest here to say, how is it over there?
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.840]   Right.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.800]   How you living over there?
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   Over there.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.200]   Like, that's a good idea.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.800]   In fact, I've booked Leo for the show for next week.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.360]   So I saw Apple perspective next week.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.400]   Well, please just a producer.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.400]   Well, thank you.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.680]   You know, I try to stay on top of things around here.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:03.560]   But yeah, I mean, that's, you know, as far as the the AI compute, you know, all that
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.560]   kind of stuff.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:12.000]   Google is and has been pretty known and you know, has proven itself to be pretty solid
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.440]   as far as that stuff is concerned.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.280]   It's a good question.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:22.080]   Where does Apple stand by comparison used to kind of be a standout thing for Google and
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.360]   for Android devices to have that?
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.800]   Has that gap narrowed?
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:33.560]   You know, I still find myself, you know, for right or wrong, I find myself still locked
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.360]   in the, in the thinking that Google has a leg up there.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.560]   But maybe, maybe that gap has really narrowed a lot.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.960]   Either that or maybe people don't.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.440]   They don't care as much about it.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.960]   Because I mean, Apple, I think is doing all right, you know, by comparison.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.600]   But they aren't.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.880]   I mean, you can't do speech to tech.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.560]   I mean, real time translate on Google devices is pretty awesome.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   It is.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.400]   Not that most people need it, which is unfortunate.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.680]   But like, I don't, I don't think Apple, I mean, someone in the comments just be like,
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.480]   Stacy, you and your blinker to Android worldview.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.360]   But I don't think Apple has anything like that.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.360]   Right.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.360]   It's been a priority.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:17.240]   Well, yeah, is live translation from one language to another?
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.160]   I'm not saying it's not an important feature.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.920]   It's very important for the people who really need it.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.840]   It's game changing.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.960]   But really the majority of people probably don't have opportunities in their daily life
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.360]   to use something like that.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:36.480]   So while it's a really great kind of example of Google's prowess in this, in this aspect
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.320]   of what they do, it's, you know, that's neat.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.360]   I just, I have no use for that unless I go traveling somewhere, maybe, you know,
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:50.000]   would you rather have privacy or real time translation for like a week?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.680]   Oh, well, well, right.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.000]   As a second Stacy, that goes off course.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.920]   No, apples going into the ad business.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.000]   All that they used to talk about.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   That's going away.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Hmm.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.600]   Apple's going to, Apple's something going to change his mind about privacy.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.600]   I, I, I bet.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.120]   I'd be curious to see.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.120]   Hey, more Jeff.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.440]   I mean, I'm, I feel like your cynicism is like totally founded.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.440]   Is that even?
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.400]   Yeah, well, because they're going in the, I mean, the whole background of Apple and privacy
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.840]   was Apple failed the ad business and so they turned a failure into a feature.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.040]   Oh, that's not an answer.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.040]   Failure into a feature.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.280]   Well, I like that.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.400]   And, and so, oh, we're the privacy company, which really meant we don't know anything about
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.400]   advertising.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.400]   We failed at it.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   We don't really care.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.400]   Use the data in any way so far.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.960]   You're better off with us.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.680]   And now they are way going into the ad business, which means they are way going to need data.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.440]   No two ways about it.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:50.080]   And so I think that if we compare Apple statements of two years ago to two years hence, we're
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.320]   going to find a little hypocrisy.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.320]   Help that.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.040]   Just, just wager it.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.040]   Dave leans so easily.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.040]   Oh, are you basing this?
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.040]   Sorry.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.040]   Oh, sorry.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.280]   Oh, I was going to say, are you basing this on the reports of them doubling their digital
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.280]   advertising business?
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.480]   They were forced and all of them.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.480]   Okay.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.480]   Right.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.480]   Right.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.480]   They're going into it.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.320]   And, you know, it's everybody's in the ad business, right?
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.720]   Amazon is, is, Amazon's ad business is now bigger than the entire magazine industry.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.000]   Best buys, floors are advertising.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.160]   Instacart is advertising.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.920]   Everybody's in the ad business now.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.920]   But all is in.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.920]   Yes.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:34.160]   But, interestingly, primarily to others as ancillary revenue, it's, it's Google's primary support,
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.160]   obviously.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.160]   Right.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.920]   In the case of Apple, it's, it's a big, he, he being a gravy on the meatloaf and same
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   for Amazon.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:46.400]   A real big ladle of, on, I, where you used to work at Ponderosa Steakhouse, by the way.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.080]   One of the things we were trained to do was you take out the cheap Australian beef, I'll
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.600]   write off the grill and you, you, next you're supposed to ask someone if they weren't the
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.720]   mushroom sauce, mushroom gravy, which is just awful.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.680]   And you ladle it up and have it right there ready to pour on.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.440]   Would you like some mushroom sauce?
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.440]   There you go.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.440]   Always this right.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.440]   Hide that bad meat.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.440]   Exactly.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.440]   So, okay.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:20.560]   Well, I, I, this is helpful to me because I'm not 100% aware, but Apple's advertising stuff
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.440]   is already in their apps.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.240]   Their news and stock apps have advertising.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.000]   They have it in the app store.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.920]   And I think this news report that, that you're referring to.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:36.760]   Well, no, this, someone linked in chat to an article, Apple growing its own ad businesses
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.760]   privacy.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.760]   There's a few people.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.760]   Right.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.760]   Those, but that's from 2021.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.760]   That's from April 2021.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.000]   So I don't know if there's newer, you know, that was focused specifically on the app store.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.240]   This is from Bloomberg in August.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.920]   So about a month ago.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.360]   And then they advertise on Apple TV.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.880]   So, in August, right.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.760]   What they're saying is showing ads on your iPhone, said Bloomberg.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:10.680]   And they're saying paid, sir, you're going to get ads inside your iOS paid service.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.640]   So it's, it is a switch.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.040]   It's, it's, it's a double edged sword that Apple can wield.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.120]   On the one hand, they hurt everybody else's ad business, particularly Facebook meta.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.120]   And on the other hand, you know, like you can't, you can't do any of this data stuff
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.120]   because we're Apple, we're pure.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.880]   And on the other hand, Apple has all this first party data.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.000]   It's going to become a world of first party data.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.960]   That's all they're advertising looks like it's advertising.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.360]   It's letting developers pay to advertise their stuff on the platform.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.680]   So it doesn't look like it's looking.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.320]   It's, I mean, it's search term data.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:51.400]   So it's like, Hey, if I'm looking for a car game, let's, let's show, you know, I can
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.360]   pay to have, you know, my game higher up.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.640]   So it feels more like Amazon's ad business than something like Google, which is now bigger
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.000]   than the magazine industry.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.920]   So at their scale, there's a lot you can do there.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:11.640]   And I think when you get to, you know, and this is, I put a thread in, which I hope we
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.560]   can get to later, um, about, because I've been trying to get my head around the streaming
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:21.000]   business and not what a mess it seems to us as consumers, like always bloody things you
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   can subscribe to for one thing you want.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.080]   It's like, it's like the monster, Mando album you don't want to have, you just want the
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.600]   single.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.000]   And that's the mess we're in now.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.160]   And the point of this, this thread is how we're heading back to an economy like the old
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:43.200]   studio system where before there was antitrust action, the movie studio owned the theater
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.840]   and ripped off everybody else trying to get onto it.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.840]   All right.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:51.560]   So consider what else is going to be on your phone than just an app.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:57.280]   If we, if we consider the death of broadcast, NBC is rumor has it going to give up the 10
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.520]   o'clock hour.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.960]   Primetime is meaningless.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.480]   Um, uh, cable is cord cutting all over.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:08.240]   So if it is finally the day of streaming and it's not just your phone, but it's also your
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.240]   Apple TV.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.160]   It's also your Apple, you know, your laptop.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.480]   It's also your, your, your tablet.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.720]   It's everything else.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:19.480]   It could be that the entirety of the entertainment industry is going to have to advertise on
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.000]   Apple to get your attention.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Just just one example.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Hmm.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Interesting.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Let's stop the conversation.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   You're just blowing our minds.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   No, I'm trying to be.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   B's.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   B's.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:39.320]   Uh, you know, it's all this Apple talk.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.320]   It just takes it out of me.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   I know it does.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.320]   It does take you.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.320]   I know.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.320]   I agree.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.320]   Vivlavita Google people.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:50.960]   Uh, I just, I guess where I come back with, with, with the whole Apple thing.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:58.200]   It's Apple has leaned so heavily and so deeply into this privacy, everything thing that if
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:05.280]   they suddenly change course, that's going to be really noticeable by hardcore users of
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.640]   the, but they're going to, but they're going to love it still there because they're Apple
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.640]   fanboys.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.640]   Some, some, how do we do it?
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.640]   This is wonderful.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.640]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.120]   Here's my days of technicals that.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.120]   Yeah, I suppose.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.120]   I mean, there's, there are those people.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.120]   I mean, but not everybody.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:25.520]   Still, some people, they, some people have just absorbed, oh, Apple cares about my privacy.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.440]   And if you ask them, they're like, wow.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.400]   And they'll be like, well, you know, it just doesn't take my data like Google does.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:40.480]   And I'm like, no, I mean, he does, but they don't know that Apple's like killing pixels,
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.800]   you know, or actually opens all the pixels on, you know, they don't actually know the
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.800]   nuts and bolts.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.800]   You're right.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.800]   You're right.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.400]   It's true because I mean, it's just, yeah.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.400]   Mm hmm.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.400]   Yep.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.400]   Yep.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.400]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:02.400]   Most people, they hear the privacy first message and that's kind of all they need to
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.400]   know.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.320]   It's like, well, they're doing these things and they are privacy focused and Android definitely
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:11.040]   isn't, you know, their opinion.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.200]   Do they actually really understand the nuts and bolts?
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   What's going on underneath?
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.200]   Maybe they do a little bit.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.200]   They're on to?
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.200]   No.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.200]   No, are they going to?
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.000]   Apple got its Apple got that reputation very fairly.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.400]   I mean, they really did.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:31.320]   But also, you know, it'll take a while for that to for that message where all the media
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.080]   is like, oh, no, they don't care.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:37.520]   That'll take a while to filter back out to the people who, you know, don't care about
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:42.320]   that because, you know, I don't know about y'all, but my friends do not spend a lot of
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.080]   time talking about like pixel tracking and cookies versus block or no.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:51.000]   No, this is super various born, true data trading.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Where do you have Stacy?
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   You need new friends.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.360]   They're on the island.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.200]   I really do.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.760]   You need to give your friends a questionnaire and if they fail on all these topics.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.720]   Sorry, we can't vote on this anymore.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:09.080]   You got an F of my friendship paper.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.840]   I should also mention that this event, because that was what we were talking about, will
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.480]   not just be set the Pixel 7 and the 7 Pro and the watch, but apparently we're going
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.280]   to get some new Nest products as well.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.960]   This is information that we're going to have.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.920]   I wonder if it's the, you know, they had the Wi-Fi stuff, the Wi-Fi 6C routers that went
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.320]   through the FCC a couple weeks ago.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.320]   Okay.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:35.840]   I'm assuming it's that because they just did a camera refresh like a year ago.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.560]   They did the Nest thermostat.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.280]   Didn't they do a refresh like two years ago?
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:48.320]   The cameras seem to be like a three to five year, three year, sorry, refresh cycle.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.920]   So I'm kind of like, I don't know.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.920]   That's my thought.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.560]   It's got to be the routers.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.960]   The routers.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:02.440]   There's also been kind of rumors bouncing around about a smaller, cheaper Chromecast, not that
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:09.040]   Chromecast wasn't already pretty inexpensive, but this one would just stream in HD, not
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.880]   4K.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.880]   And I don't know.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.920]   I think the rumors I was seeing was like 25 bucks or something pretty inexpensive.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.920]   No Stadia talks.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:21.400]   So Mr. Howell, I haven't had anything about any Stadia hardware, nothing.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.240]   I wonder why.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.240]   Strange.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.720]   You say with a slight grin.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.720]   Cool.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:32.680]   That is definitely offending two to three percent of the people watching or listening
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.680]   to this show.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.680]   Two to three.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.680]   I don't know.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   Is that high?
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.680]   That's the first one.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.200]   Now we're offending them even more.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:44.560]   And this is how it goes when we talk about Stadia, no matter how we paint it.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:50.840]   We hear from that small percentage of people who really, really care a lot about Stadia.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.760]   Anyway, so I'm looking forward to the event.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.120]   We will certainly be doing live coverage of this.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.720]   This is of course a Thursday morning.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.840]   I think, well, I don't think I know later on that morning.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.400]   We have Tech News Weekly, the show I do with Micah.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:11.800]   So we'll certainly be talking about the information on T&W that later that morning early afternoon,
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.880]   but we'll be doing live coverage of the event that day as well.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:20.480]   So I guess keep posted for information as far as when that's going to happen.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.480]   Stay tuned.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.480]   Don't go anywhere.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.440]   Don't touch that dial.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.440]   Don't touch that dial.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.440]   Yes.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.120]   And speaking of don't touch that dial, let's take a break.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:36.560]   Thank the sponsor of this episode of This Week in Google and then get back to, you know,
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.040]   I have to say this rundown has a lot of Google in it.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:44.560]   It has some non Google stuff as well, but we've got some Google topics to talk about.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.560]   And I was also thinking like maybe in the third block after the second ad, it can just
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.560]   go full democracy.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.400]   It can be like, you know what?
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.240]   It's Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.760]   What do you all want to talk about?
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.520]   All this like I defer.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.320]   So you know, it can go wherever it needs to go.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.120]   How do you like that, Leo?
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.120]   All right.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.680]   But first, let's take a break and thank the sponsor.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.160]   This episode of This Week in Google is brought to you by Hover.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:14.640]   It's time to make plans and let Hover help you achieve them.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.080]   If you're a blogger, if you're creating a portfolio, maybe you're building an online
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:24.740]   store, maybe you just want to make a more memorable redirect to, you know, an important
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.680]   page like your LinkedIn page.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.920]   Well, Hover has the best domain names and email addresses just for you.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:38.040]   Email at your domain name is key to connecting with customers and also for building trust
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.040]   for your brand.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.440]   They have domain based emails for all of your needs, be it small or large.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.800]   It's really easy to set up.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.080]   You can add as many mailboxes to your domain as you need.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.920]   When your domain renews, your mailboxes will as well.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.380]   You've got excellent prices.
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:58.700]   Their most popular mailboxes and no-brainer solution for business owners and surprise
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:59.700]   is unbeatable.
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.660]   And you get access from anywhere.
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.660]   So you can use the email app you're already comfortable with.
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:10.820]   If apps aren't your thing, you can just use their web mail and then you can access it wherever
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:11.820]   you like.
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.420]   I love Hover.
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:18.180]   You know, I have a number of domains registered through Hover and I think the experience of
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.220]   buying through Hover is just so easy.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:25.080]   I'm so used to the streamlined approach, I never feel like I'm being like pummeled or
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.420]   upsold to.
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.720]   And Hover actually isn't there to upsell you on stuff you don't need anyways.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.180]   They just want to help.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:38.580]   So they have pro level tools, powerful domain and email management tools that actually are
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:42.740]   super intuitive, very easy to use, whether you're a web pro or just getting started.
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.100]   And that's kind of what I'm talking about.
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.940]   They make the whole service, the whole process really easy.
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:52.500]   It's also very private and secure with who is privacy protection included with your domain
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.500]   purchase.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.500]   Your private information will remain exactly that.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.380]   It's going to remain private.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:03.900]   It's a really good way to reduce spam and then also protect yourself from unwanted solicitations
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.500]   across the web.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:09.740]   And then Hover connects lets you pick the services that you want to use to build and
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.220]   host your website.
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:15.300]   Connect actually helps you start using your domain name with just a couple of clicks,
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.760]   making it super easy.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.620]   At Hover you're a customer, you're not a source of data.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:24.580]   So you can take back control of your data with a reliable tracker free email.
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:29.220]   Hover is trusted by hundreds of thousands of customers, myself included, who use their
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:33.780]   domain names and email to turn their ideas into a reality.
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:39.540]   So whether you're a developer, you're a photographer, small business, Hover has something for you
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.540]   to expand your projects and get the visibility you want.
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:49.000]   All you got to do is go to hover.com/twit, you're going to get 10% off your first purchase
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   of any domain extension for the entire first year when you go there.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.640]   That's hover.com/twit.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:00.920]   Make sure and go there, you'll get that 10% off your domain extension for a full year.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.920]   Hover is awesome.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.560]   If you haven't checked them out already, go do it now.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:12.740]   We thank Hover for their support of this week in Google.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:18.940]   I don't know if there's a whole lot here, but Sundar Pichai had a talk earlier this week
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.860]   at the Code Conference in LA.
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:26.900]   I guess this was just yesterday, so it was this week, but it was also just yesterday.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:32.700]   And a lot of what Sundar Pichai was talking about focused on competition, he actually
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.020]   called Google Pro Competitive.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.420]   We are Pro Competitive.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.700]   Pro Competition.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:47.620]   And use the opportunity to point out other companies doing similar things that they would
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:48.980]   see as competition, right?
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.020]   Microsoft, Apple, as ad competitors.
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:54.100]   Touchdown on what you were talking about a little bit ago, Jeff.
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:58.980]   TikTok is one example of cutting edge video competition.
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:08.260]   So Google's out there making it known if you thought there was no competition and that
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:12.420]   Google was running away with anything right now, regulators.
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:15.420]   No, that is not true.
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:20.180]   We've got a lot of competition that's making things difficult for us right now and keeping
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.180]   them nimble.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:25.540]   TikTok was one of those examples where he's like, "Hey, they're doing -- who saw TikTok
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:26.540]   come in?
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.540]   They're doing crazy things."
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:33.460]   Not social was locked up and locked into certain companies.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:40.020]   TikTok has proven that there is still room for others to innovate, to come up and ultimately
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.980]   disrupt the status quo.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.940]   And then yeah, talked a little bit about Google's acquisition of Fitbit.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.820]   He did mention that Fitbit features coming to the upcoming PixelWatch.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:57.220]   And of course, eagle-eyed viewers saw PixelWatch on his wrist.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.220]   Nice.
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:02.580]   So, you know, there was a little hidden PixelWatch, something to look forward to there.
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:03.580]   Looks nice.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.500]   It should be about 10 times bigger, I think.
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.100]   You want the PixelWatch to be larger than it looks like?
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.100]   No, I'm joking.
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.900]   I want it to be like Apple-Tress.
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.980]   Yeah, it's right.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.860]   I want the Pixel Blondo.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:21.020]   The Pixel Blondo, the Pixel Chonk, Chonk-R.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:24.060]   I want it to be as large as the Samsung one myself.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:28.300]   Mr. Howl, you have one of the recent ones from Samsung, right?
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.100]   Yeah, the Pixel G, sorry.
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.140]   I'm not a Pixel D. Samsung Watch.
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.740]   Yeah, I wish I had it in the first place.
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.940]   Ultra something, another five something, another.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:36.940]   Yes, exactly.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:37.940]   The Samsung Galaxy Watch.
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.140]   It has the name for...
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.700]   Is it the four of the five?
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:48.700]   I think it's the five.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.700]   Yeah.
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.700]   I think it's the five.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.700]   That's right.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:55.700]   You let me just try it out and put it on my wrist.
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.700]   I love that it was the perfect size.
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.700]   It wasn't too tiny like the Apple watches, in my opinion.
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:06.700]   I think it's not too big for everybody, but it's definitely big enough for people like
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.700]   you and I to have large hands.
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.700]   Hold on.
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.700]   Not too big for everybody.
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:11.700]   I could not.
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:14.420]   The Apple watches.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.900]   You are the exception.
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.820]   I'm a woman.
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:21.980]   I want to see Stacey be the hand model for the Chunk Watch just to get an idea.
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:25.940]   The Chunk Watch, I mean, I feel like the Chunk Watch is probably...
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:31.900]   I was at a meeting and there was this guy and his watch was like...
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:35.180]   It was the size of the bottom of this can.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.340]   It was bigger than his actual wrist.
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.340]   Show it off.
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:39.340]   Wow.
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:40.340]   Show it off.
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.340]   No, I don't want him to watch.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.340]   Oh, really?
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.340]   It was ridiculous.
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.340]   It was a what watch?
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.340]   I mean, it wasn't a...
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.740]   I think it was like a Samsung watch.
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.340]   It was a smart watch, but it was ginormous.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.340]   I don't know what it was.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.340]   Some of them are.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.860]   And I like the watches as jewelry myself.
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:01.500]   They got to look good first off, but having the smart center is just a bonus.
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:05.620]   And I think Samsung has been the only one that's really been able to get that right,
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:06.620]   in my opinion.
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:10.300]   The Apple watch is cool and it does a lot of fun things, but it still doesn't...
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.300]   It doesn't look like a watch to me.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:18.300]   It just looks like some more wearables, not necessarily jewelry to me.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.300]   Yeah, some of them are.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.300]   What if you got the Hermes...
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.660]   Oh, no, that was a leather strap.
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.740]   They have a fancy metal one, don't they?
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.660]   Yeah, and it's just a strap, though.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.380]   But I like the faces of the galaxy ones.
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:31.380]   Oh.
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.380]   And I always have.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.660]   I'm going back to the original ones.
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:38.100]   But this pixel one looks like it could be a nice piece of jewelry as well.
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:41.060]   It's just really clean and I like the round face on it.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:47.340]   Yeah, the round glass on the top, which on one hand looks really appealing to my eyes,
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:50.700]   but on the other hand, I'm like, "Wait a minute, it's really exposed.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:54.780]   You know, at least on some of these other watches, you've got a little bit of a ledge
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:43:00.260]   out there that protects that glass from being the first thing that touches any sort of surface
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:01.260]   that you...
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.220]   Well, is that what Mzimi will run into?
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:04.220]   Sorry.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.940]   What does that pretend for bezels?
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:12.660]   You know, I have heard and I haven't really actually looked into this, but I have heard
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:18.980]   that the bezels on this thing are thicker than people seem to like.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:19.980]   I've just seen some people.
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:20.980]   I can't believe...
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.780]   I guess you can't make everybody...
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:29.380]   I believe that I spent two decades learning about chips and spectrum and I spend like
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:36.780]   at least 10% of my time talking about fricking bezels.
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:41.740]   I'm going pursuit of getting rid of the bezels once and for all, right?
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.980]   Seems to be the never-ending story of technology.
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:51.460]   What do you think this so-called pixel watch would cost?
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.180]   What is it supposed to cost?
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:57.940]   And actually, I think I just found an article that has some bezel pictures.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:02.700]   Because I believe the Samsung was looking at right at 500, right?
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.700]   Yeah, so...
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.300]   Wow, what is the price?
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:09.500]   I feel like we don't know exactly.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.420]   Some leaks have said $3.99 all the time.
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.740]   That feels really pricey for a pixel watch.
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:16.940]   Especially, yeah.
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:21.900]   It seems like the price has been tipped to cost $399 for the LTE model.
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:26.260]   So Wi-Fi Bluetooth model, less expensive than that.
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:27.260]   What?
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.260]   $3.25, $3-ish.
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.260]   Somewhere around there would be my guess.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:33.340]   And you think that's too much for said pixel watch?
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.340]   Is what you're saying?
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.340]   I don't know.
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.340]   Yeah, it's...
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:44.820]   Because if it's too much, then what do you feel like the Samsung smartwatch and/or smartwatches
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:48.140]   is justified at its pricing?
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:52.220]   I mean, the Galaxy watch has a history, right?
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.340]   And so they have a following.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:00.180]   Samsung also really creates high quality hardware, as we talked about earlier.
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:05.020]   I think in some ways Samsung justifies the cost of a more expensive device because of
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.020]   that.
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:13.300]   Google historically with the Pixel, even their high-end phones still cost less than a lot
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.540]   of other high-end things.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:18.500]   Although that price has really gone up and it's way more comparable.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:22.540]   But that's kind of been the history mostly as far as pixel devices are concerned.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:26.220]   So I guess there's a part of me that it would expect the pixel watch to be more competitively
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:30.820]   priced and not like, "Here's a $500 watch," which doesn't seem like it would be 500.
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:31.820]   All the other ones.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.660]   But yeah, I don't know.
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:38.460]   And then it comes down to, and we talked about this on all about Android last night, it was
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:43.580]   one of our great email from a fan of the show Mac file who is sometimes in IRC.
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.220]   Hey, I know her.
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.940]   She's also in our club to wait.
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:54.820]   She just pointed out her long history with pixel devices and how phone after phone after
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:59.300]   phone, she runs into the same thing where the first year it's really great.
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.660]   And then things start happening.
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:06.660]   You know, they start slowing down, has issues that go into crap.
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.500]   The camera, the battery, these weird little things.
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:20.380]   And so I start to wonder about Google's dedication to the longevity of its hardware.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:25.860]   Even though they're making promises about longevity from a software perspective, three
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:31.180]   years of major system updates, five years of security updates, that's really great.
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.700]   But if I'm using a phone that's two years old and I can't stand to use it anymore because
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:41.540]   it's just getting all glitchy and everything, that update, that update cadence, I don't
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:42.540]   know.
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.100]   But then the conspiracy stories start talking about playing obsolescence.
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.100]   Right?
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:48.100]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.100]   Well, that's true.
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.100]   Some people do talk about that.
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:54.180]   I don't know if any of this stuff is planned, like down to the calendar date, you know what
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.180]   I mean?
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.180]   But maybe.
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.180]   It's planned.
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:02.380]   I mean, it's planned in the sense that like a chip vendor or a software vendor will only
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.700]   support something for X number of years.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:05.700]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:06.700]   Right?
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:11.300]   So it's planned, like they know that you cannot physically buy a smartphone chip that
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:16.740]   will get security updates in support for more than like four years, for example.
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.740]   Right?
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.900]   Qualcomm has programs that certify certain devices.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:20.900]   That is true.
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:21.900]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:22.900]   Right.
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:23.900]   Yeah.
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:26.180]   So I mean, yes, it's planned.
[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:27.180]   It's a dentist, yeah.
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:28.180]   Yeah.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.180]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:33.460]   And Google says, you know, we're going to support this particular version of the OS for X number
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:37.300]   of years or security updates for the Pixel 7 through whatever.
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.300]   Right.
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.620]   They do two years or do they do three?
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:45.020]   Now they do three years of major OS updates.
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:51.100]   So three major updates to Android, but a total of five years of security.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:56.140]   But not all of those years are they month to month updates, right?
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:00.540]   Like at a certain point, it's kind of like, yeah, we update up to five years, but that
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:04.100]   might slow down in those latter two years.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.820]   Oh, they do not part.
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:13.020]   And also like, I'm really curious to see how the hardware holds up in five years.
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:19.060]   Like, of course, that's what we're asking for is we want our hardware to last longer
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:23.500]   so that people don't feel this pressure, this need to fill the landfills with a device
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.860]   that's two years old.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.940]   You know, so that's great.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:33.700]   But I mean, I have seen phones that are only a couple of years old and are insanely difficult
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:37.980]   to use because things just don't work the way they used to.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:41.900]   And that's for some of the premium devices too, right?
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.900]   It's not necessarily the feature phones that people are buying.
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:46.740]   It's some of the premium line.
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:50.620]   They're still pretty much, yeah, the garbage after two years.
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:56.060]   My wife stuck with her tiny apple for ages waiting for the small apple to come out.
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:57.980]   Pretty much worked the whole time.
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:03.540]   Mr. Jammerby has a, I believe he's got an iPhone 7.
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.260]   iPhone 7 from 2014.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:10.060]   Yeah, I'm going to get a dink 14 and then I'll get the 21 in another eight years.
[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:11.060]   Dang.
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:14.700]   A massive amount of respect for that, Jammerby.
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:15.900]   That is awesome.
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.300]   Wow.
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:24.020]   Yes, and so then this device is what, seven years old?
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:27.820]   Like at what point was it just in the last year that you're like, all right, it's time
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:32.660]   or have you been living with certain qualities of it over the past couple of years that you
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:33.660]   just kept up with?
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.980]   Well, there's been apps recommended on Mac break weekly that have downloaded to my phone
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:40.020]   and find out, oh, they won't run on my phone.
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:44.260]   And the walking measurement thing, the gate thing that I've asked, I would like that,
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:45.620]   but it doesn't run on my phone.
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:51.220]   And on this last trip, Waze was refreshing very slowly, refreshing a lot slower than
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:52.580]   I needed to make turns.
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:53.580]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:56.420]   So I need, I need a faster phone.
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.500]   Holy moly, you turns on this trip.
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:59.500]   Huh?
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:03.340]   Oh, well, fuck yes, you turn, but a lot of crazy turns.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.900]   I can only imagine how amazing it's going to be for you to get a new phone.
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:11.820]   If you've been living with that phone, eight years, yeah, seven or eight years, that's,
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.900]   you're going to get this new phone and it's going to, man, it's going to blow your mind
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:15.900]   all the way.
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:16.900]   Oh, sure.
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:18.900]   So worth not getting a new phone for it.
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:19.900]   Yes.
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:20.900]   Yes.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:21.900]   So refreshing after all that time.
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:22.900]   Wow.
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.900]   Mr. Hall, did you have your hands on the six A?
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:27.980]   Yeah, I did.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:33.620]   I ended up using, so I reviewed the six A on all about Android, I think a week ago, it
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:38.940]   was last week's episode and, and I used it a total of, I don't know, three, three and
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.620]   a half weeks.
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:44.620]   And I'd say all things considered the, I love the A series.
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:50.580]   I think the A series is a great category or variant of the Pixel phones because, you
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:54.220]   know, price to, to what you get is just really high.
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.180]   You get a lot of value out of the A series.
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:51:00.300]   And I think in that price range, it's hard to beat it for a number of reasons.
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:04.460]   But this time I definitely experienced some strangeness with the battery that I haven't
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:09.300]   experienced with Pixel phones to that degree before.
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:15.900]   It wasn't a total deal breaker, but, and I think probably it comes down to 5G, you know,
[00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:21.380]   my 5G was active and they say, well, if you turn off 5G, you get better battery and I'm
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:25.420]   just kind of the, in this camp of like, yeah, but I shouldn't have to do that to get big
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:26.420]   good battery.
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:31.700]   If it's a, if it's a feature that's on by default, like, design for that, for that to
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.180]   be a good experience, not, it's a great experience.
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:38.220]   If you turn off this major feature and, but there are other people that don't have that
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.220]   experience.
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:45.180]   So your mileage may vary, but I just, more often than not, I hit 7 o'clock and, you know,
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:50.100]   my battery was, it had, it had lit up red because, you know, it was down to like 14%.
[00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:51.260]   And I'm just not used to that.
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:56.380]   And this day and age, I'm not used to my battery being that low that early in the evening.
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:59.140]   This sounds exactly like your discussion.
[00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:04.100]   You had several years ago about the Thunderbolt and LTE.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:05.660]   Good, good memory.
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:07.060]   When was the HTC Thunderbolt?
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:08.060]   That had to be like 2011.
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:13.180]   It was a long time ago, but I remember you talking about that on all about Android all
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:16.540]   those years ago and it's like, Anna, this battery is horrible.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:18.540]   Right.
[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:20.300]   So it's kind of the same thing, right?
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.100]   It's like this next generation network.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:24.100]   Great.
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:27.260]   The phone supports it, but it comes with a bit, very large tradeoff.
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.260]   And yeah, it was right.
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:32.260]   HTC Thunderbolt January 2011 was the release date on that.
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.100]   Oh, that phone horrible.
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:39.340]   But it was the first 4G phone on Verizon.
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:40.900]   But yeah.
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:45.780]   So the 6A, like great phone, it's just, you know, understand that you might have issues
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:46.780]   with the battery.
[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:50.180]   I enjoyed the 4A.
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.980]   We had the 4A until we traded it up for whatever she's got now.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:56.940]   And the 4A was totally fine.
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.060]   And I'm like, this thing was on 300 bucks.
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.060]   I liked the 4A.
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:02.060]   Yeah, I think we only paid $300 for it.
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.100]   It's like, yeah, this just works.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.100]   Absolutely.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:10.380]   The series is, it's a solid series.
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:13.700]   But you know, with the 6A now, you don't get the headphone jack, which was, that was
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:19.100]   the last kind of like pixel remnant phone on the, in the pixel lineup that had the headphone
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:21.580]   jack if you care about that.
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:26.900]   So you know, it has, has some tradeoffs, but, but there you go.
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:29.420]   Sorry, I didn't mean to do really.
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:30.660]   That's okay.
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:31.660]   That's okay.
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:33.660]   I'm going to talk about this stuff all day.
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:36.380]   But this is all the stuff that we get to talk about.
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.500]   Oh, well, and this is kind of along those lines.
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:43.380]   And speaking of regulation, which was kind of part of what Sundar Pichai was talking
[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:52.980]   about, EU lawmakers want other Android phone makers to mirror in many ways what Google's
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.220]   doing with its pixel update cadence.
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:54:01.460]   There's draft regulation that would establish quote, eco design requirements for mobile phones,
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:03.140]   cordless phones, cordless phones.
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:04.860]   That makes me chuckle.
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:09.420]   And why even call that out anymore?
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:10.860]   I joke here.
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:14.340]   Yeah, I guess they still exist.
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:16.340]   There you go.
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:17.340]   I remember that.
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:18.340]   Drop the cord.
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:19.340]   Condile tone.
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:24.340]   I remember those corded phones, but with really, really long cords.
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:26.180]   So we could go for one room to the other.
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:28.300]   Then they just get all stretched out.
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:31.620]   And then the coils would unravel in certain parts of them.
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.900]   They'd be like little squares and then would bug the heck out of me.
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:38.700]   I'd like spend all this time trying to wind it back up.
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:39.700]   So it was.
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:42.180]   Yeah, those are like the anti OCD phone right there.
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.180]   Yes.
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.580]   Yes, totally.
[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:47.060]   But and then they also said slate tablets.
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:50.180]   So basically they want to cut down on waste, e-waste.
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:52.940]   The Pixel 6, as we mentioned, five years of updates.
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:56.300]   That's three years of OS updates, five years of security.
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:01.820]   And they want that to kind of be the case for all Android phones, at least sold in the
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:02.820]   EU.
[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:05.780]   So extending the lifeline of devices from two to five years.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:11.700]   They say that doing that is going to is equal to taking up to five million cars off the
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.700]   road.
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:15.900]   That's what the commission said.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:21.420]   So yes, regulation, but regulation for the health of the world, I suppose.
[00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:22.420]   How do we feel about that?
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:23.620]   I'm in favor of it.
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:29.300]   Well, I so I've been in favor of this sort of thing for any kind of connected device.
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:34.420]   Because again, like like chip makers don't support things for that long.
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:39.020]   Or you know, like when you spec out your design and you're going to buy like a certain memory
[00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:44.820]   for your phone, you know how many reads and write or rather writes it has.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.060]   So when you spec that out, you can spec to a higher standard.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:52.460]   It's going to cost more, but it'll last longer, right?
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:56.500]   If you don't do, I don't know if I really love the EU regulating that it has to be five
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:57.500]   years.
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:02.180]   What I would like what I would like to see is expiration dates for every device at purchase
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:06.260]   in terms of like, we will promise to support this for three years.
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:13.340]   So when you purchase that phone, you're like, okay, this is a $500 phone that I can use for
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:14.580]   the next three years.
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:15.580]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:20.260]   Or maybe you're like, I would buy a greener phone that is going to cost me $800, but it'll
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:24.060]   last for five years and I won't contribute to waste.
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:29.060]   You know, so I would rather see the market help decide this because we have to regulate
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:31.740]   how long we're going to actually support it.
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:36.540]   Like or regulate that we have to tell people that as opposed to saying you must support
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:39.100]   it for X number of years.
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:43.820]   Because these you must support it for X number of years really depends on how that device
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:45.540]   is built to begin with, right?
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:52.940]   Like, like a device that is $1,000 that Samsung puts its latest and greatest and best and loads
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:58.260]   it up, you know, that thing stands a much better chance, at least in my opinion, my limited
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:04.100]   opinion, stands a much better chance of lasting five years based on the fact that all of that,
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:10.580]   that hardware is forward, you know, future proof to a certain degree, at least considering
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:16.500]   that, versus like a low end device that costs like $100 out the door, which we still need
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:17.660]   to have, right?
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:21.740]   For some people, that's that's the device they can afford that turns into waste that
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:24.780]   turns it turns into waste.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:31.260]   But how do you ensure that $100 device with the technology that is in there to make it
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:34.860]   that that inexpensive could last five years?
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:36.940]   I don't even know that's like, is that even possible?
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:39.940]   You know, again, it goes back to like, how do you even use a phone?
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:45.060]   Like, sure, okay, like technically it's getting an update, but it's, you know, every command
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.740]   takes 10 minutes to execute.
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:48.140]   Like, that's just not usable.
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.020]   Why would you want to use that?
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:54.700]   You could, the flip side of that, if you did regulate that, you wanted to make cheap devices,
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:57.900]   you would have to make light software that could run on those devices.
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:58.900]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:02.900]   So, I mean, you're, you're right, Jason, you're going to have to bifurcated either the software
[00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:15.060]   side or the hardware side if you want to make inexpensive devices.
[00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:16.060]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.060]   That's just me.
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.060]   Right.
[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:22.500]   And there's the people who like, well, I was going to say there's people who like least
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:26.660]   versus buy their car and they like, I drive my cars into the ground because I just don't
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:28.060]   think it's something I want to update.
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:32.140]   But some people like, I must update my car every two years because it's a piece of me,
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:36.180]   you know, and it needs to be flexible.
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:37.180]   Yeah.
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.500]   The other thing is I don't think it's just an eco issue.
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:42.060]   It's also a consumer issue.
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.060]   Right.
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:45.100]   It's the 100% a consumer issue.
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:46.100]   Yeah.
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:50.220]   But it's being positioned as an eco matter by the EU, who's a very EU-ish, but it's more
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:51.220]   consumer protection.
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:52.220]   Mm-hmm.
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:53.220]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:55.780]   I mean, I've argued about this not just for funds.
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:56.780]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:59:01.900]   But if you, if you, if you need a cheap phone, but it can't be a cheap phone anymore because
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:08.900]   it's required to do all these things for so long, then yeah, have you, is it an inequitable
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:09.900]   market intervention?
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:10.900]   Right.
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:11.900]   I don't know.
[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:12.900]   Right.
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:13.900]   Is the trade off worth it.
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:14.900]   It's a good point.
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:15.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:16.900]   Yeah, really.
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:20.100]   It's not just the, the OS updates either.
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:26.660]   It's a, it also this, this regulation, draft regulation calls for repair parts and services
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:31.780]   to be offered for at least five years after that device goes on sale.
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:39.060]   So calls from meeting a strict standard on battery life or bring back swappable batteries.
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:42.500]   Can you imagine if we had a resurgence in replaceable batteries?
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:47.300]   Well, that's, I mean, that's batteries are one of the biggest sources of e-waste.
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:48.300]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:49.300]   Yeah, right.
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:54.900]   So like if you can have your batteries have more discharges without losing capacity, that
[00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:55.900]   would be great.
[00:59:55.900 --> 01:00:03.660]   I don't know if we actually have that technology at certain levels, do we?
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:04.660]   I don't know.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:05.660]   I'm not batteries.
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:10.740]   I'm going to, I'm going to allocate my bezel stuff, my bezel knowledge over to batteries
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:11.740]   to all the better.
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:12.740]   Yeah.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:15.740]   That's all the action is.
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:22.420]   I mean, I feel like I saw, let's see here, I'm looking at the nine to five Google article.
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:29.340]   The EU's requirements, this is from the article, would have to, the batteries that meet the
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:34.700]   EU's requirements would have to retain at least 83% of rated capacity after 500 charge
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:39.100]   cycles and 80% after 1000 cycles.
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:43.300]   And then you've got companies like Apple, their claim for iPhone batteries is that it
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:47.540]   holds 80% of their rated capacity after 500 charge cycles.
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:54.900]   Ah, one plus 10 T, for example, they claimed it can retain 80% capacity at 1600 charge
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:55.900]   cycles.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:01:03.500]   So there's something in there that that manufacturers are able to do to, to rate the health of their
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:09.180]   battery and apparently according to one plus 10 T because that's a huge jump from anything,
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:10.980]   any of these other numbers.
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:16.940]   There's something that they can do to increase, you know, the health of that and get more charge
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.180]   cycles in there.
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:25.420]   So I have to like, lard the battery with like toxic chemicals though to make that happen.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:26.260]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:31.540]   I haven't wandered the best by phone department in a long time.
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:37.780]   Is there still a large selection of basically burner phones of good.
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:41.100]   I just phone for very little and don't open it.
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:42.100]   You need to go.
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:43.300]   My burner phone is at Walmart.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.300]   Best buy.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.300]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:47.900]   Last time I went into Best Buy.
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.980]   I mean, are there a lot of, are there burner phones for sale?
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.540]   I'm sure there are.
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:53.540]   Yeah.
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:54.780]   You don't have to go to Best Buy.
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:57.340]   I mean, there has to be a burner phone.
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:58.340]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.340]   Come by everywhere.
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:05.780]   Gas station gas stations gas stations grocery stores.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:06.780]   Parrays.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:09.820]   I need to find the best buy.
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:12.380]   I think like I have a new burner phone for every day of the week.
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.380]   I have my reporting.
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:14.900]   What about you, Jeff?
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:17.460]   I have 365 burner phones.
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:21.060]   I'm in a hole in my pocket.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:25.140]   Well Leo basically does that just in the normal course of his business.
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.140]   Yeah, right.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.580]   That's just another day here at Twitch.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:34.820]   And then I think finally, because we've been talking a lot about Android and stuff, so
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.580]   we can wrap it up with this last one.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:40.020]   But I think this is, I think this is actually very cool.
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:44.700]   Android 14, which is, yes, the next version of Android that we haven't even started
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:49.260]   to see any versions of any developer reviews or nothing like that.
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:54.540]   We're just now starting to hear some aspects, some elements about it to look forward to.
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:03:00.340]   And I think I believe on last week's or the week before episode, you all talked about
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:04.460]   the SpaceX and T-Mobile announcement that they would be bringing satellite connectivity to
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:05.620]   smartphones.
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:13.580]   Well, last week, Hiroshi Lakhheimer actually tweeted about this and said, essentially,
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:18.460]   said that Google is working, they're designing for satellites.
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:22.900]   He said, "We're excited to support our partners in enabling all of this in the next version
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:23.900]   of Android."
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:29.220]   And it has been confirmed by 9 to 5 Google that the next version is indeed Android 14
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.220]   that Hiroshi was talking about.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:38.020]   So satellite connectivity coming to Android 14, at least his capability.
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:46.060]   And yeah, great for people who aren't served by traditional connectivity, traditional cellular
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:47.060]   coverage.
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:49.860]   This would be for a smaller percentage of people.
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:53.060]   Which is the most satellites through the other satellites?
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:04:01.140]   I don't know that that information is public yet, but there's some similarity between what
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:05.260]   SpaceX and T-Mobile is doing and what Hiroshi was referring to.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:10.140]   So I don't know if they have a direct relationship, but they're definitely working on building
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:14.180]   this functionality into Android to support something like that.
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.740]   So yeah, I could totally see that.
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:18.140]   And we thought we'd see that on the new Apple phones too.
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:19.140]   Yeah, I did too.
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.500]   That was a rumor there.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.500]   Right.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:25.980]   Any of the satellite connectivity, though, it sounds like most of these companies are
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:30.660]   looking at something like texting, which wouldn't require SpaceX level constant.
[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:31.660]   It's in that Apple.
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.660]   The satellite.
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.100]   This is discussed this morning.
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.100]   Did they talk about it?
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:37.100]   I did discuss that.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:42.020]   Yeah, it seems like they discussed that this morning and it basically shrinks down the bits
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:47.300]   of SMS so you can get it faster over this so-called satellite connection.
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.580]   Oh yeah, they did talk about it.
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:50.580]   My bad.
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:53.460]   But that had to do with the watch.
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.940]   Is that what you were saying, J MRB?
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.900]   No, it's an iPhone 14.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:00.140]   And does the Ultra watch also have it?
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.140]   OK, OK.
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.140]   Explain the size.
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.140]   There you go.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:08.660]   Yeah, the LiRC says the satellite is for SOS calls.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:09.660]   Yeah.
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:10.660]   Got it.
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:11.660]   OK.
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:12.660]   And that makes sense.
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:16.220]   I mean, the Garmin has their in reach, which was a surprise hit for them.
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:19.620]   And that's like a little...
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.340]   I have one.
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.100]   It's a little...
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:27.020]   It's a walkie-talkie-looking device that you can use when you're camping the Senate
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.020]   SOS.
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:29.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:34.100]   It looks like a tiny walkie-talkie, but it's not a walkie-talkie, sorry.
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:38.820]   And you can use it to send a little SOS in your location when you're camping.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:42.820]   And you know, like as a woman who goes hiking by herself, I'm like...
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:43.820]   Hello!
[01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:45.460]   Super good to have that.
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:46.460]   Absolutely.
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.460]   Yeah.
[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:48.460]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.940]   And I mean, I bought that for like $350.
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:55.380]   And so it makes sense that Apple's like, "Hey, that's a feature we could stick on our
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:59.100]   phones and maybe one day it could be even more useful over time."
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:05.740]   Because once you get those economies of scale for the chipsets, that would maybe be awesome.
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:12.140]   And that really ends up solving a problem that we've all kind of learned to live with
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:15.740]   because we didn't have a solution for it, which is that, you know, you don't always have
[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:19.020]   connectivity everywhere you go with your phone.
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:23.780]   Now if it supports satellite connectivity, eventually you could see a time where you kind
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:29.940]   of always do because wherever traditional cellular coverage can't reach, the satellite
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.340]   probably can.
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:36.300]   And yeah, that's some good progress right there.
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.060]   Like that a lot.
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:41.380]   So Android 14 would be something...
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:44.380]   At least one feature of Android 14 to look forward to.
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.380]   And who knows?
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.180]   If that's the case, then you can...
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:48.900]   I can already see it now, right?
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.460]   Like the Pixel 8 or whatever.
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:55.860]   Now with satellite connectivity compatibility.
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.260]   But who the heck knows?
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:59.300]   We still need to get to the satellite.
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:00.300]   Is that...
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:08.500]   Oh, Stacey, is that antenna specific to the satellite?
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.340]   Which antenna?
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:12.620]   To be able to get the satellite.
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:13.620]   Is it...
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:18.020]   Is it like imaging cell or is it a separate kind of antenna?
[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:20.020]   I don't know that...
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:22.340]   Sorry, I didn't even know Apple introduced it.
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:23.340]   So now I'm like...
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.340]   Global Star...
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.340]   It will pass bezels.
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.140]   Get past the bezels here.
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:32.740]   Okay, well if it's Global Star, you do have to have a specific transceiver in your
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:33.740]   device.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:34.740]   Okay.
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:35.740]   Now did...
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:36.740]   Like...
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:38.740]   Is Apple using Global Star?
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:39.740]   That's like...
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:40.740]   These are the...
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:43.020]   Again, just found out they have this.
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:46.140]   They just gave the high level...
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:50.420]   Apple picks Global Star for emergency satellite service on iPhone 14.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:51.420]   One hour ago.
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:58.660]   Okay, so then you would need a special antenna inside the device.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:05.820]   So is it possible in other words that Samsung could put one antenna in its hardware and
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:09.100]   Google could put a different antenna in its hardware and the software has to deal with
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:10.100]   both?
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:12.940]   Yes, but it would be stupid to do that.
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:15.580]   Yeah, but that's the mean that it won't happen.
[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:18.300]   It would be stupid because it would cost more.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:24.420]   So if you have to have a special antenna manufactured as a radio, you're going to want
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:29.260]   as many people using that radio as possible because then you can take your costs down
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:34.500]   on that radio because satellite radios, like part of the expense of satellite is because
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:39.060]   they require specialized equipment that doesn't benefit from the economies of scale that are
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.060]   in cell phones.
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:43.020]   Okay, so Queen of chips.
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:45.020]   Which chip is the...
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.780]   What am I asking here?
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:55.940]   Are the antennas, the antennae in our phones?
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:57.940]   What chips are they built into?
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:08:58.940]   How many...
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.060]   Your core chips, well what chips are the antennae in?
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:03.180]   Is this something you just add on to an existing chip?
[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.220]   It would have to be a new chip.
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:06.220]   It depends.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:11.580]   So Qualcomm, Qualcomm integrates their application processor, which is the brains of a smartphone.
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:16.300]   They're now a lot more brains on a smartphone with a radio.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:21.340]   So Apple though, because they built their own chip, they still use Qualcomm radios, but
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:26.820]   they don't use the application processor because they built their own.
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:29.460]   That's one of the reasons they're in this big fight with Qualcomm.
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:36.380]   Anyway, so you could have your separate baseband chip for talking to your 4G and usually now
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.460]   they're pretty highly integrated.
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:44.780]   So you'll have a baseband chip that talks to your 4G, your 5G network.
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:47.740]   I guess you could integrate that with...
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.980]   Right now it's not integrated with a global star.
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:53.300]   So you would need another chip on your board for handling.
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:57.780]   And the radio has the antennae plus a little...
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:04.220]   We'll call it an engine, a DSP processor, whatever, to handle the calculations of turning
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:08.140]   your airwaves into bits and bytes.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.940]   So those two things are textured.
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:15.420]   So surely this has been in discussion in the field for quite a while.
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.420]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:17.420]   Well, people have been rumored.
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:21.220]   I mean, it's been rumored for like two years.
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:24.900]   The other thing is the satellite companies for the last...
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:29.940]   I mean, in 2005 I was reporting on satellite companies that wanted to get into the cellular
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:31.300]   space.
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:37.220]   One of the big issues were that your satellite spectrum or your satellite airwaves and your
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:42.580]   LTE or whatever cellular airwaves, you couldn't have both of those, right?
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:47.060]   You had to have two separate radios and that was expensive.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:50.340]   And you always had to have...
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:56.260]   Up until probably 2008 maybe, the FCC said if you were going to do satellite connectivity,
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:01.620]   the majority of your connectivity had to deal with satellites and not with like cellular
[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:02.780]   on the ground.
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:05.620]   And they did that to separate the two things out.
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:13.140]   And then Philip about Coney came in with LightSquared and was like, the FCC said, "Yeah, okay, you
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:15.100]   don't have to...
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:20.260]   You can have this combo to rest your thing and most of your traffic doesn't have to go
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:21.260]   through satellite."
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:25.740]   And then he was like, "Aha, I found a way to back my way into a cellular network."
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:28.620]   And then everybody was like, "No!"
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.380]   And then the FCC changed their mind.
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:32.380]   It's politics.
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:33.380]   What more questions?
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:37.620]   This is really good because we happen to have the Queen of chips right here.
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:41.260]   So why not take a picture?
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:48.260]   So the announcement that Elon made with T-Mobile, he has different satellites, different birds
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:50.580]   going up, right?
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:54.540]   But how can T-Mobile say, "Can they offer it only with one phone that happens to have
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.540]   this hardware?
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:56.540]   Whose phone is it?
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:57.540]   What are they off?"
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:01.700]   I don't understand how T-Mobile as a carrier can offer it across multiple phones or is it
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.860]   just one phone that they're going to offer it to?
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.620]   How do you think that's going to work?
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:08.500]   Oh, this is the T-Mobile SpaceX thing.
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:09.900]   This isn't the Apple stuff now.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.900]   No, no, sorry, I switched.
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:12.900]   Sorry, no, no.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:16.300]   And I'm actually reading about Scooter X as Apple says, they figured out who uses the
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:20.220]   iPhones antenna, I'll answer your T-Mobile thing in a second.
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:23.580]   The iPhone's antenna and special software to compress to reach the satellites.
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.260]   Okay, so they don't actually...
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:26.260]   Wow.
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:27.260]   Wow.
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:28.260]   Wow.
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.260]   They're using the case.
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:32.380]   Well, no, they build antennas into the...
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:33.380]   No.
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.380]   ...bezzle into the...
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:35.380]   Into the phone.
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:36.380]   Sorry.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:37.380]   Okay, I just didn't...
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:46.780]   Apparently, I just slept through this part of the presentation.
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:50.700]   Okay, with T-Mobile and SpaceX, I don't know how that's going to work because I have not
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.100]   paid attention to that at all.
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:53.100]   Sorry.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.100]   Fair enough.
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:59.220]   I did learn a lot about Microsoft and 5G and AT&T though, if you want to read it.
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.900]   I didn't even visit that ever because that was all day yesterday.
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.180]   I did a whole talk on that with them.
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:06.700]   Did you ask them why we had to react to me?
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:10.940]   So maybe talk to me in 3.5G modem on our phones in order to get better battery.
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:12.340]   Did you ask them that, huh?
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:13.340]   No.
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:14.660]   Oh, I can tell you why that.
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:15.660]   Okay.
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:17.860]   No, I mean, I understand actually.
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.860]   I just wanted to throw my...
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:23.940]   Throw my upset-edness around a little bit about the battery.
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:24.940]   You're iron?
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:26.580]   Yeah, my iron, thank you.
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.580]   All right.
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:29.580]   Let's...
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:30.580]   How about this?
[01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:34.740]   Let's take a break and then I know when we come back, we're going to want to talk a
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:36.620]   little bit about this Twitter edit news.
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.340]   I'm really interested in this.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:43.940]   I think it's very interesting how Twitter decided to go about this and I'm curious to
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:45.460]   hear your take on it.
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:50.100]   And then pick out a couple of stories that you think out of this whole list you want
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.940]   to talk about and then let's...
[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:52.940]   It's a revolution?
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:53.940]   Yes.
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:54.940]   It's anarchy?
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:55.940]   Yes.
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:56.940]   It's a democracy.
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:58.980]   I am opening the floodgates.
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:02.820]   Any of these stories let me know, but we'll start with the Twitter edit because I definitely
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:04.060]   want to make sure that we talk about that.
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:09.900]   But first, let's take a break and thank the sponsor of this episode of This Week in Google.
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.860]   And that is "8 Sleep."
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:13.780]   The show's brought to you by "8 Sleep."
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:17.660]   Good sleep is the ultimate game changer.
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:20.780]   And I know because last night I did not get very good sleep.
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:25.060]   You know, it's been really hot here in the Bay Area and a lot of parts of the country.
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.420]   So it was really hot in our homes.
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:30.340]   So we ended up sleeping in the one room that had air conditioning, which is the garage,
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.660]   believe it or not, which was great.
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:37.220]   We had air conditioning, but it still, it just wasn't quite as comfy as my bed and my
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:44.260]   bed would be even more comfortable if I had "8 Sleep" technology running through it.
[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:49.220]   The "8 Sleep" pod specifically is the ultimate sleep machine.
[01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:53.140]   Consistent good sleep can help reduce the likelihood of serious health issues.
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:55.620]   It can decrease the risk of heart disease.
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:15:00.500]   It can lower blood pressure and even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:07.500]   Yet, still more than 30% of Americans struggle with sleep and feeling hot at night, like
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:11.940]   I'm talking about, is one of the main causes of poor sleep.
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.780]   That's really what "8 Sleep" is all about.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:14.980]   It regulates the temperature.
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:19.180]   Leo has "8 Sleep" technology.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:24.460]   On his mattress, it allows him to make the bed hot when it needs to be.
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:27.820]   Make the bed cool when it needs to be cool it down.
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:29.180]   This stuff is really cool.
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:34.260]   I'd love to get my hands on some of this technology in my bed.
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:41.140]   But now you can fall asleep in record time faster than you ever have before, all thanks
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:43.020]   to "8 Sleep" pod.
[01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:48.580]   The pod is the only sleep technology that dynamically cools and heats each side of the
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:49.580]   bed.
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:50.580]   I'm talking about this.
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:54.740]   That's to maintain the optimal sleeping temperature for what your body needs.
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:58.620]   What you need might be different if you're sleeping with someone else in the bed.
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:03.780]   It might be different than what that person's body needs from a temperature standpoint.
[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:05.660]   You can use the pod to regulate.
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:06.660]   It's pretty awesome.
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:12.580]   With the pod, you can start sleeping as cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit or as hot as 110 degrees
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:13.580]   Fahrenheit.
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:14.580]   Holy moly.
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:21.380]   The result, clinical data shows that "8 Sleep" users experience up to 19% increase in recovery,
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:30.940]   up to 32% improvement in sleep quality, and up to 34% more deep sleep.
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:35.620]   When you get more deep sleep, you can be confident that your mind, your body are moving through
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:42.100]   the restorative sleep stages that are absolutely vital for physical recovery, for hormone regulation,
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:45.940]   for mental clarity, all the good stuff.
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:49.260]   Even better "8 Sleep" recently launched the next generation of the pod.
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:54.460]   The new pod 3 actually enables more accurate sleep and health tracking with double the
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:56.060]   amount of sensors.
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:59.700]   That delivers the best sleep experience on Earth.
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:02.140]   The pod is not magic.
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:07.780]   It's not quite magic technically speaking, but it certainly feels like it.
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.180]   That's the beauty of "8 Sleep".
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:11.740]   Go to 8sleep.com/twig.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:16.740]   You'll get exclusive labor day savings through September 11th.
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:19.700]   This is September 7th at the time of this recording, so you've still got a couple of
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:20.700]   days.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:26.140]   "8 Sleep" currently ships within the USA, Canada, the UK, and select countries in the
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:28.340]   EU and Australia.
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:35.180]   If you're listening after September 11th, use the same URL that's 8sleep.
[01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:42.180]   8sleep.com/twig.
[01:17:42.180 --> 01:18:04.180]   8sleep is pretty cool stuff.
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:05.320]   [LAUGHING]
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.440]   Yeah, so OK, all right.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:12.020]   So your car, what's very special car do you have?
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.040]   No, our garage is no longer a garage.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.440]   We converted it into a gym for my wife
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.120]   when the pandemic happened.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:22.100]   Her business in San Francisco shut down,
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:24.580]   and so she moved her business up to Petaluma.
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:28.440]   And so we ended up converting our garage into her gym.
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:30.880]   And then her garage was getting really warm,
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:34.960]   so we got a nice air conditioner in there for her to work out of.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.120]   So it's literally-- it's the only room in the house
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.760]   that has an air conditioner.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.200]   I still refer to it as a garage, even though it's actually
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.560]   more like a gym.
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.680]   So thank you very much.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:44.520]   I just had--
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.440]   Is your wife a trainer?
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.800]   She does personal training.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.360]   She also does something called muscle activation techniques.
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.360]   So--
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.360]   Oh, OK.
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:53.920]   That's awesome.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.720]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:58.400]   So she treats people's muscular imbalance and stuff.
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.800]   It's kind of like PT, but it's a little different.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:01.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.040]   But yeah.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.960]   So-- and that comes with the out of benefit
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:08.320]   on these really, really hot days when we need a place to escape.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.800]   We've got the AC of the garage.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:10.920]   How's it going there?
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.400]   We watched Stranger Things the other night.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:17.000]   My daughter's brought in their squash mellows, whatever--
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.920]   those big stuffed animal things.
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.800]   And we go, yeah.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:21.600]   Come to--
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.600]   Wait, look at that.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.000]   You got Al cosy on the weight bench?
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.600]   Our home doesn't have an AC either, but I have a window.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.680]   You know, you know, right here that's really loud.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:33.280]   And then I have a floor unit downstairs.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.920]   And Hearthead has a floor unit over there.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:39.000]   So it can be challenging to get things cool.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.160]   Fun with cool stuff.
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.080]   I thought Petaluma was hot a lot.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.960]   I mean, say I was just going to get it because it's foggy
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.240]   day, the day of the time.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.840]   But I thought up where you guys are, it's hot a lot.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:49.120]   Well, not at all.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.360]   Well, I mean, it gets hot in the summer.
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:56.000]   But I think the beauty of Petaluma and the area that we live
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.680]   is that there's like this direct access of the wind
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:02.560]   coming from the ocean that at about like 4 or 5 o'clock
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:05.040]   in the afternoon, usually during the summer,
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:08.000]   we get this really kind of like ocean cool breeze that
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.200]   blasts through the--
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.240]   through the town.
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.520]   So it might be hot through the afternoon.
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.920]   And at Hot Petaluma terms, it's like 90-ish somewhere
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:17.680]   around there.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.040]   You know, sometimes it gets 95.
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.720]   Lately, it's been like in the hundreds, which
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:21.640]   Hearthead happens.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:22.720]   113 yesterday.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.920]   I mean, it's ridiculously hot.
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.680]   But that rarely ever happens.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:27.760]   That's super rare.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:30.160]   Well, used to be rarely happened.
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.320]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.840]   And now it's happening more.
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:38.480]   But we almost always get that nice cool breeze coming in.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.400]   And--
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.120]   I tend to tell you my lighting.
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.920]   The Petaluma gat has a microclimate.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.320]   I love the Bay Area and its microclimate.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:46.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.600]   I live in this microclimate.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.200]   You live that climate.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.120]   I told my family, we basically just
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.320]   have to survive lunchtime.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.720]   Right after that, you can definitely feel a difference.
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.280]   Yeah, because right after that, you
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.480]   can definitely feel a difference right after that.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:03.160]   The temperature just changes.
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:04.520]   And it gets comfortable.
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.120]   It's having cold, tooth-a-fish salad
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.200]   saying, which you're OK.
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.600]   There you go.
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:11.760]   Don't bake anything in the oven for the afternoon.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:12.280]   Save them.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:12.920]   All right, thank you.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.120]   I just served that interruption there.
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.280]   No, no, no, it's OK.
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:15.760]   It's OK.
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.720]   It's one of the things that I love about Petaluma
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.480]   is that you get that at the evening.
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:20.920]   Although at the same time, sometimes
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:24.040]   I wish I could go to an outdoor restaurant
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:26.240]   and be in shorts and be perfectly comfortable.
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.680]   And a lot of times in the summer, you can't do that in Petaluma.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.520]   You need a little layer because--
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.280]   Yeah, you can't do it in Seattle either.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.400]   I wore a hoodie to the beach.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.200]   Yeah, you need a hoodie every single year
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:36.840]   years ago.
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:39.400]   I came from Chicago.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.880]   And I said, oh, well, it's OK if I put an air conditioner
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:42.080]   in it.
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.880]   They all just laughed at me.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.560]   I couldn't understand why they were laughing.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.400]   But I learned soon enough.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.200]   Vogue comes in on cat feet.
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.040]   Yes.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.560]   But at the same time, I will say,
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.400]   it's nice having a room with an air conditioner in it.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:58.920]   All that.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:21:59.920]   It looks like that.
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.600]   For nights like that, it would have been unbearable sleeping
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:07.480]   upstairs in our bedrooms on the 113 degree day, the evening
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:10.280]   of that, where we didn't get that cool down in the evening.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:11.600]   So--
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.560]   And now, now on to Twitter, sorry.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.400]   No, that's OK.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.120]   That's OK.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.320]   I love it.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.960]   Yes, so Twitter.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:21.200]   Twitter, this thing we love to hate and we hate to love.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.200]   Now with an edit button, not quite for everybody,
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.640]   but Twitter is fine.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.240]   Did I have it?
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:28.040]   I haven't gotten it yet.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:28.680]   But apparently it's--
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.000]   Do you have Twitter blue?
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:30.520]   I'm blue.
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:31.400]   I have the blue button.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.760]   But is it a different thing where
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:35.400]   you can do it up to 30 minutes and all this whole Macgilla?
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.360]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.920]   I don't know who they're testing this with outside of employees.
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.680]   I think it's kind of starting there.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:45.520]   And then they're eventually going to open this up to test
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.640]   with Twitter blue.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:49.840]   The one I saw that it was going out to the blue people.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.880]   Like right away.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:53.440]   The blue subscribers were getting it.
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:56.080]   At least that's where I read it somewhere.
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.120]   I mean, eventually they are.
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:59.360]   I don't know if they are right now.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.520]   I can schedule my tweets.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.960]   That is not how they're having a different edit them.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.760]   No, I know.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:06.600]   I hate for--
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.240]   I'm the mobile.
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:14.040]   This is a test tweet.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.840]   I don't like the audio more so.
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:19.360]   I don't think where I can view the tweet and then--
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.360]   But then you know what?
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:25.440]   No, I still-- no, because I can't only wait.
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:26.880]   So I can't edit it.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.360]   And I don't think that you're going to be able to.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:34.640]   My understanding is that right now, employees are testing it.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:35.480]   But--
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:35.920]   OK.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:41.640]   So you might see tweets on Twitter that have all the symbols
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:44.560]   or the hallmarks of an editable tweet, which I'll talk about
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.320]   in a second.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.840]   But I don't know that you can actually edit yet.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:51.320]   Eventually, this is going to be a feature that comes out
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:52.520]   to Twitter blue users.
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.080]   So you'll have to pay the-- what is it now?
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:57.400]   $4.99 a month for the subscription service.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.600]   And this might actually be a feature that's worth it,
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.760]   depending on how often you tweet.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.480]   Look like an idiot, less often.
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:05.000]   Yeah, right.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.880]   But I think how they're doing this is actually really good.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:10.360]   So essentially, you're going to be
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:14.320]   able to edit up to five times within the 30 minutes following
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.000]   the publication of that tweet.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:16.880]   So you've got five--
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.080]   I can't make up your mind by that.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:18.640]   I know.
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.280]   Five seems like a lot.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:22.480]   They initially said a few times.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:26.640]   And then they clarified up to five times, which, OK,
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.640]   that's a lot of editing power that you have in 30 minutes.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:31.360]   But then after 30 minutes, you're locked in.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.520]   I suppose at that point, you could still delete it and go again.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:37.680]   But what happens when you edit a tweet?
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:40.240]   It will appear with an icon in the feed.
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:42.280]   It appears with a timestamp and a label.
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:46.440]   So it's really clear when you're looking at an editable tweet
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.480]   or a tweet that has been modified.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:51.000]   And then if you tap that label, that actually
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.720]   takes you to an edit history.
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:56.040]   And I don't know why it never dawned on me
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.760]   that that would be a great way to do edit.
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:00.960]   Because I've been very hesitant on the edit button
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:04.640]   discussion because I do believe that Twitter is--
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:08.080]   it's used in so many different ways for good or bad.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.680]   It's become an important kind of megaphone
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.000]   for certain people.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.480]   And I want to know--
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.600]   Well, what about Facebook, Mr. Howell?
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:19.680]   Well, but I don't think that Facebook is used in quite the same way
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:21.720]   as Twitter is used for that sort of thing.
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:27.120]   With all the gazillion followers and active accounts on that,
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:30.000]   you don't think there's just as many voices that
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.920]   could be used to document things that
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.240]   happen in our history and whatnot the same way Twitter has?
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.240]   Could be.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.520]   But is it?
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.480]   I feel like a lot of the communication that's
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:45.800]   happening in this way using a social network to broadcast
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.800]   to many, many people, it seems to--
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:49.720]   and I could be wrong.
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:51.080]   My perspective could be totally wrong.
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.520]   But it really seems like Twitter has kind of
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:56.080]   filled that megaphone role.
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.680]   As I think about the George Floyd scenario,
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:00.560]   did that originate on Facebook or Twitter?
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:01.400]   Is that what they got?
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.400]   Facebook.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.360]   That was on Facebook.
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.520]   OK, yeah.
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.080]   So it has its place.
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:07.960]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:11.000]   Those things have been editable for how long now?
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.560]   Can you go into a Facebook post that you posted five years ago
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.040]   and edit it?
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.200]   That I don't know.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:18.880]   But I know they've been editable.
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:20.720]   You guys are all Facebooks, so I'll find out,
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:21.720]   because I'm still there.
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.120]   Yeah, I know nothing about that.
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:26.880]   I did come back to Facebook, I should say.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:28.400]   I am there.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:32.000]   But I remember when we talked about this previously,
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.520]   the API was the discussion, when we previously
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.560]   talked about it with people using it as a source in news
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.640]   stories and things would get wacky.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:41.360]   That's right.
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.520]   How it would be.
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:44.680]   But I might-- nobody ever said that about Facebook.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.000]   And Facebook posts were editable.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:49.440]   Blog posts are editable.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.320]   And there was an ethic about doing that that you should cross out.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.560]   You shouldn't erase.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:54.560]   Right.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.560]   But that was just--
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:56.640]   I missed that ethic.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:57.720]   No one does it anymore.
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:58.480]   We still do it.
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:26:59.200]   I know.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:26:59.880]   Because I think it's great.
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:03.200]   I see people just update at the very top or at the very bottom.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:04.080]   But no cross out.
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.440]   I've seen that.
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.440]   The thing I've seen--
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.640]   The bullet at the bottom.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.360]   Sorry.
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.840]   The argument I've seen.
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:11.120]   I'm waiting for the edit button.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:11.640]   I want it.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:15.320]   But Jason, I think to make your argument,
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.680]   what I've seen is that someone could use it as a Trojan
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:26.040]   horse, that you could get in something that seems innocent.
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.920]   Or, yeah, I guess you'd put something innocent.
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:29.720]   And then you edit it.
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.440]   And you get all kinds of popular.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.720]   And then you edit it in something noxious.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:37.440]   And the noxious thing spreads.
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:41.360]   It's a bit of a stretch of a complaint to me.
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.800]   I agree with that.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.560]   All these other mechanisms are editable.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:48.120]   The problem I've always imagined for Facebook
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.560]   is that once something goes out in the RSS feed,
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.560]   you can't draw it back and change it.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.960]   And so the only thing about the edit button that worries me
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:59.680]   is that I was hoping that Facebook was heading back
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:04.040]   to being a protocol and an API, in which case people could
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.960]   just take it and put it wherever they wanted to.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.320]   But then that complicates the idea of editing.
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:13.120]   Maybe that's why the 30-minute thing, I don't know.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:17.400]   But then does that delay the tweet going out to the RSS world?
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:19.600]   Is that the thing you're doing here?
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.480]   That's a good question.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:28.120]   I guess I rarely ever think of Twitter in terms of RSS feeds.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:28.800]   Right.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.000]   There isn't much of that anymore.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.760]   But even TweetDeck is a separate instance.
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:36.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:39.560]   I don't know.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:42.520]   There's a part of me that appreciates having the record,
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.200]   though.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.960]   Like if you're going to edit--
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:45.920]   I don't know.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.960]   I like that control, I suppose.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:51.600]   I suppose at a certain point, if I put something out there
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:53.760]   to a certain degree, I'm kind of committing to it.
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.160]   And I guess that works for my brain.
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.680]   I think if we didn't have Facebook, I don't go back and edit
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:00.560]   things on Facebook.
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:01.200]   It is what it is.
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.000]   It's because you're a journalist.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.240]   We just are like, let's just-- we're going to make it happen.
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:07.560]   It is what it is.
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:09.000]   Go.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.160]   Yeah.
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:14.800]   But I appreciate that there is that kind of historical record.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.680]   If an edit is made, you could still kind of see what
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:18.640]   was there before.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:19.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.200]   That's better than Facebook or anything else.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.240]   Well, Facebook will tell you it was edited.
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:26.640]   I think it's fine to--
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:27.640]   --to edit trace.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.200]   I think it's fine to have the tag on there that says edit,
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.320]   because people are going to make just general mistakes.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:37.080]   They're going to say something that comes out totally wrong
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:38.960]   from what they intended on saying,
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.080]   because especially if we're using phones,
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:43.320]   because we all know AutoCorrect just really
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:47.160]   does a great job with the things that we're trying to say.
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:48.640]   Oh, yeah, totally.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.760]   Explodives come out and things like that.
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:51.880]   And you're like, oh, my goodness.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.280]   I really did not need for that to come out.
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:57.040]   Let me go edit this, because AutoCorrect
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.680]   wrecked what I was trying to say.
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:03.320]   Not that I was just trying to get over on somebody
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:06.200]   and go back and hide my tracks, if you will,
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:08.680]   because sometimes people just make mistakes.
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.320]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.520]   That is true.
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:14.120]   But there are people who hide their tracks.
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.280]   There are.
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.440]   Yeah, I know that.
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:19.880]   But it's nice for the people that sometimes
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.240]   just make a general mistake.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:23.720]   They just don't reread their stuff before they pass.
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:25.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:27.560]   You know, hey, welcome to Monday.
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:30.400]   Wait a minute, oh, crap today is Tuesday, Tuesday.
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:31.240]   Let me fix that.
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:32.360]   Welcome to Tuesday.
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.160]   Something as simple as that.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:35.040]   I just spent--
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:38.560]   I just edited through my manuscript
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:41.160]   another full three times, beginning to end,
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:43.320]   before I set in my final line edit.
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:47.120]   And I'll do that over and over and over and over and over again.
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:50.360]   But the idea of rereading one little tweet is too much to do.
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:54.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.280]   Weirdo.
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.760]   That tracks.
[01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:57.260]   Yeah.
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:30:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:03.840]   Yeah, it's always after I hit send that I end up looking and going,
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:04.440]   oh, wait a minute.
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.960]   I think that dang it too late.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.160]   And I suppose for the month, I only really had
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:09.320]   Twitter blue for a month.
[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:11.400]   And it was nice to have that delay thing.
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:14.960]   But then I was like, eh, do I really care that much?
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:18.040]   Like, I'm going to misspell things.
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:18.880]   That's all right.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:19.680]   I'm human.
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:20.680]   Hey, you're only--
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:21.520]   Yeah, huh.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:24.680]   Yeah, still-- yeah, you'll let some things slide as a mistake.
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:27.960]   But when context is totally changed, that's a problem.
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:28.480]   Yes.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:32.760]   And then-- and I know this is a bad joke,
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:36.120]   but there's sometimes when people want to tweet out the F word
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:39.800]   and it comes out the D word instead.
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:42.760]   Sometimes you want to go back and fix that.
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:46.160]   There may be a reason that tweeting that expletive knows.
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:49.080]   But they should have the right to be able to fix that.
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:49.440]   Yeah.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:53.200]   Man, I am just going to start tweeting out, doc.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:56.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:58.200]   Talk to me like, what is going on?
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:59.200]   Doc.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.600]   What the doc?
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:03.200]   I know what they meant.
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:05.720]   I know what that first event.
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:08.120]   They said, doc.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.040]   OK, so I'm opening it up.
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:12.200]   Who wants to pick a story?
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:15.880]   What is the story that you all want to talk about that we have here?
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:19.600]   80T, and Google, and State Farm.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:20.400]   All right.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:23.840]   And that happens to be the next line even.
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:26.400]   No, I figured I'd just make it real easy for you.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:27.400]   Wow.
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.800]   So tell us a little bit about this.
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:33.760]   All right, so August 2020 was a dark time.
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.600]   We were in the midst of the pandemic,
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.960]   and Google invested--
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:40.920]   they purchased 6.6% of 80T.
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:43.000]   And they said, hey, this security company
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.080]   is now going to resell our gear, et cetera, security gear,
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.440]   nest cameras.
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:48.400]   And it was good.
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.560]   And this started happening, and 80T got a boost.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:53.680]   Google didn't really get a bunch of a boost,
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.800]   but it was a good deal for Google,
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:59.840]   just because it gets their stuff in more mainstream homes.
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:05.200]   Now, this month, this week, State Farm said, you know what?
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:09.760]   80T, we're going to make a $1.2 billion investment.
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:13.040]   That's a 15% investment in 80T.
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.440]   And we're going to give you 100--
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:17.640]   no, I think they're giving you $300 million.
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:19.800]   $300 million to play with.
[01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:21.360]   And Google said, yeah, you know what?
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.000]   We like what you're doing for us so far.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.120]   We like the State Farm deal.
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:26.440]   We're going to give you $150 million.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:29.280]   And if you do really well, we'll give you up to $300 million
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:30.560]   to play with.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:34.880]   So this is, to me, a really interesting deal,
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:36.240]   because for the longest time, we've
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:40.080]   been waiting for insurance firms to do more than just say,
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.520]   hey, you got a security system?
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:42.800]   Great.
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:45.400]   We'll give you a 5% discount off your premiums,
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:48.080]   because with the smart home, they can actually
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.640]   do a couple things.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.520]   There's more devices that they can see
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:54.880]   used for tracking things in your home.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.880]   But they can also see if you're actually activating
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.360]   your security system.
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:00.080]   So we're going to start seeing discounts
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:02.840]   that maybe are a little bit more appropriate to the amount
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:04.680]   of gear you have in your home and the fact
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.280]   that you're actually using it.
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.400]   Now, people who get the 5% discount
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.040]   and don't turn on their security system,
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:13.360]   they're probably not going to want to opt in
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:16.800]   to using this particular state farm product.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.200]   They haven't created a product yet,
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:21.160]   but I'm imagining some of the things that might look like.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.920]   So I'm really excited about this.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:26.240]   And it also gives Google--
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:28.520]   everyone's in the insurance company,
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:30.320]   or insurance world, for a long time,
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.840]   it'd been like, man, Google and Apple,
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:35.440]   they could totally team up and offer some sort of insurance
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.840]   based on their understanding of what's
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.640]   happening in people's homes.
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:40.880]   And this seems to be like Google saying,
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:43.560]   you know what, we're not going to do that.
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:47.360]   We're going to leave that to the state farms,
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.600]   the insurance companies of the world.
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.360]   But this gets them in the door talking
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.520]   and understanding the product a little bit better.
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:56.600]   So I think it's a really interesting view.
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:59.040]   That's that.
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:34:59.400]   Nice.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:02.680]   Does it-- I don't know why my mind always goes here.
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:08.680]   But when I think of data sharing with insurance companies,
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:12.240]   I can't help but have a little bit of a red flag kind of reaction
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:12.600]   to it.
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.440]   Is that warranted in a situation like this?
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:22.800]   If they didn't let you opt in, what they're going to do
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.720]   is they're going to offer you presumably--
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.280]   and again, this is theoretical.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:27.680]   This is presumably.
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:30.600]   But if you opt into a program like this,
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:34.440]   you might pay less because you activate your security
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:36.520]   system religiously.
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:40.440]   Right?
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:43.480]   Because you're probably going to be at less risk
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:44.520]   as they're thinking.
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:45.920]   And so you'll also--
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:52.280]   you don't have to act.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.240]   If you have to activate it, that seems--
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:57.040]   if you could only get insurance if you install Google products,
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:58.480]   that becomes a problem.
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.360]   But you can still buy--
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:05.560]   there's auto insurance that you get discounts based
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.080]   on your driving.
[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:08.160]   Those are opt in.
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:11.200]   And people who drive really well really--
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:15.520]   I would never buy that as an insurance product
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:19.800]   because I drive really fast and kind of aggressively.
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:21.240]   So I'm not a good candidate.
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.000]   That's awesome.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.600]   You have driving gloves and everything.
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.760]   You're just like, let's go.
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:31.760]   I was figuring grandma's piece down the road just exactly 10
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:32.760]   June 4 here.
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:33.760]   Exactly.
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:36.160]   Really?
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:37.520]   No, no, no.
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:40.040]   I was like, I even drove in the car
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:42.160]   because you wanted insane mode.
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:42.640]   Yes.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:43.400]   I did.
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.080]   I wanted rapid acceleration.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:46.600]   So when I pull out from--
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:49.560]   I know, ludicrous speed.
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:51.760]   Anyway, the point is--
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:54.960]   so I think if--
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:57.480]   I think it's probably good for insurance companies.
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:59.720]   It also brings the price of things
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.840]   like water monitoring stuff, which
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:05.640]   is hugely valuable, but is also super expensive.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:08.680]   It could end up bringing the price of some of those products
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:12.280]   down to a point where more homes could have them installed.
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:14.720]   And that would be good.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:19.040]   So I don't think this is super nefarious just yet.
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:22.240]   I will say in the insurance, like the health insurance world,
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:24.360]   if they're paying for a CPAP machine,
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:26.960]   they are actually making sure that you're using it.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:29.280]   And some people don't like the health insurance companies
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:32.320]   are getting data on the compliance.
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.080]   And that's actually not opt-in, which
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.520]   makes it a little dodger.
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:36.520]   Right.
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:38.240]   But in this case, it doesn't--
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.120]   One is opt-in.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:40.200]   --does not bother me.
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:41.640]   You have the choice.
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:43.480]   It's in your hands to decide whether you
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:46.680]   want to go that route or not until we see a reason.
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:49.280]   Now, if they look at your teenage kid,
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.880]   they see them on the camera sneaking out,
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:52.680]   and they're like, yeah, we're not going to ensure that.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:53.000]   Right.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.280]   So that's a little--
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.400]   you wouldn't want them seeing what
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.480]   was going on in your house, necessarily,
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:01.480]   even if it was terrible behavior,
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:03.280]   if you like to light fires in your living room,
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:04.920]   like on the carpet.
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:05.560]   It's a hobby.
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.560]   It's a hobby.
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:07.760]   It's a hobby.
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:08.760]   Like, to live on the edge.
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:09.480]   I'm really good at doing that.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:11.760]   I wouldn't want them seeing that.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:15.600]   But seeing like, oh, do you turn your cameras on at night?
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:16.640]   Or when you leave the house?
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:19.000]   Right.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.520]   Good, good best practices that actually help
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:25.520]   their bottom line and yours and your safety and everything.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:26.560]   So, OK.
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:27.160]   Cool.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:30.040]   I can get behind that.
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:32.440]   What you got, Jeff?
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:33.800]   Anything on this list that you--
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:35.800]   Well, I still got to get my head out
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:38.120]   of the idea of the air conditioned garage.
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:40.640]   I'm still thinking Leo with you.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:43.120]   We'd be looking up--
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:45.360]   I envision you coddling your car.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:45.920]   Good night, honey.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:46.920]   You would be like a new BTU.
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:47.920]   You would be like a new BTU.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:49.280]   I'd be like a new BTU.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.160]   Leo and I would be looking up an old show called
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:54.760]   "My Mother of the Car," which guy's mother,
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:57.680]   got him coordinated as his car, which
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:00.240]   would be reason to put it in the air conditioned garage.
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:02.640]   But I go off on a tangent.
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.200]   That didn't happen, Jeff.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:04.640]   I'm just--
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.200]   OK.
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:09.080]   Go ahead and dispel any myths or rumors right now.
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:10.840]   "My Mother is not a car."
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:14.240]   And actually, our garage does not even fit a car anymore.
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:15.680]   It is completely converted.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:16.200]   OK.
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:17.240]   I just want to make this thing.
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:18.440]   Get my head around this.
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.560]   I imagine the Howell family.
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:23.000]   Dad won't let us get air conditioned, but the car--
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:23.960]   That's it.
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:24.760]   It's Toyota.
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:26.560]   He's born to him, to us.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.560]   All right.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.560]   Sorry.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.840]   I'll leave this now.
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.720]   So there's a thread I put up, which is long thread.
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:36.880]   At least it's not a long essay, people, from V for Vendetta,
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:41.240]   G. Von Joy, about Hollywood.
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:43.080]   And I didn't know some of this.
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:44.680]   And I knew that there was--
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:48.480]   used to be that studios would make the shows
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:51.560]   and distribute the shows and own the distribution channel.
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:52.920]   They'd own the theaters.
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:57.000]   And if Paramount owned the movie theaters,
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.480]   then if you want to get into my movie theaters, screw you.
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:00.600]   You're going to pay through the nose,
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.440]   because I'm only putting my movies in there.
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:07.520]   And that was happening until 1948, which there was a big case
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:10.480]   in the Supreme Court leading to the Paramount Accords.
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:12.520]   They said, OK, OK, we won't do that.
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:17.400]   And after there was antitrust, and after that occurred,
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:22.640]   there was a huge amount of growth that occurred.
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:25.120]   An increase in the number of independent movie theaters
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:26.640]   in the '50s, '60s, and '70s.
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:29.120]   An increase in the number of independent producers and studios.
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:31.280]   I'm reading for part of the thread here.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:35.160]   The beginning of the end of the old Hollywood studio system.
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:38.080]   And the weakening, by the way, of the Hayes production code,
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:43.440]   which was a get the smart off the screen thing.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.320]   So all this was going on, and it was fine.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:48.920]   And everybody was going along fine in Hollywood with us.
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:52.640]   And then in 2019, there was a case.
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:57.560]   And 2020 Supreme Court enabled a sun setting of the law,
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:01.520]   which according to this thread ended last month.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:03.400]   It was a two-year sun setting.
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:09.320]   So August 2022, the Paramount Accords went away.
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.280]   And so now what you see happening
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:14.920]   is that the various new studios, whether they
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:18.480]   have old names or not, so Disney or Discovery
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:26.840]   now owning Warner Brothers, or Who Did Amazon Buy?
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:27.840]   You know.
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:29.600]   Fair enough.
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:30.840]   What?
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:31.640]   MGM.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:32.160]   MGM?
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:34.200]   MGM, thank you.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:37.440]   And so what you're seeing, I think
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:39.680]   what we're seeing is the nascent beginnings here
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:44.160]   of the old studio system, where Disney can make the show
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:46.240]   and then they distribute the show
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:48.280]   and they own the distribution channel
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:51.440]   in the form of Disney Plus.
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:54.240]   And Warner Brothers has its with Discovery,
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:55.920]   which is a ridiculous structure.
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:57.520]   Amazon will have its.
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:00.400]   And we end up in this world where nobody will distribute
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:02.560]   anybody else, and we're in the position
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:05.960]   where you choose to go to the Disney Plex,
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:10.800]   or you go to the Warner Plex, or you go to the MGM Plex.
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:14.960]   And we get stuck with their bundles of what they choose
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:17.960]   to show us, which is basically where we're headed right now.
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:20.840]   And as the thread says, you're basically
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:23.360]   in a world where eight people own Hollywood,
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.320]   and Disney owns half of it having bought Fox.
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:31.960]   And again, Amazon having bought MGM.
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:35.400]   So I found it really interesting to think through where
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:36.240]   that is.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:41.080]   And as she says, it seemed to make sense at the time
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:45.160]   to get rid of the-- she's been a little bit sarcastic--
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:46.600]   to get rid of the Paramount Accords,
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:49.920]   because hey, all the studios that were in the original law,
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:53.360]   so don't even exist anymore, and movie theaters who cares.
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:58.080]   But the principle that was behind that antitrust action
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:02.080]   sunsetting leaves us vulnerable now to, I think,
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:06.440]   to my mind, a kind of bad era for entertainment.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:08.120]   And finally, I think I mentioned earlier--
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:09.640]   no, I mentioned this in class today.
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:11.360]   Sorry.
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.800]   NBC is rumored to be considering giving up
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:17.080]   its 10 o'clock hour to local stations,
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.960]   because, eh, prime time is worthless now.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:22.240]   Broadcast is worthless now.
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:25.360]   And so it's a really interesting time
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:29.480]   where the big guys are going to try to monopolize entertainment.
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:32.120]   But we have TikTok.
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:33.840]   We have YouTube.
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.920]   We have podcasts.
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.080]   We have this show.
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.200]   We have all kinds of other entertainment.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:42.080]   And what's going to happen in that new melange?
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:42.560]   I don't know.
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.640]   So sorry I turned that into a soliloquy here,
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:47.720]   but I find it absolutely fascinating to imagine
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:51.240]   what's going to happen to online entertainment.
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:55.320]   And go back and see previous discussion of Apple and phones
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:56.880]   and advertising.
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:58.160]   It's going to be really interesting
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:00.360]   to see how this works out here.
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.000]   So that was my little moment.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:02.920]   Thank you.
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:05.760]   This is why Leo tries to avoid democracy,
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:07.400]   so I don't go off in a soliloquy.
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:09.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.920]   No, I think it's valid.
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.240]   And I'm reading through this thread.
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:13.880]   It's a really great thread.
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:20.960]   She points out at one point that the original decision actually
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:23.200]   ultimately increased the number of independent movie
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:24.440]   theaters.
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:28.040]   And now we're seeing kind of in this current era
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:31.400]   that we're in this collapse of movie theaters
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.200]   filing for bankruptcy.
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.080]   What's the latest part?
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:35.520]   Well, part of that's like the pandemic.
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:36.680]   I mean, nobody--
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:37.680]   For sure.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:38.680]   I mean, that's--
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:40.280]   Well, it will only suck these days.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:41.680]   That certainly plays into--
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:43.960]   That's not true.
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:46.680]   I don't-- I mean, not all movies suck.
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.400]   There's still some movies out there.
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:49.960]   No, no, no.
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:54.320]   I don't think-- I mean, having found it in a human weekly,
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:57.800]   I just don't think there'd be the same kind of coverage now
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:00.920]   that there was 30 years ago.
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:03.320]   There are some good movies, but I think it's less.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:06.600]   I think TV became-- there was a time when TV became better
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.600]   than movies.
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.600]   OK, yeah, I'll buy it.
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:11.600]   Up to you in a piece of Plano's.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:12.600]   And then--
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.600]   Go for that for $1.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:14.600]   He's going down.
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:15.600]   What?
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.600]   I said I'll buy that for $1.
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:18.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.600]   Oh, geez, that sounds like your grandma.
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:21.600]   Wow.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:22.600]   I'm borrowing that for $1.
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:23.600]   I think it's-- yeah, my mom.
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:24.600]   Yeah, OK.
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:25.600]   I'll buy that for $1.
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:26.600]   All right.
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:28.600]   Or $0.50 if it was my grandma.
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.600]   Or a penny.
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:32.600]   A shiny penny.
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:34.600]   A shiny-- a wooden nickel.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.600]   That is interesting, though.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:39.600]   So that's fun.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:43.600]   I really hope that theaters don't completely go away.
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:45.600]   But then I'm also thinking like when is the last time I went
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:47.600]   to the movie theater watch a movie?
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.600]   I don't even know.
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:49.600]   I can't be in the summer to go to--
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:52.600]   No, I have no desire to go to theaters.
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:57.600]   I think I've said before, I've only gone to see whatever the
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:00.600]   newest Star Wars was, and I went to see "Black Panther"
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:01.600]   because of "Chat."
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:06.600]   Because in my opinion, the movie going to experience is just--
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:11.600]   it can't beat being on my couch on a nice clear screen with
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.600]   decent sound and this dark, and there's no interruptions and
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:19.600]   people talking on phones or babies crying or sneezing and
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.600]   sniffling happening all around me.
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:22.600]   Get off my lawn!
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:23.600]   Yeah, I mean--
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:26.600]   And if it's a three hour movie, you can pause it and go to
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:27.600]   the bathroom.
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:29.600]   Yeah, there's that.
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:31.600]   Didn't there's that, but I didn't see top corner.
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:33.600]   The top corner is nowhere near as good.
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:34.600]   Well, so that's the way we--
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:36.600]   My popcorn's better, dude.
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:37.600]   Mine is better.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:38.600]   I throw it in a pot.
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:40.600]   It makes the popcorn.
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:42.600]   I don't do that instant crap.
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:44.600]   I like the popcorn.
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.600]   I'm going to go with Jason here for a second, but I'm going to
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:48.600]   burst his bubble or his popcorn.
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:53.600]   So I too miss popcorn, right?
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.600]   And I don't go to the theaters because I don't want to get
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:58.600]   COVID, but I still miss the popcorn.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:01.600]   So about a year and three quarters into the pandemic, I
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:02.600]   said screw it.
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:04.600]   I'm not going to go see a movie, but I'm going to go to the
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:05.600]   theater.
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.600]   I'm going to buy a small popcorn and eat it in the car like a
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:08.600]   sick f.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.600]   Oh, I bet it was so good.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:11.600]   A sick duck.
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.600]   No, it was terrible.
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:14.600]   Sick.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:15.600]   It was awful.
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.600]   It was kind of oily and rancid.
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:18.600]   It was awful.
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:19.600]   And so I was missing it so much.
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:21.600]   I didn't miss it anymore.
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:22.600]   Oh, okay.
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:24.600]   Maybe the lacked context, though.
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:27.600]   Like you were sitting in your car eating theater popcorn.
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:32.600]   That is a sad image right there.
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:36.600]   My dad used to send us to go get popcorn for him from the
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:37.600]   theater.
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:38.600]   Really?
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:40.600]   That was a regular request.
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:44.600]   Queen Pruitt, she had her moments like that from time to time,
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:47.600]   but there's nothing like just getting the counters yourself
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:50.600]   and throwing them in a pot and just shaking the bag on pot on
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:52.600]   your stove and popping them right there.
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:53.600]   Butter.
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:54.600]   Ant butter.
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:56.600]   What's your butter stance?
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:57.600]   Butter.
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:58.600]   Salt.
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:47:59.600]   Yes.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.600]   All of the above.
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:02.600]   Yes.
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:03.600]   Yes.
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:04.600]   There's one word.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:06.600]   And I did go see Top Gun in the theater because my good friend.
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.600]   See, that's the one that I really wanted this summer to see and I still
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:09.600]   have not seen it.
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.600]   I have not seen it.
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:14.600]   I did go see it only because my good friend that's in film,
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:18.600]   you know, she recommended it and I said, "All right, I'll go do it."
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:19.600]   And I really enjoyed it.
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:24.600]   But I went when there was damn there nobody in the theater because I
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:25.600]   didn't want to be bothered with people.
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:27.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:33.600]   Well, in our year, like, we don't have now any like normal,
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:36.600]   like we don't have any of the fancy theaters with like the
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:38.600]   recliners and the food and stuff.
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:43.600]   And my child, very spoiled, will not go sit in a normal theater
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:44.600]   anymore.
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:45.600]   It's got to be the final one.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.600]   Absolutely the piece where the seats are like three times.
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:51.600]   I just got in so much better, you know.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:55.600]   I kind of get it because I'm like, when I'm crammed into those seats,
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:59.600]   again, for like three hours, I'm like, "Okay, yeah, this movie is not
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:02.600]   transporting me enough to make it worth my while I'll sit here for
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:03.600]   this long."
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:04.600]   Yeah, right.
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:07.600]   Yeah, the theater here in Petaluma, I don't know how many years
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:10.600]   ago at this point, but got converted to the big recliner
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:14.600]   style, you know, totally cut down on the amount of seats in the
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:15.600]   theater.
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:16.600]   That's not a bad thing.
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:20.600]   When we decided we were done with the theaters, this was several
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:24.600]   years ago, and I think it was Atlantis was the movie because
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.600]   we all went as a family so the kids could see it.
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:33.600]   And there was a kid behind us that was every two seconds just
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.600]   doing that.
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:41.600]   Okay, so Queen Pruitt, being a mother, reaches into a purse and
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.600]   grabs a tissue.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:48.600]   And she politely reaches back to the mother behind us,
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:51.600]   and hands the mother to tissue, she's like, "Here you go, hope
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:53.600]   they help you out."
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:56.600]   And mom took the tissue and blew her own damn nose, didn't even
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:02.600]   give it to the child, so we listened for another hour and
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:06.600]   been back to the movie theater since, you know, because it's so
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:08.600]   much better at home.
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:09.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:11.600]   So, and I'm going to agree with you.
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:15.600]   So my mother made my sister and me, and I in turn pass us on to
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:19.600]   the children, an absolute obsession about heating open
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:21.600]   mouth chewing.
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.600]   Yeah, there's that too.
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:24.600]   I can't stand it.
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:27.600]   So now that it's one matter if you've got popcorn, but now when
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:29.600]   they're practically serving you a steak dinner in the theater.
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.600]   Yeah, no kidding, right?
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:37.600]   You know, it's the smell and the interruption and the chewing
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:40.600]   and no, no.
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.600]   Yes.
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:45.600]   The movie is just not good.
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:46.600]   That's what we do.
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:47.600]   This is the show.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:49.600]   Yeah, waiting for this, right?
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:50.600]   Yeah.
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:55.600]   It's like the twig crew complains about movies.
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:56.600]   I love it.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:59.600]   I used to work in a movie theater, so I would be behind, at one
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:02.600]   point, behind the concession stand, right?
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:04.600]   That's where you start, of course, when you start working in
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:06.600]   a movie theater and making the popcorn.
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:10.600]   And I realized just how much of that oil goes into the
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:11.600]   canister.
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:14.600]   And of course, this was back in like '93, so I don't know how
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:16.600]   different it is now.
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:19.600]   But I mean, it was, I mean, when you really see what they're
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:22.600]   putting into the canister, what we were then, I mean, it was
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:23.600]   buttery-scented oil.
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:24.600]   That's really what it was.
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:25.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:26.600]   It's not butter.
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:27.600]   Yeah.
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:28.600]   It's buttery-scented oil.
[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:31.600]   And I mean, you put so much in that, and the popcorn came out
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:35.600]   and, you know, fully salted, nuclear yellow, like it looked
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:40.600]   like a pretty elastic nuclear.
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:41.600]   That was how I made the popcorn back then.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:44.600]   I wouldn't make it like that now, but it was nice to have the
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:45.600]   control.
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:47.600]   But once you've seen that, it's kind of like, oh, it takes a
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.600]   little bit of the mystery away.
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:50.600]   It's like, I don't know.
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:51.600]   This is how the sauce is made.
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:52.600]   The oldest is going away.
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:54.600]   It's going away, right?
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:59.600]   The essence of it, you know, mass media, watch out here.
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:01.600]   We're back to mass media.
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:02.600]   Here comes.
[01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:03.600]   Here comes.
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:04.600]   I'm not going back to Gutenberg.
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:06.600]   I'm just going to say, where's Gutenberg and all this?
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:07.600]   I'm just going to go to mass media.
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:11.600]   So it really was steam-powered presses and all that, and the
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:12.600]   model.
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:15.600]   And you're considered just radio, right?
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:16.600]   Broadcast.
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:18.600]   We've basically gone through a century of broadcast, and it's
[01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:19.600]   over.
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:20.600]   It's gone.
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:21.600]   It's meaningless now.
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:22.600]   It's crap on prime time.
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:24.600]   It's radio in the United States.
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:25.600]   Somebody's listening to radio.
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:27.600]   They're listening to the podcast like this one.
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:28.600]   Thank you very much.
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:29.600]   Right.
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:30.600]   And movie theaters.
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:35.600]   Well, yes, because you're a feat.
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:36.600]   A feat.
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:39.600]   A two-feet, Jeff.
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:40.600]   Two feet.
[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:41.600]   Two of them.
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:44.600]   You just can't see them because this is a podcast.
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:45.600]   Yeah.
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:49.600]   I listened to a little bit of radio.
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:53.600]   Actually, a couple of weeks ago, this is so off topic, but a
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:57.600]   couple of weeks ago, I was away for a few days, and I went to
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:03.600]   a cabin a couple hours away, and the radio in the cabin was tuned
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:08.600]   to a local radio station that played nothing but like 60s and
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:12.600]   70s kind of rock, roots stuff.
[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:15.600]   Some of the music that I love and some of it that I'm kind of
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:17.600]   like, okay, I could take or leave it.
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:22.600]   But what I loved about it, I experienced what kind of older
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:28.600]   school radio was because they had the single announcer that you
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:32.600]   know, was just like sitting there in a dark radio station,
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:35.600]   totally curating the playlist, talking about why this song is
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:36.600]   so cool.
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:40.600]   I remember back then when I went to this concert, blah, blah, blah,
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:42.600]   you know, kind of spinning stories up around the music.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:44.600]   And, you know, it was just one of those moments like it, for a
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:47.600]   couple of days, I was listening to this radio station and just
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:51.600]   like, man, I wish we had more of that, but we don't anymore.
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:54.600]   And what we do have on radio is highly programmed by a computer
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:57.600]   and then you have a little color commentary in between, but
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:58.600]   it's just not the same.
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:00.600]   It was a really awesome--
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:02.600]   >> You could hear the licensing rights.
[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:05.600]   You could do that for a podcast, you know?
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:07.600]   The problem there is the song licenses.
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:09.600]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:10.600]   >> It was--
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:12.600]   >> Well, TikTok solves that, right?
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:14.600]   >> Well, I'm just thinking, like, because there is a question
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:18.600]   about licensing for the new-- like, for the new streaming
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:21.600]   and the new way we consume content in our IP laws really
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:23.600]   haven't adapted or changed for that.
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:26.600]   But, wow, what are we talking about?
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:28.600]   >> Well, no, that's a good point.
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:31.600]   >> So I'm looking up at it, I'm like, how do we get you?
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:33.600]   >> Yes, that's a good point.
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.600]   You could do that on TikTok.
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:36.600]   You just--
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:37.600]   >> Do it three minutes.
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:41.600]   >> Put the camera for yourself, let it play and--
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:44.600]   yeah, and you give your commentary because you can adjust
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:47.600]   the volume and stuff inside of the TikTok video.
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:48.600]   >> It's your new radio station.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:49.600]   It's Aunt Ray Allen.
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:50.600]   >> Do you do?
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:51.600]   >> Pretty slick idea.
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:54.600]   >> Questlove does these things where he goes on little
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:59.600]   Twitter threads about, like, his ideal DJ party playlists
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:03.600]   or his ideal playlists for X thing, and then he--
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:06.600]   somewhat-- he doesn't do it, but someone always goes and takes
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:10.600]   that thread and then pulls the songs into a Spotify playlist,
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:13.600]   which is kind of a janky way to have to do it.
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:16.600]   But it is really cool because then you get, like,
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:21.600]   arguably a wonderful DJ and musician explaining, like,
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:24.600]   why he loves this song, why he plays this song next,
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:26.600]   what his goal is, when it's, you know, for what it--
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:29.600]   like, if it's a "get your lover" as a playlist,
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:31.600]   it's really awesome.
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:32.600]   >> Yeah.
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:35.600]   >> But I would pay to have Questlove do a podcast where he
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:37.600]   kind of does 10 songs, you know?
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:39.600]   But he can't do that.
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:43.600]   I don't-- I mean, licensing all that music would be crazy.
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:44.600]   >> Yeah.
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:45.600]   >> Yeah.
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:47.600]   It was nice, though, it was a nice experience.
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:49.600]   And I think folks in chat have figured out the radio station
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:52.600]   that I'm talking about, Declare mentioned,
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:53.600]   K-O-Z-T in Mendocino.
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:57.600]   So if there is some sort of, like, online broadcast,
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:00.600]   rebroadcasting of that radio station, check it out.
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:01.600]   >> Well, you can do it most--
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:02.600]   any radio station.
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:03.600]   >> Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:05.600]   So I'm sure you can find it and you can see exactly
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:06.600]   what I'm talking about.
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:09.600]   There was something very just kind of, like, soothing about
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:12.600]   listening to us, like, I might not like every song that you're
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:13.600]   playing, but I love that.
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:14.600]   >> I love the experience.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:18.600]   It really just took me back to when radio was like that, you know?
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:20.600]   Just isn't anymore.
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:21.600]   >> K-O-T-Z, listen.
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:24.600]   >> K-O-Z-D.com/listen-now.
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:26.600]   >> There you go.
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:27.600]   >> Yeah.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:29.600]   >> Check it out for yourself.
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.600]   And then, Anne, I don't want to leave you out of this democracy.
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:36.600]   Is there a story before we get to the change log that you want
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:38.600]   to make sure we talk about?
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:42.600]   >> The only thing that came to my mind was from Adobe.
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:44.600]   And this comes from Petapixel.
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:45.600]   What line is this?
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:46.600]   I didn't say what line.
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:47.600]   >> Line 100.
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:48.600]   >> 100.
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:49.600]   Easy to remember.
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:51.600]   >> Line 100.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:54.600]   And this was more of a, like, a "why"?
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:55.600]   Like, why?
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:56.600]   Why is this?
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:00.600]   But Adobe is launching a camera app for, quote, serious photographers.
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:05.600]   And we all are familiar with Mr. Mark LeVoy and his history
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:09.600]   with computational photography, especially back with the
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:11.600]   pixel days and so forth.
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:13.600]   Well, he's now Adobe.
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:18.600]   And Adobe is pretty popular with their AI as well.
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:22.600]   And when I saw the headline and it said, "For serious photographers,"
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:26.600]   I'm like, "Why would this even be considered?"
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:29.600]   Because when people are shooting with their phones,
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:32.600]   the AI really takes a lot of the thought out of it.
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:36.600]   You don't necessarily have to think about shutter speed and ISO
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:39.600]   and stuff like that unless you really, really want to.
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:43.600]   And even if you really, really want to, you tend to go back and
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:47.600]   just say, "Let me just hit the shutter by the fault because
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:48.600]   it's going to look good."
[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:50.600]   It just flat out works now.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:53.600]   And I just thought it was interesting, like, "Why Adobe?
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:54.600]   What's the point of this?"
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:56.600]   And I'm an Adobe fan.
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:58.600]   But I don't know why.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:02.600]   I'm curious to see what's going to happen not over because Adobe Max
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:03.600]   is coming up.
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:06.600]   I'm sure this will be part of the discussion then.
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:13.600]   And is this a control app then?
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:14.600]   Right.
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:17.600]   That's just what I'm saying.
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:21.600]   They have an app called Lightroom Mobile.
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:23.600]   I'm sure you all know about that.
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:26.600]   Inside of Lightroom Mobile, there is a camera functionality that
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:29.600]   allows you to do things like long exposures where you can change
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:33.600]   the shutter speed to be a lot slower or change it to be faster
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:36.600]   and really have some manual controls just like you would if
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:38.600]   you picked up a camera body.
[01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:40.600]   And it's okay.
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:43.600]   Using the phone's camera though, I guess is what I'm trying to
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:44.600]   do.
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:45.600]   Right.
[01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:47.600]   Using the phone's camera to try to simulate controlling...
[01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:48.600]   I understand.
[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:51.600]   You're not necessarily changing the aperture because
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:53.600]   aperture is a fixed on smartphones.
[01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:57.600]   But you can simulate an aperture change as far as how much
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:59.600]   light you're letting in on these things.
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:04.600]   That's fine.
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:08.600]   But again, I think a lot of that is already handled in the AI
[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:09.600]   today.
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:11.600]   Maybe four years ago, yeah, that's pretty cool.
[01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:12.600]   You got so much more control.
[01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:15.600]   But now the AI is so smart.
[01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:18.600]   And it could figure out your scenario and it's already taken
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:21.600]   a gazillion pictures before you even hit the shutter.
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:22.600]   Right.
[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:25.600]   What's the point of this?
[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:26.600]   I don't know.
[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:29.600]   I'm just curious to see what else they're going to say in
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:30.600]   October.
[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:32.600]   I hope to go to Adobe Max.
[01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:33.600]   They gave me a ticket.
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:35.600]   I just can't quite afford the dad gum hotel stand there.
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:36.600]   Good lord.
[01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:38.600]   Where is it being held?
[01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:39.600]   It's in LA.
[01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:40.600]   LA.
[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:44.600]   Can you find like an Airbnb or something?
[01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:46.600]   I've been looking.
[01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:47.600]   It's quite pricey.
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:49.600]   It's been quite pricey.
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:50.600]   But yeah, I've been looking.
[01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:51.600]   And everybody tells tonight.
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:54.600]   I mean, I had to stay in the city in Manhattan for...
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:57.600]   I was doing a conference on Monday and Tuesday with a dinner
[01:59:57.600 --> 01:59:58.600]   in between.
[01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:00.600]   I just didn't want to drive all the way home.
[02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:01.600]   So what the hell?
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:05.600]   And you know, New York, you could pay for $500 for a hotel
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:06.600]   room easily.
[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:07.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:10.600]   And I got this place right across the street, Nice Hotel AC 200
[02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:12.600]   bucks, which in New York is amazing.
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:13.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:14.600]   Nice.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:16.600]   But that's all you say to hotels tonight?
[02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:18.600]   What tells tonight is the app.
[02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:21.600]   You can't do it very far in advance and you're betting whether
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:22.600]   or not it's going to work.
[02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:23.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:24.600]   But it has good...
[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:26.600]   Well, and I'm fine with the last minute stuff like that.
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:28.600]   I've used last minute services like that.
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:29.600]   It didn't work that well.
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:31.600]   But maybe I'll give that a look.
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:32.600]   You want your there, yeah.
[02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:34.600]   It's your people.
[02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:35.600]   It's your things.
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:36.600]   It's your stuff.
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:37.600]   It's your people.
[02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:39.600]   It's your pick-it-head in the chat room says, "Send Uncle Leo to
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:40.600]   Bill."
[02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:41.600]   No, I'm not going to do that.
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:45.600]   If I had a garage there, I'd let you sleep in it.
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:46.600]   But...
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:50.600]   At a squishmallow with your name on it.
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:54.600]   Any number of squishmallows, actually.
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:58.600]   My daughter is quite obsessed, to be honest.
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:00:59.600]   They are squishy.
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:00.600]   They are.
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:01.600]   They're very comfortable.
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:03.600]   And assorted sizes, too.
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:05.600]   Should we do the change log?
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:06.600]   Man, there's a lot in the change log.
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:08.600]   I don't know that we're going to do all of these.
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:10.600]   But let's jump in and do the change log.
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:11.600]   Sound the horns.
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:16.600]   The Google change log.
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:18.600]   So I did the thing where I, like,
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:20.600]   hold a bunch of stuff and threw it in there.
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:23.600]   But I never actually, like, pulled the information out.
[02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:24.600]   So this should be interesting.
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:27.600]   You could be relying on some headlines here.
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:33.600]   YouTube TV, apparently adding 5.1 audio for Apple TV.
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:37.600]   So I don't know how much content on YouTube TV is actually
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:40.600]   created with 5.1 in mind.
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:43.600]   I mean, I honestly don't know.
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:44.600]   But there you go.
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:47.600]   If you've got an Apple TV and you've got a nice 5.1
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:51.600]   sound system at home, you'll be able to watch it with your
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:52.600]   Apple TV.
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:54.600]   Some Google TV sound stuff.
[02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:55.600]   5.1.
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:56.600]   There you go.
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:59.600]   Oh, Google Hangouts.
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:04.600]   So the long drug out, dragged out, whatever you want to say,
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:08.600]   marched to the death of Google Hangouts, continues.
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:12.600]   You can download any of your Hangouts history.
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:16.600]   If you wish to do so, all of your year's worth of conversations
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:20.600]   that might be hiding in your Hangouts history via Google
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:24.600]   Takeout, which is always just a bucket of fun, let me tell you,
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:26.600]   to download anything from Google Takeout.
[02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:30.600]   I'm happy it exists, but holy cow, sometimes it's a real pain
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:31.600]   in the butt.
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:33.600]   It's going to be there until January 1st.
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:36.600]   So if you want to do this, now's the time.
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:38.600]   Get in there, download your history.
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:40.600]   I'm like, what are you going to do with that history?
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:42.600]   Like, I, like, I made it.
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:43.600]   Let it go.
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:44.600]   Yeah, just let it go.
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:47.600]   Are you really going to search for that message from 10 years ago?
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:48.600]   You said you were going to--
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:50.600]   I'm just going to go on Google and still talking about this
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:52.600]   DAGGUM service, man.
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:55.600]   Just how about Google just let it go, giving us all--
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:58.600]   It's a good life, and it's hard to let it die.
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:02:59.600]   They just--
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:02.600]   They want people to feel like they got ample preparation for the end.
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:04.600]   There are people who are going to--
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:05.600]   They're going to want to have it.
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:08.600]   I mean, the digital clutter--
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:11.600]   I don't think too does DAGGUM that.
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:13.600]   Yeah, let it go.
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:17.600]   I do not have the need to back up my messages.
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:22.600]   Although I am the person that doesn't trash emails.
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:23.600]   I just archive everything.
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:24.600]   I trash emails.
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:25.600]   I trash everything.
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:26.600]   Really?
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:27.600]   I don't.
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:28.600]   This is smart.
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:31.600]   I trash-- I trash them, but I also archive a lot too.
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:34.600]   Archive nothing.
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:36.600]   I don't know why, but everyone's--
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:38.600]   I know why I do because I've had to go back.
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:41.600]   If you're going to archive it, you should just--
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:45.600]   If it's important enough to archive, then it's important enough to print out and stick
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:47.600]   in a binder for whatever year.
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:48.600]   Oh, my God.
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:49.600]   Is that it?
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:50.600]   I'm serious.
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:53.600]   People are like, what if I were to go back and read my letters to my high school boyfriend?
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:55.600]   I'm like, then print them out.
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:57.600]   I got to tell you, you're correct on that.
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:02.600]   I don't print them out, but I put that email in multiple places because there's been times
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:05.600]   when I've needed it to print it out later on.
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:06.600]   Yeah.
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:09.600]   I mean, but Google search is so good that if I really need time--
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:10.600]   No, it ain't.
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:13.600]   I can usually find it.
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:17.600]   Man, searching Gmail is a pain in the--
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:18.600]   It can't be.
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:19.600]   So much junk people have said us.
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:20.600]   Oh, gosh.
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:21.600]   It is so bad.
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:25.600]   You put in so many different qualifiers to try to narrow down.
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:26.600]   Your tenure is later.
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:28.600]   You're like, who was that person?
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:32.600]   We were talking about-- was it Samsung televisions?
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:35.600]   Was it-- you know, when you start searching things and you're like, oh, crap.
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:36.600]   Oh, boy.
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:38.600]   I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to find this thing.
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:39.600]   Yeah.
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:45.600]   And especially on mobile, trying to search your mail through the Gmail app is pointless.
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:47.600]   You can't do it.
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:53.600]   I have a shelf filled with my paper notebooks for the past, which is ridiculous because
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:55.600]   my handwriting is so awful I can't read it.
[02:04:55.600 --> 02:04:57.600]   You can't read any of it.
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:04:59.600]   I throw everything away.
[02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:01.600]   And I threw a whole bunch on the notebook.
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:05.600]   But then I went through and I found the notebook that was the original notebook of the original
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:08.600]   ideas for entertainment weekly and the design and stuff.
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:09.600]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:11.600]   Don't throw that away.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:12.600]   Yeah.
[02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:13.600]   Throw it away.
[02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:14.600]   See?
[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:15.600]   Give it to a museum.
[02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:16.600]   Hard.
[02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:19.600]   If nobody else wants to see it, see if someone throws-- if no one wants to check it.
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:20.600]   Hard-hearted.
[02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:21.600]   He can throw it away.
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:22.600]   That's an important part of it.
[02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:23.600]   It was fascinating.
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:27.600]   She's on both ends of the spectrum, essentially, because about two weeks ago she was telling
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:30.600]   us we need to put stuff in a safe.
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:31.600]   You do.
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:33.600]   I mean, like, your birth certificate.
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:37.600]   The really, really, really important things.
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:42.960]   Like, you know, your passport-- I just had to get my driver's license for the fancy new
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:46.600]   if you want to fly after May 30th or whatever driver's license.
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:49.080]   And I had to bring in my birth certificate.
[02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:55.200]   I had to bring in my social security card, my passport, like letters from my maiden aunt
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:56.200]   from the 1800s.
[02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:59.000]   I mean, it was just ridiculous.
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.600]   The last bit was not true.
[02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:01.600]   But yeah.
[02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:02.600]   But basically.
[02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:15.520]   Google Maps now has some eco-friendly features for navigating to find gas or to find kind
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:17.560]   of charging stations.
[02:06:17.560 --> 02:06:21.400]   You can tell maps, actually, what kind of a vehicle you have.
[02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:26.520]   And it will help you navigate to the places that you need to, keeping in mind how to keep
[02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:29.120]   things fuel efficient, that sort of thing.
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:31.960]   So that's kind of neat.
[02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:37.200]   I got launched in the US and Canada last year to highlight those routes with less energy.
[02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:38.840]   And this is kind of an extension of that.
[02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:40.800]   So I'm sure you've already seen that in the maps.
[02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:45.840]   And we've not seen any moral panic about this, telling it what type of car you're going to
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:46.840]   have.
[02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:47.840]   We're going to freak out.
[02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:48.840]   Oh, no.
[02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:49.840]   I don't want to tell Google.
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:50.840]   Kind of cool.
[02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:53.880]   Why should Google know that I'm driving a gas-powered vehicle?
[02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:56.280]   You don't have to tell it.
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:57.720]   Yeah, that's true.
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:06:58.720]   You don't.
[02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:01.760]   It's in the privacy of my garage, my air-conditioned garage.
[02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:05.760]   I should really stop calling it a garage.
[02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:08.560]   I think it's my, what I've learned today.
[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:09.560]   It's not really fun.
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:11.760]   The moral of this show is don't call it a garage.
[02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:16.800]   If I've learned anything today, it's that.
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:21.240]   I had to stop myself from trying to interrupt the commercial to say, "Whoa, wait, wait, wait,
[02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:22.240]   what did you just say?"
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:25.840]   I waited very patiently till afterwards.
[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:29.280]   Meanwhile, club-twit listeners are going to be like, "Why are they suddenly talking
[02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:30.280]   about his garage?"
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:32.280]   You won't get in there.
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:33.280]   Yeah, it's good.
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:34.880]   But that's okay.
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:37.880]   I think we've built up enough information around it for it to make.
[02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:38.960]   We've just played it plenty.
[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:41.000]   At least some sense.
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:47.080]   Android 13 has, of course, a number of features that you may or may not have experienced already,
[02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:54.680]   but apparently they're getting some new features designed for business users, for keeping primarily
[02:07:54.680 --> 02:08:00.520]   for expanding on the functionality that keeps, if you have a device that is a work and a
[02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:04.320]   personal use device, keeping those things separated.
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:05.320]   Why do you hate it?
[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:06.320]   I hate this.
[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:12.080]   Because it just imposed upon me personal and work and made trying to sign into the phone
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:13.280]   when I got it.
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:17.360]   Absolute hell, because, well, you can't, of course, you can't do that without account.
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:18.360]   I know.
[02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:21.280]   That's why I'm trying to have just one account.
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:24.200]   And to this day, it drives me crazy.
[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:25.200]   Oh, that sucks.
[02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:29.200]   I knew exactly where this rant was going to go.
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:32.200]   Yeah, he's going somewhere in that realm.
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:33.200]   Yeah.
[02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:36.000]   How many years have I suffered, Google?
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.040]   We'll figure it out.
[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:43.200]   Will you ever be motivated to a point to like undo what you have and just like, can I do
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:44.200]   that?
[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:45.200]   Yeah, I don't know.
[02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:46.200]   I honestly, I don't know.
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:48.760]   Yeah, if I could, I would, but I can't imagine.
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:51.000]   When you retire, just get rid of it.
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.400]   Yeah, just throw it away.
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:53.400]   Throw it away.
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:54.400]   Throw it away.
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:55.400]   Throw it away.
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:56.400]   That's, that's why.
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:57.400]   Personal.
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:08:59.400]   See, when I retire is when I become that account fully.
[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:03.600]   So the one you bought, the one you pay for?
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:05.960]   Yeah, then I don't know what to tell you, my friend.
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:11.320]   You've just made the wrong choice at the beginning and you'll suffer forever.
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:15.360]   It's basically like being born a woman, Jeff.
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:20.200]   You're just always going to have lesser opportunities, paid less and suffer more.
[02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:23.360]   Yeah, boy, boy, you brought that around.
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:24.360]   Wow.
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:26.440]   Okay, think about it though.
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:28.760]   Yes, I, I'll know why you're great.
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:30.560]   All right, back to the change.
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:32.360]   Look at Stacy's getting loopy.
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:35.160]   It's time for waffles.
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:37.880]   We could tell it's time for waffles.
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:39.400]   Chrome OS game controls.
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:45.200]   Something that Google had announced was coming is, well, it's coming and does that support
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:46.680]   is rolling out.
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:52.440]   Chrome OS 105 actually brings an early alpha version of these game controls.
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:58.800]   Just it allows essentially for you to have expanded touchscreen control of Android games
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:00.920]   using your Chromebook.
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:01.920]   So there you go.
[02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:06.120]   If you like playing Android games in your Chromebook, you will love this feature or I
[02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:08.840]   actually don't know if you will, but there you go.
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:11.520]   Look for it anyways.
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:12.520]   Let's see here.
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:13.520]   Android.
[02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:15.320]   Wow, I really didn't sort these very well.
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:16.320]   Android 13.
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:17.320]   First producer today.
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:18.320]   Yeah, I know.
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:24.960]   It's not like I had too much to do preparing and understanding the stories that were going
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:26.960]   in the rundown today.
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:30.040]   The first patch for Android 13 is out.
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:33.640]   It actually fixes some issues, some pixel issues.
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:36.240]   If you have the Pixel 6A, you are not going to get that update.
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:37.400]   It is delayed.
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:41.400]   One of the things that I think this addresses was a big complaint that we were hearing about
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:45.720]   battery drain issues on the Pixel 6 and the 6 Pro.
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:49.920]   I have wondered if it's the same thing that I was experiencing with the 6A, but the 6A
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:50.920]   isn't on 13.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:51.920]   It's still on 12.
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:53.760]   So maybe that doesn't matter.
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:11:00.000]   But nonetheless, if you've been experiencing a bunch of battery drain issues on your Pixel
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:06.560]   6 or 6 Pro since upgrading to Android 13, you will want this patch because from my understanding,
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:12.320]   it helps to address those issues and bring the phone back to a better working order as
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:16.080]   far as your battery power is concerned.
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:20.880]   And then finally, oh, oh, and I should also mention the Pixel 3A and the 3A XL.
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:23.800]   We were talking highly about these devices earlier.
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:29.200]   They are getting their final update with Android, getting a final Android 12 update.
[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:33.200]   I think that's it as far as updates go for that device.
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:40.880]   So if you have the 3A or the 3A XL, you may have hit the end of the road for updates.
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:43.240]   So I'm sorry to say that.
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:50.360]   And then finally, the Nest Hub Max is getting some quick phrases.
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:54.840]   This is to allow you to skip the Hg command.
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:12:03.760]   And so I think it bypasses the hot word and allows you to set it up so that you can talk
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:09.000]   directly to the device without always having to say Hg in order to do it.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:14.000]   I think that makes a lot of sense for a hub device like that.
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.000]   We disagree.
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:16.000]   Oh, yeah, you don't like that?
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.600]   Oh, let's hear it.
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:20.000]   It's too much to pre-program.
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:21.560]   So you've got to go in and do it in the app.
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:25.440]   I'm like, can I just say like, hey, gee, let's pre-program my quick phrases.
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:26.440]   Oh, I see.
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:27.440]   I see.
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:28.440]   But no, I got it.
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:29.440]   I hate opening apps.
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:30.440]   Yeah.
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:31.440]   I hate it.
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:32.440]   Fair.
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:35.440]   Is the programming process like a beast in the cell phone?
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:37.000]   You only get four choices?
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.360]   No, it's I mean, listen to me, I hate opening an app.
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:42.360]   It's so terrible.
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:46.840]   I mean, God, I got to go into the Google whole map and figure this out.
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:53.080]   No, it's like six steps inside the app, but it's voice.
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:56.760]   The point of voice is that you talk to it and it does what you say.
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:13:02.280]   And I feel like Google, like Amazon has been pushing Madam A towards that.
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:05.760]   So you can do a lot like you can set up a routine with your voice now.
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:08.800]   And I'm like, get on it, Google.
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:09.800]   Yeah.
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:14.200]   Well, Duindo points out an IRC too that the home app is getting very cluttered.
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:15.200]   It does feel like that sometimes.
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:16.200]   Oh my God.
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:17.200]   I'm a nightmare.
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:18.200]   Yeah.
[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:22.280]   I do not want to be in a situation where I have to open that home app, but sometimes
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:23.280]   I have to.
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:25.280]   Not a whole lot.
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:27.960]   I can never, never.
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:33.960]   And that is the Google change log.
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:35.520]   Nicely done, sir.
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:36.520]   Yeah.
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:37.920]   Well, thank you.
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:43.040]   We are going to get to tips, tricks, and all other things in a moment.
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:46.400]   But first, I want to take a break and thank the sponsor of this episode.
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:48.160]   And that is Nomad.
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:51.560]   This episode of this week in Google is brought to you by Nomad.
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:55.600]   Now Nomad's founders actually met in Santa Barbara, California.
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:14:00.000]   It actually started as a Kickstarter project back in 2012.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:06.080]   They had the goal of building ultra rugged and minimalist tools for the 21st century
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:12.120]   that would integrate seamlessly into, you know, whatever you happen to be carrying in
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:13.120]   your everyday life.
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:16.000]   And in the past nine years, they've been doing this a long time now.
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:21.960]   Nomad has expanded to offer a wide range of mobile accessories that really fit any need
[02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:27.080]   at this point from iPhone cases, Apple watch straps, wireless charges, awesome wireless
[02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:33.480]   chargers to premium wallets and passport holders crafted with whore ween leather.
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:39.880]   Now Nomad uses leather from the whore ween tannery in Chicago that was founded in 1905,
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:43.960]   there's an unparalleled blend of quality and consistency.
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:48.880]   There are leather accessories that actually develop a rich patina with time that looks
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:53.240]   great and is completely unique to you.
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:55.080]   Also the leather smells amazing.
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:59.400]   I actually have here, I don't know if you have an overhead shot, but I have because I
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:01.480]   don't have an iPhone, right?
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:02.480]   But they do.
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:08.240]   Nomad does have some accessories for Google products.
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:09.960]   This is the Pixel Buds Pro.
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:12.840]   You can see the Pixel Buds Pro on the inside.
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:19.480]   This is the whore ween leather case for the Pixel Buds Pro and it just, you know, there
[02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:20.480]   we go.
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:22.320]   That's the Pixel Buds Pro case underneath.
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:25.520]   It just fits really snugly and securely on top.
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:31.080]   Has a little see through light for the charging light to shine right through, allows me to
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:36.160]   get access to everything and, you know, doesn't, doesn't, you know, get in the way of the use
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:40.160]   of the product and it just looks really nice, very nice leather.
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:45.280]   Nomad offers convenient wireless charging solutions as well for your home, for your office and
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:50.400]   bedroom with a suite of chargers for whatever Apple device you use as well as the Apple
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:52.160]   Watch and AirPods.
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:57.640]   Nomad is now also offering AC adapters so you can check out their new 30 watt and 65 watt
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:15:59.200]   GAN adapters.
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:04.240]   The crew at Nomad was tired of dealing with flimsy charging cables that seemed to be falling
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:08.360]   apart every few months so they set out to engineer some of the most rugged cables around.
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:10.240]   I wish I had mine with me.
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:13.440]   I have some USB-C cables from Nomad at home.
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:14.440]   They are awesome.
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:20.840]   They are reinforced with a double braided Kevlar outer sheath and then a strong metal alloy
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:22.640]   connector housing.
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:27.040]   Nomad cables have been engineered for extreme durability and heavy everyday use and they
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:28.040]   really feel like it.
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:30.920]   When you've got these cables in your hands, you're like, "This is a solid cable.
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:35.960]   This cable is not going to deteriorate or it's not going anywhere.
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:37.840]   The sucker is going to work for a long time."
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:41.160]   They're also a climate neutral certified brand.
[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:45.960]   Nomad is and always will be a company that prioritizes design and quality over everything
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:46.960]   else.
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:51.400]   One of the most important aspects to Nomad when designing new products is that they use
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:56.400]   the highest quality and longest lasting materials available.
[02:16:56.400 --> 02:17:01.400]   They design all of their concepts from the ground up rather than white labeling existing
[02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:02.400]   products.
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:05.320]   You know that when you're getting a Nomad product, you're getting a product direct
[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:09.880]   from them that is unlike anything you're going to get from anywhere else.
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:12.400]   I'm telling you, their products are awesome.
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:15.120]   I also have a high speed charger.
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:20.600]   Again, I wish I brought it with two separate ports, one port to power my laptop, another
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:24.520]   port to fast charge my phone at the same time.
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:27.280]   It's just awesome to have that for travel.
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:28.840]   Just throw that in the bag and you're covered.
[02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:31.480]   It doesn't matter what you're charging, you've got what you need.
[02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:34.800]   Go to nomadgoods.com/twig.
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:36.640]   You go there and use promo code twig.
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:42.120]   You're going to get 10% off your first purchase of any Nomad accessory.
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:45.520]   That's nomadgoods.com/twig.
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:47.680]   Make sure and use that promo code twig as well.
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:53.040]   That is a limited time offer to get that 10% off your first purchase of any Nomad accessory.
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:54.280]   Yeah, Nomad's great.
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:59.560]   Check it out for yourself and we thank Nomad for their support of this week in Google.
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:01.480]   All right.
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:06.120]   So we are at the picks section and Stacy, let's start with you.
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:08.120]   What you got?
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:10.120]   Okay, sorry.
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:12.120]   That's a stretch.
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:13.920]   Let's see.
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:16.880]   Do I have something for today?
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:20.560]   Only the 17, Stacy, you have two more to go.
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:21.560]   You had something.
[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:22.560]   It was a stretch.
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:24.880]   No, no, I did have something.
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:27.320]   And now I'm like, what was it?
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:29.320]   Last week I showed you this thing.
[02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:31.760]   I'm confused because I reviewed this this week.
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:33.600]   So, but I showed it to you last week.
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:35.440]   Yeah, yeah, I think it's not that.
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:36.440]   I like it.
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:41.080]   As I look around frantically trying to figure out what arrived and what I'm doing.
[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:43.200]   It's okay to not have something too.
[02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:45.200]   I'll go ahead and say that.
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:49.560]   It's never okay not to have a thing, especially because I...
[02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:51.360]   Because you live in brief things.
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:52.360]   I'm like, what's the matter?
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:57.880]   Well, you know, because I literally just got like new devices and I'm like, what?
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:18:58.880]   What did I...
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:18:59.880]   I haven't...
[02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:00.880]   Welcome back to you.
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:01.880]   Welcome back to you.
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:10.880]   I'm gonna go walk around my desk and find the boxes on my desk.
[02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:13.240]   So, I'm like, what's it that I'm like...
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:14.240]   Iifa stuff, right?
[02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:18.080]   You know, there wasn't a lot of great Iifa.
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:22.240]   I could do the...I mean, no, I'm not gonna do that.
[02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:23.240]   That's cheating.
[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:24.240]   Okay, okay.
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:27.680]   Let's go to Jeff first and then we'll come back to you and we'll see what magic you've
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:28.680]   come up with.
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:29.680]   Jeff, what you got?
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:33.960]   So, this just in the Wall Street Journal reports about the newspaper publishers that
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:38.480]   had tried to blackmail Google and Facebook into giving them money for no good reason
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:42.880]   because Google and Facebook give them the links and give them the value.
[02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:46.400]   But they finally said, okay, okay, okay, we'll pay you something and we'll shut up and go
[02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:47.400]   away.
[02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:53.720]   So, it reveals that Gannett was offered $6 million a year by Google here.
[02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:56.160]   Free money, just take it and shush.
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:20:01.560]   They came back, their counter offer was $300 million a year.
[02:20:01.560 --> 02:20:06.480]   I don't know about you, but the Gannett paper right by here, my top is crap.
[02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:08.360]   It's so thin you can shave with it.
[02:20:08.360 --> 02:20:09.960]   It's got nothing in it.
[02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:14.320]   It's just just $300 million a year is ridiculous.
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:16.040]   And this is where the industry is.
[02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:21.960]   Now, the Washington Post had discussed a deal for $5 million a year and they rejected that.
[02:20:21.960 --> 02:20:25.120]   Then they got 15 from Facebook, but Facebook, you know what they said?
[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:27.880]   They said, I'll put you guys, we're cutting this whole thing out.
[02:20:27.880 --> 02:20:31.680]   We're not giving any of you guys money because you're all a pain.
[02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:33.160]   That was my number.
[02:20:33.160 --> 02:20:36.440]   How thin did you say it was?
[02:20:36.440 --> 02:20:39.360]   It's so thin you could shave with it.
[02:20:39.360 --> 02:20:42.320]   That is, that was excellent.
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:44.200]   I heard that when I was looking.
[02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:47.800]   I realized my device is embargoed, so I can't show it to you.
[02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:49.280]   I have two devices.
[02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:51.480]   You will tell me, Barry, that's the next week.
[02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:52.480]   Don't.
[02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:53.480]   Right.
[02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:54.480]   It's so secret.
[02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:55.480]   Sorry.
[02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:56.480]   I was like, a little bunch here.
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:20:57.480]   Just the four of them.
[02:20:57.480 --> 02:20:59.960]   But I can't give us a hand.
[02:20:59.960 --> 02:21:00.960]   Give us a hand.
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:01.960]   Give us a hand.
[02:21:01.960 --> 02:21:02.960]   What's the genre?
[02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:03.960]   What's it like?
[02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:04.960]   I can give you.
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:05.960]   I can get this marketing.
[02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:06.960]   It's a connected to the internet.
[02:21:06.960 --> 02:21:08.760]   It's a connected device connected to the internet.
[02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:09.760]   Whoa.
[02:21:09.760 --> 02:21:10.760]   Newsflash.
[02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:14.760]   But I can offer you a book recommendation.
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:16.560]   It works like that instead.
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:18.800]   Love it.
[02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:24.520]   This is an older book, but there's a new one, like the second book in this detective series.
[02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:28.760]   If it's not really a formal detective, it's called suburban dicks.
[02:21:28.760 --> 02:21:29.760]   What?
[02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:31.400]   As in private eyes.
[02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:32.400]   Oh.
[02:21:32.400 --> 02:21:35.040]   Private eyes.
[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:36.920]   And it is hilarious.
[02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:41.960]   It is a reporter who is a total jerk.
[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:44.160]   Very good at his job, but a total jerk.
[02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:45.160]   That's good.
[02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:54.160]   And a heavily pregnant person who is not an FBI profiler, but is very good at that sort
[02:21:54.160 --> 02:22:00.080]   of thing and didn't do that as her job because she got married and had a lot of kids.
[02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:03.960]   And so it's just, yeah, there you go.
[02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:05.120]   It's good writing.
[02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:08.200]   It's fun.
[02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:11.240]   It's kind of late for their summer read, but I really recommend it.
[02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:15.120]   Like, and there's a new one coming or there's a new one that just came out fairly recently,
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:16.120]   I think.
[02:22:16.120 --> 02:22:19.680]   So it looks like it might become an ongoing thing, but it likable characters.
[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:24.600]   The mystery itself is fun.
[02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:29.520]   Will this be a Stacy's book club pick at some point or is it not not?
[02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:31.520]   No, because it's not science fiction.
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:32.520]   Yeah.
[02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:35.520]   Heck enough is everything's real.
[02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:37.520]   Not so.
[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:40.120]   And it takes place in New Jersey.
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:41.120]   Yay.
[02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:44.760]   The God and state.
[02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:47.560]   The God and state.
[02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:48.560]   Very nice.
[02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:54.800]   So that is a book called suburban decks by is it Fabian Nikiaza?
[02:22:54.800 --> 02:22:55.800]   Nisiesa.
[02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:56.800]   I don't know.
[02:22:56.800 --> 02:22:57.800]   Who knows?
[02:22:57.800 --> 02:23:00.920]   I can't pronounce all the words I make up.
[02:23:00.920 --> 02:23:03.720]   So I clearly can't pronounce this unmade up word.
[02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:06.240]   There you go.
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:07.240]   All right.
[02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:08.240]   Thank you for the book recommendation.
[02:23:08.240 --> 02:23:10.400]   Ant, what you got?
[02:23:10.400 --> 02:23:17.720]   Well, this time, as usual, I got to say something about my family, but this is a book that was
[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:23.760]   recommended to me by our very own Mr. Jerry, their Twitch studios.
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:27.440]   And I'm not quite finished with it, but I am really, really digging in this called Master
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:29.840]   Minds and Wingmen.
[02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:36.800]   And I can't remember the other book that she wrote before, but this is I love how this
[02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:43.360]   was given me perspectives as a parent of boys, because I see things my way and I try
[02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:47.480]   to see things through other people's perspectives.
[02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:50.680]   But these are still my kids and I'm going to raise them the way I feel like raising
[02:23:50.680 --> 02:23:53.760]   them and do what I need to do.
[02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:58.120]   But it's still a very good read because you just get to see different perspectives and
[02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:04.560]   a lot of different insight as she interviews teenage boys and in the whole process of them,
[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:09.040]   you know, growing up with interesting parents, difficult parents, good parents, so on and
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:10.040]   so forth.
[02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:13.000]   Yeah, this was by Rosalind Wiseman.
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:20.080]   Yes, Rosalind Wiseman, masterminds and Wingmen helping our boys cope with schoolyard power,
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:24.040]   locker room tests, girlfriends and the new rules of boy world.
[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:25.840]   It's good stuff.
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:26.840]   Good stuff.
[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:27.840]   2014.
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:28.840]   Nice.
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:29.840]   That sounds.
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:32.280]   And of course, an approved dot com slash prints.
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:33.280]   Of course.
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:34.280]   Hey, Jason.
[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:35.280]   Jason has.
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:36.280]   Yeah.
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:40.440]   Since the Benito let me sit in this chair and have this microphone.
[02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:41.440]   I thought I'd pick something.
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:43.440]   Oh, I would love that.
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:44.640]   I don't we love it.
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:45.640]   I haven't seen it.
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:46.640]   It's tonight.
[02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:47.640]   It's tonight's Nova.
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:49.640]   How writing changed the world.
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:50.640]   So kind of thing.
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:51.640]   How.
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:55.640]   How great of printing the first information technology.
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:57.960]   Oh, vampires and revolutions.
[02:24:57.960 --> 02:24:59.960]   Should I talk to you about Gutenberg now?
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:03.600]   I was going to say you're speaking Jeff's language right now.
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:05.400]   Watch Nova tonight, Jeff.
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:06.400]   Whoa.
[02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:08.560]   I know I will.
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:09.880]   I love that.
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:11.960]   Thank you for offering that.
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:13.120]   That sounds really interesting.
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:15.320]   How writing changed the world.
[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:18.680]   Nova A to Z. Check that out.
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:21.160]   So that is broadcast for the first time tonight.
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:22.560]   This is a new new show.
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:23.560]   Yeah.
[02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:24.560]   Right on.
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:28.440]   Well, there'll be a rerun because I got stuff to do tonight.
[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:30.080]   Oh, you know, you know, PBS.
[02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:31.080]   Yes.
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:35.800]   And on Friday and a layer for the about once a month for the next 10 years.
[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:37.440]   OK, perfect.
[02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:41.480]   And if you call them up and tell them you enjoyed it, you get a free tote back.
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:42.480]   No.
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:43.480]   Oh, nice.
[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:45.480]   Tell them you enjoyed it and give them money for your free tote.
[02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:46.960]   Oh, so there you go.
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:47.960]   That's how you get.
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:52.000]   I will admit that the only over the top service I pay for is PBS.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.000]   Oh, wow.
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.000]   That's a good one.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:57.640]   I mean, for 50 years, they kept bugging me to donate.
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:25:58.640]   I never did.
[02:25:58.640 --> 02:25:59.640]   So now I am.
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:00.640]   Now you are.
[02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:02.040]   You're that kind of guy.
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:03.040]   Yeah, right on.
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:04.920]   Oh, you know, thanks to Leo and Lisa.
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:06.760]   I can afford to donate.
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:08.400]   Ah, there it is.
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:11.400]   There you go.
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:12.400]   That and Wikipedia.
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:13.400]   Yeah, right.
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:14.400]   Right.
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:18.000]   Yeah, I do donate there.
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:23.160]   My pick of the week is a service that I used.
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:29.720]   So this is one of those AI art generation things, which I feel like now they're propping
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:33.960]   up everywhere, you know, suddenly, suddenly they're everywhere.
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:39.360]   But this was the first one that I had actually explored it.
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:44.480]   You know, after seeing like the results of like Dolly and just and what was the one that
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:45.480]   was free?
[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:46.840]   It was like Dolly.
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:48.680]   It was like a limited stable vision.
[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:49.680]   Dolly mini.
[02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:50.680]   Dolly light.
[02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:56.720]   It was like and it was interesting, but everything, but it felt light.
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:00.800]   It felt like the images were kind of like low resolution and it was like, okay, well,
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:01.800]   that's neat.
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:03.320]   But I want like full resolution.
[02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:07.000]   Like I want to see what these things can do, get my hands on a kind of a higher end
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.840]   diversion of this if that's a good descriptor for it.
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:13.720]   And came across one called mid journey.
[02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:14.720]   And so.
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:15.720]   Yeah, next one.
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:18.520]   Should we should we tell you this was Leo's pick like two weeks?
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:19.520]   Yeah.
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:20.520]   Is it?
[02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:26.320]   Oh, yeah, you think I know that you think I know that because like I mentioned, I haven't
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:28.120]   looked at this.
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:29.120]   But let's see.
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:30.120]   Well, anyway, it's a literal.
[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:31.600]   So how about this?
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:34.640]   Leo told you about it and I did a couple of images.
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:35.640]   So that's what I'll see.
[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:36.640]   We'll see.
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:42.240]   One of them was I labeled it alien art in the dock.
[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:46.240]   And I can't remember what my what my cue was for it, but I put the links in there for
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:48.040]   you, John.
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:51.800]   And so the first one, oh, wow, we pull it up.
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:53.320]   Have we showed it yet?
[02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:54.320]   No, no, no, sorry.
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:55.320]   Sorry.
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:27:59.560]   No, no below the story, there's three links to to a Google drive.
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:01.960]   So there's one called alien art.
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:03.920]   Cause, cause Leo already did the pick.
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:06.040]   So I don't need to do all the setup and everything like this.
[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:07.040]   And there we go.
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:09.480]   So, isn't that interesting?
[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:12.320]   I can't remember what the prompt was for this.
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:14.160]   I wish I had written them all down.
[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:18.520]   But the way that that mid journey does this is really interesting.
[02:28:18.520 --> 02:28:22.560]   You put in the prompt, I think it's, it's like a imagine is the command prompt and then
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:24.040]   all of the modifiers.
[02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:25.040]   Flash imagine.
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:26.360]   And then it gives you a blank.
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:32.200]   And then it gives you four, four different ideas in like a little square grid and you
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:37.720]   can, you can either choose to take any one of those ideas and up-resit or take any one
[02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:41.600]   of those ideas and create four new ideas from that.
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:42.600]   Yeah.
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:43.760]   And you can go down that road.
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:45.160]   So I did that with a couple of images.
[02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:49.160]   That was one of them that when I got to the end, I was like, wow, that just, that just
[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:51.280]   looks like someone created that.
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:54.760]   That is so like intriguing.
[02:28:54.760 --> 02:29:00.280]   The second one I tried to recreate, Leo had done podcast legend having lunch.
[02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:01.280]   Was that on this show?
[02:29:01.280 --> 02:29:02.280]   Yeah.
[02:29:02.280 --> 02:29:04.560]   That was on the show when I was out.
[02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:07.880]   And I was like, well, what would mid journey do if I did that prompt?
[02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:09.640]   So that's the second link.
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:11.680]   And it's not nearly as impressive.
[02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:16.680]   Although they, you know, I was very similar though, because the one in the upper left
[02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:19.040]   quad is very similar to what he did.
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:20.880]   Old white guy with his wife.
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:24.800]   This guy with Brussels sprouts on a plate, you know, in the foreground.
[02:29:24.800 --> 02:29:29.360]   The second one there is really the only one that alludes to anything podcast because
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:33.280]   it kind of looks like that head on a platter is wearing headphones.
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:34.280]   Yeah.
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:35.280]   Yeah.
[02:29:35.280 --> 02:29:37.440]   But that's podcast legend having lunch.
[02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:40.000]   I didn't really explore that one much further than that.
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.880]   This last one I was really stoked on.
[02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:48.560]   I asked Micah to give me a prompt and his prompt was of course, Wawa playing Dungeons
[02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:49.800]   and Dragons.
[02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:52.000]   And I got four options.
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:53.680]   This was the winner.
[02:29:53.680 --> 02:29:55.880]   And I'm telling you, like, I love this image.
[02:29:55.880 --> 02:29:58.080]   Like that is just so cool.
[02:29:58.080 --> 02:30:02.280]   It's a little, you know, it's a little, I mean, very abstract actually, but yeah, there's
[02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:05.240]   no, no, I have been trying each one of these service.
[02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:08.400]   So my book is entitled the Gutenberg parenthesis.
[02:30:08.400 --> 02:30:11.560]   So I want to cover one of these things because I think it'd be really cool to have a book
[02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:15.000]   cover proposed to the publisher that came from AI, right?
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:16.000]   Yeah.
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:17.000]   Yeah.
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:18.000]   It doesn't understand parenthesis.
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:19.000]   It doesn't understand Gutenberg.
[02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:20.920]   They better be too large.
[02:30:20.920 --> 02:30:22.600]   There's your sign.
[02:30:22.600 --> 02:30:25.400]   You would think bring something in a parenthesis.
[02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:26.400]   Yeah.
[02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:30.400]   I'd other things that don't understand parenthesis and Gutenberg is too far back in history
[02:30:30.400 --> 02:30:31.400]   for it.
[02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:32.400]   That's good.
[02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:34.200]   Ooh, grammar snob printing press.
[02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:37.200]   What was that?
[02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:39.800]   Grammar snob printing press.
[02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:42.120]   Grammar snob printing.
[02:30:42.120 --> 02:30:43.120]   Stacy needs a waffle.
[02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:44.120]   Yeah.
[02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:45.120]   You do moral parenting.
[02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:50.080]   Wait, am I getting, no, I'm trying to think of things that like, or Oxford comma or something,
[02:30:50.080 --> 02:30:53.560]   like something to give it some, you know, maybe it's not parenthesis.
[02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:54.560]   Yeah.
[02:30:54.560 --> 02:30:56.400]   Maybe it'll get you something.
[02:30:56.400 --> 02:30:57.800]   I'm not being mean.
[02:30:57.800 --> 02:31:00.160]   I'm trying to get it to think of the grammatical.
[02:31:00.160 --> 02:31:01.160]   I thought you were just being more.
[02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:06.240]   Yeah, the syntax or what it would require is, I mean, one thing that I noticed with mid-journey
[02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:10.000]   in my short time, because you only get a limited number of free tries, right?
[02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.040]   You get 25 free tries.
[02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:14.080]   And then after that, it's $10 a month.
[02:31:14.080 --> 02:31:19.360]   You get 200 images for the month or $30 a month and you get unlimited personal use.
[02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:21.600]   So I just did the 25 free tries.
[02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:26.200]   And what I learned in that short amount of time is the more descriptive words you can
[02:31:26.200 --> 02:31:32.560]   give, so like the better, the closer your image might actually, you know, come to representing
[02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:34.640]   something along the lines of what you're looking for.
[02:31:34.640 --> 02:31:39.360]   If I was giving it short prompts, I didn't get nearly as good results as if I really
[02:31:39.360 --> 02:31:44.800]   went out on a limb and was like, all right, here's a bunch of descriptors about what this
[02:31:44.800 --> 02:31:45.800]   would look like.
[02:31:45.800 --> 02:31:52.120]   So it takes a while to really learn the syntax of how these particular image generation systems
[02:31:52.120 --> 02:31:54.360]   work, you know.
[02:31:54.360 --> 02:32:01.600]   But someone prompted in the Discord air-conditioned garage full of squishmallows.
[02:32:01.600 --> 02:32:04.600]   Excellent.
[02:32:04.600 --> 02:32:05.600]   Okay.
[02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:07.600]   It looks too real.
[02:32:07.600 --> 02:32:09.600]   I don't even know if we have that.
[02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:12.600]   I think I want to see Jason's mother of the car.
[02:32:12.600 --> 02:32:16.480]   Martin in the air-conditioned garage.
[02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:19.800]   So anyways, mid-journey, check it out.
[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:23.960]   The only reason I wanted to bring it up is because I feel like Dolly to, you know, all
[02:32:23.960 --> 02:32:27.520]   these other ones, I see people talking about them, but I have no way of using them.
[02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:29.760]   And then this one, I was like, oh, wait, through Discord?
[02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:30.760]   Okay.
[02:32:30.760 --> 02:32:31.760]   So I used it.
[02:32:31.760 --> 02:32:32.920]   And who knows?
[02:32:32.920 --> 02:32:36.680]   Maybe I got the suggestion from Leo when he featured this two weeks ago.
[02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:37.680]   This is his tool.
[02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:38.680]   I don't know.
[02:32:38.680 --> 02:32:39.680]   He's right here.
[02:32:39.680 --> 02:32:40.680]   It's okay.
[02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:43.520]   I have to come down from this.
[02:32:43.520 --> 02:32:45.320]   All right.
[02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:48.120]   Well, we've reached the end of this episode of this week and Google has been a lot of
[02:32:48.120 --> 02:32:49.360]   fun sitting in for Leo.
[02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:56.080]   He will be back next week to tell you all about the hair metal music that he is probably
[02:32:56.080 --> 02:32:57.080]   watching at this point.
[02:32:57.080 --> 02:33:00.280]   I think the concert started at four if I'm not mistaken.
[02:33:00.280 --> 02:33:02.880]   So he's in the thick of it already.
[02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:04.400]   I think Joan Jett was the opener.
[02:33:04.400 --> 02:33:08.440]   So Joan Jett might be playing right now and he'll tell you all about it.
[02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:13.720]   But Jeff Jarvis, thank you so much for being with me on this episode.
[02:33:13.720 --> 02:33:14.960]   Always a pleasure, sir.
[02:33:14.960 --> 02:33:15.960]   You do a great job.
[02:33:15.960 --> 02:33:16.960]   Thank you.
[02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:20.720]   You want to leave everyone with anything, anything you want people to know?
[02:33:20.720 --> 02:33:21.720]   Yeah.
[02:33:21.720 --> 02:33:24.920]   Buzzmachine.com will do it for you at Jeff Jarvis on Twitter.
[02:33:24.920 --> 02:33:28.440]   If you want to find him there and Stacy Higginbotham, thank you so much.
[02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:30.240]   Always a pleasure doing a show with you.
[02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:31.920]   Appreciate it.
[02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:33.640]   Just wait until next week.
[02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:34.640]   Great things.
[02:33:34.640 --> 02:33:36.840]   Great things are afoot.
[02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:40.680]   Stacy on IOT.com, it's time for her waffles.
[02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:43.600]   So she will get those here in a matter of minutes.
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:49.360]   And thank you, Aunt Pruitt, share of the office just down the hall with me.
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:52.160]   What do you want to leave people with?
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:57.680]   Just thanks for all the support and make sure you guys go and vote in the Club Twit
[02:33:57.680 --> 02:34:01.320]   Book Club because that's coming up here soon.
[02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:03.240]   That votes closing here pretty soon.
[02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:06.960]   So if you're not a member of Club Twit, first go ahead and join seven bucks a month.
[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:07.960]   There you go.
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:08.960]   But we got three books.
[02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:13.400]   So actually it's now down to two books because we figured out one hasn't been released yet.
[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:16.960]   When I looked it up, it was October 1st.
[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:19.840]   So I don't know if I got pushed back or something.
[02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:20.840]   I don't know if I got pushed back or something.
[02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:21.840]   But we had three books.
[02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:22.840]   We had three books.
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:23.840]   We had three books.
[02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:24.840]   It's Book Club.
[02:34:24.840 --> 02:34:25.840]   Who needs to read the book?
[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:26.840]   We already know what we think.
[02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:29.720]   You said you could vote for the first version of it.
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:30.720]   So wanderers.
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:31.720]   Wanderers.
[02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:32.720]   Wanderers.
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:38.320]   We have a long way to a small angry planet and we have ancillary justice.
[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:43.720]   And right now, the long way to a small angry planet is in the lead.
[02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:50.400]   The cozy sci-fi space opera, which is not a form of, or which is not the title of a
[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:51.400]   book.
[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:53.120]   Yes, not that I know.
[02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:54.120]   Poor aunt.
[02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:55.120]   He's getting such an ed.
[02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:56.120]   He's like, what?
[02:34:56.120 --> 02:34:57.120]   I'm an education.
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:35:01.200]   I don't even want to know this much about sci-fi, you guys.
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:02.200]   Yes.
[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:03.200]   Good grief.
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:06.040]   Definitely everybody check that out at ClubTwit.
[02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:09.600]   If you're not already a member, twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:12.640]   Pretty awesome stuff with Andes and everybody is doing over there.
[02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:15.480]   So make sure and check it out.
[02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:19.720]   We do this show or Leo and you guys anyways, do this show every Wednesday.
[02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:20.720]   You're always there.
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:21.720]   We know you're here.
[02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:22.720]   That's right.
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:23.720]   I'm behind the scenes.
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:24.720]   So you're right.
[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:27.840]   You're behind the scenes putting the rundown together and making little notes down at the
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:30.040]   bottom of the rundown while you do your thing.
[02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:31.040]   But...
[02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:32.840]   Grantically finding links when we go off topic.
[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:33.840]   Wait a minute.
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:34.840]   Where's the story?
[02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:35.840]   This one.
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:36.840]   Okay.
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:38.800]   Sometimes it's not even the story that Leo pulls up.
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:41.440]   It's just a story that has a story that is close.
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:42.440]   Whatever.
[02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:43.440]   That one.
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:44.440]   Don't that.
[02:35:44.440 --> 02:35:49.280]   We do the show live every Wednesday, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2 p.m.
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:51.960]   Pacific, 2100 UTC.
[02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:57.640]   If you need any information about this show at all, all you need to do is go to Twit.tv/Twig.
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:03.640]   There you will find everything you need to know to subscribe to your podcatcher of choice.
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:05.040]   Jump out to YouTube, watch it there.
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:09.040]   You can even watch it or listen to the show in the page if that's your preference.
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:10.440]   But I highly recommend you subscribe.
[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:14.040]   Then you don't have to work quite as hard for all the awesomeness.
[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:15.760]   That is This Week in Google.
[02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:16.760]   Thank you so much for watching.
[02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:18.760]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:19.440]   Bye everybody.
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:24.520]   Hey, I'm Rod Pyle, editor of Ad Astor Magazine.
[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:29.400]   And each week I'm joined by Tariq Malek, the editor in chief over at space.com.
[02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:33.720]   In our new This Week in Space podcast, every Friday, Tariq and I take a deep dive into
[02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:35.880]   the stories that define the new space age.
[02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:37.040]   What's NASA up to?
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:39.720]   When will Americans once again set foot on the moon?
[02:36:39.720 --> 02:36:41.840]   And how about those samples from the Perseverance Rover?
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:43.320]   When are those coming home?
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:45.520]   What the heck is Elon Musk done now?
[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:49.080]   In addition to all the latest and greatest in space exploration, we'll take an occasional
[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:53.440]   look at bits of space flight history that you probably never heard of and all with an
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:56.160]   eye towards having a good time along the way.
[02:36:56.160 --> 02:36:57.680]   Check us out on your favorite pod catcher.
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:07.680]   [MUSIC]
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:09.940]   (buzzing)
