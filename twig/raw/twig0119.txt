[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.680]   And boy, these days, there's a lot of stuff in the cloud.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.360]   Gina Trapani is here from smarterware.org.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.600]   Think up app.com.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.680]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.600]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.360]   It's good.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.360]   It's good.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.860]   Good.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.120]   Jeff Jarvis also here.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.120]   Oh, now he's jiggling.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.960]   Are you-- yeah.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.920]   Are you having an earthquake?
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.520]   Earthquake.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.000]   No, sorry.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.120]   Jeff's in his office at the City University of New York,
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.440]   where he's a professor of journalism.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.260]   He's also an author of a great book called Public Parts
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.220]   and Buzzmachine.com as his blog.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.620]   And also joining us, the founder of Meta Filter, Matt Howie,
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.180]   is here.
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.740]   Hello.
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.260]   Hey, Matt.
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.260]   Long time no see.
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.700]   Good to see you again.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.900]   Yeah, nice to see you.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.900]   Matt is a Google Reader fanatic.
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.580]   So we thought we'd bring him on so we could see the steam
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.620]   coming out of his ears.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.500]   Google's been-- it's amazing what Google's--
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.000]   for a-- it seemed like for a long time,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.720]   Google didn't do nothing.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.800]   And then all of a sudden, they're changing everything.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.120]   It started with Google+, but Gmail's got a new interface now.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.400]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.160]   But the one that really has people up in arms is Google Reader.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160]   They took out the shared button.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.800]   Is that the-- so I use Google Reader.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.120]   This is my account, and I use it.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.000]   We are the 1,000 plus.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.040]   But I more often use it with a client that then
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.400]   logs into it.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.900]   You, I take it, use it from the web page.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.320]   Matt.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.000]   So what's wrong here?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.920]   I'm looking.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.400]   I mean, there's a lot of things wrong.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.880]   It's cool that they are--
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.920]   Google's finally sort of investing in design.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.040]   And it's weird to complain about a free app that's
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.000]   been free for years and years and years.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.600]   Don't let that stop you, my friend.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.520]   It's pretty much ad-free.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.560]   I'm surprised it doesn't have Gmail style ads across the top.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.880]   But I just got used to--
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.240]   I will say that they kind of went overboard in last year or two.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.320]   You know, there was like--
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.960]   There were two many buttons at the bottom.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.160]   It's like there's still a--
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.660]   --sharing.
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.760]   --plus one email key.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.120]   --keep on Rentsend 2.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.560]   Edit to all of this stuff.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.400]   Yeah, now--
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.680]   You could share with a note.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.080]   You could like something.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.320]   You could star something.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.520]   That was-- I mean, they should have just stuck with two.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.920]   Like, share and star, maybe.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.160]   So they've eliminated everything but star.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.280]   And plus one, which unfortunately, instead of just plus oneing it.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.680]   You have to plus one, then you can share on plus.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.040]   But then-- so my problem is slowly I
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.760]   started using the sharing thing when I noticed other friends
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.800]   would comment sometimes on my shares.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.920]   And it seems like over the last two, three years,
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.360]   Google kind of eclipsed.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.720]   It was just so easy to just press a share button.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.800]   And I follow, I don't know, 150 people or so.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.680]   It became more important to me than delicious
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   and pinboard and Twitter and blogs for finding new stuff.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.080]   It was like new content discovery.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.600]   It was amazing.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.240]   So I would find just--
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.040]   I was following about 50 prolific people
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.880]   that were sharing five things a day.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.600]   And I was just finding the most amazing stuff.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.440]   Hey, Matt, how do I get out of this share box?
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.080]   I can't stop it.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.040]   I don't want to share this.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.000]   Can you escape?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.720]   No.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.720]   Quick away.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.360]   Nothing.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.560]   There's no closed box.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.320]   OK, little UI-- ah, there we go.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.880]   Click away.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.400]   It worked.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.600]   Yeah, and you kind of--
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.640]   I mean, even a designer of Google Reader
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.200]   said he couldn't stand this, you know, a former designer.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.960]   Yeah, he said they've lost their way.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.800]   I guess share is now in the upper right,
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.040]   on the top bar away from everything.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.200]   And that's what share whatever item you're looking at,
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.720]   which is weird.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.160]   That is weird.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.960]   But that's the same as plus one.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.440]   This one has a closed box, which is kind of nice.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.760]   My other problem is you could export the people
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.680]   you're following only in JSON format.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.240]   You know, a JavaScript XML kind of type.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.760]   And so I opened it up in a text form.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.800]   I was trying to add all these people to circles.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.720]   And I just have their Google username.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.040]   And I don't know their real name.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.240]   And sometimes there's five people with the same exact full name.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.360]   And then I finally get all my followers on plus.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.600]   And two or three have migrated to plus.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.200]   But I'm also getting pictures of their kids Halloween costume,
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.680]   their Google+ stuff.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.760]   So they essentially killed what was--
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.840]   I mean, it was a nerdy--
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.840]   you got plus in my Google Reader.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.520]   You got Reader in my plus.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.240]   Now two great flavors in one.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.160]   So I said, on the second day I woke up,
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.760]   I opened up Google Reader forgetting about all this.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.000]   It was like someone to take my iPhone
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.640]   and give me a phone from 10 years ago.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.280]   It's just all the things I loved about were completely gone.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.200]   But I feel like we should get ready,
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.720]   because this is just kind of the beginning of a whole revamp
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.600]   across the board, all this stuff.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.920]   I kind of like this.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.920]   Plusification.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.040]   We're in the business of change, but you know what?
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.640]   We kind of don't like change.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.600]   No, nerds hate change more than anybody else.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.400]   Yeah, they cause change more than anybody else.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.520]   I mean, you became a nerd because you were excited
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.120]   by all the new stuff.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.800]   But then once you got it, it dialed in, it's like,
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.760]   and every change is for the worse.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.440]   Let's just admit that right now.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.360]   It's all for the worse.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.160]   It actually kind of reveals an interesting problem
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.920]   with Google circles, which I've kind of come into too,
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.760]   is that there's no way to say, like, these are my tech posts,
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.000]   these are my personal posts, these are my MMA posts,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.440]   and you know, kind of selectively subscribe to people.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.040]   Like if there was a way from that to say,
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.600]   I just want to subscribe to, you know,
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.480]   shares from Google Reader, from his friends.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.760]   That would be, that would kind of solve the problem, right?
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.480]   So you wouldn't get the pictures of people's kids
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.320]   in their Halloween costumes.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.640]   That I figure they're going to do.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.920]   I figure that's coming in some form.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.800]   We need it so badly.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.720]   Or like just people's plus ones.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.560]   Right.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.240]   On the other hand, all that adds complexity.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.440]   It's a very, it's a challenge.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.880]   Because as Matt, as you said, you added all these buttons
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.320]   at the bottom, well, that makes people happy,
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.840]   they get attached to that button or this button,
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.000]   but then it's just kind of complex for somebody
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.920]   who's never been there before.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.400]   It's like, what's the difference between share, star,
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.240]   and plus one?
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.680]   I don't know.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.000]   Right? I mean, it's not immediately obvious anyway
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   when you look at it.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   (laughs)
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.840]   Right?
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.800]   So you, so I can understand why they'd say,
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.160]   well, let's narrow it down and just have a couple.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.360]   I don't know.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.440]   Yeah, I think that, it makes a lot of sense to focus it,
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.280]   but not if you can't get the same,
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.480]   like Matt's saying, I just can't get the same functionality
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.280]   that I had before.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.280]   Right.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.520]   Well, I think that's kind of happened though,
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.040]   sometimes when you focus things, you lose functionality.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.320]   I'm not, not to diminish your complaints, Matt.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.280]   I completely understand.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.320]   Yeah, I mean, well, they took out a major feature,
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.040]   but it was the whole shoehorning
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.240]   into their other new community tool
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.480]   that seemed just really odd.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.280]   I mean, I was on Google's campus last month,
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.640]   and in this big meeting, I was with people asking me,
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.480]   after I talked about what I was talking about,
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.680]   so what's your favorite sites
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.160]   or what are the tools you use every day?
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.840]   And I said, like, pretty much Twitter and Google Reader
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.960]   open all the time.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.880]   As soon as people heard Google Reader, they said,
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.720]   "Oh, what do you think of plus?"
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.960]   (laughing)
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.520]   So I sort of, I was like, that was weird.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.760]   Why did they ask me on the plus?
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.800]   Ooh.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.360]   And then I put it together, you know.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.440]   - Wirembells won us.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.440]   - That was came out.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.800]   But answering, weren't there rumors
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.760]   that Reader was gonna disappear entirely?
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.600]   It was gonna be entirely moved over?
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.960]   No, I think I just heard the sharing stuff,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.200]   like all the social features of everything
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.840]   is gonna be pushed to plus.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.240]   I also heard about a new plus feature,
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.200]   which was a Facebook clone feature.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.440]   And I told them basically,
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.520]   "Stop cloning Facebook, try and make something
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.400]   "actually compelling and original."
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.480]   - Are you talking about the what's hot?
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.640]   - No, I don't think this was, nobody told me to NDA this.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.320]   They said, "Oh, wait till you hear
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.120]   "about this new things coming to plus."
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.240]   - Business pages.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.080]   - No.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.880]   - I went, "What?"
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.720]   - Well, we knew that. - That's right.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.560]   - We knew that.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.560]   They were telling brands, don't create,
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.920]   you know, I didn't create a Twitter account
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.200]   'cause they told me there were gonna be brand pages.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.720]   - And I went, "Uh, like that's chasing Facebook again.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.560]   "Like, you know, nothing new and compelling."
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.160]   - Well, but it also answers a need.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.120]   I mean, if I'm a brand, see what happened,
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.360]   you know, remember in the absence of a brand page,
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.280]   everybody amasurable, everybody created user pages
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.560]   that were really brand pages.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.000]   And so I can understand why they might want
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   to separate those out.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.600]   I think really the complaint is that Google Plus
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.200]   doesn't have enough, isn't mature enough yet.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.880]   And if you're gonna move everybody to Google Plus,
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.040]   you better have all the features that people want.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.880]   - Maybe not.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.960]   - But maybe it's about proactively moving people
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.000]   to Google Plus, you know, whether they realize
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.480]   they're getting there or not.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.440]   - Yeah, they're not, yeah.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.520]   - I mean, think eventually Gmail would just be
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.680]   Google Plus messaging.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.840]   - I do.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.880]   Well, actually, you raised an important point.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.800]   I had lunch with a Googler, I'm not sure,
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.920]   oh, I'm frozen, I'm frozen.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.760]   - That's right.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.920]   Yeah, I like it that way.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.760]   - Oh.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.880]   - You look-- - Oh, you wanna imitate that, Leo.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.040]   - Hey, hey. (laughing)
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.720]   - That always works on freezing, by the way,
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.320]   when you imitate him.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.840]   - Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.520]   This was on the other side of the NDA wall at Google.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.320]   So I'm not sure if I'll quote the person,
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.160]   but I'm not giving credit only because of that worry.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.480]   But he pointed out to me that the essential mistake
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.240]   in email was that the sender has all control,
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.920]   the recipient has no control.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.080]   And in Google, and that's why email is so bloody broken,
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.760]   because that's why we get messed up with everything.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.600]   Whereas-- - Makes sense.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.680]   - Google Plus, Google Plus, the recipient has control.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.960]   And there were only two cases where that wasn't so.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.840]   One was where-- - Comments.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.160]   - Get notifications and second was comments.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.360]   So notifications, they changed so that now you can limit
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.080]   notifications to people you actually know,
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.680]   which is too bad 'cause it limits you to a known world,
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.680]   but it eliminates a spam problem.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.560]   And I suspect that it's in the comments.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.080]   So what happens then?
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.600]   So then Google circles, Google Plus, becomes a place
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   where the recipient has all control.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   And basically you can say, if I know you
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.400]   and you wanna communicate with me, communicate with me there,
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   because there'll be a lower spam environment than my email.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.680]   So Matt, you're not wrong.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.680]   I think that Google Plus could well be an architecture
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.280]   for the future of email.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.400]   - Would you wanna replace email or just have it as another,
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.560]   perhaps more better way to communicate?
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.280]   - I think email is got awful broken.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.760]   And I'm not sure what to do about it.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.400]   And so I think that we probably end up with two worlds, right?
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.240]   We end up with email as it stands, which is,
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.000]   you know, the same as trying to find somebody in Times Square.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   And we have the other extreme, which is complete control,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.960]   which is like Google Plus could be.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.400]   And then in the middle, there's some airlock
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.320]   where someone can knock on the door and say,
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.160]   "Will you let me in?"
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.000]   - There has to be.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.480]   - Because, well, yeah.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.440]   - I mean, I have all this infrastructure around my email,
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.600]   as many of us do, to filter it, to spamify it.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.080]   I mean, I don't wanna have to recreate that all in tools,
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.280]   Google Plus tools that may not even be as good.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.120]   - No, I agree, but I think you end up with different worlds,
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.960]   right?
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.760]   So LinkedIn is like one example of that airlock, right?
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.640]   Where you choose whether or not to go through it
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.240]   to meet somebody else on the other side,
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.200]   because you have signals that allow it, right?
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.120]   So at one level, it's like my students find that
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.200]   getting me on Twitter is sometimes easier than email,
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.440]   because my email is just a mess.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.440]   - Yeah, that's already happening to FACTO, exactly.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.280]   - Right.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.120]   - Right.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.680]   So, and that's a world where I have to follow you
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.840]   and all that, so I think that--
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.960]   - And Google's already set this up with these Google messaging
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.480]   that's built in, like if I go to your profile on G Plus,
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.520]   I could say send a message to Jeff.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.920]   There's a new button there.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.920]   - Right, but it's email though.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.960]   I mean, it still kind of lands in Jeff's pile
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.520]   of crazy email, you know?
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.440]   - Does it?
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.280]   - Yeah.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.120]   - It doesn't, okay, so if you use Gmail, it does.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.800]   - Well, but at Google Plus, what you can do is,
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.480]   they know they don't make us clear enough.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.520]   You can send a message just to what you can share
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.040]   with just one person.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.760]   - Right, so that's a message.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.120]   - That's the message that occurs.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.000]   The problem with that is when people do that,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.320]   I don't, there's no clear signal that says,
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.600]   this is private to you.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.880]   - Oh, that's a problem.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.200]   - That is, that-- - Yeah, it flows down
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.880]   and you don't see it, yeah, that's happened to me.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.520]   - Yeah, and I've had people say something,
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.360]   I think, wow, that's an odd thing to announce to the world.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.920]   And then I realize, oh, they're not announcing the world,
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.840]   they're just saying it to me.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.240]   - So what, but see, here's this,
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.440]   here's the send message button,
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.280]   this is new on the Google Press profile.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.040]   If I press that, it creates a Google Plus private message.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.240]   It's not an email.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.080]   - Trust me. - Oh, okay, that is, that is,
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.240]   so what happened, send that to me, Leo?
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.040]   - Or if you have someone to use a private message,
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.680]   well, you can respond to it too.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.920]   You, Jeff, and Cher, you know, this is something
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.840]   that this is kind of the hidden Google Plus
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.360]   because this could be going on all the time
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.520]   and we don't even know 'cause nobody sees it.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.480]   People may already be in the millions using Google Plus
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.560]   in lieu of email, we just wouldn't know that.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.080]   In fact, I do believe they've said that.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.160]   - The two to one, the current number, I think this is public,
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.840]   is two to one private public.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.480]   - Yeah, it's heading to a three to one.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.880]   - Yeah, so people are using it.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.280]   - Okay, so I got the message for you on top,
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.200]   so then I'll let me-- - So, and I'll show you,
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.960]   this is what it looks like to me,
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.600]   is that it says limited, it doesn't,
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.280]   you know, this is, we need more signals here,
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.680]   this is not enough to say limited,
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.200]   and you can say private to Jeff or something.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.720]   - No, it does, it does.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.120]   - Well, it could be limited to two people,
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:10.960]   I guess, why then?
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.400]   - Yeah, well, I should have a list of who I sent it to here.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.160]   That's one thing that's different than email.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.000]   I don't know who's seeing it. - Things that are just you.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.920]   - And now Jeff's responded, "In real time, I like that."
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.240]   - Can't you click on that limit?
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.640]   - So this is very buzzy.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.480]   - Can I click on it?
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.840]   - See who you sent it to?
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.880]   - Ah, there you go, so I can see that.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.560]   - Okay. - What, two people.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.080]   - Yeah, me and Jeff, yeah.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.600]   - Okay. - The Pilgrim and the Cowboy.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.320]   That's not a cowboy hat, it's a Pilgrim hat, by the way.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.600]   - Oh, excuse me. - It's November.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.480]   So I don't know, I think this is,
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.360]   this is in many circumstances,
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.920]   a suitable replacement for email.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:51.200]   It's a kind of, in between instant messaging and email.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.040]   - I just sent one back.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.800]   - On my profile, there's a send the message button
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.160]   and a send an email button, so that was my confusion.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.720]   - Ah. - Yeah.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.880]   - Because I've enabled that, like let people send me email.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:02.800]   And actually, I've been using that
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.080]   as my kind of personal email form forever,
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.040]   because I don't wanna just hand out my email.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.000]   - Well, and if you go to my profile on Google+,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.680]   you can message Leo, that's always been part of the profiles.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.520]   Thing, and yeah, see here,
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.640]   I could send a message or send an email to myself.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.800]   I don't know why I don't wanna do that, but I could.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.400]   - Right, so if you have a verified identity
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.160]   and somewhere another Google does it, right?
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.080]   It starts to become your canonical address in the world.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.800]   People can email you, but you have control,
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.000]   now gives you more control.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   They can only, they can message to you only if you allow that.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   It is not, it doesn't require the friend connection,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   the Facebook required for so long, so it can be.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.320]   I always get trouble on this show when I say it's asynchronous,
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.680]   I was supposed to say it's whatever.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.760]   All right, I know people, I know you got pissed off.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.720]   - Asymmetric. - Thank you, asymmetric.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.080]   - Asymmetric is the word you're looking for.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.800]   - I think it's actually somewhat both.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.640]   (laughing)
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.800]   I hope I'm not freezing like that.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   - And, right, so that becomes a really interesting
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.280]   new frontier here.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.800]   - You know, if they open an API,
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.120]   if they need a better API before they do too much of this,
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.680]   'cause then we could have tools,
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.880]   I'm just, I'm gonna miss the tools I have
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.680]   for filtering for processing in my mail clients.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.640]   Gina, you could write something if you would,
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.560]   I would appreciate that, thank you very much.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.120]   - Oh sure, I'll just also, I'll go back up this weekend.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.400]   Speaking of mail, Gmail of course now has a new interface,
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.280]   and I just for the first time saw the opportunity.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.720]   If you look in the lower right,
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.440]   I didn't see this earlier, but now it says,
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.240]   you see, switch to the new look, you click that
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.960]   and you'll get this, you'll automatically get
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.600]   upgraded to the new look soon, but if you don't want to wait,
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.480]   you can switch to the new look today
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.840]   and then click this button.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.320]   I saved this, I didn't do it until you were watching.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.440]   And now I'm switching to the new look,
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.200]   which looks a lot like the template that I was using,
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.720]   which was the new look.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.080]   They have new themes though, they have HD themes.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.280]   - Do they have some kind of new design guru
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.000]   who's doing all this?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.120]   - They said they were gonna do it,
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.240]   they did say they were gonna do this
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.520]   with the launch of Google+,
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.000]   that they were gonna do all of this.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.840]   I don't know. - It looks a lot like
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.120]   what it used to be, that theme that you're using,
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.680]   that minimal theme, but it's got a couple
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.480]   of cool little things to it.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.720]   Like it gracefully kind of resizes
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.360]   when you resize your browser window, which is nice.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.680]   The gadgets on the side, the sidebar are resizable.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.440]   So you can resize your labels, you can resize your,
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.960]   you know, your chat gadget.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.840]   It takes actually from Honeycomb, a little thing.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.520]   If you select a message, buttons appear
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.520]   with possible actions that you can perform
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.280]   on those messages at the top, on the action bar,
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.800]   similar to like an Android action bar, which is kind of neat.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.400]   So if you select a message,
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.000]   you'll see the buttons show up.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.640]   And the conversations like look a lot nicer too.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.920]   - I like this. - Oh, and search.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.840]   Search is really cool.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.760]   If you click that down arrow on the right side
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.480]   of the search box, you can specify like, yeah,
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.320]   from to the subject, which is awesome.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.960]   Yeah, that's really awesome.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.280]   - I always-- - Create a filter
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.360]   with this search, that's great.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.200]   - Yeah, and you create a filter right from there.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.600]   (humming)
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.880]   - Why is that? - Which is super neat.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.960]   - So this is good, this is encouraging to me
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.880]   because these are the tools I was talking about
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.560]   that I need for mail.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.480]   If this somehow integrates with Plus as well,
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.440]   then I would have the features though.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.160]   - Right, so you start to have this world
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.280]   of people I know versus people I don't know.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.880]   Email becomes for people I don't know.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.720]   - Got it.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   - Fancy, I lean, very fancy.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.640]   - I'm cheering. - Oh, yeah, that's the--
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.280]   - Trying to spruce it up for you guys.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.040]   (whooshing)
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.880]   - They're doing-- - And a--
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.960]   - Ooh, look up to mail with it, ooh, look up to it.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.800]   That's right.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.320]   Right, so does that work?
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.720]   People I know, people I don't know.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.560]   - Yeah.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.960]   - And that works for me.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.520]   I mean, I use Twitter direct messages
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.840]   and I am as my kind of whitelisted conversations, right?
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.920]   Like these are people who I've friended,
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.360]   who I know, who I trust well enough.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.200]   Like I am, for example.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.640]   I only put people on my I am buddy list
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.360]   who are friends and who are okay to interrupt me.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.600]   I don't want a stranger interrupting me,
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.560]   but like, but Matt, I am me yesterday complaining
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.280]   about Google Reader and I said, "Hey, come on Twig"
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.120]   and that's how this happened, you know?
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.280]   - Are you on her list?
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.960]   - Leo's totally on my I am list.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.800]   - I'm on my list.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.640]   - Yes you are.
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.440]   (laughing)
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.280]   - You know what I noticed?
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.040]   No longer says priority inbox is just inbox.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.400]   There doesn't seem like there's anything but priority
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.000]   in the box anymore.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.840]   Unless there's-- - Oh really?
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.080]   - It must be setting.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.120]   Well, in the last-- - That's another layer, right?
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.160]   So you have people you know on Google+,
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.160]   people who wanna know you in the airlock,
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.720]   people who you probably are okay with,
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.720]   which is priority in box and then everything else.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.280]   - Oh yeah, say call it important now.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.640]   - Important. - Yes, important.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.960]   - Important and unread.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.840]   - Also, if you click the gear on the upper right hand side,
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.720]   you can change the density.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.600]   - I know from comfortable to cozy to compact.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.800]   - I'm a cozy fan myself.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.440]   - Cozy, I don't know, compact.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.360]   I like to get a lot jammed in there.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.240]   - Yeah, you like high information density.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.920]   - Oh, I can see this is cozy.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.000]   This is what Gini, now you can go comfortable
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.240]   where you can spread the hell all over the place.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.120]   Or compact where you get thousands of messages
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.960]   into one little tiny page.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.400]   I like this.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.040]   - My favorite feature is the collapsing of,
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.000]   I guess signatures and replies and that little,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.180]   you get like a little three dot graphic.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:34.120]   And then if you click it expands on the fly
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.800]   and I notice people's long SIG files disappear and--
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.960]   - Yeah, that's handy.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.440]   - I'll tell you, this is making it more,
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.240]   you know, I never really use the G,
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.000]   I know this is heresy, but I usually use my own male client,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.960]   not the Gmail client, I use Apple male usually.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.360]   But this now has gotten so feature laden,
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.640]   particularly that bar on the right that says
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.680]   who you're talking to and what other,
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.040]   I mean, look at all this here on the right, Eileen.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.120]   - You're showing a email, so--
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.400]   - Oh, you don't wanna show your email?
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.680]   - Well, no, not mine.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.800]   It's the person that, it's a person.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.240]   - Okay, we don't wanna show that one,
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.080]   so let me go to--
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.320]   - Well, it's just a person, you know.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.200]   I mean, it's work.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.720]   - Here, I'll show my fidelity,
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.760]   but see, in order to do that,
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.840]   I have to show somebody with, wait a minute,
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.400]   don't, don't, don't.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.440]   - I just didn't want this person to get an address.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.880]   - Steve Gibson, no, but see,
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.280]   Steve has no personality, so he doesn't show up.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.680]   (laughing)
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.960]   Doesn't even have a picture.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.280]   - It's not my email I care about,
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.280]   it's the other person on the thread.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.560]   - Yeah, yeah, I understand why too,
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.440]   'cause he's somebody that people would love to meet.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.280]   Let me see.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.600]   - How do I change the--
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.880]   - I missed this, Leo, how do I change my email?
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.040]   - Oh, switch to New Look, there it is.
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.040]   - Yeah, but it's not everybody gets that right there.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.280]   And now see, they're okay,
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.760]   so this is short, I think everybody knows who he is.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.960]   So, see how I like this on the right though,
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.560]   where it shows, like I can follow him on Twitter,
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.000]   see how I wasn't, and look, look at that,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.640]   it's showing a little, so I'm gonna follow, yeah,
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.200]   that's good, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.600]   I don't wanna log in right now.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.440]   - Wow.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.360]   - I guess I have to, isn't that cool?
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.360]   Log in with Google now, oh my God, allow, allow, allow.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.120]   Connect, hey, yeah, yeah, this is something I've installed,
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.000]   this is reportive, I didn't--
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.800]   - Oh, okay, I was gonna say that's, yeah, that's the data.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.200]   - That's more than, yeah, return to Gmail.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.960]   Okay, so, but you're getting,
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.600]   are you getting this, or is this reportive over here?
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.440]   - I'm not getting that.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.600]   - Oh, oh, too bad, it's fun.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.200]   So let me turn off reportive then.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.360]   So what are you getting on the right?
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.400]   You're getting some of this though, right?
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.440]   - Yeah, I'm getting the names of the people
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.680]   in the conversation.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.520]   - Okay.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.360]   - That's mad.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.600]   - I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting,
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.120]   - Matt, you gotta unplug your headset
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.120]   and plug it in again.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.200]   Here, go off my email for a second,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.680]   and I'm gonna turn off reportive.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.520]   I don't even know, what is reportive?
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.920]   Connect your seclamium email,
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.120]   I don't even know what this is,
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.440]   I installed something I wish I didn't,
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.400]   I shouldn't do that, 'cause then I don't have a normal
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.320]   interface, but it was kinda cool, wasn't it?
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.720]   - How it, - Yeah.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.320]   - Yeah, so maybe you can plug it.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.760]   (laughing)
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.760]   I don't even know, this is the problem,
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.280]   and this is a real issue in general
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.880]   with adding all of features like this,
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.760]   is that people get this weird disconnect,
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.840]   like I'm looking at something,
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.720]   but I don't know where it came from,
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.960]   I don't know what it is, and to be honest,
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.120]   I have no idea how to turn it off.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.920]   - So Matt, this gives you the option to switch
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.560]   to the new look, or not switch to the new look.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.400]   Do you just wish that that had been the option for reader A,
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.320]   and B, do we think that you'll be able to hold on
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.280]   to your old link, look, Gmail forever?
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.880]   - No, I actually like the new Gmail.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:46.720]   I mean, I was my biggest concern with the Google readers,
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.880]   they just took out like 25, well, 50% of why I used it.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.080]   Like this is gone.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.360]   - Share, you love share.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.560]   - Yeah, and there's no migration client,
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.240]   you know, I'm seeing here reading an XML file
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.880]   and trying to build a new circle, which was crazy,
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.320]   and then it doesn't even offer the same functionality,
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.400]   but you know, Gmail, I really like it this morning,
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.320]   you know, when I first used about 20 minutes,
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.960]   I didn't like the loss of text labels,
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.600]   of just the little things on the top,
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.840]   but after 20 minutes, I memorized what archive is,
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.840]   so you know, I can hit that like a Skinner box.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   (laughing)
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.160]   - Archive, archive, archive.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.480]   - Yeah, and I realized today, like,
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.360]   Gmail's gotten really good in the last year or two,
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.120]   like I see maybe one or two spam is--
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.280]   - Oh, it's really good, isn't it?
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.280]   - A day maybe instead of per hour, like, you know,
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.720]   a year ago, it's been fantastic.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.600]   It's just getting better.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.080]   It's just slowly gotten mildly better
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.560]   to the point where I barely even notice, you know.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.360]   - A reportive is a, okay, I see it,
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:54.000]   it's a Chrome add-on, so I'll turn that off.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.560]   No, I'm confused, I don't even know.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.880]   - I did, I do see like a person I was emailing,
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.360]   I see a nice little icon away from all of them.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.160]   - That's something they added, yeah.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.400]   - And I see their last Google+ update that was public.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.240]   - Right.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.040]   - That's only one person I've seen do that.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.400]   - Hmm.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.200]   Let me look at somebody, so careful with my email here.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.960]   I always reveal more than I choose.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.840]   How about, do you mind if I show your vacation email, Eileen?
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.160]   - Yeah, sure, no, no, no.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.960]   (laughing)
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.160]   - Where are you going, Eileen?
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.320]   - I'm going to Hawaii, going to Maui.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.160]   - Well, it looks like--
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.000]   - Right on.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.520]   - Although January.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.320]   - Looks like reportive is still there, so nevermind.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.040]   I don't know, I thought I turned it off.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.720]   Anyway, okay, so it's a mixed bag, some good, some bad,
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.560]   but this is just the beginning, I think,
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.560]   of a complete redesign of everything Google.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.560]   And in order to, it's the G-plusification, right?
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.000]   That's the goal. - Plusification, yep.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.440]   - Plusification of everything, it's true.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.560]   - So if you don't like G-plus, you might not be too happy
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.800]   with it. - You will like G-plus.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.880]   - Plus, no choice.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.320]   You got no choice, enjoy everybody.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.280]   - Yeah, it sounds like if you wanna do anything social
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.920]   on Google, it's gonna be plus.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.320]   It's gonna be hooked in a plus, eventually,
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.880]   if it's not already. - Right.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.480]   - Which makes sense for Google.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:20.560]   - Okay, anything else about reader we wanna say?
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.520]   Do you think, I mean, really truthfully,
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.360]   this is, how Google must be looking at how many people
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.240]   use reader and say there's not really a whole bunch
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.080]   of people here.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.960]   This is kind of a, reading, if feed reader,
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.840]   does that even make sense anymore in this?
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.040]   - Well, that's the other question, is RSS.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.280]   I mean, how many feeds do you have in your reader
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.360]   that you never ever touch?
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.160]   - 1,000 plus.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:47.080]   It's always 1,000 plus, on read articles.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.080]   - Yeah, after Life Hacker, I basically switched
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.760]   to Twitter almost entirely. - Right.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.680]   - But I mean, I was in a weird kind of situation.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.120]   At Life Hacker, I mean, I had to pound through
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.720]   my RSS reader every single day.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.840]   I had to treat it like an inbox.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.800]   So it just became equated with work for me.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.360]   But I think that switched from reading RSS
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.880]   and blogs, kind of the old school way
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.400]   with the feed reader and switching to Facebook or Twitter
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.800]   and getting your links that way.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.360]   - It's a better signaling system.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.800]   It's just a better-- - Right.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.680]   - It's sharing as the new means of
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.240]   - It's collaborative. - Discovery and distribution.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.520]   - Yeah, it's collaborative.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:25.960]   And yet, well, Matt, why make a case for news readers?
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.960]   - Yeah, you know, it's tough because it's like a niche nerd.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.680]   I am, and you know, it makes no money for Google.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.920]   Google's strange, you know, when I visited there last month,
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.240]   I was hanging out with the AdSense teams
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.080]   and the teams were extremely small.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.040]   Like it would boggle your mind
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.000]   that billions of dollars are moving through like,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.920]   you know, a small cube farm.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.080]   You could see all sides of 30 people are in charge
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.360]   of something that's bringing in over a billion dollars.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.640]   - It's psychotic. - Yeah.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.080]   - And then you realize there's 15,000 employees.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.840]   Only the people in the ad groups
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.960]   are the ones making money from Google.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.520]   You know, everyone else is just sort of sucking up resources
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.120]   and making cool tech.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.520]   It's really-- - 31,000.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.360]   (laughing)
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.200]   - Yeah, it's just really strange.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.040]   It's really strange.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.560]   The ad people aren't treated like gods.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.520]   You know, like the people who are making Google Maps,
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.920]   you know, are respected on the campus.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.880]   But, you know, really, it's all about, you know,
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.840]   what makes money, I guess.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.840]   So I know Google Reader's has this tiny little niche product.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.040]   I know I was using it in a really niche way
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.920]   with other super tech nerds, but it was very, you know,
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.040]   awesome and compelling and perfect for me.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.960]   I cut my feeds down to maybe 250 or 300 blogs,
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.840]   so I could treat it like an inbox, you know,
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.280]   that could get to zero in a day.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.120]   - Ah!
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:43.960]   (laughing)
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.760]   - But I noticed that everyone just moved to Twitter
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.080]   for link sharing, you know, delicious has sort of been
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.360]   dying out, definitely is with the redesign.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.120]   And pin boards sort of, like network activity
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.440]   is where I used to watch for interesting stuff.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.840]   And now I just sort of watch Twitter.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.480]   But Twitter doesn't, there's not like aggregation tools
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.120]   that show me, like give me the hottest links
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.760]   among the whatever 400 people I follow that were shared today.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.960]   Like what are the two or three collisions there?
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.560]   I haven't seen anything like that.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.880]   Seems like a tool that needs to be built.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880]   - Hmm.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.480]   I think it's such a moving target.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.480]   It's so hard to know how people, every, you know,
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.960]   five months, everything changes about how people
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.800]   consume content on the net.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.240]   You know, I'll give you an example.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.520]   I'm looking at the Verge, which they've done a beautiful job.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.360]   This is Joshua Topolsky and Cruz, you know,
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.400]   the guys who left in gadgets, next big thing.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:40.400]   And it's a beautiful website with beautifully designed.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.360]   And I think a very modern, you know, kind of tablet-y
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.120]   and all of this, but I wonder, you know,
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.000]   I don't really go to sites anymore,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.200]   even Life Hacker, to read stuff.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.720]   I replaced that long ago with news readers
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.960]   and now replaced news readers with Google+, Facebook.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.640]   - And look at what Facebook's doing with Guardian
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.160]   and perfect example.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.000]   - Right, yeah.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.320]   - You know, I call it the Peter Butter Strategy.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.600]   You want your content to be spreadable and embeddable.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.440]   - Everywhere.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.680]   - So what do you think of something like this,
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.800]   which is really, I mean, this is, you know,
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.080]   you'd asked me a couple of years ago, I said,
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.040]   this is the future of magazines.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.840]   And now I'm wondering if this has a future at all,
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.520]   as great as it is, I mean, it's beautiful.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.840]   And there are long form articles and they're, you know,
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.160]   beautifully designed.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.080]   Every article has a really strong image associated with it.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.280]   And of course, from their point of view,
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.080]   they want you to go hit this because this is where the ads are.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.000]   But they-- - But, but Leo,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.760]   then that's where the Facebook model works,
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.520]   is your ads go with you to Facebook.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.680]   - Yeah, and notice they're not as chewing
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.280]   this social sharing, they've got like tweet,
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.720]   plus one stumble upon.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.080]   - I would like to be able to embed that
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.600]   in a Google+ post, right?
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.760]   - These-- - I might be able to take the
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.320]   article like a YouTube, I can embed a YouTube video
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.600]   in Google+, why shouldn't I be able to embed that article?
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.280]   - Well, that's up to them and I bet you can
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:05.320]   because that's up to their, the tags, the meta info
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.880]   they put in there.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.200]   In other words, there's no means now to embed a whole article
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.360]   into a Google+ post. - Oh, you know,
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.800]   not the entire article, I see what you're saying.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.000]   - Right, I want to embed the whole thing--
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.080]   - I don't know, I don't know.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.360]   I mean, I remember there's meta tags that Google uses
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.760]   to find, you know, and format this data.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.360]   I don't know if you can't make it be the entire text.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.560]   - Oh, you want one quote, I just want to know
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.360]   that you can today.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.200]   - And you?
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.320]   - Anybody?
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.240]   Matt, Gina?
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.200]   - I mean-- - Remember--
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.040]   - There's these tags. - You know,
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.160]   a full school like iFrame, you know.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.920]   - Yeah, I mean, it should travel with the brand
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.520]   and the revenue and-- - But what,
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.200]   yeah, what you're saying, Jeff, is if I paste in a link,
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:48.080]   for a site, just as I do with YouTube,
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:53.200]   shouldn't it, as it does with YouTube,
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.560]   be a beautifully formatted Google+ article.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.520]   And I kind of find this because they're--
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.640]   - Why should you have to go click off to the other site?
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.480]   - Right. - Says the--
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.560]   - You should be able to expand it
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.840]   and see the whole thing. - You are right there
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.320]   and you'll end up getting more readers
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.440]   'cause they don't have to travel as far.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.280]   And Gina's right, you know, the only thing you do now
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.360]   is an awkward iFramey thing,
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:16.480]   but Facebook has gone one step in that way,
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.280]   which is toward having an alternate homepage
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.440]   for those sites.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.240]   The next step is to have an alternate display
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.360]   of a piece of content embedded,
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.200]   and then do you really need the site anymore?
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.040]   Somebody said it to me today,
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.080]   well, what about, is that where a flip board is?
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.240]   And I said, you know, I think about it,
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.640]   I use flip board for the first month that I have my iPad.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.960]   I haven't used it in three months.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.840]   - I do actually still use flip board to browse articles.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.560]   - What's, this is the point, is that we're in a very
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.720]   rapidly changing area about how people consume content.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.720]   And I mean, some people are reader,
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.360]   but I think that's a small number.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.520]   A lot of people are doing it on social networks,
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.480]   using that as a signaling system.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.880]   And I think if Google's smart,
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.920]   I agree with you, Jeff, what they should do is,
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.080]   you know, right now, if you paste a YouTube link in,
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.240]   it formats it just right.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.400]   You see, it gives you the video, it gives you the title,
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.960]   it gives you a paragraph.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.520]   And I know that as a webmaster,
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.640]   you can put the appropriate meta tags into your content
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.920]   that will help Google format it properly.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.520]   And so, yeah, I know that.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.200]   And some people do and some people don't.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.160]   What I'm wondering is,
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:23.600]   see, here's an example, this website has done that.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.720]   And the question is, can you format it in such a way
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.560]   that it's more than just a paragraph
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.600]   that you have the whole article there and it expands?
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.440]   - Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm not.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.560]   I think you can only specify like the summary and the image.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.400]   - Okay.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.040]   So I worked on BetterGReader,
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.000]   which is a Firefox extension for Google Reader,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.960]   which is now basically doesn't work at all
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.320]   because of the redesign.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.720]   That's another thing, I'll try to update it.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.840]   But we had this one script that basically, you know,
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.200]   let you see the original,
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.040]   which just replaced the item, the RSS item
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.560]   with the entire page, but inside an iframe.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.240]   And people like that 'cause they wanted to see
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.520]   the original page, it was kind of, it's really clunky
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.760]   'cause you see all the ads from the originating site
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.920]   and it would often spread beyond the viewport for the item.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.640]   So it gets tricky, you know,
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.560]   embedding content like that.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.320]   I mean, you know, there's the ads question.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.880]   - Iframe is absolutely a hack and not the one.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.240]   - Yeah, it's a terrible hack.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.000]   - Well, what you really want and I wish Google would provide
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.680]   is a set of tags that is not just description title summary,
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.800]   full article.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.940]   - Full article. - And it could have
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.640]   - Yes. - Yes.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.680]   And if they're smart, they'll do that
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.600]   because then Google Plus becomes your reader
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:36.200]   and you just like flip board, you can scan through,
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.960]   but it's flip board, you get all the signals.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.320]   I guess that's what flip board does
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.080]   'cause it's pulling from Twitter feeds.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.360]   - Well, I'm hearing that Facebook with its new structure
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.440]   is feeding back to the publishers better data
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.800]   than their own systems have or new data.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.520]   - That's what you need to do.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.680]   - Yeah. - And Facebook knows
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.400]   so much about the reader, they can do that.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.720]   And that's where Apple, I think made a little bit
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:56.560]   of a mistake. - Exactly.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.400]   - Apple says, no, we want to hold on to that.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.240]   - Right. - Right.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.120]   - I mean, Google could do that
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.120]   with RSS right now, right?
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.680]   Because with RSS, you know what the full text article is.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.400]   In some cases you have an excerpt,
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.160]   you have the headline and the title.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.880]   So if someone shared something on Google,
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.440]   Google had to auto-detect RSS and do all that for you.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.080]   But right now, I think it's about proving to publishers
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.200]   that Google Plus drives traffic to their sites
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.680]   so that people can see ads.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.080]   - Right, but the ads can travel with the content.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.240]   - That's the future. - Right.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.720]   - YouTube ads travel with it.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.680]   All right, all right, get your glasses ready people.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.920]   Get your glasses ready to drinking game about to start.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:31.760]   (laughing)
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.600]   - Oh boy.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.080]   - Before Gutenberg,
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:40.200]   you know, Eisenstein says that the scholars had to travel
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.600]   town to town to the books.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.360]   And then after the press, the books travel to the scholars.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.480]   Well, in that metaphor, we're still being made to travel
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.400]   site to site town to town.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.520]   The content should come to us.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.160]   And as long as the business model
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.640]   and the business rule and revenue is there,
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.600]   then I've got to believe in the long run,
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:02.720]   it's valuable for a content brand to have its content
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.280]   with advertising, with brand, with links, with analytics,
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.040]   embedded all around.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.400]   That's the extension of social.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.880]   - And by then you look at something like The Verge
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.840]   and they've designed this great landing page,
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.280]   beautiful looking, really designed to draw you to the page,
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.200]   except that that's not, people know,
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.560]   I don't think people have in years gone to a website
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.080]   to read the contents on the website.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.600]   That's not how it works.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:28.560]   - Well, you guys are kind of conflating yourself
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.360]   as customers for even The Verge.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:35.080]   And really The Verge is, I mean, not saying cynical,
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:39.840]   but they're really, I don't know how to put this,
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.040]   they're designed for searches two years from now.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.680]   Like have you noticed that there's a product page
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.040]   with like the product title, like every story
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.160]   we've ever heard about that product?
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.560]   That's a search landing page.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.120]   You're talking about you and I looking at ads,
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.280]   like we're inconsequential.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.480]   We're like a rounding error.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.360]   - It's really getting those search results.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.720]   - Yeah, it's like, I mean, that's the business model
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.680]   of even meta filters.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.640]   Like 80% of the traffic to the server
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.280]   is people looking at one page
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.720]   and they've never looked the site ever.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.840]   - Exactly.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.120]   So then that's been going on for a long time.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.880]   - So I mean, that's the key for that.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.200]   - Yeah, search and sharing.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.360]   You've got three levels of discovery of content, right?
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.160]   Brand, search and sharing now.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.200]   So brand is a homepage, which is an expression
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.160]   of editorial ego and brand.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.080]   Search is exactly what you just said, Matt.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.560]   People coming in from wherever
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.920]   and sharing is embedding it out there
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.520]   where you recommend it at places like G+,
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.560]   and you've got to have all three strategies.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.880]   But editorially, I know, because I is one,
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.720]   we love the homepage because that's the thing we control,
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.760]   the other two we don't control.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.920]   - Yeah, I'm saying, but we account for one to 5%
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.680]   of their revenue.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.960]   Random like gadget freaks reading the site every day
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.200]   or not reading the site or reading it by RSS.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:01.120]   I'm saying this silent majority is like 80, 85%
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.280]   is like not us.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.120]   - Search.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:03.960]   - It's not designed.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.520]   - Yes, I agree.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.800]   But then why do they put so much effort
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.160]   into a beautiful homepage?
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.240]   - Yeah, good question.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.160]   - You know, I almost argue that you shouldn't have a homepage.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.800]   Like Google doesn't have a homepage.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   - Right.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.640]   - It is a box.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.000]   - I guess you do a homepage because,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.680]   I mean, you gotta cover the bases.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.960]   - Yeah, but the way it works inside places is people go
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.280]   berserk about the homepage.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.400]   This is the math point.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.400]   And they don't pay nearly enough attention to the pages
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.360]   that people actually come to
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.320]   and they're the only ones people experience.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.760]   - So is the future something like this,
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.080]   Washington Post social reader embedded in Facebook?
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.640]   Is that the future?
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.120]   - I think it's part of the future.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.480]   Someone, when I was behind the NDA wall at Google
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.960]   kind of made fun of it because they said,
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.560]   "Well, that's just an alternative homepage."
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.320]   But I think that, yeah, when you get down
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.640]   to the article level and look at what Google+ has done,
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.640]   it's mixing news and conversation.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:00.080]   So how do you get your stuff in that mix?
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.920]   And how are you given formatting abilities to do that?
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.920]   That's where I think it goes.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.640]   - Well, and you go back to your Facebook page
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.520]   and then everybody who's reading the social reader
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.600]   shows up in the ticker on the right
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:15.200]   as it scrolls by saying, "Oh, I was reading Gareth's reading this."
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.080]   Daniel's reading that.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.320]   Imogenes listening to this.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.840]   - And now go to something like music, right?
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.600]   - Well, we're both Google and Facebook.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.800]   Let your friends listen to what you're listening to.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.400]   That's the new radio airplay.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.880]   - Right.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.080]   The smart strategy from Facebook's point of view.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.360]   And I wonder if it reflects closer
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.920]   to how people consume content.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.440]   - Then we're moving. - Then a home site.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.120]   Or a news reader.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.320]   Right?
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.160]   - Yeah.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.840]   - Gina, do you still use a news reader per se?
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.240]   I mean, you tell you got rid of it and go to Twitter.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.840]   - Do you use it at all?
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.880]   - I use it on Wednesday mornings to prepare for Twig.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.720]   - Right.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.560]   - Right.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.440]   - I mean, it's a special case, but you're right.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.760]   But it's part of our beat check.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.600]   - Yeah.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.400]   - In the old days of radio news reporting,
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.680]   you do a beat check every morning.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.120]   You'd call the fire department, the police department.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:08.960]   That's what we do.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.880]   We're doing our beat check, but that's a very specialized use.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.720]   - Yes.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.200]   - Actually, the truth is I go to techmeme
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.560]   and news.google.com.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:17.560]   And that's pretty much it.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.960]   I go to the technology news on Google
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.320]   and I go to the techmeme
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.640]   when I need to find out what happened today.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.520]   And the techmeme is all about signals.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.480]   - Yeah.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:31.760]   - It's Gabe Rivera, but it's a specialized form of signals.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.480]   But then I follow day in day out,
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.960]   I'm following Twitter and Google,
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.040]   actually Google+ has become more and more the place I go.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.840]   - Yeah.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.080]   - I like the tone of the conversation there.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.120]   - It's also a great place to find,
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.360]   increasingly a great place to find links.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.000]   And it seems to be that memes and other things
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.680]   surface faster on Google+, at least--
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.440]   - Yeah, I see things really fast on+ too.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.080]   - And more legibly, 'cause the problem with Twitter
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.440]   is it's cryptic.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.280]   - Yes.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.520]   - I can't figure out what the hell I'm reading.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.840]   I'm getting old.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.160]   I don't understand all this stuff.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.640]   - Yeah, and it's just good for conversation.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.840]   - Why can't you speak English?
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.840]   - Speak English!
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.800]   - It's great for conversation.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.200]   I posted a problem I was having with some think of development
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.800]   a couple of weeks ago, I got, you know,
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.520]   I had the privilege of having a lot of, being a lot of circles
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.440]   'cause Google put me on their suggested list.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.400]   I got like 90 comments, all of some great suggestions,
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.440]   totally solved my problem, posted a follow up,
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.320]   thanking everyone, like it's just a really good place
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.680]   to do kind of Q and A, asking for suggestions
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.200]   and just getting into conversations about things.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.720]   Not in a way that you just can't do on Twitter.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.600]   And because it's super tech nerds on Google+
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.960]   it's just conversations you couldn't have on Facebook.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.200]   - Right.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.920]   That's not gonna last.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.840]   Not if Google has anything--
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.400]   - Well, not if, yeah, if things go Google's way.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.280]   - That's an audience selection.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.320]   That's the same thing with Quora, right?
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.480]   People say Quora's great if you act now.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.320]   - Yeah, right now.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.800]   - Silicon Valley startup with problems about your servers
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.720]   you get awesome answers and you get them.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.320]   - How did you handle that on MetaFilter?
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.640]   'Cause that's the same exact thing happened with MetaFilter, right?
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.560]   - What?
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.040]   - Well, initially MetaFilter was a geek community.
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.960]   It's still a pretty geeky community.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.000]   - It's fine. I mean, we meter sort of the sign up.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.280]   So like the crowd isn't too big.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:22.320]   So there's like 10 to 12,000 people using the site everyday
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.600]   and answering questions.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.800]   So that's, we found that's like a big enough number
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.640]   where chances are two or three people have experienced
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.320]   whatever you could possibly imagine.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.960]   You're asking about.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.680]   But it's not so much.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.680]   Yeah, I always think like 10,000 people's a good number
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.400]   'cause everyone's done everything
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.200]   or had experience with everything.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.760]   And then it's not so much that you're like,
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.280]   Yahoo answers yelling into the void of strangers.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.760]   - That's an important moment.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.400]   We have the Dunbar number.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.600]   We just got the Howie number.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.680]   - Howie number.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.600]   - 10,000.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:53.440]   - But you know what?
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.480]   - 10,000 is enough experience.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.040]   - I'm speaking on Tuesday to PubCon
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.720]   which is a big marketing SEO conference in Vegas.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:05.720]   And one of the things that I wanna talk about is
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:10.680]   we do have, it's kind of in the air that you should get bigger.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.720]   You should grow your audience.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:12.920]   You should always get bigger.
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.800]   Whether it's media, websites,
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.480]   Metafilter, Google+, bigger is always better.
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.000]   More people means more revenue, grow it bigger.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.280]   But I think there's a really big question about culture
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.560]   and focus.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.520]   And I think Matt, you hit the nail on the head.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.360]   There's a size, maybe it's 10,000.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.240]   You don't wanna get bigger than that.
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.080]   Because it--
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:30.920]   - I think that's right, Leo.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.840]   - And it was true of media too.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.600]   Because it's the old myth of media that we sold
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.920]   was that every reader saw every ad.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.920]   And so we wanted more readers
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.120]   that we could charge ever more for the ads.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.800]   Well, that's not the case anymore.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.680]   When you, the only people who see the ads
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.880]   are the people who look at that page
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.840]   and that ad is there for a reason.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.400]   And so can you become too big?
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.560]   Yes, I've seen one site that has,
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.400]   the pursuit of page views,
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.480]   got them to go crazy on SEO.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.360]   And got them to bring in all kinds of irrelevant traffic.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.440]   The cost spent with and gives them no revenue.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.440]   - It's what happened to tech TV.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.880]   It's what happens to every TV network.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.880]   And that's why Bravo sucks and Discovery sucks.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.920]   And it's one of the things that I realized here at Twit
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.320]   and we do not wanna grow.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.680]   - Wow.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.560]   - We do not, most media they say,
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.560]   how can I get more audience?
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.000]   I do not want more audience.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.520]   I wanna, an audience that I know how to serve
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.120]   that's a very specific unique audience.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.320]   I don't wanna grow up past that.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.960]   People say, why don't you do more marketing?
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.560]   I don't know.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.400]   - Wow.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.240]   - I'm not gonna--
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.160]   - Well, but your new properties,
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.280]   you're going to the Howie rule here, right?
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:38.040]   I presume the Twig still wants to grow some.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.360]   - Well, we don't want it to make,
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.600]   look, it's more than 10,000.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.720]   But so our number is not the Howie number.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:48.520]   But there maybe is another number for broadcast media.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.600]   And actually, I think it depends on the niche that you're in.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.200]   But I wanna, I only wanna grow to the extent
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.600]   that we serve the people, you know,
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.480]   if you're the kind of person that would like this,
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.760]   then sure, but I'm not gonna change this
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.520]   to increase the number of people who like it.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.680]   - Right, right, I like that.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.600]   That's really interesting.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.360]   - It's a very different way of looking at media.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.160]   I don't think it's typical.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.000]   - No, not at all.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:09.840]   I think it's unique.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.640]   - And I think the number in podcasting,
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.600]   if I hate that word,
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.280]   but is more around 150 to 250,000.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.200]   That's the media number.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.040]   - That's interesting.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.600]   - Any more of that, you've loaded it.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.440]   - It's interesting.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.720]   I definitely struggle with that at Life Hacker.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.240]   You know, this constant pressure to go more mainstream,
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.200]   and I think it really resulted in some, you know,
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.840]   lower quality content.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:33.680]   - It's a mistake. - Definitely did.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.800]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:35.880]   - And it takes some courage,
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:40.400]   and frankly, some willingness not to become a mogul.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.760]   (laughs)
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.040]   To say no.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.680]   But in the long run, you do better
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.200]   because you know that audience,
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.600]   you serve that audience well.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.160]   Advertisers know what they're getting.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.520]   You're getting an engaged audience,
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.440]   not a halfway awake audience.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.960]   It just makes sense to me.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:56.800]   And I think-- - This is why
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.080]   I'll never get investors, right?
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:58.920]   - Yeah, but that's fine.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.120]   And I don't want investors,
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.040]   'cause I know that one of the things investors do is say,
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.360]   grow, that's how they, that's the whole idea.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.720]   Grow our investment.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.920]   So that's why we don't want investors.
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.840]   We've always wanted to just serve that niche properly.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.600]   And now I think the niche grows
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.560]   because there's more and more people interested in tech,
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.080]   more and more of these tech enthusiasts.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.920]   - And more topics based on your platform.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:21.760]   - Yeah. - But we're gonna do
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.920]   a gaming show, so that grows it into a different area.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:28.400]   But it's still aimed at enthusiasts, you know?
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.120]   - That's the perversion of both media and investment then.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.960]   - Exactly. - I would love,
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.600]   this is a hint, I would love to invest in Twit, right?
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.600]   As an annuity.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.920]   - Think about it more that way.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.520]   - Yes. - Yes, I own a share of it
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.880]   and you keep on making money
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.080]   and I keep on getting checks,
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.800]   which thank you very much again anyway.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.480]   But in terms of an investment structure,
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.920]   that if you're a new media business,
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.280]   like my entrepreneurial students,
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.400]   you could live that way.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.200]   But I had to separate content businesses from platforms
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.840]   or as Reed Hoffman described it to me,
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.680]   entrepreneurial from free agent nation.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.920]   You're more in creating a world of free agent nations
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.160]   where Twit and Twig and Android and so on
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.080]   are all on a platform and all have a model,
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.440]   but all have a limited size.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.600]   That's really interesting, Liam.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.360]   - Well, it goes well beyond that
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:19.560]   to the whole notion of sustainable growth in general.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.440]   Because we have this crazy notion that progress means growth
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.920]   and we have seven billion people on this planet now.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:31.200]   There is a limited, there's a finite set of resources.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.440]   There's a finite set of room,
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.520]   there's a finite set of water,
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.760]   there's a finite set of oil.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:39.520]   And unlimited continual growth at an exponential level
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.880]   breaks everything.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.280]   And there's actually, we did an interview
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.720]   with him, it was fascinating
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.880]   on I think it was on Dr. Kiki's Science Hour.
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:51.000]   There's a whole movement, not much listened to
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.960]   'cause no president, no government,
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.400]   nobody's gonna go with this.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.240]   - Right.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.440]   - And you say, wait a minute,
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.640]   is unfettered growth the right way to go?
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.800]   And it isn't in any respect.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.240]   - Or is it even possible anymore?
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.280]   - It isn't, by South by Southwest talk
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.280]   is gonna be honey, we shrunk the economy.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.120]   - Yeah.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.360]   - That argues that, I think we discussed this before,
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.000]   but the technology leads to efficiency over growth.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.560]   So you can't wish for growth anymore
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:17.600]   when things like retail and media
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.640]   are shrinking by their new architecture.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.960]   - Right.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.680]   - South by Southwest might be a good example
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.800]   of something that can do too much.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.600]   - Good point, really good.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.440]   (laughing)
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.080]   - Sorry, I love these out loud, but.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.240]   - No, really good.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.480]   - The howie rule.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.120]   (laughing)
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:34.960]   - Totally.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.520]   - Well, we're, you know what?
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:37.520]   - I don't go to it anymore.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.680]   - Humans are greedy.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:42.240]   Humans are greedy, we always want more.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.520]   - But when it kind of ruins the experience,
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.360]   - It ruins it.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.040]   - Comic Con is the same thing, you know?
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.760]   Like, I think, you know, events that get too popular
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.080]   and they just keep kind of keep upping the.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.360]   - Gina, what do you do then about the exclusivity issue
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.600]   that people want to participate in this
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.880]   and they can't because nanny, nanny, I mean,
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.720]   'cause I'm a veteran or I got in early,
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.400]   that's a problem too though, isn't it?
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.000]   - It is, I mean, I'm to the point where I just,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.960]   I'm like, very consciously opting to out
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.320]   of those really huge events and looking for the smaller,
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.960]   sort of more up and coming events,
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.240]   which, you know, are just a better,
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.880]   just because they're a better experience.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.160]   Yeah, I don't know what the solution is for South by.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.800]   I don't know if it's live streaming or, you know,
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:28.000]   doing some remote, but I think they would do really well
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.760]   to maybe focus on a little more.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.120]   - We need a North by East by and a West by.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.480]   - Well, I want to start a business
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.920]   that puts the control of deciding to do events
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.920]   in the hands of the speakers, organizers,
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.120]   whatever you call it, right?
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.480]   And the people formerly know is the audience
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.400]   and takes it out of the hands of the conference organizers
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.840]   and takes it out of the hands of the speakers,
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.480]   the euros and all that.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:54.040]   And so you could see if you have critical mass
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:57.640]   for a North by and Kickstarter and start an event
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.040]   that's your own event.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.400]   You know, I looked at pop tech is going to Iceland
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.760]   and I would, I'm dying to go to Iceland
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.600]   and I'd love to go to that,
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.400]   but then I looked at the price of $5,000 and I say,
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.240]   "Never mind."
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.240]   - Yeah.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.000]   Yeah, I think, I think just having new events,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.640]   I think new events can spring out of frustrations
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.840]   from people like myself and Matt
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.600]   who are just like, I'm not going to South by Southwest,
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.160]   but I'm going to go to, you know,
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.640]   I don't know how to come back to come on or something.
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.000]   - You go to South by this year.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.160]   - It's not the part.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.160]   (laughing)
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.040]   - You know, you two were the reason why I went last year.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.680]   - We want to do twig from there.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:27.760]   - No, I know.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.840]   We'll talk about this on time.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.680]   - Can just go this year.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.280]   And we'll forget it next year.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.960]   - They're actually--
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:35.800]   - They're actually--
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.040]   - They're actually unfortunately fairly arrogant too,
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.600]   which adds to the mess of it because for instance,
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.640]   they asked me if I would host,
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:45.360]   I don't know, there's some kind of a startup thing
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.400]   they're doing, the two days with the startup stuff.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.440]   And we said, yeah, we'd love to
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:53.520]   if we could get badges for our staff to the conference.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.480]   And if you could help us book a room for our event there.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.160]   And they said, oh no, we're not going to give you anything.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.760]   We just want you to do two days.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.480]   (laughing)
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.720]   Oh, never mind.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.720]   'Cause I'm not going to do that.
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.120]   It's like, if there's a certain,
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.640]   like we're South by, you should just do this.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.920]   So anyway, I don't, by the way,
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:10.280]   that's dirty laundry, I don't want to--
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.160]   - All right, Leo, Leo, Leo, you've got to go
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.720]   to the event business.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.560]   - No, I don't.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.400]   See?
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:16.240]   - You see?
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.160]   - You see what the pressures are?
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.880]   And that's exactly it, I'm sticking to my knitting, baby.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:23.080]   You know, Steve Jobs came in when he came back to Apple
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:24.280]   and he went up on the whiteboard
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.000]   and he drew a quadrant, four things.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.520]   Apple had like 20 products.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:31.680]   He said, four products, consumer pro, portable desktop.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.920]   That's it.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:34.520]   And it was brilliant, right?
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:37.960]   Simplify, streamline, we don't need to grow.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.120]   We just want to serve our audience better.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.320]   And if, you know, the problem that South by has,
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.680]   I don't think South by lost sight of its goals,
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.520]   I think they're still doing it.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.600]   It's just that the number of people
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.400]   who wanted to go got out of control.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.240]   - Yeah.
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.080]   - And that's a normal evolution.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.240]   I don't think that that's something you could blame
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.080]   the South by--
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.440]   I don't know, maybe you can't, I don't know them,
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.160]   but I don't think that that's something
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.200]   you blame the organizers for.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.920]   So there's different kinds of growth.
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.720]   And I could see us getting too big, you know,
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:03.760]   if we had 20 million people with all different constituencies
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.840]   and different, that we couldn't manage it.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.080]   Matt?
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.840]   - Yeah.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.000]   (laughs)
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.440]   Well, I think South by Southwest,
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.240]   the organizers they're serious about.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.600]   They could have, you know,
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.440]   they could have done something.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.280]   - They could have done something.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.360]   - Up the price to 500 bucks from 200,
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.120]   or make it a thousand bucks like a normal tech conference,
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.080]   bring the numbers down to something manageable.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:26.440]   I mean, it was just, there's lines everywhere,
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:27.560]   it's hard to get food.
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:28.680]   I mean, it's just impossible.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.520]   It's just the whole thing.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.240]   - I don't think that, 'cause that makes it more exclusive.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.200]   I don't think being more exclusive is a good idea.
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.440]   I think, you know, look at TED.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.200]   What is it, $5,000?
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.480]   - Yeah. - No lines at TED.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:41.560]   - And invitation only.
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.040]   - Yeah, you get to sit down right now.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.000]   - You get invited to spend $5,000.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.840]   - And obnoxious.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.800]   - And it's, yeah, that doesn't improve accessibility.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.400]   So I think really the weighted channel,
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.640]   South by exactly what you said,
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.760]   which is divided into more conferences.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.360]   Spread it out, spread the wealth.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.360]   Hey, we gotta take a break.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.600]   God, we're already like an hour into the show
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.200]   and I have done one commercial.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.120]   Can I do a commercial just quickly?
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:04.960]   And then we'll get on.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.280]   There's so much to talk about.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.120]   I know, we have three, and there's a fly.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.840]   Where do these flies come from?
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.680]   - I don't know.
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.080]   Tom killed a fly on the air when he was in.
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:15.920]   - Really? - Like that?
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:16.960]   - I know that I do your insight.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.680]   - We wouldn't have a lot to talk about.
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:22.360]   - Who was the guy who was it jobs?
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.080]   Or was it Bill Gates who just caught a fly like that?
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.480]   And you're gonna interview?
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.760]   - He was an Obama.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:28.600]   - It was Obama.
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:29.800]   It was a president.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:30.640]   - Yes.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.120]   - Can we bring him in here to catch these flies?
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.320]   - Tom can do it for you, he's done.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:38.400]   - Surely he has, he needs something to do right now.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.840]   Go to me, no, put it up there.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:40.680]   That's good.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.960]   That's exactly what I wanted to talk about.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:44.080]   Ladies and gentlemen, our friends at Citrix
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.640]   give us the wherewithal to do this.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.880]   And run of the reasons, they're not looking for
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.680]   100 million people.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:52.120]   They know that the people who watch this show
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.760]   are their best potential customers,
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:58.640]   'cause you're savvy, and you use technology to help you
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.160]   get your jobs done, get on with life.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.720]   And this is what Go to Meeting's all about.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:03.960]   It's an online meeting service.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.440]   Okay, we know those are great.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.800]   It's very fast, very secure, very easy to use Mac
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.800]   or PC, completely cross platform.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:12.520]   You're by the way, the people who do the Go to Meeting,
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:15.920]   you know, that you go to, like if you're doing a sales call,
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.960]   they don't have to have it installed.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.240]   Ahead of time, you don't have to support them,
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.400]   you just give them a link.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.840]   We're gonna have a meeting at two o'clock on Thursday.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.360]   They click the link 30 seconds later,
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.640]   they're seeing your screen.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:29.800]   And now with the new HD faces, they're seeing you.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.360]   And you're seeing them.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.600]   Go to Meeting has added video.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.960]   So this is stuff, this is as good as the dedicated
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:40.600]   tele-present systems that are being sold for 10s, 20s,
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.800]   hundreds of thousands of dollars to big businesses.
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:45.240]   You got it right now and you got it in your laptop.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.240]   You got it in your desktop and you even have it
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.440]   in your iPad.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.840]   You can't hold a meeting on your iPad,
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.480]   but you're gonna tend a meeting on your iPad.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.480]   You don't even need a phone.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.360]   You just plug in your microphone and your earbuds.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.960]   And the sound, the video, the whole thing
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.960]   is happening on your iPad.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.920]   I just think it's just the best way
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.080]   to make your business more efficient,
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.400]   to get more done, travel less,
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.960]   and make your meetings more engaging,
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.280]   more personal with that video.
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.120]   I love that.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:12.000]   Try it right now, absolutely free on your Mac or your PC.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.160]   Visit gotomeeting.com, use the offer code Twig.
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:20.160]   If you decide to buy, you got 30 months free,
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.960]   and then if you decide to buy, I think it's $49 a month.
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:26.360]   It's nothing, nothing.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.080]   It's really affordable.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:31.240]   And I also wanna underscore that the iPad app
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.680]   is absolutely free.
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.960]   So anybody can attend your meeting for free.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.080]   Go to meeting on iPad on Mac or PC.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.360]   Go to meeting.com, use the offer code Twig.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:40.320]   Enough said.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.680]   I won't belabor the point.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:45.600]   So there's nothing to talk about, huh?
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:50.280]   We talked about Google Reader, we talked about Gmail.
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:52.920]   Although we should mention the iOS app that came out for G.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.960]   That was out for three seconds.
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:57.120]   It came out, oh, bye.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.360]   God, we'd lost everybody.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.960]   Is it just me and me now, Jeff?
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.160]   We take over.
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.000]   I got rid of them.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.320]   They are dead now.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.520]   They are dead to me.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:11.120]   Yeah, the Gmail for iOS, for iPhone and iPad.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:12.880]   Apparently, people were raving about it.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.040]   I know, MGC.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.800]   It really was gone in the flash.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:16.640]   And it was gone.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.040]   And apparently there's a bug in notifications
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.520]   has to do with iOS 5.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.800]   Here's the official Gmail blog earlier today,
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:24.920]   Madisat writes.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:26.480]   We launched a new Gmail app for iOS.
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:28.480]   Unfortunately, it contained a bug
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.880]   which broke notifications and caused users to see
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.680]   an error message when opening the app.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:33.920]   That's not what you want.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.400]   So we removed the app while we correct the app.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.400]   Oh, we have a screenshot of that.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.040]   You do?
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:40.280]   Is it bad?
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.000]   It was annoying and weird.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:42.840]   Where is it?
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.480]   Put it on Google+.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.240]   Yes, I can't think that Apple didn't catch this.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.240]   I'm sorry, Skype just crashed on me.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.400]   I can't believe nobody caught it.
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:49.760]   How do you--
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:50.760]   No one caught it.
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:52.320]   It's so crazy.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.880]   Are you excited about--
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:54.880]   No, we have on Android.
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:57.760]   All of us who use Android have very nice native Gmail apps.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.600]   And by the way, they updated both the Gmail app
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:03.000]   and the Google+ app on Android now is really sweet.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   You could do a hangout now on your Android phone.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.080]   Yeah, it's very cool.
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:09.200]   Yay.
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.760]   Loving that.
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.040]   Yeah, you know, the native app was always
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:15.800]   one of the reasons why I really liked Gmail or Android.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.280]   Excuse me, over iOS.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:20.160]   Even though I have to say, the iOS, the web app
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:24.360]   interface on the iPad is actually quite nice.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:26.920]   So yeah, I'm excited about this having a native app on iOS.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:29.480]   Although I didn't get to download it before they pulled it.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:31.400]   So hopefully it'll show up again soon.
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:32.960]   Matt, did you find your screenshot?
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.520]   Yeah, I'm uploading to Flickr right now.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:39.560]   What's weird is the Android app feels like just a wrapper
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:41.680]   for the web version of it.
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:45.160]   And that's definitely what they did with Gmail on the iPhone.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.120]   It just feels like a wrapper for the website.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:48.680]   I use the website all the time.
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:49.880]   It's a bit nicer.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:50.400]   I don't know why.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.360]   I like the Android version so much better.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.960]   Ooh, this is ugly.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:57.040]   No foul is the APS environment entitlement string
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:58.840]   found for application.
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:00.400]   OK?
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.840]   OK?
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.240]   So of course, the APS environment entitlement.
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:08.880]   Like, did they not check that?
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.320]   How would you not see that?
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:12.120]   I don't-- yeah.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:14.800]   Especially this had to be in review for a few days, at least.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:16.240]   It was, yeah.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.720]   Well, it also reminds me whenever I powered up my Android
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.520]   phone, which I only use sporadically,
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:23.160]   I'll get some Google Maps XML error,
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:26.120]   like the first time I turn it on, always.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.160]   I don't know why.
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:28.400]   That's not good.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:28.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:31.040]   Yeah, you don't want to see that, especially on the iPhone.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.040]   So Matt, you're an iPhone user.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:36.320]   I like to sort of have Android stuff for testing.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:37.320]   That's interesting.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.920]   I've been using the iPhone 4s.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:39.720]   I really like Siri.
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:41.040]   And I'm going to stick with it mostly
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.640]   because I use Siri all the time.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.240]   But then I pulled out the Galaxy.
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.160]   I've been using it for a week.
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.360]   And I pulled out the Galaxy S2.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.160]   And then the screen is so much nicer.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.320]   And I compared it to the iPhone.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.440]   I know it's not a retina display.
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:54.760]   The DPI is not up there.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:55.160]   But what--
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.360]   Better than the retina display.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.880]   It's the blacks are black, much black.
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.200]   The color in the contrast is so much better.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.640]   And the size--
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.800]   I have the sprint one.
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.200]   So it's 4 and 1/2 inches.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.520]   I like the size.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.040]   So--
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:09.960]   Interesting.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.480]   It's a little disappointing.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.520]   We should talk about Google TV because Matt--
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.020]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:15.600]   Google TV.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.840]   Google TV.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:20.760]   They're going to finally make my $300 investment.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.840]   Almost worth it.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.720]   $29 bucks now for the--
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:27.240]   Now Matt has a Sony one.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.560]   You and I have the Logitech review.
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.240]   Right.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.800]   And Matt also has every other DVR that's on the market
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.040]   because he writes PVR blogs.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.480]   So he knows how Google TV actually compares to everything
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.080]   else that's up there.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.040]   First is a new blog.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:39.960]   I have like--
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.160]   I have like seven devices or something hooked up to my TV.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:46.880]   But I only use Google TV to play Flash video.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.640]   That's it.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.920]   Like Flash online video is the only--
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.600]   I mean, it's like $200 or $300 just to play Flash random.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.440]   And I mean--
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.760]   It's the job.
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.360]   I listen to-- I mean, I watch a lot of weird niche.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.120]   You know, like TV feeds from Europe
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.120]   are in this little Flash player on some Belgium site.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.040]   And that works fine.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:07.880]   Everything works.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.040]   What is this we're looking at?
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.440]   Is that the new interface?
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.000]   Yes.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:11.600]   It will be.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.280]   No.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:13.800]   Yes.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.280]   It's that thing along the bottom, yeah.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.600]   What the hell?
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.600]   This-- this is the interface?
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.000]   No, no.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.520]   Well, it's a-- it's just that screen in the middle.
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.600]   Oh, oh, god.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.440]   I'm just going like--
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.600]   I don't like that on my screen.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.200]   Now, I think the one of the things I really actually do like
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.800]   after using every-- and I like you, Matt.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.080]   I've used every set top box from the Western Digital Live
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.480]   to the Roku, Plex Boxy Box.
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.520]   Of course, it's nice you can get porn on Boxy Box.
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.960]   So I've got to commend them for that.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:44.960]   But--
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.200]   But the nice thing about the Google TV
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.080]   is it doesn't use an HDMI port.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.960]   It's a pass through.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.360]   And I kind of like that.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:00.160]   So you have your cable box goes to the Google TV, which then
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.360]   goes to your TV.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.160]   So you're-- it's a little confusing.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.160]   And I hope they fix this in 3.1.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.680]   Because when the screen saver goes on on the Google TV,
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.320]   suddenly you can't watch your TV.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.480]   And my family doesn't understand that, oh, you've
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.360]   got to get that keyboard out and press a button on the keyboard
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.040]   before you can watch the TV.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.240]   It's all your fault.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.400]   To me, it's like eight weeks to figure it out.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.240]   And I actually disconnected it.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.360]   I don't-- yeah, I don't pipe my G--
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.880]   everything through the Google TV.
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.800]   I just use it as a different device.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.400]   It works OK.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.080]   It works good.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.240]   I just use it as a Chrome web browser on TV.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.160]   It's basically--
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.880]   Well, see, that's the idea is that you don't have to exit
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.520]   your TV to browse.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:41.640]   You're still browsing and watching TV, which, of course,
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.800]   is really stupid.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.200]   But it was-- because--
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.240]   I don't know if the Sony does this, the Logitech,
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:50.000]   because it's basically a harmony.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.480]   You tell it what your TV is and what your set top box is.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.280]   And you control everything from that keyboard, volume on off,
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.680]   everything, pause.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.880]   And so it's-- you know what?
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.160]   Actually, I brought it out because I'm waiting for the 3.1.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.080]   And I kind of thought, this isn't that bad.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:08.400]   At $99, I think it's almost a good idea.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.720]   It could be so much better, though.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.280]   I mean, I keep thinking about all the apps that I want on my TV.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.760]   Well, won't we get that?
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.240]   Yeah, I mean, I actually--
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.840]   I haven't had a TV with apps.
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.480]   I know there are TVs with apps out there now.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.080]   It doesn't Sony have a TV with--
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:20.680]   They all do.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.720]   --kind of an app store, yeah?
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.560]   Yeah, but I keep thinking about all the apps
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.120]   I wish that I could have on my TV.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.640]   Like, you know, there's so many times
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.920]   I'll be watching a show and I'll see an actor and actress
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.880]   and be like, what was she on before?
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:34.120]   I just want to be able to pause and do some magical face
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.600]   recognition and just bring up the IMDb page, you know,
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.840]   kind of right there on screen.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.360]   And also, I am dying to get a good, like,
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.760]   insta paper for my TV.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.720]   So like, whenever I come across a YouTube video
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.200]   that I want to watch later on my TV,
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.920]   I want to just be able to send it to something
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.920]   and have it just show up.
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.420]   Plex.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:52.480]   And Plex does that?
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.160]   Plex does that.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:58.040]   You queue them up and then you go home and you watch TV.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.240]   This is going to be my tool of the week.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.040]   There's Plex on the Google TV.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:02.520]   OK.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.880]   But that's what you want to add.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.400]   And I think where-- I think--
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.000]   I really thought Apple would do this.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.120]   They didn't do it with Apple TV yet.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.040]   But I really think that that's where
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:15.600]   Google has a chance to really revitalize this is by--
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.640]   look, they've got a market.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.280]   And this is on your TV.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:19.880]   You've got Twitter.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:20.600]   You've got Flixter.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.400]   You've got all this stuff.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.040]   And I think there's a-- there's a--
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.680]   I cannot wait to see 3.1 on here.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.400]   I wish it were ice cream sandwich.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.960]   But I can't wait to see-- I think there's a potential here.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.080]   I can't wait to see it either, hopefully.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.040]   Hopefully by Thanksgiving.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.560]   Yeah, I'm hoping by next week.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:39.600]   I was hoping we could talk about it this week.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.560]   Um.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.400]   And you can watch us on it.
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:48.880]   You just can't watch ABC, Fox, sci-fi.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.080]   Those bastards.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.260]   But you can watch live.
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.040]   That's with the TV, right?
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:52.800]   That's Flash.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:53.820]   Yeah.
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.640]   You can't watch--
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.760]   Right, but you can't get right.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.240]   Because they say it's not a browser.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.480]   That's a Google TV.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.840]   What is wrong with them?
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.320]   Jeff, you must know.
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.240]   What the hell is wrong?
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.960]   Why would ABC say I can watch it on this,
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.360]   but not on my Google TV?
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.480]   What the hell's wrong with that?
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.760]   So we got to parse that, right?
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:16.120]   They don't want Google-- they don't want to give Google--
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.520]   well, is it ABC or is it the MSO?
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:19.280]   It's a bunch of them.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.920]   No, it's ABC because--
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.560]   OK, so no, I could go--
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.600]   I used to, in the first day--
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.680]   the first day you got your Google TV a year ago,
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.440]   you would surf to ABC and you could watch the shows.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.400]   You could go to Hulu and watch the shows
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.360]   because you have a browser with all the capabilities.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.800]   Then they started looking at the user agent
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.120]   and saying, oh, you're coming to us from a Google TV.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.000]   X-Nay on there.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.720]   Well, here's where it is, right?
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.000]   It disaggregates the channel because they show you
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.080]   on Google TV, search for a show, go right to the show.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.680]   Who cares what channel is on?
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.600]   There's no such thing as a channel.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.440]   But I'm in the browser.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.600]   That's the point.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.240]   Oh, I see it.
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.320]   You're looking at ABC.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.200]   I'm looking at the ABC website.
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.240]   Right, but in the long run, where Google, the search
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:05.040]   company, will head is you want to see that actor?
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.240]   Well, here's where they are and I'll take your right to it
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.960]   and you have less sense of the-- I guess that's their fear.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:10.840]   I don't know.
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:11.440]   Make a--
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.880]   Also, ABC is like saying, should we hand over full video
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:19.800]   control to the largest ad company on the planet
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.360]   and just hope for the best that they don't just put text ads
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.440]   on the bottom of our little ABC streaming video?
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.800]   Like, I don't know.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.440]   I think they didn't like the competition.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:33.840]   I imagine with the market launched in the new update
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.760]   that there will be plenty of apps that can change
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.920]   your user agent string.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.320]   Well, you could do that before.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.520]   And apparently they're getting--
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.080]   They're pretty smart about what they look at.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.080]   I don't know how they do.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.360]   But they could tell.
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:45.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:48.760]   Well, they announced all these new players.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.440]   Look at all the new stars on YouTube.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.760]   And it's kind of--
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.280]   Oh, that, the YouTube, 100 YouTube channels.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.080]   They overpaid.
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.880]   And what is the Shaquille O'Neal comedy channel?
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.240]   What is that going to be?
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:02.680]   That's it.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:06.200]   It's the Shaq Comedy channel.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.200]   Yes!
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.360]   We're up there.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.160]   Left, damn you.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.240]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.600]   We're going to talk about four, then we're
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.480]   going to talk some more about other stuff.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.200]   Matt Howie's here from Metafilter.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.560]   And I didn't know this, the PVR blog, which I've read all the time.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:19.560]   And you're very--
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.600]   on the PVR blog, you're very self-effacing.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.280]   It doesn't have a big Matt Howie's PVR blog.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.960]   Well, I actually sold it a couple of years ago.
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.720]   And then I just bought it back two weeks ago.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.320]   Oh, you did.
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.320]   Congratulations.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:31.720]   It was the first--
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:36.440]   Matt, wasn't it the first revenue sustainable blog?
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:37.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.680]   And I wrote it-- I was dumb enough to write a big post saying,
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.240]   hey, everybody, here's how you make money with the blogs.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:42.680]   And then--
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:43.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:44.680]   I figured it out.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.680]   There are five clones of it.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.480]   Like, within two months, there are five different, like,
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.440]   Tivo blogs.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.960]   And then the revenue started to go down.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.920]   But yeah, like, a couple years ago,
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.760]   I hadn't been posting to it for months.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.280]   So I just-- yeah, that's what my remotes are.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.280]   Your remotes look like my remotes.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.080]   Yeah, I hate it.
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.400]   Boxy, I see them all.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.720]   These are all the ones I have.
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.800]   Except for the Sony piece of crap.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.760]   I like it.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.000]   I have a keyboard.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:08.920]   But it's a little big.
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.200]   It's crazy to have a keyboard on your coffee table.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:11.680]   That's just not--
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.760]   One's like, PlayStation controller size.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.920]   It actually feels great for hands.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:16.240]   Yeah, but the keyboard is real.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.800]   I mean, you could type easily.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.680]   It's just-- I don't know.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.320]   I like the keyboard.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.800]   Anyway, this is great.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.200]   Congratulations.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:22.700]   Nothing.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:25.320]   I didn't realize you had reacquired.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:29.960]   Yeah, well, I sold it to this little email marketing
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:30.520]   company.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.720]   I knew that would kind of dodgy.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.160]   But they were like, we've never done content before.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.040]   It can't be that hard.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.000]   I gave them all these tips.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.440]   I showed them my RSS lists.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.080]   I told them how to--
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.880]   I spent two days working with them.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:44.680]   And then they never made a single post for two years.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:45.680]   Wow.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.160]   They just said, we don't have the time.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.000]   So I offered them a fraction of what they paid for it.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   And they said, sure.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:52.500]   Yay.
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.160]   That was a unique money out of the deal.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:54.720]   Good for you.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.440]   Hey.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.920]   It's a profit thing.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:59.120]   By the way, is your health OK?
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.080]   Did the tumor go on?
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.680]   Yeah, it's shrunk and I'm doing great.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.600]   Yay.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.480]   So you're on the cancer side of the show today.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.880]   No, no, no.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.320]   It wasn't cancer.
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:12.080]   It wasn't cancer.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:12.440]   All right.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.240]   So Gina and I are--
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.640]   That's my exclusive.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:16.960]   The hammer has fallen on YouTube.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:17.880]   Gina, I have to keep looking up.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.120]   I've got enough for everybody.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.240]   We're just waiting for it to hit us.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.160]   Yeah, it's just a matter of time.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:24.760]   We're all dying.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:25.920]   It's just how fast.
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.080]   Exactly.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:28.960]   Wah, wah.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.560]   I know a light's going to fall any day now and hit me in the head.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.920]   Hey, this show is brought to you by-- and thank goodness.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.120]   Because of them, we can afford safety chains on our lights.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:41.760]   So Ford's keeping me alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.720]   The great folks at Ford, they are very proud of the fact
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.160]   that Ford's vehicles are basically consumer electronics
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:49.760]   devices.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:52.880]   I mean, until Ford came along, you'd get in a car
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:56.440]   and basically you'd be going back to the 19th century.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.560]   You have a steering wheel, a stick, a brake, and that's it.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:02.680]   And you turn on the radio and you can hear top 40 radio.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:06.960]   Now, thanks to this amazing stuff that put the Ford sink,
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:13.080]   the My Ford Touch, you're driving the Wonder car.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.040]   I've talked before how I could talk to my car.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.960]   Now, with AppLink, they've got an API for apps.
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.840]   Alan Malali told me he said, we cannot--
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.880]   our iterative process cannot be as fast as the smartphone,
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:25.200]   guys.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.800]   They really, every year, they come up--
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.480]   in case of Android, every five minutes,
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:30.160]   they come up with something new and exciting.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.720]   So they've got an API.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:36.680]   People can write apps for smartphones, apples, or androids,
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:39.920]   that then you can talk to and communicate with.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.000]   So the first three are already out Pandora.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.040]   That was the obvious one.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.320]   So you can actually talk to Pandora.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.400]   You press the button on your steering wheel.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.600]   You don't take your eyes off the road,
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:50.440]   your hands off the wheels.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:51.680]   It's very safe.
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.880]   And that's the problem with Siri.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.680]   You have to push the button on Siri.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:55.120]   This, no.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.680]   You press the button on the steering wheel.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:00.000]   And you could say things like play my classic rock station
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.280]   or bookmark this song so I could buy it later,
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:06.080]   or thumbs up or thumbs down on Pandora that's got open beak
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.640]   so it'll read you your tweets or your timeline, your replies.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.840]   It's got Stitcher Smart Radio.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.400]   So you can create an audio magazine of podcasts.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.400]   So you can listen to this show.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.800]   It's absolutely the best way to listen to it.
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.080]   Leo endorses Stitcher on the app link.
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.640]   I just think it's fantastic.
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.040]   But there's all sorts of other things too.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.480]   I mean, what I encourage you to do
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.200]   is go to this website, Ford.com/technology.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:33.280]   Look at the new engines, the sync that my Ford Touch.
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:37.240]   You know, they've got a great thing here.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.240]   Where is it?
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:43.280]   It's my key for teenagers that makes-- you can set a maximum
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:47.680]   speed and a maximum volume of the stereo.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:51.200]   Turn that stereo down, you punk.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.160]   Anyway, I just love it.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.000]   This is such a great place.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.760]   I'm so glad we have a relationship with them.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.000]   We invite you to our barbecues.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.800]   Coming up, we've got two of them.
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.880]   November 13th and December 4th.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.760]   If you go to twit.tv, you click the link
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.080]   and you get this web page.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.840]   We do ask that you sign up.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.160]   So click the day you can come.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.880]   The 13th of this month, a week from Sunday,
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:12.240]   or next month, December 4th.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:12.760]   And--
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:13.920]   You are doing events.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.480]   We are.
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:15.920]   You're right.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:16.560]   I didn't even think of that.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:17.120]   There you go.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:17.880]   It's a little event.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.880]   Only 50 people can come.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:21.120]   We're going to have great food from the-- yeah, right.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.160]   I don't want it to be South by.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.400]   There's no lines.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.680]   Come and watch Twit.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.680]   You'll see our new gaming show in process.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.120]   We're actually on the 13th.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.880]   If you can come the 13th, we're going
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.760]   to have Brian Rushwood, Veronica Belmont, the host
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:32.960]   of our new gaming show here.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.400]   The producer Dan Mitchell, Chad Johnson.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.120]   And we're going to try things out.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.520]   So you could be part of our--
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.960]   we've got to have a fire hole where we throw games we don't like.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:41.960]   We're going to have some stuff.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.720]   You could try it out.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.320]   You could be part of-- you could see how shows are developed
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.720]   at Twit on the fly as we go.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:48.680]   It's going to be fun.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:49.600]   I really want you to come.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.640]   So go to Twit.tv, click the link,
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.240]   and sign up to be at the barbecue.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.320]   And of course, Ford will be there with some great vehicles.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.960]   So you can take a look at all the stuff
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.000]   that I've been talking about.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.800]   Thank you, Ford, for your support.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:01.880]   No lights.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.880]   We'll hit me.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.560]   Thanks, Ford.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:08.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.960]   I should have my rundown right in front of me.
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:12.120]   You know, I should probably print these out,
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.040]   because I, like most nerds, now have 300 tabs open,
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.000]   all at the same time.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.200]   But you need paper that supports hyperlink, clicking.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:21.880]   That's right.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.880]   That's right.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.520]   So we talked about the YouTube thing.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:32.200]   Who are, besides Shaq, Madonna, they're also bringing networks,
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.960]   right, or not?
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.960]   Is it just individuals?
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:38.120]   No, it's not onions that included a response.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.280]   See, that'll be good.
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.720]   But doesn't the Onion News Network already, like,
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:42.640]   just have a channel?
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.480]   I mean, what is it?
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:44.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.560]   They could have thrown it in there.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:46.760]   All right.
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:48.840]   And it's going to be the lean back experience, right?
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.240]   Or not?
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:53.760]   The idea--
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.400]   I don't know the difference.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.560]   I don't know either.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:58.520]   Is this to receive updates about the new channels
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:59.920]   joining YouTube as they launch?
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.920]   It's evening here at the Twit Brick House.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:12.560]   And now, all the lights are out so we can watch the new
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.640]   Shaquille O'Neal comedy hour.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:19.200]   Starring Shaquille-- you got to wonder-- OK, so they said,
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.320]   what, $100 million for this?
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.200]   You got to wonder, how long Madonna, Shaq, how long are these
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.160]   guys going to put up with this?
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:30.200]   I mean, is this going to be a long term?
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.440]   Most of this is crap.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.440]   I'm looking at it right now.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.360]   I'm not going to name names because I don't want people
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.120]   to think I think they're crap.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.120]   But most of this does not look good.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:44.800]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:47.520]   American Hipster, comedic channel exploring pop culture
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.600]   through the lens of hipsterism.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.000]   Oh, yeah, I'll be watching that a lot.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   Wow.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:58.360]   They've got a channel food named to be determined.
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.600]   Channel Auto, named to be determined.
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:06.160]   Channel pets and animals, named to be determined.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.480]   I'm guessing this is out of the purchase of next-to networks
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.400]   and their kind of platform.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.360]   A lot of this.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.480]   A lot of this is their old show.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.960]   Those are their own.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:18.400]   I guess it's kind of what I was saying.
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.640]   If you're super serving a niche audience,
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:24.440]   like if you're into soccer, kick TV will be great,
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.520]   except I bet they don't-- will they have games?
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.840]   Or will they just be commentary?
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:30.280]   You're going to just be people talking
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:33.320]   while you're waiting for a goal to happen.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.200]   Yeah, not a soccer fan.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.040]   Which is a long time.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.080]   I can tell.
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.120]   Yes.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:38.800]   Wow.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.720]   It's a little slow for me.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.760]   We've added a rim shot and crickets.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.920]   Talk about production value.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.920]   Oh!
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:46.920]   Oh!
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.400]   That's that trouble.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:52.600]   So I'm not saying I'm mad at YouTube for not including us,
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.720]   but I think this is the production values.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.560]   Look at the circuit board.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.160]   The production value.
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.920]   This is a high production value program.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:00.840]   So we're talking about it.
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.520]   You know who's on their SB Nation,
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:04.800]   the formerly known as SB Nation?
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:07.360]   I guess I have to rename that show.
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.320]   The people who own the verge.
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:10.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.360]   Stan Lee's World of Heroes.
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:15.680]   [CLAPPING]
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.840]   OK, the five people in the audience like Stan Lee.
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.800]   Depak Chopra's Chopra Well.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:24.240]   Inspiration, knowledge, total well-being from Depak Chopra.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.560]   [LAUGHING]
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.160]   The Comedy Shack Network.
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.320]   That's the one I'm watching.
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:32.000]   An urban comedy network featuring stand-up comedy,
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:32.880]   sketch comedies.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.080]   Oh, OK.
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.440]   So this isn't Shaq.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.200]   He's going to just-- hey, Nerdist has a channel.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.600]   That's too bad I want the movie to show.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.680]   OK, Nerdist would be good.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.880]   Nerdist has a channel.
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:42.840]   That's the one I'm going to watch.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.320]   We love Chris.
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.920]   Brought to you by the nerd-friendly folks
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:48.200]   at Nerdist Industries, the Jim Henson Company,
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:53.200]   Geek Chic Daily, and Broadway Video Entertainment.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.120]   What about Kevin Pollock's chat show?
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.600]   We see that show up on every system is where the first--
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.760]   Yeah, no, I don't see that on here.
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.160]   You know what's interesting?
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.960]   It's clear that there's throwing everything
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:08.520]   against the wall, and then what will stick and what won't stick.
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:11.800]   What's the business deal for these guys?
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.320]   Really?
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.360]   I think they're thinking long term that they basically--
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:18.400]   YouTube wants to be--
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.280]   I don't even want to say broadcast network.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:21.560]   Wants to be a cable network.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:22.520]   Right before the channel is--
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:23.600]   Are they getting up from payment,
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.040]   or are they going to insure a bad revenue?
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.080]   What's the deal?
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.440]   They said $100 million.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.280]   There's 100 channels.
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:29.480]   Each of them get $1 million.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.880]   I don't know.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.760]   I think the deal-- I mean, YouTube Live, the deal,
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.240]   is it's an ad network.
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.320]   They put the ads on your show.
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.320]   Because we talked to YouTube Live, and they said--
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.040]   Which is why you won't.
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.880]   You have to take all the ads out of your show.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.080]   I said, but wait a minute.
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.520]   I said, who's going to do this?
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.920]   CNN is going to take the ads out of CNN
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.080]   so that they can be on YouTube Live.
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.040]   I don't think so.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.880]   I said, you're going to get all these down market people
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.400]   who don't have any ads.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.680]   Well, Sirius takes the ads out of CNN, in fact,
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.520]   and puts their own trucker ads in.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.880]   Oh, well, maybe that's OK.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.680]   So CNN does that then.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:06.320]   But if that's-- that's different because it's a car.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:09.760]   If too many CNN listeners switched over to Sirius,
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.600]   that'd be really bad.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.160]   That'd be a problem.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:12.920]   So same for you.
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:15.920]   If too many people started watching you on Google,
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.360]   unless they pay you more higher rates,
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.040]   well, this goes back to your do not grow.
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:20.520]   Right.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.440]   So that's why we're not going to do it.
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:26.560]   Google Maps kind of pull a little fast one.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:31.760]   They pull the rug out from under a couple of people.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:32.680]   So what happens here?
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.800]   What scares me, they've been hanging around with a phone
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.080]   company too long because they announced
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:41.480]   that heavy users will now get charged, which kind of sounds
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.640]   logical, except that Google Maps has been free for how long
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.160]   with no warning of this.
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:49.120]   And that's the monopoly fear that people have about Google
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.520]   is they're going to get you addicted to something.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.120]   And then suddenly, thing, now they're going to put down
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.200]   the term pike on you.
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:59.400]   So if you're using version three of the JavaScript API
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:06.600]   or the Stenix Map API, you'll be capped at $25,000 a day.
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.760]   And if you go past 25,000 views, you'll
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.200]   have to pay $4 per 1,000.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:18.160]   So if you had 50,000 views, that'd be four times--
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.360]   $100?
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:20.160]   Wouldn't be that bad.
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.840]   $100.
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:22.280]   If you had--
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:22.920]   I know.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:28.360]   But if you're-- it's the principle of a thing.
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.840]   So that revenue is the minimus to Google.
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:35.480]   By the way, Matt, your math skills are excellent.
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.000]   I ask Google.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.560]   That's why he has the how we--
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:43.640]   The cap is set to 2,500 loads for styled maps
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.760]   that customize the presentation.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:50.160]   After 25,000 loads, the overage goes to $8,
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:54.040]   I guess if you modify it in any way per 1,000.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.360]   I have a feeling that whenever you release any sort of widget
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:00.880]   or JavaScript include of anything--
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:05.280]   you get lists like 99% of your audience.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:07.400]   It loads five times a day.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.440]   A few people loads a couple hundred times a day.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:13.080]   And there's always like two psychotically heavy users
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.920]   that millions--
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:18.080]   like your servers are dedicated to that one outside service.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:18.560]   Map, how much?
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.040]   So I imagine--
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:23.080]   yeah, I imagine there's like four or five mapping startups
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.200]   that were just piggybacking on Google Maps.
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.440]   And you know, probably had some decent revenue.
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:31.280]   And Google's saying, hey, you know, maybe
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.440]   you can scale it back a bit.
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:36.960]   They did say that this is really for people who are peaking.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:39.000]   They're not for people who are occasional peeks
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.640]   as people who are always over the limit all the time.
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:42.880]   So I think that that makes sense.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.640]   Like what most Yelp be like?
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.120]   God, yeah, right.
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.160]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.240]   It's a good point.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:53.520]   Yeah, people, as you say, who built a business on their maps,
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.160]   they should be giving you some money.
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.000]   I don't think that's unreasonable.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.680]   It's just a kind of a switch of room.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:20:59.680]   I don't disagree with that.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.520]   But it's the switch of room.
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:03.200]   And it happened-- you know, there was no hint ever
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.800]   that we're going to do this.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:08.040]   It's not revenue that's going to matter to Google.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:11.800]   And so-- but they got you by the neck or another broadie part.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.920]   And now they do it.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.840]   And that's going to-- I think that's going to backfire on them
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:18.320]   when it comes to antitrust discussion.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:19.600]   Well, exactly.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:23.040]   And a number of people-- we were talking about this on Twitter--
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:27.360]   comparing today's Google to Microsoft in 1998.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.560]   Yeah, it's a zoon.
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:32.040]   And Google today is as arrogant as Microsoft is,
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.640]   and as greedy as Microsoft is.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:35.120]   And they're doing the bait and switch
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:36.240]   that Microsoft used to do.
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:37.040]   Well, it's free.
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:37.540]   It's free.
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:38.920]   OK, now that we got you hooked and we've
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:42.360]   killed all the competition, pay up.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.080]   Now, fortunately, there's open street maps.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:46.000]   There are open maps that I imagine
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.240]   will get some traffic out of this.
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.840]   I love open street maps.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:51.040]   I think it's great.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.320]   And it's free, right?
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.720]   I think it is.
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.400]   Yeah, it'd be interesting to see what happens
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.720]   with the Google+ API.
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:01.080]   Like, right now, there's a courtesy cap of 1,000 calls a day.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:03.120]   So I wonder if they're going to start out when they start
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:07.520]   releasing, making an API more widely available with limits.
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.020]   Like this.
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.460]   You know, if it started out this way,
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.660]   hey, you get 25,000 calls free.
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.860]   And then after that, you have to pay.
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:14.660]   And that's a very common--
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:17.220]   Twitter famously sort of throttles there.
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:20.540]   You get 350 requests an hour unless you get what I listed.
[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:23.780]   I mean, I think that API limits are totally reasonable.
[01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:26.540]   But you're point that it's been always free up until now.
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:28.500]   And now there's these huge businesses
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.500]   that use these maps.
[01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:33.020]   Is a good one.
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:37.520]   Survey says many parents lie to get their kids on Facebook.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.720]   I'm the only one here that's not a parent.
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:45.080]   So I'm interested to hear what you all think about this.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:48.680]   So the COPPA, the Child Online Privacy Protection Act,
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:51.480]   says that you have to have parental cassette
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.480]   if you let children under 13 use your site.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:58.480]   That's why Facebook says you have to be 13 to use Facebook.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.600]   But according to this survey--
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.400]   I had the wonderful Dana Boyd and company--
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:08.520]   Yep Lots of parents are just saying, oh don't worry. I'll sign you up or lie or whatever
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:12.920]   You know what day is go ahead, man. Oh
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:21.160]   Yeah, I've been there when flicker went from when they let you tag people you know in photos kind of like Facebook
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:25.140]   You know, I had all these thousands of photos of my daughter on flicker
[01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:30.080]   And I went to try and sign up a Yahoo account for her and then it's like oh
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:34.640]   You get through the entire sign up and then you get to the point of connecting the flicker and it goes
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:38.480]   Yeah, no, you gotta be 13 actually I think Yahoo says 18 don't they?
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:44.440]   Well, I backed out of it and then a friend whose son it was like three is on there as a user
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:50.840]   It's like what did what did you do? And she was I said it, you know, I took 10 years off his birthday
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:56.960]   There's this debate going on Google plus right now should Google plus allow under 18 users and
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:02.560]   They had somebody did a poll and was 61 percent said no, we don't want the kitties on here
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:05.120]   So Dana's
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:09.680]   Research why parents help their children help their children
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:16.280]   An unintended consequences of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act found that many parents
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:24.600]   Knowingly allow their children to lie about their age in fact often help them to do so in order to gain access to age restricted sites
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:28.760]   This is the issue of the unexpected consequences of this kind of regulation
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:35.360]   I wrote a piece at time.com about this but two weeks ago and then new data was coming out with this which is superb research
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:39.680]   Because it says that the FTC is trying and they're there the FTC is now going to toughen this
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.960]   A site can use information about a child
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:50.120]   Anyway, only if you get the explosive permission of the parents and only if that comes in pre-nautar document and scanning it or faxing it
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:59.520]   Remember that or a video conference with the company and it's onerous and I asked the FTC attorney over this in a call with a free
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:06.120]   Future privacy forum whether they had any research about lying and they didn't now data does they had no research about how much parents use this
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:08.120]   but my biggest concern is that
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:10.760]   Because of this legislation
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:18.920]   Sites do not build anything for anyone under 13 which makes children the worst served sector of society on the internet and that is a tragedy
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:22.520]   Dana says parents want their kids to have access to public life
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:27.400]   And today what public life means is participating even in commercial social media sites
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:30.320]   Listen to this for kids were under 13 when they signed up
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:35.360]   68% of the parents said yeah, we helped them sign up among 10 year olds
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:44.000]   95% of the parents were not only aware of their kids using the service 78% of them helped them 78% helped them create the account so
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:50.600]   Parents now, I don't think it's troubling because I always told my kids lie all you want to online marketers
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:54.080]   We'll make more it's not a problem
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:59.680]   If somebody asks you if a stranger comes up to you and the street and asks you where do you live little girl?
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:05.560]   It's okay to lie if a marketer comes on a website and says what's your age and demographic?
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:10.640]   It's okay to lie lie to them be my guests right is that a girl am I wrong?
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.560]   Dana seems to think it's a bad thing
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:18.680]   No, no, no what Dana is saying is she says it's deeply problematic that kids and parents are lying
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:22.240]   Because what we're doing is we're training our kids to lie we are
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:29.120]   What she's talking about is the validity of Kappa of this law well, I understand saying it's not doing what it's supposed to do
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:34.360]   And I was at a session recently and people told what should we do and Dana is the one who taught me that
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:39.800]   You should regulate the use of the data more than the collection of the data by regulating the collection of the data
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:43.420]   We all lose out all children lose out by regulating bad guys
[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:47.000]   You go after the bad guys and and that's what's happened here
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.680]   So so what she's saying is that this legis
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.960]   I don't want to put any words in her mouth
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:56.360]   But what I would come out of this with is that this legislation and the regulation that followed had this
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:02.720]   Doesn't know what the harm they're trying to protect from is and and parents don't obviously don't want it right so what are we doing?
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:09.200]   Right eight only 18% of parents surveyed said they thought the government should have age limits on websites
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.140]   That's not what they want. They want an information. They want to control. They didn't want prohibition
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:18.220]   Right, it's that's the parent that's the other point. It's the parents job not the government
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:21.400]   But I still think it's now maybe I'm ethically challenged
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:26.360]   I guess I should say it's never okay in under any circumstances to lie
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:29.360]   But what I told my kids all along is it's okay to lie
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.240]   to bad guys
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.960]   Isn't that okay
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:42.360]   It's okay. Yeah, I think so but is it is a media but what happens here is that is the media site or the service like Facebook?
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:45.000]   Gets thrown in with the bad guys
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.360]   Where you know imagine well, that's true. That's a good point. Here's an example
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.400]   Let's let's say that you're an educational site and you want to do a geography game
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:57.700]   You want to deal with the geography that the kid knows you start and say well, what town do you live in?
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:28:02.920]   Loser right right you're gonna get in big trouble and you have to go through all kinds of hoops
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:06.040]   So what do you do you don't do it? You don't ever serve a child that age?
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:13.120]   That's the problem so so that the good guys here are are not motivated to serve this audience
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:18.960]   And they stay away and they and so we've expanded stranger danger to make every adult on earth evil
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:24.960]   Crucial wax says it right. It's not lying. It's keeping personal information secret through misinformation. Yes
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.880]   That's good. That's good. I like that
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.840]   Kids do it all the time. They say they're a hundred years old all the time on my space or whatever
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:35.320]   That's that's just what they do. I don't think that they see that is lying
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:40.600]   Man
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:45.400]   I mean, I wonder how much about this is about online marketers and about sort of adult content
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:51.840]   Like I would like to see the comparison of parents who let their under 17 kids see our rated movies or play like mature
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:57.960]   And for mature rated video games as compared to to this number. I mean it's I wouldn't let my kids do that
[01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:03.240]   Well, right and that's interesting right because you because you you're you're very experienced on the internet
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:05.440]   You know what happens on the internet a lot of these parents said, you know
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.560]   My our computer is in the family room and I'm friends with my kid
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.920]   And I see everything that my kid posts to his or her wall
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:14.440]   And I monitor who my friend who my kid is friends with on Facebook
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:19.200]   So and it's my responsibility to do that and that's why I feel comfortable lying right and so in the case of an
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:19.640]   R-rated movie
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:22.680]   Maybe you know the parent goes in with the kid or the parent says that that's not okay
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.120]   But but there's this idea
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.120]   You know and Jeff knows that connecting on the internet is a good thing right?
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:32.000]   It's not it's not automatically a bad thing the predators aren't
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.760]   Automatically gonna descend upon your kid right that this is this is about participation in public life in a positive way
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:43.120]   And that's I think Dana's point right that this law that was made so many years ago has to be visited
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.120]   Let's fix it nobody like that law from day one
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:48.760]   It was always a bad idea and Facebook is more of a messaging platform anyway now
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:52.080]   So it's like my aunt announced our family reunion on Facebook
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:55.160]   No idea my entire my ten year old cousins are on Facebook
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:30:00.200]   They're all there I had no idea and they'd be disenfranchised if they weren't there and there's no porn on Facebook
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:05.280]   There's no adult stuff on Facebook. So Leo I snuck into the graduate
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:11.120]   Didn't you ever sneak into a do all the time all right? So you want your repair with your kids don't?
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:14.640]   Well, I don't let them I don't buy them beer
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:25.480]   No, I think Mike I knew Mike I try to discourage that but I you I think my kids probably were sneaking into our rated movies
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:32.240]   I'll tell you what the graduate compared to an our rated movie today is a very different thing. Oh, yeah
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:37.600]   The graduate oh boy, I don't let my parents live that down
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:41.520]   You know my parents wouldn't let me see I was in 10th grade
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:44.320]   They wouldn't let me see oh
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:48.320]   Art Garfucker was in it
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:51.160]   Oh, I can't remember the name of it
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.680]   and that room
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.680]   It was an our rated movie
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:31:02.740]   Is it Jack Nicholson that's 22? No Jack Nicholson art carfunkle and I think Ann Margaret is in it
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:07.600]   Anyway, all right right right right right come on chat room. You can do it. You can do it. Come on. Come on
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:10.600]   But mrs. Robinson are you carnal knowledge. Thank you
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:15.240]   Siri would have known that by the way, did you know?
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:22.600]   Just a selling point for Siri because Gina you said you can say Siri who starred in carnal knowledge and Siri will look it up for you
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:24.960]   Nice
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:27.000]   Nice selling point for zero. I like it
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:32.520]   Let's oh one more thing as long as we're talking about Facebook
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:38.560]   The folks at MOG which is a music service nice. I like it. It's one of my favorite music services say that you know
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:43.320]   They've been struggling along. There's a lot of competition with Spotify RDO rhapsody. I on and on and on
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:47.680]   By by putting their stuff by joining the Facebook
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:50.720]   friction-free sharing platform
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.480]   MOG has grown
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:55.480]   246 percent like that
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:32:05.480]   Power platform power to platform. Yeah, all right. We're gonna take a break come back with Gina's tips Jeff's Jarvis

[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:11.200]   Gina your tip of the week
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:18.440]   This is pretty cool Google's being a lot more transparent or a little bit more transparent about why it serves you the ads that it does
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:23.680]   If you do a search for so example search we do search for galaxy nexus for example
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:30.000]   You'll get a couple of ads at the top, you know regular just blue link ads, but there's a new link that says why these ads
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:36.480]   If you click on that you'll get a little little explanation ads are based on your current search terms
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:39.280]   Which is pretty obvious, right?
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:44.880]   But you can go and there's a new now an ads preferences manager where you can say don't ever show me ads from this advertiser again
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:47.560]   You can see you can block certain advertisers, which is really nice
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.920]   and
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:54.680]   So it's pretty cool. I'd like to see this more. You know sometimes I get wacky ads in my gmail
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:57.960]   I'm just like how did you know how did they where did they come up with that?
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:01.400]   And so I'd like to see this roll out everywhere right now. I'm only seeing it in the search results
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:04.680]   But the ads preferences manager is at
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.800]   Just happens if you do the search you don't have to even worry about it
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:14.400]   Just click why these ads and then I say visit Google's ad preferences manager to learn more
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:18.000]   And then it shows you the ads you saw in this case Google Nexus
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.280]   I saw two one for quote for Google and one for Samsung
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:27.280]   Verizon and you can literally just block it. Yep, you can block certain advertisers and you can opt out as well of
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:32.480]   Personalization of ad personalization as well. So I don't have it
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:35.480]   Really? Well, they know it's you
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:39.400]   So so opt out that is pretty neat
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:44.360]   Everybody should be doing this everyone should be doing this. Yeah more often
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:48.920]   More opted in users are 40% more likely to click on ads and opted out users
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:54.560]   Huh, this is really good good on you Google and you know this costs them nothing because you know
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:57.440]   I mean just this just gives people gives them more valuable data. Yeah
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:02.280]   It's the same thing dig dig that did that whether you could dig up or down ads and
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:10.640]   Advertisers paid for that. Yeah, I think that's really useful Facebook does it too block this ad advertisers actually want that information
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:15.160]   They don't want to advertise to people who aren't interested. That's a waste of their money
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:18.200]   cool
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.400]   So you don't see it. Are you logged in Jeff?
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:25.840]   Maybe that's yeah, I am that's weird. Yeah
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:28.840]   That's weird
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:30.840]   You know, there's a nice new thing on
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:39.080]   That I like another way that Google+ is infiltrated if you do a search for a a Google+ artist
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:45.360]   I mean a blogger you can circle them now if let me see here. I'll do Matt Howie. Oh
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:50.020]   From the search results. Yeah, yeah the classification of everything
[01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:52.520]   You can search results. So
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:54.660]   I'm already connected to you Matt
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:37:01.200]   But if I weren't I could circle you here and you can see people's like the number of circles that that people are in as well
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:07.000]   It doesn't look like Matt hooked up his oh, you haven't hooked it up yet profile, but yeah, I mean Leo
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000]   I bet it works for you Leo. I'm hooked up
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.080]   So here's oh there. Yeah, look Gina oh
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:19.600]   In other 50,000 Google+ circles. She's in two of my circles. I can read I could add her to other circle
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:22.400]   I just think this is this doesn't bother me. Does that I think this is cool?
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:26.240]   It's it's cool, but it really I mean it really makes web publishers
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:32.320]   Compels them to use Google+ right well Facebook's doing these kinds of things I mean it attaches authority
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:35.200]   I feel a little weird about attaching authority to the number of circles you're in
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:40.080]   Because then it becomes this popularity contest like kind of the Twitter followers issue
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:44.080]   Yeah, and also you know my numbers huge because Google put me on the suggested user list
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.600]   You know because I do this show that's not you know that that's not fair
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:49.760]   I I appreciate sort of organic numbers a little better
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.920]   So I hope and I hope they use a few other factors to figure out authority and expertise and that kind of thing
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:58.320]   But it is really interesting the way that plus is kind of creeping into everything
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:04.680]   I mean there's no reason why a web publisher won't join plus and and try to you know get into a lot of circles
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:08.400]   Hey, I didn't want to put the like button on my pages, but you have to I mean it's just part of the thing now
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:11.540]   You got to do like plus Twitter whatever
[01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:15.320]   It's a brave new world isn't it Matt Howie?
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:19.800]   It's exhausting
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:24.120]   That will use plus whether he likes it or not
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:31.800]   Yeah, just like Facebook you have to I do I resisted for a long time. I deleted my Facebook account on this very show. I
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:36.520]   Wish I could have kept it that way Jeff Jarvis your number of the week my friend
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:39.000]   My number is
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.280]   300,000 which is how many people signed a petition online to beat down
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:48.200]   Bank of America's $5 debit card. Yeah
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:57.640]   Molly catchful 22 year old woman from Washington collected $300,000 is kind of occupy the ATM and
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:03.460]   I just think it's another wonderful sign of the tools of publicness enabling people Pache
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:06.720]   clay shirky organizing with our organizations and
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:10.840]   Us controlling the companies and yay. Yay
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:16.760]   Similarly you saw the White House is we the people online petitions
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:22.360]   They issued their first response to an online petition which one the marijuana one the
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:26.680]   No, it was the student loan one. I'm trying to find it now
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:29.200]   There's a petition that the White House pay attention to the petitions
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:38.560]   Assign that one no, they did they actually they actually responded to this petition the petition was to
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:41.520]   To
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:45.320]   Forgive all student loan debt and the response was not to forgive all student loan debt
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:48.120]   But what but a new policy that reduces payments good
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:54.000]   So I mean really first first example of an online kind of online organize organizing changing policy
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.720]   Which excited me because that's what expert labs is all about
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:05.440]   Genius think up app is an expert labs. It was actually used by the White House. I imagine 2012 will be very exciting for you. Yeah, yeah
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:10.840]   Well, the White House is separate from the campaign, but yes, I understand yeah, yeah
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:18.560]   Are you skeptical Jeff to see that hair walk over it
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:26.120]   But that's an important hair. Let's not denigrate the hair. Oh, yeah
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:34.880]   So my tool is Plex Plex is a really great piece of software based on Xbox media center XBMC
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:39.960]   It's a complete rewrite very powerful. It's a media server. You can run on Android
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:42.920]   You can run it on iPhone you can run it on your computer
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:46.720]   You should be if you're using if you want to do a you know home theater PC
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:49.240]   You should be using Plex now works with Google TV
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:52.440]   And this is very exciting if you go to the Plex blog
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.440]   They'll talk about it. They've added Google TV compatibility
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:02.680]   Now I'm unclear. I guess this means it's $4.99 $4.99
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:05.120]   I guess what this means is that you have to have
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.000]   the new
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:07.800]   3.1
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:11.640]   I'm not sure because it has to be a market right because it's an app to be in the market. Yeah
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:15.600]   Yeah, this is definitely gonna be the first app I buy on my TV absolutely a must I just
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:20.360]   Read up on Plex to know what the capabilities are but you're gonna really love this
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:25.600]   So the minute you're the all three of you who are watching and that's Matt me and Gina
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:31.560]   Who have Google TV? You might want to take a look at getting Plex on that right away. You'll be able to
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:37.640]   Stream over the Wi-Fi or your ethernet all the media in your house onto your Google TV
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:44.280]   I mean, it's just gonna it's just gonna I think make Google TV the and the and the Plex people say we're really happy
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:48.520]   We believe that this actually runs very well on Google TV. There's plenty of horsepower
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:51.840]   It handles a surprisingly large number of media formats
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:59.120]   They're pretty excited about this and Plex is open source and it kind of grew out of a hack the act Xbox
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:03.320]   XEMC which is also an open source product. So it's got this great history of like, you know
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:07.760]   It's such a good fit for Android and Spotify on theirs, you know CNN
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:12.360]   I mean you're gonna get a lot more channels revision 3 Twitter of course is on Plex
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:19.720]   So this is a really nice way to take your Google TV and amp it up and I think you add this to the new Google TV
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:27.240]   You're gonna have a very very nice home theater PC Matt will probably be writing about this on the PVR blog any minute now
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:30.000]   Matt how we get the new version
