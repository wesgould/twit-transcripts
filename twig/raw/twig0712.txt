[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   Coming up next on this week in Google is me Jason Howell filling in for Leo LaPorte one last time. I promise you he returns next week
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.960]   We've got Jeff Jarvis Stacy Higginbotham and Pruitt and a whole host of Google related news at the top of the show
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.520]   Anyways, we talk about Samsung possibly at least looking into the idea of bringing being
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.920]   chat into its
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.440]   devices and Google is a very happy about it a little panicked about it actually also the pixel fold
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.520]   Coming to Google I/O almost certainly we're gonna see the pixel fold at Google I/O along with a bunch of other hardware
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.160]   We talked about that the sub stack CEO
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:45.960]   Suffering from a little foot in mouth disease that's coming up and Drake and the weekend smash hit was created with AI
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.960]   And that's why you can't hear it anymore all that more coming up next on this week in Google
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.400]   Podcasts you love from people you trust
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.240]   This is twig

[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:09.800]   It's time for this week in Google. I'm Jason Howell filling in one more time just one more time for Leo Le Port who
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.440]   is rounding out his
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.200]   Vacation he's at that point of the vacation where he's like looking at the calendar like oh really do I have to do
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   I have to stop having this kind of fun
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.360]   Although I will say at the end of my vacation all four of us in my family. We were like ready to return
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.360]   So maybe he's at that point too
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.680]   Who knows you can ask him next week when he's back on this week in Google
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.360]   But it's great to be back joined as always by the awesome crew of twig starting with you Stacey Higginbotham
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.040]   Welcome. It's good to see you. Hello. How was your birth? We're fun. Yeah, exactly. I know
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.480]   How was your birthday celebration?
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:57.120]   Oh, it's delicious. There was so much food and cake and oh, I'll tell you about him. I got I got the Sonos speakers
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.680]   A little bit of a tease to the future
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.560]   So you can stay tuned for that also joining us and Pruitt
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.880]   The second person wearing a beanie it appears. I'm just following her leave
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.440]   Whatever miss his home. I thought them says goes
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.480]   Yeah, hey you guys make it look good and you're making me wish that I had brought mine to work today's
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.840]   It would be fitting because I've been cold all day. So I probably should have done that also joining us
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.440]   But not wearing a beanie on his head is Mr. Jazzy because I got a hair
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.160]   Yeah, you've got some awesome hair I do have to say
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.840]   It is whenever I I haven't done TV in a long time when I did TV always the makeup people and hair people would say oh
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.840]   I love your hair
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.960]   We've got we've got something to work with here
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:01.880]   Yeah waves waves very nice to see you see all three of you and
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.240]   Let's see here, you know once again
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:11.480]   You know last week was all about bringing democracy to the show and only using Jeff's lakes
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.400]   Links this week. I opened up the dock and once again, there was just this huge
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.320]   List of things I added to it. So it's supplemented. You did it
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.800]   It is and I just I just put stuff in for about saying we should talk about all my enemies just choices
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.680]   But but you put in some really great stuff. So we're gonna be talking about it a lot this week
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.120]   And then Leo will return next week and it will no longer be a democracy about it and yeah, don't
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.600]   Should we start talking about this whole Samsung being chat GPT threat?
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.520]   Which we talked a little bit about on all about Android last night the story is that
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.360]   There was a report googled out a hold of word that possibly Samsung was looking into
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.720]   The possibility let's say of replacing Google search on its Android phones with Bing and you know
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.360]   You can imagine probably a big reason for that is because Bing now has that chat the chat bot
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.440]   functionality with it
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.880]   But we started talking about this on the show last night and then immediately kind of got
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.880]   Pointed to another article from the chat room
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:31.200]   This article is from Android Authority that basically says like Samsung couldn't do that which is a really good point because
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:41.000]   If you are at least here in the US, you know Google makes you sign if you want to have Google suite of apps on your Android phone
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.040]   And that includes Google search you have to sign the mobile application distribution agreement
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.000]   Which basically says it's all or nothing essentially if you want the Google Play Store you also had to have
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.840]   Google search so it's kind of hard to believe that Samsung would sacrifice that in order to do Microsoft Bing
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.900]   Search on the device, but it's not entirely I was a hard mr
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.480]   Howl because isn't Samsung the same folks had decided you know what we want to de-Google our phones about
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.120]   eight nine years ago and go with was it Tyson and some other
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:23.720]   Well, but they're not doing it. I mean their phones aren't running. They're still running Android
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.560]   Yeah, that's true andro but that's not Google right
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:36.080]   Is not necessarily that is true. Yeah, I mean if you're talking about straight up like open source Android
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.520]   You can you can run open source Android on your device and not
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.320]   not be required to
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:53.240]   To you know make that a little bit what Amazon did with the fire phone because their phone and stuff was not necessarily a Google phone
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.540]   It was just open source code wait wait wait here is me
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.120]   traumatizing unboxing a Samsung phone
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.320]   big
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:11.120]   But it's I can't imagine the customers gonna be happy being with a chatbot that's magical I
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:18.960]   Feel like Samsung doesn't use like true open source Android don't know
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:26.080]   They use Android from Google that's that's kind of my point and the point of the Android Authority article is that
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.480]   Samsung of all companies has totally agreed
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:36.640]   To the motto the mobile application distribution agreement which basically says you know if you get a Samsung
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.880]   You expect the play store to be on that device or at least we do here in the US
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.720]   And I mean that's just the way it's always been with Samsung
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.080]   And with most Android phones most people buying Android phones
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:55.040]   Do have that expectation here in the US especially that there's gonna be the play store. There's gonna be Google search
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.440]   There's gonna be Google Maps. There's gonna be whatever you know insert your you know
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:06.480]   any number of Google apps that are installed on almost every Android device in the US here and if they
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:13.560]   Decided to go with a different search. They're breaking that agreement. They can't have the full suite of apps
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:21.160]   They're no longer allowed to have Google Play Store on there. They're no longer allowed to have Google Maps or any any of them basically
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160]   It's like all or nothing
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:30.880]   That's the difference. Yeah, I get that but I swear I thought they at least toyed with the idea of
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:39.240]   Doing just that several years ago because of you can sideload stuff pretty easily in the Android ecosystem
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.920]   And not necessarily have to go through the play store if you want to do your own
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.880]   Samsung store or what have you
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.280]   Developers could still have their apps
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:57.040]   Publish there as well and I'm sure they wouldn't mine having apps published on Samsung devices because you know
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.040]   They would like the number one
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:05.000]   manufacturer of phones in the planet, right? It's not the iPhone the Samsung's a number one, right?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.920]   Yeah, I mean, but it would be that would be a huge blow if
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:16.240]   Because when I think of Samsung I also you're right the numbers are huge as far as
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.200]   user base worldwide Samsung is
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.600]   I believe Samsung's on top
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.760]   But I'd say the majority of those users are not users that we would consider power
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:35.920]   Users, okay. Yeah, yeah, side loading no matter how easy it is is an extra step and it's and it's actually
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:42.440]   Kind of not super easy to understand when it's your first time sideloading an app, you know, it makes sense to us
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.280]   Yeah, but I think to the average person like when I think of my my mom
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.360]   Having I mean she has an iPhone, but you know if she was on Android
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.120]   She'd probably have a Samsung phone and if I think of her
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.480]   You know based on what you're saying like oh, but sideloading is pretty easy if she wanted Google Maps like I
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:06.220]   Could never imagine a million years. My mom actually deciding like I'm you know, I'm gonna sideload
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:16.160]   She'd be calling me to do that and that's you know, that's a step too far. I think yeah, that's my point
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:23.120]   Um, okay, so here's some some history if y'all want it. Yes, apparently love his all the way back
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.880]   in
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:31.360]   2010 Samsung tried to replace Android by launching its own mobile OS called bada bada. That's right. I'll be
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:38.480]   Okay, 2012 and you try it again with tizen. So there's tizen. Okay, and then
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.840]   in response Google bought Motorola
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.960]   Oh, yeah
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.560]   We're gonna buy we're gonna make our phones. We'll protect it. Yeah, and then in 2014
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.840]   They sold buterola because they apparently felt like they didn't need it anymore. Yeah
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:11:00.160]   Apparently in 2017 the launch of Bixby which went
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:06.800]   Is Bixby even still on the phone? Yeah, my phone. Okay. Yeah, I'm just yeah Bixby is still around
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:13.600]   Still kicking so that was that was kind of threatening, but they also have partnerships not just on the mobile phone
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.120]   um
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.760]   The tensor chipset in the google pixel phones is made by samsung's foundry operations
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.440]   um
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.840]   They also are they have a pretty tight partnerships with smart things and google home
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.240]   and
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.600]   So yeah
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.720]   That's the history there if that helps they did internet it did help
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.160]   It's it certainly shows that I think along the way samsung would love
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.800]   You know many many times would love to have autonomy and kind of control the entire thing
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.520]   Which makes sense about samsung they're very much, you know all about their ecosystem
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:57.840]   So even within the world of android they still have their devices playing nicer with their other devices than they
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.160]   They are
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.960]   It's big as they are it makes sense for them to consider
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.400]   You know why not just do our own thing, you know because it's not just mobile phones with with them
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.720]   it's the televisions it's the
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   Bag and refrigerators that I refuse but they've never done a good job with that stuff
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.520]   Right people complain about what some some adds to the phone
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.400]   It's like gm. Did he read okay
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:26.000]   The the to be your operating systems on their car. I'm never i'm not buying a gm car without
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.240]   Is android rapple
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.760]   Yeah, you know they're bad at it to samsung's credit because I was one of those people for many years
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.240]   It said you know what this is the reason I don't have a samsung phone because there's too much crap
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.520]   Where on top of the android and I just want to get to the android
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:48.400]   I always wanted those folks but to their credit this lasts several iterations here of the I guess you can go all the way back to maybe ds
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.480]   20
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:59.040]   Or the model right before that the os got a lot cleaner. Oh that actually was so the article i'm referencing is from make use of
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:06.080]   They actually talk about the reason that happened is because google was pushing so hard on samsung to stop doing it
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:13.520]   Uh-huh so that was part of their their frustrations with each other and why samsung was like no no i'll build my own darn it
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.800]   You know because oh i'm sorry go ahead
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.000]   No, I was just gonna say which is so anti-consumer
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.880]   You know queen peruut
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:29.760]   She started out as a samsung user a gazillion years ago and then when the pixel line started coming out
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.960]   She she got into the pixel world and and just like me just lights clean android
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:41.840]   And I don't remember which samsung model came out that she wanted to try it was it was a note line so it's somewhere
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.560]   One of the last time there was a note
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:53.360]   She tried the note and it drove her nuts because the os was just so cluttered with stuff and she's she's like I used to love the stylus and love
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.880]   Navigating through but this is just it's too. It's too busy. I believe that's the word. She said it's just too busy
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.800]   She was used to the vanilla
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.840]   Android and now fast forward to I guess 2021
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.720]   She got a s
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:14.800]   Whatever it is this latest samsung. She's she's back on samsung now. She doesn't have a pixel and she's totally fine
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.680]   You don't have you don't hear her fussing about it's being too busy or just too much stuff going on
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.400]   She's back in that ecosystem that she used to love and it's cleaner now
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.960]   So I mean it I got to give him credit for that
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.040]   I said all of them, but they've got
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.560]   That in my opinion my experience they've definitely improved that in the last handful of years
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:40.640]   Because I was full of fully for forever on board with this this idea that samsung
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.160]   You know they clutter their devices with too many features
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.600]   They go out of their way to make sure you know about every single little feature and it gets really annoying
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.560]   At least in the beginning of setting up a phone lots of clutter
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:57.760]   The bubbly sounds and the little quick everything gets tapped on it sounded like bubbles bursting
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Right
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.920]   Gosh just stop all this cute stuff. It's a phone. I'm not a 13 year old girl
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.240]   Somebody likes it, but it isn't me
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:14.640]   Um, they have improved a lot of that stuff and I give samsung full credit. I just have a really hard time
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.440]   like uh, I have a hard time
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.640]   Seeing samsung turn away
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.960]   from
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.960]   What is arguably the backbone of its success in my opinion
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.680]   I mean, you know samsung does a lot of things right on their own
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.160]   but at the core of it is
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.040]   Is android and is the google experience of android?
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.120]   If samsung, you know required you to install
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:47.200]   Apps that run on every android platform, but you've got to get them over here now instead of over here
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.320]   I just don't think it would be as successful as it is right now
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.520]   But maybe it could be negotiation it may just be negotiation. Yeah, be saying we could go to bid. Yes
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.760]   Right, um
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.760]   But you know, I also think this prediction will come back to haunt me
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.600]   But I think that there's going to be a huge
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.920]   um
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.640]   Not buyers remorse but installers remorse on chat gpt in search
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:18.080]   I think it's going to be the media is going to be so on top of of every single thing. It does wrong
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.680]   Lively and people are making mistakes. It's not going to deliver a good experience
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.200]   It's going to be wrong because it's not meant to do this at all
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.360]   and um
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.800]   Google I think the mistake google is making is not saying we're the cautious ones
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.000]   We're going to do it right. Oh, microsoft is rushing in because they're so desperate
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.960]   And I'm kind of surprised that google isn't doing that and they're saying, okay, okay. What running you were rush
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.600]   Yeah, they're kind of doing the opposite of that. Yeah, they are and like, oh, we don't want to be left behind
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.640]   This is the first real major threat that we've put that we've faced
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.920]   You know our in decades not I don't think I don't think it is everybody's screaming
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.080]   I just saw a piece of the washington post just now
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.760]   um
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.720]   Goochatsy pt will mean the languages will disappear
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:04.800]   No, it could actually be in the opposite. There's there everybody's trying to find their profound experience
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.040]   Elon musket will destroy humanity down to it will destroy google's business
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:16.160]   I don't I think it's cool to start off with but I don't think it's going to be a game changer for these companies for quite a while
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.240]   am I crazy?
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.480]   You know um
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.160]   I saw an article
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:27.040]   Yesterday maybe in nature and it was AI search engines are exploding a number. Are they any good?
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.680]   And I thought it was going to be a
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.800]   An academic study. I was kind of impressed that they pulled it out so quickly
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.840]   It's an article
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.000]   It was clicky. It was it was not that kind that was not that part of nature
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.080]   um, and so
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.480]   But it is a researcher who's evaluating
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.280]   large language models
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.440]   Oh, it's someone from hugging face, which is uh, okay. Stay with diffusion
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.080]   Yeah, um
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.360]   So it the gist of it was like eh
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.800]   They're not there yet and they're also
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:09.920]   When they're wrong, they're not they're wrong in ways that it's hard for people to understand or recognize so they're really a problem
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:15.520]   Um, so that was kind of the gist of this article, but I was very disappointed that it wasn't more sciencey
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.080]   So I couldn't say 30 of them have room for improvement
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:27.520]   I mean, we're at the beginning of of of you know, this at least this modern infusion or attempt to infuse
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.680]   What we think of as search and have reinforced for decades
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.640]   With this kind of more conversational kind of do everything
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.160]   View that we apparently have about chatbots
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:46.240]   um just yesterday for all about android there were there were a couple of uh of
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.520]   New phones released, you know a Xiaomi phone and a sous phone and everything
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:58.640]   And so I was kind of prepping it for the doc and getting ready to put in the show and it came down to the part where when I'm like
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.800]   Creating my notes and everything for the show. I had to like start pulling specs and stuff and
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:07.840]   Uh in that moment. I was just like shoot me like the last thing I want to do is like, you know
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.760]   Transcribe specs for yet another phone. I've done it so many times and then I thought yeah wait a minute
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.720]   Yeah
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:22.240]   I could I could open up being chatbot and and see what it does as far as transcribing the specs because I don't want to do it
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.240]   And I did it and it did it great. I checked the data the data was accurate
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:32.480]   I was like god. I kind of feel dirty for having done that but I mean it did the same thing I was going to do
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.920]   You know, I still bring my own context to the show. So it's not like i'm just reading a robot
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.000]   but um
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.560]   But yeah, so I think that was just a really interesting experience
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:50.080]   To me, it's like I am using search in that capacity to do something useful in a way that I haven't
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.880]   Before and uh, yeah, if that's the direction that search is headed
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.400]   Like I'm I'm interested in that that's that's compelling to me
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:07.280]   I think we're gonna have to have better programs for our interns because a lot of things. Yeah, you would have an intern do yes
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.280]   That's not a bad thing. I'm just like oh
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.920]   Yeah, because like I was talking to my child who has a job dealing with data and doing things like
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.920]   Thank you notes and like just real scut work for like
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.040]   psychotherapy practice and like
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:30.960]   They're automating the heck out of what their job is now and it's it's great. So i'm like, oh
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:38.720]   Yeah, that's fine, but I agree with you. We will have to find some more scut work for so I put it a story on higher level scut work
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.840]   Because you got a half scut where it's a progress in uh, pain. You gotta do
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.960]   Yeah, you can't start like you can't give like a 18 year old or a 22 year old out of college something that's
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.480]   Yeah, it requires 20 years of experience, but right?
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.360]   Right. I can judge me so so I put in a story at line 35, which is related to this, but since it's democracy
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.360]   I'll bring it up now. Yeah, dude. Um
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.880]   How to where people are using judging we need to get multiple full-time job. Yes the over employed
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:11.600]   Yeah, yeah, which is fascinating and I bet it's about it's probably overdone as a story and they turn to a trend that's not really a trend
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.680]   But it's interesting you can see how the efficiencies for this kind of crap work
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:22.720]   Or tremendous. Well, yes, and so I read through that article and I think what really struck me about that is
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:30.480]   That these over employed so these are people who have realized hey, I can I can instead of having one job
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.800]   I can have two three
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.560]   four jobs because I was going too far
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.360]   Yeah, five. I don't think I could pull off five
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.960]   But I can do four
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:46.160]   And I mean they're making upwards of like 500,000 a year because they're working these multiple jobs because AI
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:51.520]   Does like 75 percent of the normal kind of busy work that they would do
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.400]   And I guess my mind just kind of went to okay
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.680]   Yeah, now because we're at the beginning of all this but that's got to change like I can't imagine
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.960]   That's the new norm is everybody can work four jobs and get paid, you know half a million dollars a year because
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:13.440]   Uh, AI bots are gonna help them work more efficiently like everything's gonna adjust towards that at some point. So enjoy it while you can
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:18.400]   Well, yeah, and that's the way we are. I mean, that's what we're kind of
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:26.800]   We're accelerating this role of like just hyper is it hyper capitalism hyper productivity hyper something where
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.280]   This will be good for like yeah a year or two, but if you can make
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.840]   500k true a million dollars during that year or two and then
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.800]   If you're already doing this you're probably gonna spot the next thing then you just hop up here
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.760]   Just you just can't really sit anymore. Yeah
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:52.720]   Yeah, maybe i'm just jealous jealous. Yeah. I mean, I love being complacent. I'm not gonna lie. I'm like god
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:58.880]   You get into that point. Let it's just chill 45. I deserve to be chill
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.800]   I just use my experience. I deserve a frozen
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.640]   Well
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.640]   be frozen
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.040]   You know, we talked on sunday because I had the honor and pleasure of being on the
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:16.160]   The big big chair the big show big show. Yes, indeed. Thank you
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.720]   A lot of fun. Appreciate you having me on
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:24.160]   And I asked the same question to dan patterson and chase and hiner about you know
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:31.440]   How good is this going to be for companies, you know, in particularly like enterprise and
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.280]   We discussed that a lot of automation could go into place
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.480]   um once the ai is trained up and that's going to help things like
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:46.960]   Terminated someone, you know someone decides they want to leave the company because they got another job
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:53.120]   You know, so we need to terminate them in the system because what happens and there was some reported stories that
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.160]   people to get terminated, but a couple
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:02.560]   Acts a couple of things would still have access for them after they're terminated and it should have been in a checklist
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.120]   You know someone could still log into the crm if you will or something like that
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.720]   And if you can log into the crm you probably can log into some other
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.840]   Server on the network that you shouldn't be able to log into outside of the company
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.720]   um and ai could go in and take those
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:27.280]   Different scripts that could be run across multiple systems and maybe create one super script if you would a termination script
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:33.280]   Right, you know, I at the previous company. I worked that we had a a script for
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.240]   terms, you know, and that's what we called it terms and it was
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:44.080]   Pretty methodical and after doing you do three or four of them in a row
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:50.160]   Yeah, you can see why someone would rather have this that process automated
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:56.400]   But we couldn't automate it because if you're using um active directory micro sauce active directory
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.880]   It could handle a lot of things, but it couldn't necessarily handle the things on say
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.360]   a
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.880]   Red hat linux box that needed to go through and have things
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.880]   Checked off from permissions and killing accounts and stuff like that
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.920]   So if we could get scripts to do all of that in one that would be great
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:21.680]   Looking to do the to do the rundown
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.960]   Heck honestly, it ai to be us. We can have
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.400]   Oh, no, no, I fall in here as you are
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.920]   I mean honestly
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:41.120]   An ai to construct the rundown that's that's fully believable like when I think about my tasks on on creating a runtime
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.160]   Everything it's it's pulling you know
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:51.520]   What are the what are the the news items that are getting kind of the most attention or or the news items that I just find personally fascinating
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:57.760]   Um, so there is a little bit of that but pretty easy to for an a for an ai system to understand
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:03.920]   What news stories are the big ones or the controversial ones or the you know the the funniest ones
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.160]   Depending on how people online are reacting to them compile a list of those
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.120]   Uh go through each article and pull out the most important notes from each article like
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.280]   I can totally see an ai system. Maybe I'm building one right now, you know
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:24.720]   An ai system for podcasters and notes in a doc. I mean that seems incredibly doable. By the time we're off
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.720]   You'll see a link in the chat
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:34.240]   True never knows it may have just given someone a really great idea, but um
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:39.760]   So so then getting back to this idea of ai infused in search
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.760]   We know that google of course has its bard
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:49.120]   Beyond that google saw this thing, you know this this potential
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:55.920]   Scenario with sam san going in a different direction and apparently at least to according to the uh,
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.400]   I think it was the new york times
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.640]   That was like, you know an indicator for google to really jump on okay
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:08.320]   Yet another reason why we really need to step up our efforts for for integrating ai into search
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:12.240]   um when I think of ai on mobile and what we've
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:18.400]   Interacted with over the past five seven years of what has been our current model of ai
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:24.560]   It's been pretty useful at times sometimes it's been kind of like really um, you know
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:31.120]   I expected better of you, but sometimes you know ai on on the mobile device has been pretty magical
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.480]   What do we think about like the next five years the next five years?
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.400]   Based on what we're seeing right now with ai and
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:44.320]   Going forward if google is like full court press to bring these features into into search
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.560]   That means it's also bringing it into mobile and what does that mean for our day-to-day?
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:53.280]   As far as that's concerned. Well, hold on. I mean there's been ai on our mobile devices forever
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.840]   I mean look at portrait mode that is that is algorithms designed to isolate me
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:03.680]   I mean so so I want us to be a little bit more specific there just because I mean right no I
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.320]   That's a good point and I
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.560]   I do I did intend for that
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:15.680]   We have had ai on our phones and google has made a really big deal about that for the past right however many years
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.320]   But I feel like where we're at right now is we're suddenly or people
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:27.440]   Are dazzled by what ai can do now that it couldn't do before and it seems like a like a shift
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.840]   So what does that mean going forward?
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:37.440]   We're dazzled by it because it's something that we think of as being unique to ourselves and human which is facility with language and
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.640]   summaries right so so
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:46.960]   And it's so visible and it's so neat. We're like oh the computer looks like us now
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.080]   Whereas the computer isolating pixels for portraiture or
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:58.800]   Suggesting tone, you know, you're like what is or or Stacy right? Oh the computer looks like us
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:03.040]   Right it's both reactions at once right right yeah, that's true. So
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.880]   You know and I don't know about search on my phone like
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:13.680]   Okay search is awesome because search is a x is still 60 billion. It's a multi
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:20.160]   Bill like it is the revenue that it is the money that underlies all this innovation for google in particular
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.640]   Microsoft has other better
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:28.480]   Sources of revenue as well right so when we break this question down i'm like
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.280]   Search is so important to google because it's their it's their cash cow
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:41.280]   Will it change the way we do things on our phone? Yes? Will it change things in a way that is more?
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:47.600]   Astronomical than what we've already seen i'm a little doubtful
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.440]   um
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.840]   But it's a huge threat to google from that perspective so
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.520]   I mean it but it's Stacy
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.840]   Yeah, is it
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.480]   Um, you know, I think that's what the presumption is and everybody was saying. Oh my god. Oh my god
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.960]   Microsoft's ahead of google google's a problem
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:12.800]   What's the value we get for and and leo loves his search engine then I keep on forgetting the name of it even
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   But is it nieva nieva? Yeah, nieva
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.600]   Um, but the value we get from search is not conversation
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.440]   Right it's answers to questions. Right and um
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:31.360]   We try you know everybody tried to use the voice devices and we talked about this last week where the voice devices go away
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:37.200]   Because we really don't get information that way. It's not very convenient. Maybe that's partly voice but it's partly also conversation
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.200]   I don't know i Stacy. I had the same kind of reaction you did first, but i'm starting to
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.840]   um doubt myself there whether
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.480]   uh
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:52.560]   If if being keeps on giving back uh wordy wrong answers
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:57.280]   Is google better off saying but we're google
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:02.080]   Well, do you think I mean I don't think it'll give wordy bad answers forever
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.200]   Yeah, I think I mean I think
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:10.000]   We recognize that that's a problem. I I think this initial like
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:18.320]   It's glitchy is the same sort of you remember when we had mobile phones in the very beginning and like calls were dropped and people were appalled
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:23.120]   And people made fun of it like it was an active punchline way early on in the mobile phone era, right?
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.920]   And now best effort voice
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:31.040]   Yeah, we all just accept it right that's that's just a part of life. It's
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.560]   whatever
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:38.160]   so a best effort search that is impressive and offers other features like
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.480]   you know
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.680]   Bigger answers maybe more convenience because you have to do less
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:51.360]   Might actually be the same sort of thing as best effort voice one time unthinkable and now we're like yeah, right? You know what you're getting right?
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.040]   um
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.880]   So that's that's a I don't I just don't know. Yeah, the other question is
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:04.560]   For something like like if sam's like google pays apple and sam's son to put search on their phones, right?
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:10.080]   And those are big deals and those are big deals because google needs everybody to be funneling
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:16.560]   Search through google right because that's again their cash cow. So what is the impact if
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.840]   If apple's like google
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.720]   Everybody wants being you're just not the hotness anymore. I'm going over to microsoft
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.600]   That's gonna suck for google because that is I don't know how many web searches away from them
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.560]   and that means those people don't see their ads so
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:39.760]   I don't know if it's just a quality on the search or if it's a like fundamental business issue if that makes sense
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.560]   Yeah, yeah, I don't know you're right. We don't know
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.600]   Um, but I think google could this is this is you know, we talked about before and said they're run down today too
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.000]   I think google could make a big mistake
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.840]   Following
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:58.320]   Microsoft here and they could differentiate themselves by saying we're not going to do it until we get the right answers
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.320]   We're not going to do it. This is what we depend upon
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:06.880]   I don't know. I think it would be a mistake to say we're not going to do it until we get like the right answers
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.280]   What what is that point? Yeah?
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:15.360]   So i'm like where do we draw the is it three nines? Is it right? Right? Right?
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.760]   One nine and a bunch of eights. I don't know so that's I don't know
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.840]   But the alternative is I'm a terrible pundit
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:29.200]   But the the opposite side of that coin is you know, where where do you draw the line?
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:33.040]   To wait long enough for it to be quote-unquote safe
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:39.760]   Or you know what google apparently is doing according to this article that you put in here from from bloomberg
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.400]   About just launching bard
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:48.080]   Ethics you know ai ethics be damned. Yeah, they were very google was very focused
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.520]   and
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.720]   attentive
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.160]   When it needed to be like when it was feet were held to the fire
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.320]   Uh when they let out let go of uh timnet gebaru
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.560]   And suddenly this ai ethics thing was called into question and google
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.480]   You know kind of okay
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.360]   We're really focused on this until there was competition
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.960]   And then all that went out the window according to this article a lot of people
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:17.120]   You know from the inside saying you know google was very quick to kind of turn on its heels and just say
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:22.000]   You know, this is now priority number one put that on the on the back burner
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.200]   We got to launch no matter what and we got to get we got to get this stuff into all of our products
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.400]   But long one go look at it. Yeah, it's a potential
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.360]   Revenue string for profit, right?
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.200]   Yeah, I don't know how
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:43.120]   Um, I mean by way of by way of search and adds the way that they are already
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:48.320]   Um, right if i'm kind of following, you know, where kind of where you were coming from stacy
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.120]   I saw that story and I thought well
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:56.800]   Google jumped on it because microsoft jumped on it and google said you know what if microsoft's jumping on it
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:01.280]   It's got to be something there. We already do search pretty dad gum good and we can
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.880]   Up the ante if he will and make it even better and just keep getting more and more revenue
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.640]   Puff it in towards our product the that's that's just how I saw it
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:15.680]   And I know that these staff could you know, would be upset about it
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.720]   But at the same time google is still a dad gum business and
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:24.480]   You know, they don't care about people. I hope there's a transcript somewhere i'm sitting up or but try saying
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.480]   We're pretty dad gum good
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.240]   I really hope for that. I want to
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.880]   We're a business. We're for profit
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:37.760]   I think a lot of people lose sight of that all these companies that we enjoy to
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.240]   Uh speaking about each week
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.040]   The companies their businesses first and you know, we like to hope that they're
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.000]   Doing the right thing and being nice to the staff and employees or what have you but
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.200]   Bottom line is profit at the end of the day
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:36:00.640]   Did anyone watch the 60 minutes thing on AI? I did not see that this Sunday. I couldn't bear it
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.520]   It was hard
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.680]   It was hard. I should make it through it
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:11.360]   Margaret Mitchell said she couldn't bear to either or timmy gabra one of the authors of the of the staister parents said
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.360]   I can't bear to watch it. I'll read the transcript
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:19.520]   Um, I put something at the last minute there. There was a there were really wrong about about something
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.520]   um
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.720]   Where they they there was this moment. I did see this clip
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.160]   where
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.640]   Sundar says there are these unexpected behaviors
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.160]   and
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:35.440]   The unexpected behavior was supposedly it taught itself an entire language without being taught the language
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.920]   And that's just plain wrong
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.480]   Completely wrong
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.720]   It was trained on the language google talked about how it was trained on the language. It's palm
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.760]   And they let it out there like this mysterious machine
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.160]   You know grabbed a whole bunch of knowledge and we don't even know how it did it not the case
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:58.240]   Get ready ant get ready. It was an example of push the button and
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.120]   moral pattern
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:05.840]   I don't know stacy miss the moral panic. I know I was here for it. Okay
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:11.440]   I was here for the moral panic. I saw the button. I was like, is that the same fire that elmos in front of in the meme?
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.520]   Fire
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.840]   Awesome. What was the movie? What was that movie? Not elmos fire?
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.960]   I don't know there was saying elmos fire, but I almost fire it was saying elmos fire right? Okay
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:32.160]   That's is that the basis of elmowin front of the fire? Oh, I don't know
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:37.440]   That's a good question. I have no idea for for good. Let's ask chat gpt
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.280]   It'll make some part. You know what I asked so I asked bard
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:46.400]   How how would chat gpt change search and I also asked it
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.720]   I asked it r is chat gpt a threat to search, but it got it got through
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.880]   um and
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.640]   Bar doesn't think too highly of it surprisingly, but it does say
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.680]   Chat gpt could change search in a number of ways
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.600]   For example, it could be used to provide more comprehensive and informative answers to questions
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.160]   This is like and I'll just answer your question then jason on your mobile phone
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.480]   Personalized search results better to match the user's interests on your mobile phone
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:16.320]   Make it easier to find information on complex or controversial topics
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:22.400]   Help users understand the context of information and make it easier to find information in different languages
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.600]   however
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.920]   It is important to note that chat gpt is still under development. It is not clear yet how it will be used in the future
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:35.040]   So there is there's how it could change search. It's a prevarication machine
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.960]   I don't think it's a prevarication machine that is a really
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.800]   Dicy or like that's a scandalous kind of comment there
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.760]   I was 20. No word was that you just
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:52.480]   Perbed a fancy way of saying lying no no line line skirting
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.840]   Scumbity a train as a journalist. I like it's lying
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:05.840]   I was I was just gonna I don't think I talked about this, but I went to a presentation
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:12.160]   Actually, it was about tiny ml in factory automation. So I was surprised when chat gpt came up
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.800]   but this company was talking about how
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:22.560]   In a factory to control your equipment you have something called a programmable logic controller, which is a dedicated computer that only
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:29.200]   Manages information and data and control of that one piece of equipment and it's not connected to the internet usually
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:35.760]   Um, but these plc's are like highly custom very fancy and they all have their own unique programming languages
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   It's a total bear to deal with them
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.040]   but
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:44.080]   This company used they wanted to apply a tiny machine learning model in tie it to
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.680]   Software that was going to run from the internet basically to normal people software not plc software
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:54.640]   So to to write that code that would combine these things they used chat gpt
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.320]   and
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.760]   They told it what they were trying to do and they it and the
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:06.480]   Maker the plc in a road code for them and they actually ended up using about 40 percent of the code
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:11.280]   Which saved them like four hours worth of work, which I think is the right way to look at this
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.640]   Yes, yes, so and people who don't know how to code
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.760]   Can now tell the machine what they want to do. I think that's that's huge power. Well, no
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:24.320]   I wouldn't say that yet because like I don't know how to code for a plc
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.800]   You still had to have that knowledge
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:32.320]   Well, no, but I think like as someone who doesn't know how to code what I would end up doing is say hey chat gpt
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.000]   I want to do this this and this and it would do it, but if it didn't work
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.840]   I don't have any tools to fix it. There's no way for you to know last week. There was a story
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.840]   We didn't get to about a
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:49.120]   Everybody and all gaz children have their their gender-dev AIs now. There's one that debugs the programming as it writes it
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.280]   Oh
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.280]   That is fancy
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.080]   That could get my little like ADHD braving the programming right there
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.600]   Like I already did this. I'm not looking at it again
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:09.680]   There'll be a new career a new career direction is someone who's not actually a coder, but who's good at
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:15.920]   At understanding how to get you know AIs breaking parts of t to code things, you know
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.280]   Organized enough to know the right questions. Yeah
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.320]   Interesting stuff
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.360]   Cool, well, let's uh, let's take a quick break
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:28.640]   And then we got a whole lot more to talk about this week
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.040]   You had to know AI was going to come up in this show
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.960]   I feel like every show across the network these days has some sort of AI
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.080]   Angle to it because it's just how can it not?
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:44.320]   Um, I'm sorry. Yeah, discussion is a worth listening to unlike the mass media. Oh, sorry. Yes
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:50.880]   It's still you are right there you go and that's why you love twit
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:57.600]   Um, but let's take a break and thank the sponsor of this episode of this week in google is brought to you by sisco
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.840]   Moraki the experts in cloud based networking for hybrid work
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:07.600]   Uh, you could have employees working from home. They could be working, you know in a cabin
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.600]   Uh in the mountains somewhere as long as it has good wifi imaging
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:17.280]   Uh, or you know a lounge chair on the beach again good good coverage
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:23.040]   Is kind of required in that situation, but a cloud managed network provides the same exceptional work experience
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:30.240]   No matter where they are it's very liberating you may as well welcome hybrid work because it's not going anywhere
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:36.720]   It's here to stay hybrid work works best in the cloud. It has its perks for both employees and leaders
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:41.760]   Workers can move faster. They can deliver better results with a cloud managed network
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:48.880]   And then you know the benefit to leaders is automating distributed operations building more sustainable
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:55.040]   Work spaces and proactively protecting the network and idg market pulse research report
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:43:00.800]   Conducted for moraki actually highlights top tier opportunities in supporting hybrid work
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:06.400]   Hybrid work is a priority for 78 of c suite executives 78
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:13.280]   Leaders want to drive collaboration forward. They also want to stay on top of or in fact boost
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:21.920]   Productivity and security hybrid work as we very well know has a number of challenges as well the idg report
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.640]   Uh raises the red flag about security
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:32.960]   It notes that 48 percent of leaders report cybersecurity threats as a primary obstacle to improving workforce experiences
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:38.800]   Um always on security monitoring is part of what makes the cloud managed network so awesome
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:43.040]   It can use apps from moraki's vast ecosystem of partners
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:50.640]   These are turnkey solutions built to work seamlessly with the moraki cloud platform for things like asset tracking
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.040]   Location analytics and more
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.840]   And you can gather insights on how people use their work spaces as one example in a smart space
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:03.600]   Environmental sensors can actually track activity and occupancy levels to stay on top of cleanliness
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:09.040]   Uh, you can reserve work spaces. That's based on vacancy and employee profiles
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:13.840]   Uh to allow employees to scout out a spot in a snap
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:19.760]   Those locations and restricted environments can actually be booked in advance and include time-based
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:28.080]   Door access and then finally mobile device management that's integrating devices and systems to allow it to manage update
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.160]   troubleshoot company-owned devices
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:35.120]   Uh even when the device and employee are in that remote location somewhere
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:40.640]   So you can turn any space into a place of productivity and empower your organization with the same
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:47.280]   exceptional experience no matter where they work with moraki and the sisco suite of technology
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:51.040]   Learn how your organization can make hybrid work work
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:55.040]   All you gotta do is visit moraki.cisco.com
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:45:02.240]   Slash twitch and check it out for yourself and we thank sisco moraki for their support of this week in
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.440]   google
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.440]   bra bra
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.400]   Um
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:13.760]   Do we want to step off the the gas the ai gas pedal for a moment and talk a little bit about io because we've got some interesting
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:18.640]   You're the boss. You're the boss. No, no keep going. Keep your love. All right. Yeah our discussions apparently
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.440]   No, no, I vote for io
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.680]   No, people hate our ai discussions
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:29.280]   I don't know. I was just I mean, I'm not saying we won't go venture back into the ai waters
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.800]   But at some point but ant was wearing his ironic hat
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.240]   So
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:43.280]   I always give out sarcasm through uh to my family here and no one ever gets it. They all think i'm serious
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.240]   So
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:50.160]   I should be surprised. I would take you seriously to it. Yeah, it's true because it's the smart thing to do your
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.640]   Serious guy
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.400]   Well, let's talk about it. Let's talk a little bit about io which I mean
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.800]   Honestly, let's be real. We're probably gonna hear a heck of a lot about ai
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.360]   Uh in a number of different ways
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.880]   Uh at io questions will they screw it up again? Yeah, right?
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.440]   Yeah, the uh, you know any any stage demos. How are those gonna go?
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:16.000]   I mean could could get remember to bring the phone and leave it there
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.880]   But we've been hearing um
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.480]   We're we're kind of getting a good indication or good view
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.320]   Into
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:33.200]   the hardware aspect of io which for any developers probably the lesser exciting
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.800]   aspect of google io as you know as a developer conference after all but
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:45.200]   You know, we've all been to io. I think I think all of us have been to io one one time or another
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:49.520]   And when we're at io and you know, they're they're unloading
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.080]   Information about their new devices or anything like that. Yeah, definitely gets a whole
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:47:00.400]   Yeah, a lot of attention and and I think what's interesting about this google io is that
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:09.200]   There are the there are the devices that we know of and then there's the device that we've only heard about but hasn't really
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.680]   Been officially announced
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:18.000]   Uh, which is the pixel fold and it actually looks like this is almost certain to happen
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:23.040]   CNBC has its own sources there have been other leaks leading up to now, but cnbc
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:30.480]   Uh is you know, basically saying like it's on the pixel fold that's google's first foldable device
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:36.560]   Is going to be launched at google io and I mean it's it's going to be announced may 10th
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:39.360]   pre-order same day
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.640]   um
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:45.680]   Available from my understanding june 27th so a month later a month and a half later
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:50.400]   Probably somewhere between 17 and 1800 dollars so a pricey device
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.520]   I know and it'll be buying that tomorrow
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:58.400]   Yeah
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.360]   Somebody gives Stacy some ox calm down calm down
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:08.720]   Were you getting your hopes up or something
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:13.520]   Well, I haven't even spent that much money on shoes and I know I spent an
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:19.920]   amount of money on shoes and that that is a lot it's a lot of no
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:23.040]   That's what shoes you're wearing now, Stacy
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.920]   Well right now i'm wearing my llb slippers
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:35.520]   But I do have all the more worth is llb slippers. Thank you very much
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:41.840]   I have some fancy like I have some Prada loafers that were very expensive
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.800]   But not expensive but not expensive but not pixle fold expensive
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.800]   $100 good grief man
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.960]   It is um
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:57.920]   Does it make it any better to say that that's about the same price as samsung's zfold?
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:03.040]   No, they're like same same ish area, but no that's not true
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:09.600]   Is that how much the phone that lio gave me was no? Did he give me the zfold? No no no no no no the flip
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:14.000]   He gave me the flip the smaller one. Oh, how much does it flip cost?
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:21.040]   I think that's more like 999. That's like a yeah, I think so device. Yeah, which I also think is a better aside
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.280]   That's still more than my shoes. Yeah
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:27.040]   Still getting some expensive phone should not be a thousand dollars
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:31.200]   I mean phones are expensive. Yeah, but I mean not be a thousand dollars
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.640]   700 tops in my opinion. Yeah, yeah
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:37.520]   Paying the samsung tax maybe I don't know
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:45.600]   This is 999. Yep. Yeah, I mean get yourself a dagger macbook pro for like 1500 bucks
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:50.320]   And you can make calls or avoid on that thing. Oh, are open you're not gonna hold it out already
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.480]   Cockets go on a cheese vacation. Okay. Yeah, they're in that around like this is different things
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.120]   Okay, macbook air
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:01.760]   I was like you've got the biceps to carry a pro around but the rest of us no way
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.880]   Yeah, this is this is ant on his phone. He's like, oh, hello
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.080]   Do it do it do it
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:14.560]   It's just crazy these these devices cost this much and I've ran it about this before I ran about it on here
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:15.360]   but
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.320]   just
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:16.880]   a
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:22.640]   $1,200 phone is is the open endless price and three months later is going to be $900
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:28.080]   I guarantee it and then another three months from that it's going to be roughly 500 bucks
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:33.600]   Why not just come out to gate with it under a thousand dollars just and stop overcharging us for
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:39.600]   For these devices on launch day. It's ridiculous because people will pay for it. Yeah, okay
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:45.600]   We need to stop paying for it and well at some point some people will I mean they're people buy gold phones
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:52.480]   Oh, yeah, I did phones. Hey you person stop being excited about that phone stop finding value in that price
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.120]   Some people just will
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:00.240]   And don't give me your I enjoyed a pixel 6 pro but this joint is not a thousand dollar
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:07.840]   Piece of equipment is not it does well and did what it need to do had its little issues that had to have some software updates to fix it
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:13.840]   Um still not a thousand dollar phone in my what I don't understand is the is the utility
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.520]   Unless you're a game player, I guess of the of the vertical fold
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:21.760]   Stacy's horizontal fold I get it makes it smaller
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:29.520]   Right it's it's really hand sized but the but the but the horizontal I mean the vertical really confused. I'm not good at this
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:34.800]   Um the book landscape and portrait there you go versus tablet fold
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.280]   Stacy if leo offered you a
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.240]   Vertical fold would you have said?
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:43.040]   Yes, or would you have said?
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:49.760]   I mean I would have tried it. Yeah, but I wouldn't carry it around necessarily. I mean yeah, you
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.280]   I like the idea of the the
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:59.760]   Vertical fold if you will what is that what you call it? This photos. Yeah, I like I like the idea of one that
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.680]   Folds like a book that way. Um why but it
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:09.840]   I thought clamshells the clam shells the clam shells this way. It was like the flip, right
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:13.280]   Yeah, yeah, but okay. Well fold
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:16.320]   Book fold is the fold
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.720]   Clamshell is the flip
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:23.840]   That's what we're gonna call it. That makes the most sense. We're going to do the whole show just with
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.400]   um hand signals now
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.400]   Um, no, I like this way out for
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:37.600]   You like the most quiet reason because it's not like dual monitors here at my desk
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:43.440]   Um for multitasking. I I totally would be down for that. I just don't want to be down for that for
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:51.760]   Over a thousand dollars because the screen is only going to be this big, you know, 6.2 inches or something like that
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:55.360]   It's not worth it. So dr. And brought to tasking
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.240]   Yeah multitasking is is why i'm not dr. Androids. Sorry about that
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:04.400]   I mean it's the the fold
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.480]   um
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:11.680]   Is really just meant to be it's a phone most of the time, but it's a tablet when you want it
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:15.840]   And that's that's the the benefit. I suppose would you want it?
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:21.200]   Um, I you know, I'm kind of saying this Stacy. I really want to use it. I want to try it
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.600]   I've I used the z fold
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:27.040]   Um a few different iterations of the z fold because leo has
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:31.360]   You know bought bought them a couple of times and i've gotten them for review and everything
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:33.840]   And i've just find always found them
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:41.040]   Very bulky like yes, they fold down to a phone size sort of but definitely not thickness
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.880]   You know, it's it's probably like
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.680]   To you know twice as thick if not a little bit thicker
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.680]   And so it really ends up being you know because I carry my phone in my pocket
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:54.080]   It ends up feeling like a huge brick that i'm hauling around with me all the time
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:55.760]   and uh
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:59.920]   And then it's like do I actually unfold it and use it
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.320]   In that way
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:08.080]   Enough to justify the cost plus it's not a one foot. It's not a one hand or it's not an easy
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:12.080]   It's not a one hand device. No, I mean it is when it's folded, but
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:16.640]   Ooh, don't drop it if you got it open. It's really hard to hold on to with one hand, you know
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:25.440]   Can you do one app on one side and another app on the other side and yeah, you can with the zfold
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:31.840]   Um, okay, i'm pretty certain they're going to be that they're going to allow you to do that with a pixel fold
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:35.680]   You know androids been getting a lot of updates the last couple of
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.080]   versions
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.840]   uh in order to
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:43.440]   Really solidify compatibility for these larger
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:49.920]   Size foldable devices and that's kind of part of it is the multitasking aspect has been
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.880]   You know a part of that also having like a little launch bar
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.880]   Uh like a taskbar like you used to seeing on a laptop that sort of stuff
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.760]   It's a computer because we're doing more computer tasks
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:05.680]   I mean the only time I want multitasking on my phone is when i'm doing something like i'm trying to manage my email and i'm pulling in
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:11.520]   Need a from something else and trying to I mean and then i'm like why the heck am I trying to do this on my phone?
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:16.400]   And i'm like it's because my computer so bulky and I don't want to get it out or I don't want to go to my desk
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.720]   but
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:23.280]   You know my pick of the week would be ideal for a fold
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.960]   um
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.480]   Because of being able to look at different menus on one screen
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:32.160]   and having another viewer on the other screen where you can sort of
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:38.720]   See how this menu affects the image or the output or program output or what have you and
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:45.600]   Just like I would sit in at a desk with multiple monitors. So they just just makes sense to me creative watts
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:50.240]   For gaming when you turn out the really confused things when you turn it
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:56.160]   This way. Yeah. Yeah for sure. Yeah. Yeah, and and so
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:02.000]   The controls are on the bottom screen and the and the actions on the top screen, right? Right. Yeah, that would be cool too
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.680]   Yeah, you know and some like at least as
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:12.400]   with the samsung example, there are certain apps and games that make use of the fact that like
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:17.920]   On the inside, you know, you've got a a seamless display, but it has a little bit of a crease
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:21.840]   That allows you to delineate that this screen is dedicated to this
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:29.760]   You know, ui element or whatever and this this screen is dedicated to something else like the like the camera app the stock
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:34.720]   Samsung camera app if you got the fold and you unfold it halfway or whatever
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:39.520]   It's going to give you kind of like your preview of what the camera shows on one screen
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:45.680]   And on the other half of the screen is going to give you all of your controls and so certain things like that are definitely
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:48.080]   You hold up a thing this big to take a picture
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:55.520]   They do that now. Yeah, I was about to say that that is a thing people do now, but yeah, that's not unusual
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:01.280]   Hey, anyone remember i'm just going to take us like a little jaunt down maybe it's memory late day for you
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.520]   I know it's like the historian
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.280]   so
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:09.920]   Was it 2005 maybe 2004?
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:18.480]   The intel had campaigns about your unwired life and they were all about adding it was when they were adding wifi to their
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:21.840]   laptops and really just laptops in general
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:24.960]   and suddenly
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:28.320]   Yeah, it was something like that. It was like unwire your life or something like that
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:34.720]   And we were all like I mean the best they could do was show people with their laptop like outside
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.200]   Yeah, again working
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:41.920]   So I threw it we're in another one of those moments where we're just like we love we don't
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.720]   Don't realize it, but we look we want our computing to be as powerful as possible
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:50.640]   And as mobile as possible and that's kind of what this is encapsulating
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:53.360]   And we will make sacrifices to get there
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:57.600]   Um, I don't know if we're going to make all the sacrifices, but the other thing is
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:00.320]   we're not
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:07.200]   We're moving away from a content creation model where we're creating content with like lots of words like jeff
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:11.120]   Like all of us do really except for ant who does a lot of you calling me wordy
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.840]   Yes, but not
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.840]   Not what was it? What was it?
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:20.160]   You said something was wordy and wrong. You're not necessarily wordy and wrong
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:26.960]   Big is going to be wordy and wrong. I'm not yeah. Thank you very much. I am not big
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:31.360]   Don't be me. It's my compliment of the day for
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:34.000]   Nothing
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.840]   It's good
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:41.600]   But yeah, so I feel like this is just like this continuum and so you take it. Yeah, yeah
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:44.720]   I don't know where I was going with that, but that was
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:49.280]   Well, I think stacy goes to last week. You know, I was asking you about
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:53.360]   Chips and you told me I was asking you about a boring story, but the
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:59:01.040]   The the major drop in laptops and yes pandemic and yes this and yes that but I think you're pointing about ever more mobile
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:05.920]   Matters the mobile there's going to be middle ground like tablets
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:08.800]   you know
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:10.480]   Speaking of it each
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.240]   Yeah, oh, we're going to talk about your tablet
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:16.240]   No, I think you're probably
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:23.200]   Teasing ahead to the other IO things. I'm sure it's about your reactions to this will be the pixel tablets
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:27.440]   Which we already know about no about yeah, because I showed it last year
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:32.400]   They showed it last year that it would happen this year at some point. It looks like it's going to happen at this IO
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:36.880]   Um, I mean it really looks like IO is going to be a big hardware announcement
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.360]   Uh, it's not great books
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:41.600]   I know chrome books that I've heard of
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:46.560]   Tablet couldn't the pixel tablet work for you Jeff? That's what I was going to ask mr. Stacy
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:52.720]   How big is the tablet? Maybe you could use it. It's it's android not chrome, right? All right. You like chrome OS
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:59.280]   It is a soft matte look with textured feet. That's me. I have a soft matte looks and textured
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.000]   I walk around barefoot
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.760]   But sometimes in very expensive shoes
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.720]   Well, yeah, those those protect my textured feet
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.360]   And hide them
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:17.040]   You would find I imagine you would find this pretty interesting too stacy is that so this pixel tablet
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.960]   Is going to have a dock with it
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:25.840]   That turns it into basically like a nest a nest hub
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:30.400]   essential which we've talked about. Yeah, I'm sure you guys have talked about on twig
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.720]   Um, I know we've talked about it on all that android
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:39.040]   Over the course of the last years, you know as we're leading up to this final release of the pixel tablet is
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:44.640]   Oh, could that is that the ultimate? You know the the kind of ultimate play is that yes
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.440]   It's a tablet, but it's also your home control device
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:54.720]   And this dock that you take it around it's I I don't know if it's it ships with the dock or
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.720]   I think one story said it would ship with
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.560]   Okay
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.880]   It would or wouldn't because I heard that it might not
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:06.240]   Okay, oh really? Oh because I was like because it talked about a price for the dock being like 130 or
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.920]   $2,000
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:13.040]   I saw conflicting reports on this that but the the nine to five google stories said four colors
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.880]   And this included dock. Mm-hmm. That's right
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.320]   So that's interesting
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:24.880]   And do we know what are they charging for this tablet now? Did we do we get a
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:31.680]   Price on the on the tablet. That's a good question. I don't know. I just saw expensive tablets
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.120]   So I was like oh, that's it. Is it a seven inch or an eight inch?
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:40.800]   Do we know how big is it? Does that matter is greatly eight inch. I don't like seven. I want my nexus seven to back
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:49.440]   Yeah, um, let's see here. Sorry. I'm I'm trying to 11 inches long seven inches tall
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.840]   Oh, that's weird. So the nexus seven
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.880]   Well
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:03.120]   So it's a more of a landscape device 11. No, I don't I don't believe it is a thing that's larger than the nexus seven
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:11.360]   The nexus seven was um, oh, no. Yeah. No, there's a seven was 7.8 by 4.7. Yeah, this is a standard tablet size
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:15.280]   Yeah, this is yeah, like a larger. Yeah, a regular tablet size
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.960]   Like a seven was like a mini tablet. Yeah, right? Duh. Yeah, duh
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.840]   I just can't do vertical and horizontal without thinking
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:25.600]   I can't do dimensions very well without thinking, you know, I
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.320]   I'm a pretty I was a smart kid
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.360]   I think
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:34.640]   But I'd take those standardized tests where the pulley starts here then it goes around old I had no idea
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.960]   I just came up and said I don't use pulleys. I'm never going to I can't do this
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.520]   You have used pulleys. I guarantee it. It's
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:47.920]   I don't do spatial relations. I can't do it. You can't sing Stacy. I can't do spatial relations
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.880]   I I can't either they're harder for me. I got you. Yeah, it's a different part of the brain
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.280]   Wait, it's in the next day. See today
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:01.360]   It's the hat. It's not cold and bitter. I'm like warm and snugly
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.280]   Um
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:11.760]   Okay, so this tablet I'm really excited about it, but it kind of depends on how much it costs because like I could get
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.680]   like the charging dock if that's like 130 bucks
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:20.720]   If we're looking at it like a $500 tablet that is way too effing much to pay for
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:25.920]   A kind of smart home display interaction device. Yeah, I know it's also a tablet
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.760]   But I have an iPad for that and it works just great. Mm-hmm. Tell it
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.000]   So so I feel like I don't know what google's trying to do here
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.480]   But like my Lenovo display that they're now gonna stop supporting that was 250 bucks when I bought it
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.600]   And that felt like a decent price. I mean it was kind of expensive, but I was like, yeah, I'll do that
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.120]   but
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:54.160]   If you're like the comps for that sort of thing feel like an iPad what price do you think a reasonable price?
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:58.560]   Probably like I mean it depends on the size of the tablet, right?
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.240]   It's a big tablet. Yeah, I mean, that's pretty substantial. So I would say
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.880]   maybe 300
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.560]   but
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.280]   I I am a lisha works is four to five
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.520]   Three hundred hours for a full size tablet. That's what you're saying. It'd be low
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.240]   Well, see and the other thing is I don't
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:21.200]   I don't need a full size tablet. I need a good display for my smart home
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.480]   like I
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:27.040]   And if you combine the two then maybe in like four years after my iPad
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.360]   My my latest iPad dies
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.680]   Maybe but then my husband would kill me because all of his games are on the iOS ecosystem
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:39.760]   So I don't really need a google tablet. I guess right? I'm really ios. Could you imagine carrying that?
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:47.040]   That the tablet is portable or you already know your phone or is there a benefit to carrying the home control device around?
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.680]   Oh, well, I mean
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:54.480]   We have again y'all are gonna know I'm out in myself left and right here
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:59.200]   But we have a couple iPads floating around so we have a downstairs and upstairs one for
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:02.800]   Whoever wants to control things in the home already
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.840]   Okay, so but we don't actually use it
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:10.640]   We just control it via the apps like because we also have the google devices everywhere in the house too. So
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.120]   like
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.600]   I'd have to start from a blank slate. I guess
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.720]   And i'm so in like four years. I will
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.120]   And we'll see where we're at
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:27.120]   But what's the market and this I don't hear any thought of this coming with a keyboard and being now I had a laptop
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:32.480]   This is this is this is home oriented. What's the market opportunity? You think google sees here?
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.000]   Well, I think it's the people who have iPad sleep. Okay
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.640]   in my house
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:43.600]   I have displays for controlling things and if it's a photo frame when it's not used and that's really fun
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.120]   Right and we talk to it. We tell it to play Netflix if we're sitting at the breakfast bar
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.840]   You know duo calls whatever we actually use ours like that
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.400]   Not every day necessarily but enough and then if it's also a tablet
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:03.440]   We are on our i people on our house or on iPads probably like probably actually could tell you because I have the data from our
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.680]   private usage
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.720]   but like
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:10.400]   Four or five hours a day either watching videos like somebody's watching
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:16.720]   My husband might be on the couch watching a video or my kids downstairs watching or like playing a game on
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.360]   Just like to de-stress, you know, so
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:23.440]   Those are the two kind of display worlds that this could fill
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.200]   Uh-huh
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:29.360]   But we currently have separate devices for it and
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:37.360]   We have multiple of them and the value is in multiple of them because there's always one to hand when you want it
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.040]   Mm-hmm
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:44.880]   Right and it 800 dollars or sorry 500 for the tablet 130 for the doc
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.600]   I don't know if we would have as many as we currently have
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:53.120]   Yeah, I just wonder what can google do to
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:56.000]   get people to buy their tablet that
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:04.080]   They either have an iPad and look into replace their iPad or don't have one and it was probably going to get an iPad because
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:08.480]   iPads was just so good from a hardware and user experience
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:11.840]   What exactly can they do and if you're saying
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:18.160]   Make this thing a little less expensive. That's a good draw but will they compromise the hardware on that?
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:24.160]   The first thing came to mind mind when you said $300 for one and like that screen is going to look horrible at like HD
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.400]   When they should get
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.400]   14 out of 40 what what kind of yeah
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.520]   Sacrifices do they make in order to get it to $300?
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:36.880]   I mean, I'm on google right now searching for the second gen nest hub just to you know understand how much that is
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:40.080]   That's $100 hundred dollars for a screen
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.600]   With a stand that controls your stuff. It's not a tablet
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:50.080]   Yes, this is the nest hub. Oh, hold on. Oh, I guess it's smaller too. Isn't it? It's a smaller. Yeah, let me
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.640]   Let me give you
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.360]   Yeah, it's a smaller screen. That's right. I forgot about that
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.520]   So it's not the same size screen. So there's that benefit I suppose
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:04.560]   I mean if the tablets $500, let's say that's my guess I don't know
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.880]   You know that it's going to be $500
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.240]   But if I had to guess I'd say $4.99. Let's say
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:13.280]   If it was $4.99 and it came with a stand
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:17.440]   That would be one thing because then it's like, okay. Well, I'm in the market for a tablet
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:22.720]   I get this tablet and oh it can also be this thing that I don't have in my kitchen
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:27.360]   So that'll be where that lives I can control my smart home on it and it's a tablet
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.960]   Which was my original reason to buy it
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:34.320]   I don't know why anyone would buy that if their original goal is to get a smart home control thing
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:37.920]   Yeah, that seems like a really expensive smart home control device
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.440]   If you don't already need a tablet, you know what I mean?
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.680]   Yeah, if you're gonna spend that you're gonna have
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:51.200]   Like a savant or a control force some system that already comes with like a either a fancier version of an android tablet or
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:53.040]   an iOS tablet that's just
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.880]   Plopped under your wall. I just I don't
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.640]   Yeah, I have no I have no tablet lust
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:06.480]   Yeah, you know, I just I used to I love my Nexus 7. I've said that 10 times
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.040]   Though I was also early early on the show. I think you children were too young for this
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.040]   I
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.440]   Notoriously re-boxed the iPad
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:23.360]   Well, the iPad came out because I said it's not a creation device. It's just a watching device. That's boring
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:28.960]   Okay, I was obnoxious. Oh, yeah. Well tablets tablets are I mean, they're not word
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:33.600]   Like that's one of the things I was thinking about when we're talking about the future of smaller computers and whatever
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:39.120]   Yeah, right, right, but they they can be I mean my kid does like oh now they are yeah
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.600]   All kinds of crazy. Oh, yeah, absolutely
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.120]   Absolutely
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:49.280]   Yeah, they've definitely evolved over the years, but at the same time like I totally agree with you Jeff
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:53.040]   I don't really have a whole lot of need in my life right now for tablet
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.680]   Um, yeah, so I'm sorry. I'm gonna be really curious to see how
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:01.600]   Google kind of tells the story of the pixel tablet
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.920]   Um, just to how did they tell it when they when they introduced it last time
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.440]   It was just kind of a hardware story. It wasn't a used story
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.200]   Yeah, they certainly I mean they really didn't say a whole lot about it
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.680]   It was really added as like a and
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:21.840]   By the way sometime next year, you know, they kind of showed a little shot of it and that that was really about it
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.520]   They didn't do a whole lot of story. All right. So let's circle back to family Jason
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:30.720]   Not trying to get us off the IO, but just a little a little tiny peninsula here. Okay
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.640]   Um
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.760]   Is
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:37.600]   It's supposed to have the tensor chip. Yeah, the g the tensor g
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:43.920]   Yes, what is a I add to the tablet experience potentially that we don't remember from our old tablets
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:49.680]   Um anything good question. I I mean honestly, I'd say that same sort of stuff
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:54.400]   It's been adding forever. Exactly. I think it's the same stuff that you have on your pixel seven or whatever
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.760]   You know, I don't think that
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:03.040]   I don't I'm guessing that there is not much in the way of difference between the pixel tablet and the pixel seven
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:08.640]   Other than one is a larger screen and taps into the work that google's done for a tablet
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:14.720]   You know experience versus on the phone. I think I think technically they probably do very similar things
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:20.880]   You know, it the tablet has one camera. So your key or photo capabilities are less
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:26.320]   But I mean, I don't know that AI gives the tablet any more capabilities than what we've already seen
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:31.840]   Be my guess. Yeah, all right, you know, I want to be I want to be excited about something to buy
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:40.240]   Uh, what about the pixel seven a no, I realize I'm stretching here, but we know we're gonna see that at google. Io as well
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:45.440]   That's their next a series. You might get rain or I think i'm gonna bet you're gonna get one of those
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.960]   That's the one that usually does well. All right, they series
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.520]   Yeah, they've done pretty well with their a series
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:59.120]   They've brought a lot of value to the mid range with the a series and they take the design of the current flagship
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:02.400]   Kind of scale it down and make a really great kind of
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:09.360]   Facts, you know lower cost facsimile of it and uh, yeah, I think I think the a series has been pretty solid
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.920]   year after year, so
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.160]   um almost certainly gonna be
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.200]   You know hearing about well, I
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:22.480]   I'm pretty darn certain that you're gonna be hearing about the pixel seven a at google.io
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:28.640]   I think it releases same day. So that yeah, yeah, you're getting a thing you're getting they're gonna have a few
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:35.280]   Select journals they're offering them. I guess maybe yeah, I don't know maybe but look under your chair
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.280]   Yay
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.440]   Used to be that we gave out hardware google.io. Well, we're back
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.680]   You know
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.720]   Google if you need me to write your scripts for you. Just let me know
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:49.840]   uh
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.840]   Cardboard we're bringing it back
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.800]   Really, I got the first nexus device at a good. I was like
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.440]   So fancy. Yeah, fun
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:05.200]   Do wait a minute. So when you say the first nexus devices, did they give out the phone the nexus one
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:09.920]   Well, it was under your chair. That was an under your chair nexus too
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.640]   It wasn't really under your chair. I don't know what was under
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.280]   You had to go pick it up. I can't remember. I I never had the I think it was
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.320]   Of all the next is I never had the nexus one and I never had the nexus for
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:28.000]   Let me just make sure it was an excess one because I guess maybe it was the next but I think it was their first one
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.320]   Yeah, the next one I was so flummoxed. Yeah, it was a rolly ball
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:40.720]   Kevin was supposed to be there and he wasn't and so I had to go and I was like I didn't cover mobile devices
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.080]   I covered semiconductors and I was like give me a chip
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.960]   Yeah, I was like the heck if I do it here, but I I've managed
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:56.640]   Yeah, all the next is me. I remember that that was the the ball was how do you feel a neat funny feeling to it
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.600]   Definitely a different different phone. I like that
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:05.600]   I like that phone. That was my that was uh with that phone was my earliest experience in getting
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:06.800]   uh
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.560]   I was working at scene at at the time
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:13.040]   And I was behind the scenes. I don't even know if I was doing buzz out loud
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.960]   like
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.880]   You know in in front of a mic at that point and I was one weekend
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.680]   I was out to dinner with a group of people
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:25.360]   With my wife and some friends and then a bunch of people I didn't know
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:32.160]   And someone no, that's right. I was doing an android show it at a scene at and uh someone at the table pulls out a phone
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:34.560]   And I knew that google was working on a google phone
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.720]   And he pulled it out and it hadn't been announced publicly yet and I looked at it
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.520]   And I started talking to him and he said yeah, this is
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.080]   This is google's new phone. It's gonna be released soon
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.160]   And I tweeted out that I had seen it
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.880]   And then like he got picked up by the news
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:56.400]   And I felt like I felt so like yeah, I did that. I made that news happen. I leaked it. You're an leaker
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:04.720]   My only experience where that happened. I felt it was so early on in my before discord so leak powerful
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:09.760]   Yeah, exactly. That's my that's my nexus one story
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:15.840]   Um, okay. Well, that's google.io. We got that coming up in a couple of weeks
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:18.880]   I guess it's like three weeks away and uh, yeah, I
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:24.560]   Is anyone else here going? I mean, I'm I'm gonna be there. Oh, rub it in rub it in mr
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.960]   Haha, I just I just want to know who i'm gonna see there
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.520]   I am I am back up if I have to
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.320]   go back up
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:37.680]   We can before I'll be in a sonoma, which is right next door to petal. I know where that is
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:41.680]   Oh, but no, I'm not going to IO on fruits or one
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:44.000]   wine
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]   Okay
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:52.080]   I'm barbecued. I'll get you some barbecue too. Oh, sorry. Really? That's a rant uh not a rant. That's a uh
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:55.520]   Off the rails comment. Sorry carry on. That's okay
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:01.440]   Is that is that we're doing fun at at sonoma barbecue? It's just not no no no no
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:09.280]   There's legit barbecue in calistoga. Oh, you can send me send me links. I'll take it. I shall
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:15.040]   I had no idea. I'm not i'll trust you on barbecue aunt because I feel like you you're from the south
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:18.160]   You'll know good barbecue. Yes, exactly. I need to know where this place is
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:24.000]   Damn. So I thought kakalaki was something you made up and then I saw somebody refer to themselves on twitter as
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.720]   Oh
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.720]   I had no idea
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.880]   I thought it was a leo and an ant joke

[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:26.160]   To go against stacy and go for a story stacy would like just just for the
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.960]   Just gameify it more and would differ
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:36.080]   Unless it's a sports story. Yes, and there are some sports stories

[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:34.560]   Throwing the dice out and see where it lands. What do you all want to talk about is there a story in here that's that's really
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.280]   catching your imagination that you want to discuss
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:44.240]   Um, why not take a look at the sub stack story like to get that was a big one
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:51.600]   and miss higgin bottoms thoughts on the whole journalistic side of things with neeliah petel
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.120]   Yes, christmas. Yeah christmas
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:58.400]   CEO of
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:01.920]   Substack interviewed by neeliah petel on his podcast
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:07.680]   neeliah i felt framed a pretty fair question to christ
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:12.000]   As far as what kind of content is allowed?
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.760]   Can't remember if he was talking about sub stack in general or if it's uh isolated to sub stack he was notes
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:25.760]   I think was both I was just saying would you if allows direct racism would if somebody said that that a
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:29.920]   Person with brown skin shouldn't be here. Would you allow that right?
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:37.200]   And christ just would not answer the question. I mean he was given so many opportunities to do so
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:41.760]   I didn't feel like it was an unfair question to ask at all. No
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:48.880]   At all. I was it was just kind of confusing like I understand why you don't just say no like
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:52.800]   He was doubly fair by saying i'm giving you an easy question. Yes totally
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:57.040]   Give me the answer. You know you should give me and you wouldn't do it. Yeah. Yeah
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:03.600]   You know I I watched that well not watch it. I listened to it the full show and
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:10.160]   Yeah, it's definitely cringe worthy and I mentioned this on the sunday show. It it seemed like
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:13.040]   This was a ceo
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:18.160]   Trying to be safe and not say the wrong thing. Ah because he did not have that's ironic
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.680]   the
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:24.960]   In his in in his ear whispering what he can and can't say so he he literally just just
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:30.000]   Got quiet. At least that's what it sounded like. Where did the show did this occur at was it beginning or end?
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.480]   Uh, this was in the middle of it middle of the episode. How was it the rest of the show after that?
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:38.640]   Yeah, it was informative. He he just gave a lot of insight on the whole
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:45.680]   Beef that sub stack and twitter had going and there's a lot of insight there far as the whole api
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:51.600]   Um, there's just a lot of good information about the platform in general and then in the middle of it was this
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:58.240]   incident here about content moderation and again listening to that
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.160]   he
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:06.080]   He sounded like he wasn't sure how to answer that because what it would it ended up being this he didn't want to necessarily
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.800]   uh, muddy the line between
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:15.200]   content moderation and free speech and on sunday we discussed this and
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:21.680]   uh, Dan mentioned that a lot of tech companies are trying to wrap themselves around
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:28.240]   the the the blanket of uh, free speech to protect themselves and keep them out of trouble
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:33.680]   And not have to worry about content moderation and that's not necessarily fair
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:38.720]   But I get where they're coming from, um, because the example that I used again sunday
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.480]   and
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:47.680]   I want y'all to think about this as if you were me a black man here in the us. Okay, and here in my neighborhood
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.240]   I am this house is the only
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:53.520]   Family of black people in this whole neighborhood
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:25:00.080]   We stand out. I mean there's an even there was even an instance where a man at a game says
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.480]   Oh, you're the black family over there
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:08.800]   So and he didn't mean it maliciously. It's just it was a fact. Yeah, but
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:13.680]   let's say i'm walking the neighborhood mind of my own business and
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:17.360]   Someone across the street or what have you said something to me out of the way
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:21.760]   That person I could look at him and say you know what that person is racist
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:24.560]   Or I can look at him and say that person is a jackass
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.160]   and
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:28.160]   a lot of times it's
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.360]   They're just jackasses out there. They're not always racist
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:34.080]   and I think that's the line that
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:39.120]   the ceo was struggling with right there because I can't sit here and say he
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.520]   He's for um
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:45.680]   These racist comments being on their platform at the same time as a business
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:52.000]   He doesn't necessarily want to cut out free speech and and get it mixed up with moderation
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:57.120]   Some kind of way thought as a business. He doesn't have any obligations to free speech
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:02.640]   And I would also argue that it is better business to say yeah
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:09.280]   There are certain things we won't allow on the platform. Yeah, and I mean anybody who
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:14.000]   Yeah, anyway
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:17.680]   you can't have
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:23.760]   You can't be a platform and have free speech in a world of I can't I don't think we're supposed to say the jerk
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.760]   jerks
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.720]   Because they're jerks and jerks their mo is to
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:34.960]   Push into right right to try to inflam and so
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.680]   it's again. I will I will
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:41.840]   Didn't need I use the shopping ball someone used the shopping ball analogy, but
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:45.760]   I I think again the dinner party you're
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:49.120]   You're inviting people over
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:55.120]   And if someone doesn't behave in a way that's great. You don't let them stay right right right
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.480]   right
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:02.960]   And if you don't like my dinner party because you're like a big fan of nazi germany and love you know
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:08.800]   Hating on brown people then you know, that's okay by me. I'm okay with that. Yeah
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:13.120]   Yeah, you know, and I heard this whole free speech
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.880]   phrase been been thrown out
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:22.640]   You know a lot over the last couple of years be it because of the stuff that has happened on twitter be it
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:27.040]   uh, what's that? Oh my parlor parlor and in truth social and
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:34.320]   Everybody there fusses when not everybody but a lot of people always talk about this is where I can have free speech
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:39.120]   This is where I can have free speech, but then what's the where's the line you're drawing because
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000]   You just flat out races
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:48.080]   Um, or you just a jerk, you know, well, this is the whole cancel culture of taking two
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:52.000]   Right free speech is been weaponized. Exactly. Exactly
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.120]   Yes
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.120]   parlor or is a parlay
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:00.000]   I was
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.880]   It's e are I don't know if it's necessarily french like kind of bad those folks using
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:10.480]   pronunciation well, it's it's parlay is to speak so I just still I just
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:15.920]   Yeah, but that's in the front say right you're right. No, you're right
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:23.760]   I just my brain. I have a hunch that that crew to put that together and not necessarily leaning on the french terminology
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:28.800]   Yeah, these this is the crowd that accuses them being you know surrender cheese monkeys. Yeah, they're not there
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:33.280]   Cheese monkeys remember that. Yep
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:39.840]   I do not anyway, I think I think much credit to ny live. I think it was a good journalistic
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:44.400]   Effort he gave him he was he was blunt. He was direct. He had the right question
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:51.360]   Yeah, didn't let him off the hook. He gave him a chance and he and best showed himself and his company for what they are
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:54.000]   well before before this
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.080]   was
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.920]   was there um
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.040]   What's the word I'm looking for was sub-stack scene
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.440]   as a
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:07.840]   Not not quite so pure. I don't know how to phrase this. Well, yeah
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:10.800]   Was it was a first like tarnish tarnishing?
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:16.960]   Well, it has it has it gave a lot of money to and promoted the berry wices of the world of people who
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:22.560]   Send the letters and say I have my free speech to say anything. I want to say yeah and not quite Joe Rogan
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:30.400]   But it tickles the Joe Rogan toes there. Okay, and and so again, you just made a delineation right there
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:38.640]   Yes, I did and I think that's what he as the CEO was trying to battle with this is our there's that line
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:45.040]   Let me make sure I'm just just right there below fella. You can't as do I showed him you can't you can't yeah?
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.040]   I don't know because I think you end up
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:53.600]   I mean my view on that interview is he does more damage by not making the
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:30:00.560]   Making the stand on something like on an example that was so obviously easy to say heck
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:07.680]   No to like unless unless you are a platform that welcomes that sort of thing
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:12.880]   And there are platforms that exist that are open to that sort of thing and yes, right
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:14.240]   and so then
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:18.240]   If if you actually aren't then why don't you say that you aren't?
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:21.520]   It just it baffled my mind because I yeah
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.860]   I I guess I I guess I had a
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:27.620]   Yeah, thought of no worse than Elon Musk
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:30.180]   Elon Musk is just as bad if not worse
[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:34.020]   But it shows you where they are and it again tells us why we don't want to be
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:40.340]   In a position where that's controlled and what I love about the Fediverse is that yeah true socials over there
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:44.820]   And the swamp but it can be ignored we can choose to ignore it
[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:49.460]   There's a different way to go when you have one singular platform and you allow it there
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:54.260]   That's what you're saying your platform stands for and let me be clear. I
[01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:59.540]   Would have liked to to hear best say no, this is not allowed
[01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:02.980]   That's I that's that's where I stand
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:10.420]   But what I'm saying is I I think I can get where he was coming from in that particular interview being very generous and
[01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:15.700]   He was trying to I think I think it was it was a business decision. I think you're right there
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:17.780]   He was trying to pervericate
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:25.700]   Pervericate there's a 20. Oh there it is. We that's a good use of pervericate was it was he was trying to pervericate for the sake of
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:32.820]   the muskite rogan berry wise glen green walls of the world and
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:36.980]   He was oddly trying not to offend them
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:41.540]   And that's a really weird standard to have okay
[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:45.860]   It's it's it's it's a it's a battle with
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:49.220]   Moderation and censorship
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:54.980]   Um, so it is not censorship to you know to hear them tell it is that you're them tell it is right
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:32:00.500]   But it's not at all between choice properly moderating content versus censoring somebody
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:05.940]   Because none of them want to have a censorship label on any of these platforms
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:08.500]   But as stacey says I would be happy to have
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:13.540]   The garden party to the censor especially since I live yeah around people. I don't like very much
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:21.700]   Well, and there's there. I mean the other thing is the weaponization of the phrase free speech also comes at the expense of
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:25.540]   objective truth at times and that's a problem
[01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.860]   and so
[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:29.380]   look
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:34.580]   News organizations have a duty to the truth and yes, we can slant it and we can we can do
[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:37.060]   I mean there is no such thing as like
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:39.780]   There are facts that I could put in my story, but I can certainly
[01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:45.540]   Make the facts work in a way that has you read the story with a slightly different slant
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:51.780]   Right and if you're uncritically reading it, you're just going to walk away thinking like how dare they or whatever? Um, but
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:58.020]   I forgot where I was going with this again. I did I want to other I didn't interrupt you and
[01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:00.500]   No, I know see what that'd be clear here
[01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:01.860]   I didn't do
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:04.900]   My fear is super helpful for me because I I'm like, I'm so like
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:08.100]   Whoa, whoa, where's I going with this? So the point is sorry
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:13.540]   So the point is as a major media organization. I don't think it's that hard to say no
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:17.060]   I'm not going to create a platform for people whose
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:19.700]   opinions
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:27.220]   Not that I find objectionable. I mean I do find them objectionable, but I find them actively harmful yeah, right a subset of the population
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:31.940]   That's a problem for me. I can't I can't condone actual harm for people
[01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:34.740]   and I can report the truth
[01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:42.420]   in my you know, I can report facts. I can find objective truth, but these other companies these
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:46.580]   Other platforms the problem is when they
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:49.540]   promote harm and
[01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:51.060]   they
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:56.820]   Don't promote the truth. I mean they're there are too in when they promote harm and they promote the tooth but
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:00.740]   It's also the point you made earlier. So see yeah that um
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:09.220]   It's manipulation. It's it's an effort to manipulate a public to get people fired up and show yourself in our medium. No
[01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:15.540]   Never I mean we we've been it like I don't mean to manipulate people at all state my bias right up front
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:20.100]   I am pro-consumer in all of my dealings, right? So if I see a company that is like
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:26.900]   You know charging too much money for something or saying I can't deliver broadband at this rate because it would be
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:31.060]   Prohibitively expensive for my business. I'm gonna be like, uh, no
[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:35.540]   Here's here's how it could be done or I think this is dodgy and I will say my opinion
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:38.500]   But I'm also very upfront about what my opinion is
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:41.380]   I don't know
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:43.380]   Again, no point. I'm just stop talking
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:48.580]   Love it when you speak
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:54.980]   Yes, um has anyone here? Um used blue sky with any I can't get it yet
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:35:02.420]   No, because I know that they've opened up you'd been in by now if they've a lot of rights is all the amper or to some people I guess
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:08.900]   Yeah, I haven't I haven't used it either. Mike you're to try it. Micah actually did give me
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:12.260]   Um an invite into it. The problem is
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:17.060]   It's only iOS right there's no ad try version of it now
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:22.340]   It's like okay. That's awesome, but I can't do anything with it right now
[01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:25.620]   so
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:27.700]   Yeah, I'm dying to try it
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:29.620]   Um because I think I think um
[01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:33.380]   Jay graver who's the head of it, you know, makes some good points
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:38.340]   We're not trying to compete with activity pub but let more flowers bloom and um
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:44.340]   That they're gonna allow some things and I think that competition is gonna be good even if even if it if it
[01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:46.980]   You don't use it. Um
[01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:51.860]   If it'll make people jealous on activity pub and vice versa and both will rise. I think
[01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:54.660]   That was a very stacy comment away
[01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:56.980]   Sorry like an
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:36:00.900]   Completely not point. Oh god. What am I doing?
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:05.220]   Basie is that is that had a little tight?
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:11.460]   I've just apparently for a clock y'all that's what I
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:13.460]   Waffle clock
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:15.780]   Time for waffles
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:19.540]   Okay
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:23.060]   Um what about you you put in this story here, uh, jeff
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:30.340]   Well, actually you put in this story that also as I read through it realized you were interviewed for this story about
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:33.140]   I had been a
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:35.140]   No, but that mastodon
[01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:38.820]   Kind of checking in on mastodon at this point
[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:44.500]   All I can say is like i'm just not using any real social media with any
[01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:48.740]   Regularity right now, so i'm probably not the right person to ask but my mastodon
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:53.860]   Activity has gone way down, but so has my twitter activity like i'm just not doing a lot of any of it
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:56.100]   I'm curious to know
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:37:01.140]   Uh, where you all stand with with mastodon this is a great mastodon stacy after last week
[01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:09.620]   People were ready to yell at you and say just use twit.social don't use this excuse if I don't know what's here to be on
[01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:11.780]   you're right there
[01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:18.820]   Lao has provided it generously a free and easy good server with people who love you just do twit social
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:21.220]   Just do it stacy just do it
[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:24.180]   Do it please
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:28.740]   Do it do it stacy like i'm begging i'm begging. Yep, maybe
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:30.980]   Maybe
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:34.180]   You know what that's like when I asked my wife something she says, oh, it's fine
[01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:41.060]   Fine and maybe yeah, are just words. You know jeff. I got expensive shoes to shop for. I don't know
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:48.020]   I'm just i'm working on I got my own stuff going on man. Oh
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:51.140]   Yeah, I I still barely use it
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:55.700]   Now but like mr. Howl is it's it's a general
[01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:58.020]   Generality far as social
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:03.060]   That i'm not really using much of anything and it's just and if I am doing it or a lot of it's just automation
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:10.340]   I keep seeing i'll pop into our twit that social instance and i'll see stuff from miss adriana
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:16.580]   And I see it really really late because i don't i don't come in here, but I appreciate her
[01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:20.420]   Sharing these these interesting stories with us that we could potentially
[01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:26.260]   Um put on the show for twig. She listens to this one week this I think is the amiss stuff
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:28.900]   I mean, I'm on mast on every day. Absolutely
[01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:30.180]   um
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:35.380]   Every morning I read you know in papers and news sites and I post stuff on both twitter mast on
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:41.380]   Um, I like the discussion on mast on the one thing I said to to wilford who did the article
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:43.460]   um
[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:45.220]   is that
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:49.700]   The I miss and i miss a good algorithm to show me what I missed
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:52.340]   That's really what I want
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:57.540]   Uh that there was stuff overnight that I would didn't see and i'm not gonna see me and that's the one thing that I wish for
[01:38:57.540 --> 01:39:02.900]   Uh quote tweet would be convenient. Yeah better search. Yeah, okay. I agree with those two things. I think they'll come
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:05.380]   but um
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:12.180]   I want to choose the algorithms. What i'm hoping what i'm wishing for is for somebody to come along and offer a
[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:14.500]   um
[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:18.020]   You know, perfectly by choice algorithm is a guy who does a feed
[01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:21.860]   I'm seeing if I can find it off the map. I love that he does this he goes
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:26.100]   Just goes through his own feed and says here's stuff that he missed and then he shares that in turn
[01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:29.220]   And it's good stuff. Mm, and I like it a lot
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:33.620]   So so the thing what happens is the half life of a discussion. Oh, here it is
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:37.060]   David's ultra algo ego
[01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:40.580]   Um
[01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:45.700]   The uh, addresses cala ruso ca co l a r u double s o
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:51.380]   Underscore algo at law and up builders. He also does a bot that has top links
[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:55.620]   Uh, they didn't interest him, right? So that kind of little service is good. That's only his feed
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:58.980]   If I could use his for mine, I would love that
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:02.820]   But so what happens is the half life of a discussion is very very short
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:04.100]   Mm
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:05.220]   Um
[01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:07.620]   Because of the algorithm and because the way it works on twitter
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:12.100]   They just can last for a day or two, which is good. I think it's bad if you're getting smashed
[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:14.420]   Yeah, that's a good it goes both ways
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:15.860]   Look both ways absolutely
[01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:21.460]   But but more people from different time zones can enter in and can add to a conversation and I like that
[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:26.660]   And on on mastodon it either collects a lot or it disappears pretty quickly
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:27.940]   Um
[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:31.860]   And so that's why I miss things because I don't see people boosting stuff that they happen to see
[01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:36.740]   That to me is the main weakness in mastodon, but I love it. I love where it's going
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:42.660]   I had it when the whole sub stack thing came out. I went on and I speculated and I said what I don't think anyone has yet done
[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:46.180]   an activity verb pub version of sub stack
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:49.300]   You know, I would love to see that kind of thing
[01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:51.380]   um
[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:56.740]   What you're saying is it's totally different from what I am practicing if you will
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:59.620]   Um, when I go into twitter that social
[01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:03.460]   I immediately just go to notifications. I'm not even
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:07.860]   Scrolling through reading anything else anymore. Uh, because it just
[01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:12.500]   I'm not there. Um, and even with twitter I log on to twitter
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:18.580]   And I just go to notifications because I don't even want to see what's being posted out there anymore
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:20.260]   um
[01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:25.060]   Maybe in a in a in a couple weeks that'll change maybe in a month that it changed but right now
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:29.860]   I just because I know people are so pissed off and angry and and
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:33.540]   I just get tired of reading through all of the
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:38.340]   Uh, it brings me down basically and I don't want to do that
[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:42.100]   So I'll if anything when I pop in there, I just go to the notification column
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:48.020]   And if and if the first couple of things are actual messages to me, I'll try to acknowledge it
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:50.100]   But most of the time it's just someone
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:57.140]   Acknowledging that they saw one of my auto posts go out and then I'm out and I'm done with social media
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:59.780]   for the day
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:02.180]   Yeah, I miss talking to people on twitter
[01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:06.900]   Um and having like little conversations with my twitter friends
[01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:12.260]   Um, but I don't have them anymore. So I'm just on there. Yeah, I've got auto social things
[01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:14.900]   Which by the way
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:17.780]   Jason if you want to play around with it
[01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:22.660]   I have if auto generating from my stories tweets
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:25.940]   But they have a summarize function that ties into google docs
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:28.500]   So if you want to play
[01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:34.740]   Create a google sheets just tie in that trigger when you put an article into google sheets for the rundown
[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:38.580]   It will actually generate a summary for you. Oh wow
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:40.980]   little hacks
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:42.980]   That's that was gonna be my thing of the week
[01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:45.700]   And maybe it should have been but
[01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:49.940]   I just dropped it now. She's trying to jump into the show is what she's trying to do
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:51.300]   No, no, I was playing with it
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:57.620]   So so part of the reason I was having trouble forming coherent thoughts was because I was also trying to make it work with my google sheets
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:02.100]   Um, but I cannot do eight things at one time because I just can't
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:05.140]   Well, it is feasible and it would work chat gpt
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:07.220]   Might be able to help you do eight things at once
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:11.940]   You can have like four jobs at once. That's what we learned earlier. Yeah, not while i'm talking
[01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:13.620]   Same time
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:17.300]   Yeah, true true. I know that that makes me that's cool
[01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:24.660]   Your if tool makes me think about zap here because I use zap here and zap here used to be a sponsor here on the network i think
[01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:26.740]   um
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:30.900]   And they have a is of free service and I use it for part of my automation
[01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:36.740]   But I got an email earlier today to where now if you're using zap year for twitter
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:41.060]   You can not go to their paid plan of zap year because
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:43.860]   Changes to the twitter api
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:46.900]   Is making things a little bit more difficult if you will
[01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:54.740]   Oh, you know what in zap year has open ai chat gpt3 and dali integrations. Let's see if they have a good summary one
[01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:58.100]   I also have a zap year account
[01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:02.980]   Uh, exactly. Yeah a lot of my stuff is run through that and buffer and
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:07.700]   I literally just in the mornings. I'll set some some things up and
[01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:09.860]   forget it
[01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:14.020]   And so a lot of times the notifications that I do catch in the day
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:17.620]   It takes me a minute to figure out what are these people talking about?
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:22.020]   I don't know what's posted. Oh, yeah. Okay now I remember. Yeah
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:28.260]   Stacey you mentioned that you aren't having as many conversations on twitter as you used to
[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:32.100]   Is that a change that you have made or just a change?
[01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:37.380]   Like like and how you're approaching twitter or is that just you've noticed that since
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:40.340]   I don't know the the must people I used
[01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:46.340]   Yeah, the people I used to interact with are either not there or they're like me. They're just posting automated posts
[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:48.500]   so
[01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:53.780]   You know, I think it's a shift yesterday. Yeah, I posted something that I historically
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:59.700]   You know would have where I was talking about like my lights going on at six in the morning and blinking for no apparent reason
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:02.340]   Um, and to me it was just a funny story
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:07.300]   But I you I would like people used to share more of those that you could respond to and talk to them about
[01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:09.700]   People you know, talk to me. I used to also
[01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:12.580]   And now it just doesn't
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:17.780]   It feels dirty. I don't want to do it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's like I'm going to the wrong dinner parties
[01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:22.260]   And I don't want to be seen in the dinner parties. Yeah, yeah, but at the same time for my job
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:26.900]   I do have to like maintain some sort of presence. All right, it's like
[01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:29.860]   Well, let me ask you this
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:33.140]   Let me ask you this Stacey um and and and Jason all of you
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:37.540]   So NPR
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:42.660]   Went off twitter because must finally piss them off so much by calling them a government supported media
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:47.540]   Right, right and they left and people so applauded them and pbs went to and cbc is going off too
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:52.260]   And the one hand I certainly agree with that. Don't don't go to the bad dinner party on the other hand
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:56.660]   There's a lot of people still there and if all the news organizations left twitter
[01:45:56.660 --> 01:46:01.300]   Doesn't get a lot worse for public discourse. Is there a responsibility?
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:06.420]   For a news organization like npr to stay or a responsibility to go. What do you guys think?
[01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:09.540]   This is hard
[01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:12.580]   It was an individual but an organization like them. Yeah
[01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:15.940]   I think the the poking of the stick
[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:21.700]   I mean to the what they did to what twitter did to mpr in terms of literally it. I was like
[01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:24.980]   Yeah, you know what mpr should leave they should be like
[01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:29.780]   Yeah, I don't I don't have to put up with your crap twitter. You're nothing to me and you know what good for them
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:32.420]   so I I tend to think that
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:39.380]   I probably leave twitter if I didn't have a contractual obligation as part of my add things to tweet things for them
[01:46:39.380 --> 01:46:41.460]   Oh
[01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:43.460]   So I you know I do a
[01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:45.140]   tweet and
[01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:47.140]   We're writing it out of the contracts
[01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:52.420]   Moving forward, but for the next few months I have to be there and I have to do that so I I will
[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:54.740]   but
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:57.940]   And I clearly delineate the missponsored messages y'all don't worry. Yeah
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:03.860]   And I you know and I am truly grateful that these people are sponsoring the show whatever but um
[01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:08.340]   I don't blame npr and I think it was probably the right thing to do
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:13.860]   Yeah, I I would absolutely agree. I think I mean well
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:20.260]   Who who does mpr? Oh that that allegiance to?
[01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:25.460]   I don't know. I think I think as a company and as and as individuals
[01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:31.780]   We have to we have to make choices that line up with our values when I think of mpr
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:37.940]   I think I think of you know strong values and I'm not surprised that that uh, they would choose to
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:40.420]   To venture away and I support that
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:44.420]   I think that's a strong position to to decide around
[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:52.820]   You know again mr. Laport has said quite openly we need to stop using twitter we as in twit
[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:55.380]   but
[01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:59.620]   At this point we shouldn't because it it it works for us from a
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:08.020]   Corporate standpoint to to an extent anyway, so it it doesn't make sense for us to stop using twitter as twit tv
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:10.580]   And now granted five stop using twitter
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:13.780]   I don't think anybody would notice like that, but
[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:16.900]   Again, I'm not the same
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:19.140]   Entity as twitties, you know, of course
[01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:24.660]   It's kind of like if your ibm or volt swag it. How long do you sell stuff to the nazis? I don't know man
[01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:30.340]   Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, but how long do you keep these people are not actively?
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:32.420]   I mean they are some of them are actually are
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:34.580]   But they're not
[01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:40.500]   Totally putting 12 million people into camps which I mean is a really low bar
[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:42.660]   to but
[01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:47.380]   Yeah, I mean because this is kind of those are the things I think about them like oh, I just know I support this
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:53.940]   Well, I'm disgusted by what chris best and and some stack and so I'm likely to say I'm
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:49:00.260]   Never playing to use some stack unless that changes, but but i'm on twitter still and he'll have us because he's worse
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:04.740]   So I mean he's still doing what he wants to do on oh in his platform
[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:08.260]   You know he just he just probably suspended a wired
[01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:15.780]   Journalist for tweet his own story about about something involving twitter, you know, so free speech my iran
[01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:20.580]   Wow really oh, yeah, see that yeah, just have damn pith. I mean like
[01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:23.940]   I don't want to go to there anymore
[01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:28.260]   But it's but we stay see
[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:33.780]   With that socials a very nice place it is cozy, okay, but
[01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:38.980]   So home had to force me on to twitter like yeah
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:41.060]   I joined forever ago
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:46.660]   But I joined because almost like every single one of you needs to make twitter accounts and get on it and start tweeting once a day
[01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:52.340]   Like it was part of my literal job. So I was like you did you wine before doing it and tweeted once a day she did
[01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:59.700]   I've won but I got into it and enough people were there that it became fun. Mm-hmm. I'm just not social
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:02.820]   Yeah, I mean you don't see me on anything social
[01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:04.580]   All right
[01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:06.980]   anti social stacy. I mean yeah
[01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:11.540]   I'm fun to talk to at a party if you like to talk about nerdy stuff
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:16.580]   The right party
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:19.860]   Let's uh, let's let's change the mood of this party a little bit. Let's
[01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:27.300]   Crank it up a notch. How about this story about uh, AI making a duet with Drake and the weekend
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:30.100]   Did you did you all?
[01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:32.100]   I was here here. It's still
[01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:39.220]   So you think you can play it anymore. I yeah, so the examples are down. I should have found you know, of course they're
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:44.500]   Um, it's on youtube. You want me to sing? We can't play it though. I mean if we we played it
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:48.820]   It would probably be taken down. It's it's so so current. So what is the story here?
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:53.860]   Someone went on on tiktok and actually used AI to create
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:51:02.500]   a duo of uh or duet, sorry of drake and the weekend to artists who did not actually record this song together
[01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:05.380]   Um, that we're not gonna play because we'll probably get taken down if we do
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:12.420]   But um, I don't know what but there's a question here. There's it so i'm a lawyer on on mastodon said whoa
[01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:15.300]   If they took it down because I don't want to peeve
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:17.700]   universal music group
[01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:22.020]   Okay, I understand if they took it down because they thought it was a copyright issue. It ain't
[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:26.580]   It isn't a copyright issue. It's it's it's a considerable change
[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:29.380]   Um, it's you know, it's it's
[01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:35.140]   Well, wait a minute. Well, okay, so but but that's I think the question because in order to
[01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:42.900]   In order to represent the weekend and drake's likeness you have to train a system on their voice
[01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:47.700]   Well, that's the whole other question right that that's sampling right? I don't know what that is
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:51.060]   But that's something I mean no to train them. I mean you could just let them
[01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:56.740]   Listen, you could let them listen to the radio radio stand and they would get drake all day long. Yeah, they would
[01:51:56.740 --> 01:51:59.140]   Yeah
[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:03.220]   But but are we allowed as she knows that well you're well what you're we're seeing now
[01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:08.020]   Is beer? I was at an event some of four event last week and berry dealer is trying to say we have to stop this
[01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:13.140]   We have to stop them from you know training on our stuff and newspapers are saying this and entertainment companies
[01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:17.220]   Are saying this well, but Stacy's exactly right. You're in public. You're out there
[01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:24.340]   It's a really dangerous thing for light societies say you're not allowed to know that you can't remember that you can't be inspired by that
[01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:26.260]   um
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:28.580]   And so I I think
[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:30.660]   um and we already have
[01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:35.140]   No, there's a different way to do that we read it just announced that they're going to charge their api
[01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:39.380]   I mean they because they know that these places are scraping them like crazy. They want to make something on it right
[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:42.980]   I think that's too bad for society and for researchers
[01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:48.260]   That they're not going to get access to this api because it's really valuable, but okay. It's their company
[01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:51.060]   They can do what they want but courts so far
[01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:57.540]   And and the federal government so far has said that the product of ai is not copyrightable
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:53:02.420]   So if it's not copyrightable, how is it a copyright?
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:07.300]   Violation in a sense too. It's really interesting. The copyright is just outmoded as hell
[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:12.660]   And this is poking holes in it in ways that's going to take years to go through the courts on
[01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:18.020]   So let me ask because there you have a right
[01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:23.460]   You have a right to your likeness, right? And i'm trying to think of what that's called
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:27.140]   Um, it might be called a right to your likeness. I think it's called that yes
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:32.020]   Rights to your own if for your name and likeness, right? Yes. Yep, right? So personality rights
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:39.140]   By impersonate so instead of copyright drake could say this clearly sounds like me and is an impersonation
[01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:44.740]   That's a better case. You're right. Yep. And that that's a that's a legal argument that's been bought
[01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:49.700]   What about cover bands? Yeah, yeah, that's that was my gonna be my question too
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:56.180]   Uh drake is not the only person that's wrong. It sounds like drake. You should hear my springsteen imitation, you know
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:54:00.020]   If you play in a cover band publicly
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:05.860]   Do you license there is a performance license for the for the song?
[01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:08.900]   For the song your the
[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:15.460]   Who owns the the the lyrics or the music but not for sounding like springsteen
[01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:20.660]   And if you have cover bands if you completely made up a song
[01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:25.140]   That would be in the style of springsteen along before ai you could do that
[01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:30.820]   Yeah, there could be a fraudulent thing here where you're but it wasn't a fraudulent. It said this is ai
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:32.420]   This made it ai
[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:34.420]   So here's a lawyer
[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:38.100]   You're talking about tribute acts versus covers
[01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:43.140]   Um, they are trading off the name brand and images. So let's look at the case law
[01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:51.780]   Oh, as an example. So case law there is case law in this 2010 universal lawyers for universal music and sweden's now legal notices to more than 15
[01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:55.620]   Abba tribute acts and then stop trading off the name Abba
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:55:01.140]   many of them were forced to change their names or risk being sued sued. So
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:04.100]   there is
[01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:05.300]   precedent
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:11.140]   To go against tribute bands if someone really wants to and it seems to be based off of
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:15.620]   Like this a likelihood of confusion between the acts
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:24.500]   So so they're the likelihood of so the legal test does the original act possess a commercial interest in their identity
[01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:30.020]   If you're Drake. Yes, has a tribute act used some of the original acts identity without permission?
[01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:34.580]   Yes, has a tribute act created some sort of damage
[01:55:34.580 --> 01:55:37.220]   I mean, I don't know
[01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:45.300]   And there's also the fair use there's fair use which has laura slusick says is nothing but the right to hire a lawyer
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:51.460]   Um, but if things are changed enough and the thing about this case was it's not a song they ever sang right?
[01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:54.740]   Yeah, it's not a song that they're made up song. It's yes
[01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:59.380]   That's so interesting. Yeah, you're not stealing the music. You're not stealing the lyrics
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:03.620]   You're being open about saying this is a I made this up. These guys haven't sung together
[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:08.580]   Uh in this format. Um now I could get it could get copying. No, I
[01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:15.060]   Oh, yeah, he said it was a I he said, oh, he did he disclosed that it was a I he posted
[01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:21.860]   This is a I of Drake and the weekend if he had posted this and not
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:24.580]   mentioned their names would that
[01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:32.100]   absolve in any way, you know what I mean like labeling it as and and like I think it was even I think it was even on spotify
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:35.860]   Um and they ended up removing it from spotify, but
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:42.580]   There I could see some real, you know kind of lines being crossed where you know, this is a song
[01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:48.980]   Drake the weekend meanwhile neither of them actually had anything to do with it if there's money being generated off of this
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:52.340]   It's certainly not going to them. Maybe in the future it will
[01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:57.140]   Because these are things that are getting figured out right now or this is fascinating. That's where this is headed
[01:56:57.140 --> 01:57:02.100]   I mean how many people have been inspired by shakespeare and shakespeare doesn't get a dive anymore
[01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:07.860]   Right, you know, and uh, it's okay. Obviously that's copyright time. I know I know
[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:12.260]   It's been dead for or bill
[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:17.300]   All the money she makes yeah, I feel so bad. Um shakespeare. Yeah
[01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:19.220]   um
[01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:22.820]   Well, it will actually actually oh get me go on. I just got a book here
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:28.900]   The vaudley and library about the money owed to shakespeare by first folio
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:34.580]   And the reason this is interesting is because there were so many pirated bad versions of shakespeare out there
[01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:42.020]   That when he died two of his friends from stage said we've got to put together the authoritative shakespeare because it sucks
[01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:43.380]   What's out there?
[01:57:43.380 --> 01:57:47.460]   And in my book and the good mr. Pretthesis out in june available for pre-order now
[01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:51.140]   um, I bought the bad. I think it's the bad
[01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:54.580]   Um, uh, bad hamlet. I think it is
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:56.340]   uh hilarious
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:58:00.900]   Uh that got out there so they came and they said we're gonna we're gonna create the definitive shakespeare because it matters
[01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:07.060]   Shakespeare's name was being used on on collections of poems he had nothing to do with and he said don't don't do that
[01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:13.220]   Um, and this is all before there were laws around this. So yeah, it stays here. You're right likeness
[01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:17.780]   It's real it matters, but this pushes it in fascinating ways
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:22.900]   Oh, yeah, and I think I mean you can find the the version on youtube
[01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:28.260]   I think it's really compelling until they hit the falsetto for drake. Yeah, and the weekend is fine
[01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:32.500]   Yeah, I mean it doesn't it's by no means a perfect
[01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:38.900]   You know sounding song it totally has that kind of that kind of uh dusty
[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:46.500]   AI quality to it but but but what it reminds me of is I think it was on this show last week when I mentioned
[01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:50.020]   It was a way on vacation and I thought about like in the future
[01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:53.540]   Are we gonna ask you know an AI to create the movie we watched tonight?
[01:58:53.540 --> 01:58:55.860]   And it's kind of the same with music right like
[01:58:55.860 --> 01:59:03.300]   Which has been another thing that I've thought about if I if I want to you know at a certain point with AI create a new
[01:59:03.300 --> 01:59:04.980]   underworld album
[01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:10.340]   There's you know x number of underworld albums that exist to to learn from
[01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:15.300]   Like I imagine it might be possible to hear and well, that's interesting Jason
[01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:17.860]   Even if you look at a spotify and it creates a
[01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:19.780]   Madonna
[01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:23.460]   Radio it's using Madonna's name with music that isn't madonna's
[01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:26.420]   That's like madonna and if you like madonna you'll like this
[01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:29.460]   It's kind of the same
[01:59:29.460 --> 01:59:33.940]   No, it is not because all the madonna songs that are on there clearly label and madonna
[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:36.340]   She gets money and so does everybody else who's part of that playlist
[01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:40.980]   They could do the whole playlist without Madonna, but still use her name to say this is cheap
[01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:43.700]   Let's say let's say Madonna refused to be on spotify
[01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:47.700]   But they played no they've done that in the past. Yeah, they have
[01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:50.740]   Who was Taylor Taylor Swift?
[01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:53.700]   Taylor didn't want to be on spotify, right? Right. She didn't want to be on
[01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:56.260]   No, it's Beyonce
[01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:59.780]   Both. Oh, yeah Beyonce wanted title. That's right exclusive
[01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:02.260]   of course with
[02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:04.260]   Jay Z running for that man
[02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:06.340]   All right
[02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:10.740]   I find this stuff. Oh, that's gonna be it's gonna be fascinating to watch absolutely fascinating to watch
[02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:13.140]   Absolutely. You know what I found fascinating to watch what?
[02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:19.220]   What the video of a robot sorting trash was how you like that one wasn't that cool
[02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:20.580]   There is line 38
[02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:25.220]   I just I mean there's nothing much really to say here except for I could have watched this all day long
[02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:28.740]   Google released a couple things like this. This is one of them
[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:36.580]   Where there it's not just AI with text and images and music. It's obviously also robotics and
[02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:40.420]   Yeah, okay, this goes over here
[02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:45.380]   Scroll and look at the look at this classroom where they have a bunch of them doing it once
[02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:49.220]   Uh keep going I think oh I see it
[02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:52.100]   A little lower
[02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:55.300]   No, no, no, no, there you go
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:58.500]   So there's the laboratory
[02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:00.660]   All of the
[02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:06.580]   Robots are sorting all the trash what would be cool is if they showed like a new piece of trash coming in
[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:08.980]   One robot figuring out where it was going get
[02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:11.380]   Scratches
[02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:16.580]   No, and then immediately all the other robots know what to do with it
[02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:19.620]   Oh
[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:23.060]   Yeah, no network
[02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:28.340]   I mean, I don't know if it's a I mean, it's a network. I don't know. It's a pretty
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:31.380]   Adorable I thought it was really cool. That's why there are human beings
[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:37.780]   We're now employed to do this work. It is not pleasant work. It smells. Yeah, it's important for the environment to get it done
[02:01:37.780 --> 02:01:43.940]   Um to your point earlier and about the scutt work. This is the scutt work. You want machines to do?
[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:51.060]   Yeah, I want to hand my trash like sometimes when you get to a place and you see all that like I remember going to the offices at
[02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:54.100]   Giga way back in the day because it was in california
[02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:58.500]   And I would just stand there at the kitchen and I'll just
[02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:05.860]   Which what do I do which pin does this go in? Yeah, is this blue or green? Oh, no. Yeah, it's a bit
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:12.980]   She's yeah, I still know you got a compost and all that. Oh my lord. I still struggle with it. Yeah
[02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:16.100]   It gets easier, but
[02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:17.780]   One day
[02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:22.740]   All right, that's a pretty cute robot. I have to say it looks like it's like a robot
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:30.660]   Okay, I'll put that over there. Yes, dainty right? It's kind of dainty. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, which I really don't
[02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:35.460]   Which is very endearing about it. I when I was I watched those videos like I like that robot
[02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:41.060]   It really wants to get its job right. It really wants to do the right thing. I have robot empathy Jason
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:43.540]   Yes, apparently I do
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:49.620]   Should we do a change log a minimal change log is really not much in here. Can I suggest can I suggest first
[02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:53.460]   One little tick tock corner. Oh, yeah, he sees honor. I want to hear about this whether this
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:56.260]   Was supposed to be huge news huge news
[02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:58.980]   It was huge news on reddit. Okay y'all
[02:02:58.980 --> 02:03:01.540]   go on
[02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:07.940]   Yes, go for it. So I'm going through tick tock and here's a video of a fairy
[02:03:07.940 --> 02:03:14.660]   uh run a ground off range of maverick island and the audio really is the announcer on the
[02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:16.420]   ship saying
[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:18.420]   abandoned ship
[02:03:19.380 --> 02:03:23.380]   Yeah, a friend of mine lives down there. They're like it was loud. It was annoying. It was also hilarious
[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:28.100]   Um, yes the walla walla
[02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:30.980]   Which is one of our fairies ran aground
[02:03:30.980 --> 02:03:43.700]   Where I expected to see people doing dives
[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:53.540]   No, they they got so they the passengers were taken off via the fast fairy system. So they they
[02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:56.020]   Yeah
[02:03:56.020 --> 02:04:00.180]   They're all safe. Okay, spent. I mean some of them spent like nine hours on the boat and
[02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:06.100]   They stay wow to get their cars. Yeah, because it was low tide and they
[02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:10.500]   They couldn't get the boat out and then they had to get other boats in
[02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:14.980]   But those boats had to wait for there to be enough tide and also they had to like
[02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:21.780]   There's a shortage. This is a lack of infrastructure funding. There's a shortage of available boats in the washington state
[02:04:21.780 --> 02:04:25.540]   It's all better than bridges. I would say all worth the price
[02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:33.860]   The bridge. I mean the Bremerton routes long. It's an hour long boat ride. So that's not a bridge. That's not a bridge worthy span
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:36.660]   Yeah, all right. Thank you for that. Now you can go to the
[02:04:36.660 --> 02:04:40.980]   Excellent. Thank you for the tick tock corner and now it's time for the changelog
[02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:44.180]   the kugo changelog
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:46.740]   Not
[02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:50.260]   Much of a changelog this week
[02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:56.740]   Starting but we got four things in here. So it you know it qualifies at least
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:04:58.340]   um
[02:04:58.340 --> 02:04:59.620]   Google phy
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:02.180]   Now known as google phy wireless apparently
[02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:04.900]   Getting a redesign of the app
[02:05:04.900 --> 02:05:08.500]   Renaming everything
[02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:10.500]   Google cannot help itself
[02:05:10.660 --> 02:05:16.500]   Google gets bored of its names. It has to rename them and then when it gets bored even further it has to kill them
[02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:18.500]   I mean, it's just it's weird
[02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:23.460]   But you're right the chai needs to fix that he could easily fix that he's the ceo
[02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:30.420]   Hey, stop this with this renaming crap people dad gummit. So what was you said before you're the best dad gum? No, what was it?
[02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:35.620]   The best dad gum search engine out here best dad gummit
[02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:38.260]   stop with these names
[02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:42.420]   So refer to it no longer as google phy
[02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:45.860]   No longer as project phy that that was a while ago
[02:05:45.860 --> 02:05:51.940]   It is now google phy wireless the whole thing if you don't say the whole thing. I don't know what you're talking about. So
[02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:59.940]   Keep that at least project phy was the early days and it sounded like hey, this is new. We're working on this. I I get that
[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:01.860]   um, but
[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:04.580]   Going from google phy to google phy wireless. I
[02:06:05.540 --> 02:06:10.820]   I don't know. I guess they're they don't want to confuse it with right other infrastructure
[02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:14.020]   What is it google google phybers stuff?
[02:06:14.020 --> 02:06:16.740]   Potentially I guess
[02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:20.180]   Who the heck knows google just likes to change things
[02:06:20.180 --> 02:06:23.060]   It's the google way. What can we say?
[02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:28.820]   Um, if you've racked up any play store points the play points that I think
[02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:32.980]   Up until now you could just use for like digital goods
[02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:42.100]   And stuff now google is making it so that you can redeem your play points for actual physical goods things like shirts socks water bottles
[02:06:42.100 --> 02:06:48.180]   Uh insta cart orders door dash. So if you've been racking up those play points
[02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:55.380]   Um, I think I have a decent amount racked up because I never I never really spend them on on apps or anything like that
[02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:59.060]   So I think it's the same collect them. I don't know. Where do I find play points? I don't know
[02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:01.700]   In the upper right on your phone
[02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:09.300]   Is your underplay yeah in in the play store if you if you spend any money in the play store if you're renting video
[02:07:09.300 --> 02:07:14.020]   You know renting movies or how many points do you use f oh boy?
[02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:18.260]   Probably not many but I have 1600 whoa
[02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:21.140]   So you can get 97

[02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:13.780]   Just just in case people

[02:09:17.380 --> 02:09:20.260]   blurry

[02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:25.540]   Some

[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:35.140]   If if you go under your name, there is a play points icon in the menu that you can look and see if you have play points too
[02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:40.020]   Okay. Yeah, I want to look at like a transaction register to see what
[02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:42.740]   What do you accumulate that meaning?
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:47.540]   Export a csv buy you watch a lot. Maybe it's your youtube subscription
[02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:52.740]   Uh, maybe maybe yeah because I pay for premium every month
[02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:55.780]   as well as youtube tv
[02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:59.780]   I'm earning that 1.2 points per dollar
[02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:02.260]   uh according to this screen
[02:10:02.260 --> 02:10:10.580]   1.2 points is that what you said 1.2. Yeah, okay, so according to this screen here and it says i'm a gold member
[02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:13.140]   Okay
[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:16.820]   Oh, yeah, they have a bronze something something in gold. I saw that as options
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:22.660]   And the more the higher you are the more points you earn on every purchase. It's like being an airline member
[02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:26.100]   weekly prize I get a gold
[02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:35.140]   A gold prize weekly prize apparently then it expires in one day when something every week. Let me hit this claim button. Oh, yeah
[02:10:35.140 --> 02:10:38.260]   Let's see there it is
[02:10:38.260 --> 02:10:39.700]   and
[02:10:39.700 --> 02:10:44.820]   Tap to see what's inside went up to 200 play points. I'm going to tap it to see what's inside
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:47.300]   it's thinking
[02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:52.260]   What you just gave me seven play points to add to my 1600
[02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:58.580]   Oh see i'm going to get for the dino socks. I got it as well. I'm going to tap to see what's inside for me too
[02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:00.580]   What did I get what did I get?
[02:11:00.580 --> 02:11:03.140]   Six you beat me by one and
[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:07.060]   Okay, that's that gold status. He's earning more points
[02:11:07.060 --> 02:11:14.260]   So I have 1600 16 points man. I'm only silver
[02:11:16.660 --> 02:11:19.780]   And his gold I feel this is the first time I feel privileged
[02:11:19.780 --> 02:11:24.740]   I spent too much on shoes. You spent too much on the play store. Yep
[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:29.620]   Soon you could buy shoes on the play store. You never know with your life. That's crazy
[02:11:29.620 --> 02:11:31.140]   uh
[02:11:31.140 --> 02:11:33.700]   Nest thermostat gets matter support
[02:11:33.700 --> 02:11:36.900]   That that a big deal
[02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:37.940]   I guess
[02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:42.660]   People were upset because all of it's only the most recent one the cheapest nest
[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:45.060]   Remember what version yeah
[02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:46.660]   So
[02:11:46.660 --> 02:11:50.740]   If you have an older nest you're not getting matter. We knew that was coming but this is the first time
[02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:56.420]   It's official when people are sad. Oh, they do ironically have thread on many of those thermostats because
[02:11:56.420 --> 02:12:02.180]   Nest Tony Fadel and the nest team were the ones who pushed the concept of the threat network, but
[02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:07.060]   Such is like such is life new nest thermostat
[02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:14.900]   At least in 2020 gets that matter support starting well starting yesterday. So there you go. Yeah starting history
[02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:17.860]   It's rolling out over the next few weeks. So it may take a second right right
[02:12:17.860 --> 02:12:20.180]   and
[02:12:20.180 --> 02:12:25.780]   Um, I told you it was a short change log. Uh, google chat if you're using the web interface
[02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:30.500]   You get a full redesign web interface updated with material you
[02:12:30.500 --> 02:12:36.340]   Uh, I feel like when i'm doing material you update some really scraped the barrel
[02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:40.980]   Time for the
[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:45.540]   There you go
[02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:52.500]   Good enough. All right, uh any last things before we get into pics and stuff
[02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:56.580]   We can't jump in the pics too doesn't matter
[02:12:56.580 --> 02:12:59.220]   Sure call it's a lot. I mean
[02:12:59.220 --> 02:13:04.340]   I thought that this the sports story was interesting. All right. Tells tell us why the sports story
[02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:12.420]   Which one is the i64? Okay, you know, we we talk about privacy and in data harvesting and all of that
[02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:13.860]   Um
[02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:18.420]   But the school that I love to hate university of south carolina football team
[02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:23.860]   They were able to get a million dollar boost in ticket sales recently
[02:13:23.860 --> 02:13:28.900]   Why because of the shopping site fanatics.com
[02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:31.060]   Um
[02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:35.300]   USC was able to tap into the api and figure out okay
[02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:39.940]   What customers were buying when they were buying it and get the other information
[02:13:40.420 --> 02:13:42.340]   That says you know what let's reach out to them
[02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:47.540]   And see we can get them to buy some more tickets for our games and
[02:13:47.540 --> 02:13:52.580]   That's freaking brilliant. It's out there, but then you look at it from the consumer standpoint
[02:13:52.580 --> 02:13:55.700]   Uh, I'm sure a lot of people don't know
[02:13:55.700 --> 02:13:58.340]   That their data is being scraped like that
[02:13:58.340 --> 02:14:05.220]   And so I dug into it a little bit more and it's clearly in the terms of services. It's also in the privacy statement
[02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:08.820]   Um, but you can opt out of this stuff
[02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:11.700]   They do allow you to opt out, but if you don't know about it
[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:15.460]   You're not going to opt out so they don't risk necessarily
[02:14:15.460 --> 02:14:21.700]   Advertise this unless it's in an email after you place your order you get your little confirmation email
[02:14:21.700 --> 02:14:28.180]   The most you'll see is at the bottom of it. Hey, if you don't want to see any more messages about this order just click here to
[02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:33.860]   manage your subscriptions or stuff like that, but I thought it was fascinating that um
[02:14:34.580 --> 02:14:35.780]   Somebody's
[02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:41.460]   Besides a hemazon is using all of this data to make money and that's a lot of money million dollars
[02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:44.420]   Spotify does it to promote
[02:14:44.420 --> 02:14:45.780]   uh
[02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:52.020]   Artists that you listen to if they're coming in concert near you because they have that data. Yes. They got it too. Yeah, I mean
[02:14:52.020 --> 02:14:55.700]   I mind stuff like that less
[02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:59.220]   I don't know how was you I mean because like if you're buying
[02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:06.340]   Merchandise for a sports team and then you're told that they have tickets available. They're playing here
[02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:11.540]   Is that is that a okay use of your data or do you rather you would just rather not?
[02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:18.820]   I rather that be something I find out on my own by searching the schedule and stuff like that
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:20.820]   But again, we're in the bubble
[02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:24.500]   You know, they were we're not quote normal people
[02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:26.260]   Um
[02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:30.820]   I don't I don't want them. Excuse me. Heck a lot of times. I don't even have stuff shipped to my house
[02:15:30.820 --> 02:15:36.420]   You know depends on what it is because I don't I don't want that data out there. So
[02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:44.500]   Yeah, I'd rather just go to the website and look at my favorite team schedule and see where they're going to be on which day and look at my
[02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:48.740]   Calendar and go from there. I don't I don't need them reaching out to me
[02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:51.860]   Because they connected to an API
[02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:54.020]   Okay
[02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:56.020]   I kind of I mean I kind of like this
[02:15:56.020 --> 02:15:59.060]   It's totally fair. I kind of appreciate the
[02:15:59.060 --> 02:16:06.660]   Uh spotify integration because for some of the less popular artists like I know when it's swift is coming into sound but I may not
[02:16:06.660 --> 02:16:08.740]   When like slave cleaves is coming to town
[02:16:08.740 --> 02:16:10.580]   um
[02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:14.260]   So some I kind of think it's a nice thing but I can see you know
[02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:18.260]   Yeah, I can see your point too
[02:16:19.940 --> 02:16:23.060]   To me, that's like the least offensive use of my data
[02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:26.500]   Out there. Yeah, yeah, and that is fairly
[02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:29.460]   Not as offensive. Uh gary z
[02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:37.620]   Gary's here in the discourse says I think aunt is saying that people don't read in terms of service docs. No, we don't that's true
[02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:41.940]   We don't I just have no life. So every now and then I do read them
[02:16:41.940 --> 02:16:46.900]   Ah, nothing like kicking back with some terms of service docs
[02:16:49.140 --> 02:16:51.540]   Should do when you need to go to bed at night. Yeah, it's
[02:16:51.540 --> 02:16:55.380]   Some of the stuff is so curious though because they'll they'll have
[02:16:55.380 --> 02:16:59.380]   Okay, we will
[02:16:59.380 --> 02:17:03.860]   We will collect your data, but we'll only collect this much and we won't share
[02:17:03.860 --> 02:17:07.620]   This pile of the data, but we will share this pile of the data
[02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:10.420]   But only if you tell us not to but then
[02:17:10.420 --> 02:17:14.500]   If you want us not to share you need to go and click over here
[02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:18.500]   To open up this page and then you scroll through that page and it's like
[02:17:18.900 --> 02:17:22.820]   Uh another mismatch of all right. Make sure you click here and then it says oh wait, man
[02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:24.820]   Just shoot us an email
[02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:31.300]   That's the opt out and you never know if that email gets now, you know, you know, this is so it's a lot of stuff like that
[02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:32.820]   And these
[02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:34.820]   But again, I have no life. I'm sorry
[02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:38.100]   You know what aunt you're gonna love this. I wrote a story
[02:17:38.100 --> 02:17:42.580]   I think I put it on the website yesterday maybe about medical privacy
[02:17:42.580 --> 02:17:48.180]   And I looked at some creepy creepy terms of service you you can go look at that and be like, ew
[02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:51.220]   Yeah, don't get a replacement knee with smart sensors in it
[02:17:51.220 --> 02:17:53.860]   All right
[02:17:53.860 --> 02:17:55.540]   All right
[02:17:55.540 --> 02:17:58.740]   Um, is that your pick stacy you want that to be your pick because I know you
[02:17:58.740 --> 02:18:01.460]   You unveiled your pick earlier
[02:18:01.460 --> 02:18:06.820]   Do you have a pick? Well, I I have lots of things. I have so many things y'all
[02:18:06.820 --> 02:18:11.140]   Um, I got the new sonos era 300 speakers for my birthday
[02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:17.060]   Actually got them before my birthday, but my husband made me wait to open them and build them on birthday
[02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:20.420]   He says clearly
[02:18:20.420 --> 02:18:22.420]   Whiting and I
[02:18:22.420 --> 02:18:24.820]   So a couple things one
[02:18:24.820 --> 02:18:26.980]   I use the sonos rebate program
[02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:31.300]   I don't know if everybody has like I had some old old sonos gear sticking around
[02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:35.940]   So I got 30 off just by putting in the serial number and promising to throw that away
[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:41.860]   And that was actually part of like because I can't resell it anymore because sonos now bricks their old old gear
[02:18:41.860 --> 02:18:46.100]   Right. I know exactly where this is coming from. Yeah, given you the full story
[02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:50.900]   But if you have it in your piston sonos and you're like, uh, I run into resell it
[02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:55.300]   Well, you could get 30 percent off of the new item. Yeah, nice
[02:18:55.300 --> 02:18:59.780]   Um, so they were still really expensive, but they sound amazing
[02:18:59.780 --> 02:19:06.580]   And the downside I will say of this is I cannot for the life of me figure out how to listen to Dolby at most
[02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:13.060]   Fancy spatial audio music on my sonos and it's just so they sound great
[02:19:13.140 --> 02:19:16.900]   They're designed to be like 3d sound they're designed in this weird shape
[02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:19.460]   I'm sure if you care about this sort of thing you've seen them
[02:19:19.460 --> 02:19:22.260]   um
[02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:23.620]   but
[02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:25.620]   I have amazon music. I
[02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:28.500]   Subscribe to it so I can play with this and
[02:19:28.500 --> 02:19:35.460]   I just can't figure out how to listen only to that or to and not that I want to because there's not enough of it, but
[02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:41.300]   Yeah, so setting these up was the most complicated thing I've ever had to do
[02:19:41.620 --> 02:19:43.620]   because I wanted to use
[02:19:43.620 --> 02:19:45.620]   because because of
[02:19:45.620 --> 02:19:52.580]   iOS and android issues, so there was that and then tying the different music accounts to different voice services
[02:19:52.580 --> 02:20:00.980]   We have broken technology because it took me like an hour to set everything up and I sort of knew what I was doing
[02:20:00.980 --> 02:20:03.940]   so I will just say that
[02:20:03.940 --> 02:20:07.380]   That technology is broken and all of our integrations suck
[02:20:08.020 --> 02:20:11.300]   And the user experience is terrible, but the speakers sound great
[02:20:11.300 --> 02:20:13.780]   Even if it's not
[02:20:13.780 --> 02:20:18.340]   Grub Grub Grub smile after all that at the end of the day
[02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:23.540]   Isn't that what matters most out of a speaker from sonos? How does that sound? I mean it
[02:20:23.540 --> 02:20:27.300]   Yeah, everybody in my family is very happy
[02:20:27.300 --> 02:20:31.140]   They replaced my nest audio speakers that were just terrible
[02:20:31.140 --> 02:20:35.380]   And but the best of all the smart speakers because I really wanted a smart speaker
[02:20:35.540 --> 02:20:40.500]   So if you have questions, let me know. I don't know if I'll write a review probably not, but
[02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:44.900]   That was my pick of the week. Nice. I'd make you'll listen to it, but
[02:20:44.900 --> 02:20:50.340]   We can't hear the quality. Yeah. Yeah. It wouldn't it wouldn't
[02:20:50.340 --> 02:20:52.660]   Work
[02:20:52.660 --> 02:20:55.780]   Wouldn't do a whole lot. It would still sound like a speaker on the other side of the room
[02:20:55.780 --> 02:21:04.020]   Through the mic exactly. Thank you transfer through my microphone. Yes, exactly right the sonos era 300
[02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:06.500]   Uh, jeff what you got?
[02:21:06.500 --> 02:21:11.140]   All right, well, I have to mention two things given the podcast neither of these is down on my bottom list
[02:21:11.140 --> 02:21:13.220]   But okay one is that americans
[02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:19.700]   Most people leave the news they hear on podcasts of course because it's done by wonderful people like us
[02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:23.220]   Were reading off the news. So why wouldn't it be right?
[02:21:23.220 --> 02:21:27.300]   Um, that was one. That's all I need to say about that. The other one
[02:21:27.300 --> 02:21:29.620]   I think is worth noting
[02:21:29.620 --> 02:21:34.340]   Is that the last two computer magazines? Yeah in print have done
[02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:37.460]   died maximum pc and mac life
[02:21:37.460 --> 02:21:42.180]   Yeah, print
[02:21:42.180 --> 02:21:48.340]   It was uh quite a long run almost half a century according to technologizer
[02:21:48.340 --> 02:21:54.660]   But uh, it's called I used to collect bite magazines. I didn't understand more than 85 percent of it
[02:21:54.660 --> 02:22:01.780]   But I loved it. Uh, I used to write for pc magazine and and all these magazines doing, you know
[02:22:02.260 --> 02:22:06.100]   A review of the latest version of word star that kind of stuff
[02:22:06.100 --> 02:22:10.420]   But they're gone son. My mom wrote with thesis on word star
[02:22:10.420 --> 02:22:13.300]   Yeah, I love
[02:22:13.300 --> 02:22:16.420]   Control age control age control age control age right, you know, yeah
[02:22:16.420 --> 02:22:20.180]   Sound of my childhood was a dot matrix printer printing off pages
[02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:27.540]   Yeah
[02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:31.460]   I know I saw this article we talked about it a little bit on twit this weekend
[02:22:32.020 --> 02:22:35.060]   Um, yeah a little bit of a tear. I mean
[02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:41.300]   You know my computer magazines were more Commodore 64 related back in the late 80s
[02:22:41.300 --> 02:22:45.620]   And then in the pc era like late 90s. I remember
[02:22:45.620 --> 02:22:52.660]   A handful and I do mean a handful because they were huge of computer shopper and uh, so yeah
[02:22:52.660 --> 02:22:56.820]   Computer shopper. I don't know if you remember that thing was oh jeez
[02:22:56.820 --> 02:23:00.580]   Gigantic comically large every single time
[02:23:01.540 --> 02:23:04.820]   But yeah, that's kind of crazy to think like I mean
[02:23:04.820 --> 02:23:09.940]   The last two computer magazines. That's that's an era end of an era
[02:23:09.940 --> 02:23:13.860]   Sad
[02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:16.500]   Um and what you got?
[02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:22.500]   All right. I had to fill mine in here. Um, first one is
[02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:26.020]   Luma touch luma touch. I spoken about them in the past
[02:23:26.580 --> 02:23:31.540]   They've added a multi cam support and again as I said earlier in the show
[02:23:31.540 --> 02:23:34.580]   With having a foldable device
[02:23:34.580 --> 02:23:42.180]   An app like this will be pretty that gum cool because she could have all of your controls and a timeline down on one screen and then the viewer
[02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:44.580]   Up at the top with your source
[02:23:44.580 --> 02:23:48.980]   Source files and your program files at the top that that would be awesome
[02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:52.580]   But anyway, they've added multi cam support this week for an in-app purchase
[02:23:52.660 --> 02:23:57.540]   I think it's like 20 bucks if that and uh, multi cam support is
[02:23:57.540 --> 02:24:02.900]   For people that's not familiar with video editing is you can get all of your cameras
[02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:10.020]   Shooting a scene or like just shooting our show here at twig different cameras and you can sync all of those cameras up
[02:24:10.020 --> 02:24:14.340]   In post and you can do your cuts in post, you know
[02:24:14.340 --> 02:24:18.660]   Because not everybody has a tricaster like we do and can do the cuts the way mr
[02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:25.220]   Benito is doing but this way with multi cam support in your video editor to allow you to do your cuts and posts
[02:24:25.220 --> 02:24:27.700]   To make it look the way you want it to look
[02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:32.260]   But uh, yeah, that's luma touch on ios and android
[02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:39.940]   Elasti I just wanted to give a shout out to mr. Terrell. He's a a loyal listener twig you be on my mind, sir
[02:24:39.940 --> 02:24:45.540]   Thank you for all your support of us and having heard from you a little bit. I hope you're doing okay
[02:24:45.860 --> 02:24:50.020]   And so I wanted to say it publicly just in case you're listening nice
[02:24:50.020 --> 02:24:53.940]   Thank you aunt
[02:24:53.940 --> 02:25:01.140]   My pick is a book. I just finished. I think i'm pretty certain I remember once upon a time being
[02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:06.420]   Um filling in for leo and one of my picks being a book by the author lisa de mour
[02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:11.460]   uh phd she writes she's written a lot of books about um
[02:25:11.460 --> 02:25:14.660]   girls health and
[02:25:15.380 --> 02:25:23.460]   Like young women the transition from being a girl into a woman and and i've just personally i found them incredibly helpful
[02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:29.620]   Um because I have two daughters and they you know my oldest daughter just turned 13 a couple of months ago
[02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:32.100]   And so it's very you know, it's
[02:25:32.100 --> 02:25:35.940]   Any parents would would know it's it's an interesting time
[02:25:35.940 --> 02:25:40.020]   And i'm loving i'm loving where i'm at with our family and everything like that
[02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:42.580]   But I also want to understand
[02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:47.300]   Things that I might not know and so lisa de mour just writes really compelling books
[02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:50.980]   On the topic and I just finished a book by her called under pressure
[02:25:50.980 --> 02:25:57.540]   confronting the epidemic of stress and anxiety in girls and it was just it was fantastic
[02:25:57.540 --> 02:26:04.020]   And i've just started another of her books that she wrote that she released i think like a year year and a half ago called
[02:26:04.020 --> 02:26:09.140]   um the emotional lives of teenagers raising connected capable and compassionate
[02:26:09.140 --> 02:26:12.020]   Adolescence and i'm just like i'm in this like
[02:26:12.740 --> 02:26:15.540]   mode of just being incredibly captivated
[02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:20.100]   By this and you know taking some of the things that i'm reading and
[02:26:20.100 --> 02:26:24.980]   Trying to figure out how how I talk with my daughter about different things
[02:26:24.980 --> 02:26:30.500]   Better than maybe you know, I would have had I not read these books so any parents out there
[02:26:30.500 --> 02:26:37.700]   Uh of children because I think the emotional lives of teenagers that's you know, that's not just targeted just at at young girls
[02:26:37.700 --> 02:26:39.140]   Um
[02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:46.740]   Targeted boys have emotions too. Absolutely and the book focuses heavily on that as well. You know, that's that's equally is important
[02:26:46.740 --> 02:26:53.780]   It's very important. So um, she's just a really great author and actually if you get her books on audible
[02:26:53.780 --> 02:26:59.300]   She reads them all it's in her voice and uh, I just I love it when authors do that
[02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:04.020]   Um, and especially when they're good at doing that and she is very good at it. So
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:11.700]   So there you go. Her uh, her name is uh, Lisa de mour Ph.D. Look for her books. She is very very smart
[02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:15.700]   I'm learning a lot from her good pick. Yeah
[02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:21.860]   But we have reached the end of this episode of this week in google always a lot of fun
[02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:25.700]   Always appreciate the opportunity to fill in for leo when leo is out
[02:27:25.700 --> 02:27:32.660]   So thanks to you three for welcoming back welcoming me back once again and uh next week

[02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:46.020]   What do you want to leave people with stacy anything anything that you're working on that you want to
[02:27:46.020 --> 02:27:48.580]   want to tease or no
[02:27:48.580 --> 02:27:53.460]   She's checking for the bird make sure it didn't hit the window. No the bird. I think
[02:27:53.460 --> 02:27:59.620]   I'm gonna take the plastic off the way you can see it's falling off. Um, no, uh, stacey on iot
[02:28:00.020 --> 02:28:02.900]   I guess I don't know. Okay, Stacy on the
[02:28:02.900 --> 02:28:08.340]   story about smart pry read it about privacy. I think you guys should be aware that this is happening
[02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:13.540]   I will smirk in skimmin drive privacy legislation. It should that's the name of that article
[02:28:13.540 --> 02:28:19.940]   I skimmed over at miss tacey just briefly and the paragraph about hipah. Yeah, I
[02:28:19.940 --> 02:28:25.860]   It's unfortunate that people do not quite understand that one of those p stands for portability
[02:28:26.500 --> 02:28:32.980]   So yeah, not privacy none of them none of them stand for privacy. There's only one pn
[02:28:32.980 --> 02:28:35.460]   But does does one of them stand for per verification
[02:28:35.460 --> 02:28:40.900]   Good point after this episode absolutely
