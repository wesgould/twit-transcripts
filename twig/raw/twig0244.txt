[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.960]   Gina Trapani is here.
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.880]   Yes, the change log is back.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.160]   Aaron Newcomb as well.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.160]   We'll talk about Hartley, what you should do
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.840]   about this horrible internet disaster.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.280]   And whether you need an antivirus on Android, turns out.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.960]   The answer is not what you expect.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.720]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.400]   Netcasts you love.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.800]   From people you trust.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.080]   This is Twig.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.840]   Bandwidth for this week in Google

[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.400]   the show where we cover Google, the cloud, the Google
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.120]   verse, the Twitter verse, the Facebook verse, the blank verse.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.080]   Gina's for panning's back.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.680]   We missed you, Gina.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.800]   Oh, so great to be back.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.360]   Hello.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.200]   Think up.com.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.640]   Now in her new Brooklyn office, no more paneling.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.800]   I'm sad.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.240]   I've graduated from mom's basement.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.520]   Did you bring the Jets blanket?
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.680]   It's just like it's dated moms, unfortunately.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.640]   I'm like a grown-up now.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.480]   It's really exciting.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.600]   My own four walls.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.160]   It's amazing.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.680]   How nice.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.400]   Great to be here.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.720]   We missed you so much, but we're glad you're here.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.400]   I'm going to ask you about your phone in a second.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.880]   Erin Newcomb is also here.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.880]   Yeah, glad to be here.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.920]   And that app and also a regular on many of our shows.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.960]   You did Floss this morning.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.000]   Flossly for you this morning.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.720]   Yeah, we talked to the guys from--
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.640]   I was at myfo, myfo.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.520]   It's the guy that do the micro payments.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.200]   Oh, hey.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.240]   Mepos, I think it is.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.560]   My FOS.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.200]   And they do micro payments.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.840]   And they're really--
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.400]   Open source micro payments.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.720]   Open source micro payments.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.240]   And it's--
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.200]   Were they using our pollution?
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.600]   I did.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.640]   We get into that a little bit.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.720]   We kind of just laughed about it.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.280]   And we didn't actually go into the details,
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.840]   because I didn't want to derail the show on our way.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.360]   And you can listen to security now, yes.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.960]   Yeah, that was great.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.840]   Obviously, what a deep, deep, deep details of that.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.520]   Heartbleed is--
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.520]   it's ironic, because this was the week
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520]   XP yesterday, XP came to its end of life.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.080]   And we thought XP, POCOLips would happen.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.280]   And all the people, almost half a billion
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.840]   who are continuing to run XP, no longer are getting updates.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.040]   That means that the hackers who have exploits or--
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.000]   nothing's happened yet.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.520]   But I think we've not heard the end of it.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.640]   Nevertheless, the big security story of the week
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.880]   has nothing to do with XP.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.880]   It's has to do with Open Source.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.760]   Turns out there's been a highly exploitable flaw
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.920]   in the OpenSSL library that's used
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.360]   by two-thirds of all web servers out there right now.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.480]   Anybody uses Apache or Nginx?
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   Is likely, right?
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.320]   Using OpenSSL?
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.040]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.840]   Yeah, in fact, we just interviewed the Nginx guys
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.760]   about a month ago on Floss Weekly.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.360]   They came in and gave us an overview.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.160]   And I saw that.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.080]   And I was like, oh, I feel so bad for them,
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.360]   because they have such a great product.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.720]   Yeah, it's not their fault.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.920]   But it's pretty much anything that uses OpenSSL
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.120]   is at risk.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.760]   And the thing is, what they're at risk for is so significant.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.120]   Because basically, it allows a leak of data
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.800]   from the server itself, and it leaves no trace.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.360]   And we know that this whole has existed for two years.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.680]   So that means for the last two years,
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.600]   any bad guy who knew of this whole
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.280]   could extract data from a server 64 bytes at a time,
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.600]   directly from memory.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.120]   From memory.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.480]   So that means-- now, he can't say,
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.520]   I want to get Aaron Newcomb's credentials.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.680]   He just gets whatever he gets.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.440]   He gets whatever he gets.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.480]   But then you take all that data and you parse through it,
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.760]   and you're like, this is after the decryption algorithms
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.240]   have run on things like your passwords
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.680]   and sensitive information that is going back and forth
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.240]   on the server.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.920]   So after that decryption has gone through,
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.080]   then it gets loaded into memory.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.480]   And you've got all this data just basically sitting there,
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.400]   open for someone to come in and pull out and digest.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.120]   Now, since it's from memory-- so we
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.560]   were having a discussion on Windows Weekly,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.520]   and I will ask Steve, but he's not around right now.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.840]   And by the way, Google was bit by this.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.400]   There is a Google Twitter, Google, Yahoo.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.760]   Pretty much everybody uses the lamp stack was bit.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.080]   So and presumably, they've all patched it.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.440]   Google has patched most, Yahoo's patched most, not all.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.040]   It takes time.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.440]   Under services.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.800]   It's patched up many servers.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.040]   Because there is a fix, but you have
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.560]   to make sure that library is being used by your servers
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.960]   everywhere.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.240]   You sit in the interesting-- so it reads what's in RAM.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.960]   Not what's in the database.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.280]   So that's important because it's decrypted.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.040]   But it also means that when somebody was asking, well,
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.680]   what about two-factor authentication?
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.560]   Has that been compromised?
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.480]   And if it were reading-- so in order for two-factor to work,
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.800]   you and Google share a key, a secret number.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.600]   And locally on your phone, it's hashing that secret number
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.280]   with the time to get a six-digit code.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.680]   Google hashes the time with the same secret number,
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   knows what that code should be.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.440]   You're both at the same-- your times are synchronized.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.680]   And so that number should match.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.720]   If they match, then Google says, oh, yes, you're you.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.400]   So that is a secret number that Google knows.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.600]   Is that stored in RAM during that handshake?
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.280]   We don't know.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.600]   Well, we don't know.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.920]   And quite possibly, whatever you type into the keyboard
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.720]   and press Enter when you type in that number--
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.880]   That's going to be in memory.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.360]   But that's only good for 30 seconds.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.920]   But that's only good for exactly--
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.800]   It's the secret number that we have to know if it is that
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.440]   being at least.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.440]   So I would say no, but I'm not the expert.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.320]   I would defer to Steve Gibson on this.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.160]   But I would say no, because they should be taking that key
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.240]   that hash and then using that along with something else,
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.520]   like you said, time, or your mother's maiden name,
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.400]   or the number of digits and pi, up to a certain point
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.480]   in that point is random.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.320]   But there has to be-- it's symmetric in the sense
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.720]   there has to be a shared number and a shared key.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.680]   And that shared key--
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.040]   If that's leaked by heartbleed, then you're screwed.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.200]   Then two factors not going to even protect you.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.800]   Well, if you know the key and you know what the algorithm is
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.760]   for generating the number.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.640]   Well, everybody uses Google Authenticator.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.040]   We know what the algorithm is.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.480]   We know what it is for Google anyway.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.760]   We know what it is for a new version of Google
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.600]   and it's not going to be a new version of Google.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.840]   And we know that it's not going to be a new version of Google.

[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.160]   And we know that it's going to be a new version of Google.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.160]   But unfortunately, it's not happening.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.160]   I keep going to Bank of America.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160]   They're not saying anything.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160]   No bank wants to talk about this.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.160]   They'll just raise more concern than they can solve.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160]   And people will go, what happened?
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160]   My heart is bleeding?
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.160]   What should I do?
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:04.160]   And that's a problem because I don't know if my bank has fixed this.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160]   I haven't logged into my bank since I heard about this.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.160]   I said, oop.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.160]   Now, it doesn't matter, right?
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.160]   Because it's been going on for the past two years.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160]   They've probably got it now.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160]   But what does matter, what was kind of a big deal about this, was that, you know, people
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.160]   started talking about this before the fix was ready.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.160]   So there was generating a lot of anxiety about this.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   And I know that there was some pushback against some media outlets and things talking about this
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.160]   saying, you know, why was this such made such a big deal before we had the fix put out?
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.160]   Now, you can.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.160]   There are heart bleed tests online.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.160]   And I think that you can use to test it.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:49.160]   The open SSL test suite has been updated to test for that chat room.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.160]   What's the link for that?
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160]   Because yeah, it's like SSL.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160]   And last pass has one last pass.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.160]   That's it.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.160]   I think that's it.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.160]   And I would trust last pass.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160]   By the way, they fixed theirs very quickly.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.160]   But that doesn't mean that merely means you can use last pass to fix your passwords.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.160]   Right.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.160]   But you can't.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.160]   So the SSL server test does now have this is from QALIS have so you can say, okay, well, bank
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:25.160]   of America.com have they fixed it and it will actually have a heart bleed.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160]   So it is not vulnerable according to this to the heart bleed attack.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   So I assume that these checkers are just examining the headers of the website request to see whether
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.160]   or not the right, the particular version of open SSL is being used.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.160]   But you know, those headers are very easily, you know, on set or you didn't like it.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.800]   I think up, you know, we changed our headers so you couldn't detect exactly what versions
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.160]   we were using for security purposes, security through obscurity.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.160]   That is.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   So these checkers, unless they're doing something different, Aaron, correct me if they are, they're,
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   you know, they'll tell you if they know for sure this site is running this vulnerable version
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.160]   of open SSL, but they can't tell you for sure for everybody.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:12.160]   Yahoo.com was tested as vulnerable according to this just detected server software of ATS
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160]   server software's unknown might well, this is why they call it.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   They say it's vulnerable.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.160]   They don't know.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.160]   They don't know.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160]   Right.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160]   So Yahoo is renamed has said they deliver in their headers, which is totally configurable in
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.160]   a batch in NGINX, you know, what software is this web server using?
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.160]   You can change that name to anything in your config files with, you know, ours says, you
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160]   know, think up web server, right?
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.760]   And that's, and that's, like I said, security through obscurity.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.760]   But for these kind of checkers that are just looking at the headers, they just don't know.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.560]   They don't know what version of open SSL is.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.360]   So this isn't, this isn't even though.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.800]   Wallace is saying, oh, yeah, Yahoo.com is not vulnerable to heart bleed.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.800]   This isn't conclusive.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.800]   Right.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.960]   It's not definitive anyway.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.960]   It's not definitive.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.360]   That's not so good.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.760]   That's not so good.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.760]   That's not so good.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.440]   Because my bank is never, ever, ever going to say, oh, we fixed our servers.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.080]   It's so maybe I'll wait till they say you should change your password now.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.080]   They're never going to send that out either.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.480]   Well, you know, I just tried to log in a Tumblr earlier today and I got the message, you
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:17.400]   know, you know, detected unusual activity on your account, please change your password.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.880]   And I assume that this was heart bleed, you know, related.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:25.240]   In fact, we had a Tumblr engineer on all about Android last night on the Android team.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.560]   So I went and changed my password.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.280]   So will your banks do that?
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.160]   Yeah, I mean, I hope so.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.200]   I mean, I expect that anytime my bank suspects that something has gone wrong with my account,
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.960]   they'd asked me to update my credentials.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.960]   Today's truth.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.440]   I think the reality is that these bugs are always going to happen.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:45.840]   I think that the real test of an app or a company's metal is how quickly they acknowledge
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:51.840]   that they were affected and that they fix it and they lay out a clear plan for users to
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.080]   sort of recoup their information.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.000]   Don't and be honest, the banks are not known for being there.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.640]   There's one other thing now and we talked about this on security now and I don't know
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.840]   if this is necessary or not, but Steve said do it.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.600]   So I'm going to show you this too.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.800]   If you're using Chrome, you're going to go to your settings, show advanced settings,
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:18.840]   which is at the very bottom and you'll see SSL certificates right at the very bottom.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:24.440]   One thing that most browsers do not currently do is check for server certificate revocation.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:30.240]   So this is important because part of the fix is to get a new certificate issued.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.120]   You can presume Google presumes the certificate has been compromised.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.120]   We don't know by the way.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.960]   We don't know, but they're going to presume it's been compromised.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.760]   Now what you don't want to do is continue to use the broken certificate because that
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.760]   could allow a man in the middle.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.200]   If it has been compromised, that could allow a man in the middle.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:52.720]   So what you want to do is check the box that says check for server certificate revocation.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.960]   That means Chrome will say, we'll go to the, there's two different databases and say,
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.600]   has this server, is this certificate revved or revoked?
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.120]   And if you're getting a bad certificate, the browser will say, whoa, not supposed to do
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.120]   that.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.120]   That's a revoked certificate.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:11.880]   It's not on by default because Steve says it's a can add it's there's some overhead to
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.480]   check these two databases so it can slow it down.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.920]   So by default, it doesn't do that.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.920]   Turn it on, at least for now.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   Turn it on.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:19.920]   I'm turning it on right now.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.920]   That's a great tip.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.920]   Thank you, Steve.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.840]   You can do it in Firefox.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.520]   Safari, if you're a Mac user is a little more complicated, you actually have to go into
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.800]   keychain access into the certificate section.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.920]   I might as well do it since I think we probably have a few Macintosh users watching.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.080]   Your Chromebook is sufficient just to do it in Chrome.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:49.000]   You have to go into certificates and keychain access, go to in the preferences.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.520]   And then this is the online.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.000]   These are the two different databases.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.600]   It searches O, CSP and CRL.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.400]   These are certificate revocation servers.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.720]   Default is best attempt.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:07.480]   What you want to do is hold down your option key and select require for all certificates.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.480]   It's not.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.880]   You can't even get to that without holding down the option key.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.280]   Because I guess they just don't want you to slow down.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.640]   I don't know.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:24.080]   But basically from now on, it will go and check those two databases, O CSP and CRL, for revocation
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.880]   before it accepts a certificate.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.880]   And I don't know.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.280]   It should be probably in this day and age of default behavior, but I guess it slows things
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.280]   down.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:37.800]   I just got an email from my FTTT saying there was a major vulnerability.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.840]   IFTT is no longer vulnerable.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.840]   Good for that.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.840]   We have no evidence of malicious behavior.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.160]   But we've logged you out of IFTT across all the apps and we encourage you to change your
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.400]   password.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.680]   That's a really good way, I think, to handle this.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.400]   Holy cow.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:16:00.560]   But that means everybody watching has got to go through all of their HTTPS site passwords
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.800]   and change them.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.000]   And I've standardized on, I think I'm going to switch to LastPass, but I use LastPass.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.800]   I use password right now because it's free and it works pretty much everywhere.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.760]   But now all those passwords that I felt so safe and secure about because they were all
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.560]   scrambled and run through an algorithm and mixed up and I didn't have to remember what
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.120]   they all actually were.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.240]   Now I have to figure out a different way to go through and change all those passwords.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.240]   It's easy to do, but it's just kind of a pain in the butt.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.800]   Yeah, if you're not using a password keeper, it's shush.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.920]   But this is an opportunity to start using LastPass.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.800]   We know LastPass is secure.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   Start using LastPass, set it up, and now go through every site.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.640]   Exactly.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.640]   LastPass will remember it.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.640]   Ask that it's generated password.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.160]   Say I want a new password, generate it.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.160]   LastPass will remember it.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.160]   You're now clean.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.560]   That's exactly what I'm going to do, especially since they now have the integration with Android
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.760]   for Chrome and some other apps.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.760]   Isn't that nice?
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.760]   That's awesome.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.160]   By the way, it completely broke.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.360]   What was it?
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.360]   It completely broke something.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.800]   Oh, the camera on the MA.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.800]   Oh, really?
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.200]   Oh, did it?
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.920]   So, and it was one of those things nobody knew about.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.720]   I'm sure LastPass has fixed it.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.000]   But if you get weird crashes, so the camera kept crashing.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.200]   And what I finally, I think I was searching on the web and finally figured out is that
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:25.160]   the cam, that LastPass was trying to pop up, they check this thing.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:30.960]   So you have to go into the LastPass, they have settings for every app and say don't.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.240]   And then the camera works fine.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.240]   Wow.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.720]   It's a weird fix and I'm glad I found it because I actually thought I had a bad MA.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.720]   Mm.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.720]   So there was no indication?
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.440]   No, because, you know, this is what happens.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.520]   We just kept crashing, crashing.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.920]   New phone, new software feature.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.120]   So no one had a chance to test it.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.160]   And being one of the, that's always the drawback to being the, uh, no hair of a new product.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.400]   The canary and the coal mine.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   I am.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   Exactly.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.360]   And I passed out and fell a long way.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.400]   So you can, so it's a good thing to know.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.480]   I guess I'll pass that along if you, if you get weirdness.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:09.800]   But I do love it because LastPass, when it sees a password, a entry form will pop up
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.960]   and say, do you want me to fill that out?
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.400]   I happen to know that.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   I'm not awesome.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   Mm.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   Pretty good stuff.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.400]   All right.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.400]   We'll take a break.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.400]   Come back.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.400]   We've got lots to talk about.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.400]   In fact, I want to ask Gina, I hear you got your MA.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.400]   I did.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   I did.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.400]   You pushed by.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.640]   And you and I have a different versions because you have the Google play edition.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.640]   I'm curious about it.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.640]   I got the play edition.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.640]   We should talk about it.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.640]   You guys last night played with the Galaxy S5 as well.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.640]   I'd love to get that.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.640]   I'm not sure about the impression.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.640]   Yes.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.080]   Although I hear you were kind of negative.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.440]   You know, I, yeah.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.720]   You know, I'm a sucker for design, which is why I have the MA.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.920]   I completely agree with you.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.080]   And I didn't, I didn't love the looks of the S5.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.880]   It looks just like the S4.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.880]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:57.120]   But, but I gave, so I was going to review it this week, but I felt so bad for Jason.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.120]   I said, please, you have this.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.120]   So he's got a for a week.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.120]   He'll review it.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.120]   We have the unboxing.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.160]   And you unboxed it first, but you had a.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.160]   Oh, I did, but.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.480]   We had a re-unboxed.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.680]   Yeah, but I guess we were embargoed so we couldn't do it till midnight.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.680]   It was very complicated.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.680]   Right.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.680]   Yes.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.680]   It was a little bit complicated.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.680]   Jason had a late night last night.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.920]   Our show today brought to you by nature.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.320]   You want a snack?
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.520]   It'll make you feel better.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.520]   Jason, have a snack.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.560]   You know, look, we've got another nature box.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.920]   So they have three sizes.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.240]   This is, I think this is the small size.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:34.600]   The whole idea is, come around this time of day, in the early afternoon, lunches long,
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.360]   gone, a distant memory, and dinner is too far off to be forgotten.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.080]   But maybe you've just got a little hankering for something.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.720]   Wouldn't you love a nature box?
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.560]   How about a cherry berry bonanza?
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.520]   That looks pretty good.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.200]   These are all nutritionist approved.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.160]   The thing I love about nature box is these are healthy snacks.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.240]   Snacks you can eat and not feel guilty about.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.240]   This has, what is it having it?
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.760]   It's cranberries, tart cherries, blueberries.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.760]   That's it.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.760]   Oh my God.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.760]   I'm ordering one of these.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.760]   Oh, that sounds good.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.760]   That's it.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.400]   I have to hear about it last night and to me.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.400]   Yeah, forget it.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.400]   It's a ordering.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   So here's the cool thing.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.280]   Why don't you get it for a think up?
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:26.360]   So there are never any, never any high fructose corn syrup or trans fats in these things.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.560]   They are always all natural ingredients.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.160]   They're just delicious.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:38.400]   You can, if you wish, narrow it down at naturebox.com/twit and say, I want vegan or soy free.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.280]   I'm gluten conscious or I don't want any lactose.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.280]   I'm not free non-gima.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.280]   All of that stuff.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.080]   You can also choose by taste savory, sweet or spicy or you could just say, come on.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:53.700]   Hit me with a random selection like barbecue, kurtl kettles, kettl kurtls, french toast
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:58.020]   granola, chili lime pistachios, cherry berry bannins.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.100]   They'll put a box together.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.740]   Here's smoky barbecue peas.
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.700]   Which one is this suits you, Aaron?
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.700]   You could pick one.
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.940]   I'll take the barbecue peas.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.740]   Brost, see, Aaron brought us donuts this morning.
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.580]   Oh, no.
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.580]   I would love to have Chipotle maple almonds.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.580]   Come on.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.580]   It's good too.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.580]   Sweet, savory.
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.580]   I can eat either of those actually.
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.220]   You can have anything you want because you know what?
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.980]   There's more where that came from.
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.380]   I get a nature box every month.
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.780]   You can do three, six or 12 month subscription.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:30.700]   And if you go to naturebox.com/twit, 50% off your first box.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.020]   Naturebox.com/twit.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:38.660]   You're going to, okay, you're going to just try the cherry.
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.300]   He's trying the Chipotle maple almonds.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.860]   This is the Chipotle maple almonds?
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.940]   So you know almonds are good for you.
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:45.980]   They're a great nanny oxis.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:50.860]   No high fructose corn syrup, no parsley, hydrogenated oils, zero trans fats, no artificial sweeteners,
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.160]   flavors or colors.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.160]   This is, right?
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.460]   Little sweet, little hot.
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.460]   Not too spicy.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.460]   Little sweet, little heat.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.460]   It's just a little smidge of the taste.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.460]   Oh, man.
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.460]   Oh, man.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.460]   Killing me here.
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.460]   And they sound good too.
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.260]   All right, all right, all right.
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.460]   Wow, is that good?
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.460]   Yeah, really good.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.360]   Healthy crunch.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.060]   We give these guys always wait too much ad time because we keep eating their stuff while
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.060]   they're...
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:21.700]   I mean, half hour ad as we eat.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.600]   All right, moving along.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.000]   Thank you, Mr. Butts.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.200]   Snack times over.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   Nap times coming up.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.200]   That's right.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.200]   That's what I look forward to.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.400]   How do you like it?
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.200]   M8, you had the original HTC One as did I?
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.280]   Yes, and my daughter threw it on the floor too many times and it died.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.280]   It died on me.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.280]   These things have.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.280]   I did.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.280]   Yeah, they happen.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.800]   So I ordered the M8 from the Google Play Store.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.500]   I got it day before yesterday.
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.160]   Of course, the HTC One has a micro SIM and this has a nano SIM.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:01.680]   So I had to go down to the T-Mobile store and get a new SIM where the T-Mobile people nearly
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.680]   passed out.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.080]   They're like, "Where did you get this phone?
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.600]   This doesn't come out till Friday."
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.000]   It's like, just ordered it on the web.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   No big deal.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.560]   So they transferred my number over.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.040]   And you know, I like it a lot.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.040]   It's big.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.960]   It's bigger than the regular HTC One.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:21.560]   And it's got these kind of curved softer edges with this lip which the regular or the original
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.200]   HTC One didn't have, which I don't like as much.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.840]   The two things I really do like, I like that the buttons are now on screen rather than
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.000]   on the device itself.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Yes.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.920]   And the heck out of me out of the room?
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.920]   Yeah, I like that a lot.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.480]   That's a closer cut on to the Google Android experience.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.600]   Now, this is the Google Play Edition, which means that I'm running kind of the Google
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:48.040]   Android experience, but the one thing that this phone has different is these dual cameras.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.040]   Right.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.040]   So they actually forked.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.600]   They did ship this Google Play Edition with the HTC Photo Edit.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.600]   Oh, good.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.200]   Which can do the focus match.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.920]   That's the most important part of Sense 6 you want.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.920]   That's good.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.360]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.880]   And so I played around with that a little bit.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.840]   It took a few shots of my daughter who's always moving.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.120]   I always seemed to get the background focused and her blurred.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.360]   And so I tried changing the focus and it's okay.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.640]   It's not super good.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.640]   It's not super good.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:20.800]   Like I noticed kind of like around her head, you could tell that it's not perfectly aligned.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.480]   You could tell if there's a seam.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.160]   And it felt like a filter.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.360]   I thought that would feel less like a filter.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:34.840]   I thought that it would feel less like an Instagram filter and more like a genuine this
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.640]   thing in the front is going out of focus.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.200]   And there's that 3D where you can tilt and see the three kind of 3D object.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   That's just weird.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.040]   Which also seemed kind of gimmicky to me.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:48.320]   So unfortunately the dual camera stuff did seem more gimmicky than I would have liked.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.320]   Let me show you.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.840]   These are pictures I took in our studio of Chad.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.560]   This is the normal one.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.240]   This is with a background de-colored, desaturated.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.040]   That's kind of cool.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.040]   That's nice.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.040]   And this is another.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.480]   These are special effects they do in the backgrounds.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.840]   Don't forget that.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.600]   Okay, now this is the faded background.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.640]   Alright, there you go.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.880]   So notice kind of around his hair.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.880]   It's not perfect.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.880]   It's pretty good.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.880]   It's pretty good.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.680]   It's pretty good but it's not as good as if you took that with a real DSLR and had that
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.480]   real depth of field.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.480]   Yeah, but I mean it's good enough for online.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.760]   So look here's Greg.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.720]   Look at Greg's arm on the left there.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.240]   When I take it out of focus the arms.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.000]   But if you think about the depth of field is very shallow, right?
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   So his arm would be out of focus.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Yeah, it should be.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.600]   I don't hate it.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.600]   I agree with you.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:46.400]   Now what is good about this is the macro camera is excellent.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.680]   So the close up pictures are quite good.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.360]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.640]   I'm thinking this is a pretty darn good.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:59.280]   It's four megapixels but you know, one trick and you could do this I think if you have
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.240]   the sense camera.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.640]   There's a setting for maximum ISO.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.960]   One of the things this camera does in low light is turns the ISO way too high.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.960]   It's very grainy.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   I set it down to 400.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.720]   It won't go above 400 now, which means you're not going to get as low light won't be as
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.240]   good as it is maybe used to be.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.400]   And that makes sense that the default settings were set that way, right?
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.400]   Because that was supposed to be one of the sweet spots.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.000]   It's a selling point.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.600]   They want that aspect of the camera to work really well because that's the one place.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.800]   Since they only have four megapixels, they can claim really good low light pictures.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.840]   Well, so some of these are low.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.560]   This is a low light picture.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.680]   You see there's a lot of grain.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.000]   This is before I set it down to 400.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.640]   And so I just find that a little displeasing with a light grain.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.920]   So I just, I grin and bear it.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.480]   So this doesn't actually, the play edition doesn't ship with the HPC camera but it does
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.480]   have the HPC edit.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.560]   I'm sorry, my video is getting bad.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.360]   It does have the HPC edit features.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:05.440]   So when you tap the edit button, when you're looking to gallery, it lets you use HPC edit.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.560]   And those aren't available for photos that you take while you're taking video, which I
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.560]   do a lot.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.520]   Like I'll take video of my daughter and then just tap the screen to grab a still.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.720]   And so it doesn't seem to be using the dual cameras there.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.000]   So you can't do the focus in a 3D thing.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   But...
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   There's nothing else though.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.640]   Trying to think what else in sense you would be missing.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.960]   I don't think there's anything else that you really, this really, you got, so, there's
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.960]   a Zoe app on here.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:34.600]   It says, "Coming soon, I think they're going to offer the Zoe capability to all cameras."
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.600]   Wow.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   It's going to be in the play store.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   It would be in the play store.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.600]   That would be great.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.600]   That would be great.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.600]   That would be great.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.600]   Here's another example.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:47.520]   If you look at the straw hat in the middle and then I defocus the background, apparently
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:53.360]   the brim of the hat is also... that's a little disconcerting.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.240]   And the guy's shoulder on the far right gets blurred.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.400]   That so it doesn't work.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.400]   You're right.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.400]   It's not perfect.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.400]   It's a filter.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.400]   It's a filter.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.400]   Look at his shoulder.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.400]   There's no reason that she...
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.800]   My impression was that these were two different images.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.680]   One with different focuses and that you were switching between them, but it's actually
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.160]   much more of a software effect.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.160]   I think it's a copy.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.160]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.480]   You can clearly see the region select there.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.480]   It's computational.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.520]   And it may be the stripes in the shirt confused it.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.040]   I would bet that that's what happened.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.720]   Combined with the shadow probably.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.960]   Did they really need to build a hole on the camera in the back of the phone in order to
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.960]   do this?
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.960]   I don't know.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.520]   Like, do you think like effects that they could have achieved is just a one really good
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.520]   camera?
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.760]   Well, in fact, the Nokia does.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.640]   So the Nokia camera app, which has a single sensor, does it, in fact, arguably does it
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   better?
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.120]   So, yeah, I would say so.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.320]   I do like this phone though.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.640]   You've got to like the build is heavier and bigger than your old one, right?
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.480]   Oh, we lost her.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.480]   She was just slowly...
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.480]   Sorry about that.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.480]   My video is degrading.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.480]   I hope it's better.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.480]   You're fine.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.480]   You're better.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.480]   Okay.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.480]   Good.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.480]   As long as my audio is good.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   I love the phone.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.480]   Just to be clear, I really do love it.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.480]   It's beautiful.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.480]   It does push my personal limit of size.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   I wouldn't want a phone bigger than this.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.480]   It does feel big.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.480]   But the build is gorgeous.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.480]   I have to...
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.680]   I'm really restraining myself from buying that really cool case with the dots.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.680]   No, don't buy that.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.680]   That's dumb.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.680]   I like the dot case.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.680]   I like the dot case.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.680]   I like the dot case.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.680]   Oh, get the dot case.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.680]   By all means, be quick.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.680]   Knock yourself out.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.440]   Why are you trying to restrain yourself?
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.040]   If you like the dot case.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:35.320]   Well, because I risked some domestic discord around this particular financial decision.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.320]   So I don't know if I can...
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.320]   Oh, come on.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   How much is the dot case?
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.320]   That's like 100 bucks.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.320]   Well, that's true.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.320]   I guess once you think 700 bucks in, you're...
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.320]   Really?
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.320]   You have to have the dot case.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.480]   It's only been three days with the battery life so far has been great.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.720]   I forgot to plug this in last night.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.720]   And I'm at still...
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.720]   I'm at about 50 percent right now.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.720]   I've been getting...
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.720]   I'm at 51 percent.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.960]   Fifty hours is pretty consistent.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.960]   That's great.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.960]   And another thing I really needed and the HTC One was kind of killing me on.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.760]   So I'm very pleased about that.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.320]   That may not stay that way.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.000]   Remember, that's just brand new phone factor.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.600]   And it may be better for Gina than it is for you, Leo, because...
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.600]   Very good.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.600]   Right.
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.600]   ...Gee, running Google.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.600]   Right.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.600]   Right.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.600]   Well, it's also very user-specific.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.600]   I mean, how you use it.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   And how you use it absolutely.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.600]   Yeah, what you're running back on.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   How much do you use the display?
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.600]   Right.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.600]   Yep.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   Definitely.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.120]   I had gone really far and installed a bunch of apps, particularly for AA.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:30.560]   And so I've gone a clean suite and just tried to remove as many background processes as
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.560]   possible.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.160]   Do either of you use a screen protector?
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.160]   No.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.160]   No.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.160]   No.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.760]   Because the curved edges to that phone are going to make screen protectors look a little
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.960]   goofy, because they won't cling to the edges.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.960]   So you have to get one that's cut down.
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.960]   Right.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.960]   And then when it's cut down, it looks like you're not really protecting the whole screen.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.960]   Right.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.960]   So...
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:49.960]   I mean, the bezel, the bezel.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.960]   Yeah, the bezel on the edges.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.960]   Or beveled.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.360]   That was one of the problems with the Nexus 4.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.080]   I got Nexus 4's for my wife and my son for Christmas.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.480]   And I went to put a screen protector on them because they need them.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.200]   And I'm like, "Why isn't this fitting right?"
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.880]   And it's like, "Oh yeah, I forgot the corners are beveled."
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.880]   Edges.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:08.880]   So...
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.800]   Nothing's perfect in this world alas.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.880]   But it feels good in your hand.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.880]   So what did you guys...
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.520]   I guess you weren't here.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.080]   You were, of course, on Skype, Gina.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:23.000]   So you didn't get to actually hold the Galaxy S5.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.040]   What was the consensus on that last night on all about Android?
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:29.480]   You know, we were really just kind of checking out the hardware part of it.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.480]   We're checking out the dimpled back and that metallic kind of...
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.040]   The dimpled back is certainly...
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.160]   Yeah, that was our consensus.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.520]   You know, we've been told that we're really hard on the Samsung devices.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.200]   I don't think any of us are really huge fans of the Samsung builds.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.520]   And we were talking about how the buttons were reversed as usual and how the camera
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.280]   kind of protrudes a little bit.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.280]   I am now.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.400]   It's so funny that talking about a 180 degree turn for me, I used to want a physical home
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.400]   button.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.400]   Now I don't.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:05.160]   Yeah, I have now completely gone over to the Google idea of having soft buttons at the
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.160]   bottom of the screen.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.160]   Remember I hated that idea?
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.240]   And you'd admit that there is wasted space.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:15.960]   There is from here to here wasted by the buttons and by the HTC logo that maybe could
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.400]   be better used.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:23.360]   However, I just think that's so much better than this wonky home button.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.320]   Just the click and all that stuff.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.320]   There's the band-aid back.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.720]   Yeah, it feels a little cheap, right?
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.720]   I'm supposed to feel more natural.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   I'm supposed to feel more natural.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.200]   I'm going to love it.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.200]   Are they?
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.200]   I mean, I...
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.680]   I feel like this is a cultural gulf.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.000]   Like this is...
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Seriously.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   I agree.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   I agree.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.680]   That this is just... some people will like it.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.320]   It just feels cheesy to me.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.200]   I really don't like touch whiz.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.120]   They've improved it in the sense that there is more free space on here.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:57.360]   There's a lot of the Samsung apps are optional, which is a big improvement.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:02.440]   But AT&T, this is an AT&T phone, still 10 AT&T apps.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.280]   Come on.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.040]   You don't get any of that stuff on Google Play, do you?
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.040]   No.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.320]   No, that's why I put Google Edition on my S4.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.320]   Right.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.680]   I get rid of all that crap.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.200]   And so here's all the Samsung apps.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.760]   The nice thing is I can uninstall them when I don't have to install them.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:22.440]   So they've got more than 10 gigs free on the 16 gig phone, which that's a big improvement.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:27.080]   Camera on this is a significant improvement, 13 megapixels.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.080]   And it's using beauty face right now.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.840]   And look how beautiful I look.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.840]   Look how beautiful.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.640]   That is beautiful.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.680]   We were very happy.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.160]   We had some good Leo pictures on the phone.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.720]   Oh yeah, I left some pictures on there.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.760]   That is beauty face.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.760]   And that's gorgeous.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.760]   That's a little fantastic.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:51.040]   Oh my my son.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.600]   I heard that Chad.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.600]   What?
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.600]   What?
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   It's a beauty face.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.680]   I mean, it describes the whole camera.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.440]   They got rid of the golf mode.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.440]   I can't understand what, what are you going to do?
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.320]   Yeah, isn't that terrible?
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.760]   So they do have auto beauty face shot and more.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.480]   I don't know what shot and more is.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   It's golf mode.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.480]   Oh, it's back.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.320]   I just did a one browse the various effects available for burst shots I see.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:28.280]   So now I can hold the device steady till it takes the picture.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:33.880]   Now I have all these best faced, best photo stuff.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.880]   Hmm.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:41.360]   I don't, it doesn't look any better than me.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.360]   Let's see.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.440]   I don't know how to get out of this now.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.440]   I'm stuck.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.440]   There we go.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.440]   What other modes?
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.440]   You got dual camera.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.800]   I still think that's silly, but the MA has that as well.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   What's download?
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.680]   Why is that a mode?
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:57.680]   Download mode?
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.560]   Oh, I can get more animated photo shot and sound.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.440]   Ah, again, this is how they save a little space.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.440]   You don't know.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.680]   I think that's a good response, Sam.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.680]   I can just do.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.720]   Not everybody's going to want golf mode, but if they do, I guess you can get it again.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.200]   It's a fast 13 megapixel camera.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.440]   I actually think that the camera on the MA is more pleasing.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.360]   I think you made the right choice, Gina.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.440]   I'm pretty happy with it.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.440]   No, I don't know.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.880]   Is there an N6 imminent?
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.680]   I mean, there's always the next thing, right?
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.120]   Do we think IO is going to, I think IO is going to yield a watch.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.560]   I don't know that it's going to be a phone this year, but it might be both.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.560]   Right.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.000]   And who knows about a tablet?
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.040]   Another thing, and I bet you you can do this, the Fitbit app works with this phone.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:47.000]   I don't know if they mentioned with the MA, you know, there's the Samsung Health app,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.280]   but the Fitbit app works with the accelerometer in this phone.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:57.000]   So the same thing that the S Health does on the Galaxy will work on the MA, but you have
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.200]   to download the Fitbit app and you can see your steps and distance.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.360]   This is me for today.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.560]   And you can, you know, so that's nice.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.800]   Other apps besides Fitbit apparently will work.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:18.040]   I'm 5,622 steps today and only 5,000 more to go.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.040]   So you like it?
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.040]   You're happy.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.040]   I am.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.040]   I'm pretty happy about it.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.840]   So now the Fitbit app, you still have to think with the Fitbit dongle, right?
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.960]   You're not thinking directly to your phone.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:27.960]   No.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.640]   Or the phone is calculating your phone.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.640]   The phone is calculating.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.640]   The phone is the dongle.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.040]   You no longer need the bracelet.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.440]   That's the phone's an accelerometer.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:39.480]   You just have to carry it with you wherever you go and jig all the way.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:45.240]   Because of the thinking, I always have a dongle plugged in.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.560]   I've got some other computer and I never do the thinking.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.560]   Silly.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.560]   Silly, Silly.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.560]   I'm going to get my video fixed.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.920]   Download Fitbit while you're doing that.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.520]   Yeah, I'll do that.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.520]   So interesting.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:01.160]   I was listening this morning to TNT.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.920]   Of course Comcast is testifying now in front of Congress.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:09.720]   Why it should be allowed to merge with Time Warner and considering they pretty much bought
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.720]   and owned Congress.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.840]   I don't think this is going to be a difficult thing.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.680]   They seem very confident.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:20.360]   Meanwhile, Google is saying, "We should get in the mobile phone business."
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   Comcast announced it wants to do a Wi-Fi ISP.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:32.360]   Google is also getting close to competing with wireless carriers.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   Apparently they're considering offering in areas where they offer Google fiber, a wireless
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.440]   service.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.080]   Maybe that Google Play phone then would really start to sing.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.080]   Yep.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:50.000]   Remember they were in the bidding for the 700 megahertz spectrum released by the television
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.680]   stations a few years ago.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:56.000]   They bid like Pi and what else did they bid?
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.360]   They bid some like mathematical bids.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.360]   Right.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:04.240]   They were serious, they were trying to get the FCC to make rules about the spectrum for
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.640]   whoever bought it that it would be open.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:12.680]   Verizon ended up getting it and Verizon is theoretically hobbled by net neutrality agreements
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.840]   it made when it bought that but of course they ignore them.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:21.360]   The FCC has no will to enforce it so it doesn't really matter.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.360]   It's really a disappointment.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.280]   When that spectrum came up, everyone was like, "Oh, this is great.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.280]   It'll go through walls.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.280]   It'll be really nice."
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.280]   Yeah, it's very low frequency.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.280]   It's low frequency.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.280]   It's low frequency.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:35.000]   You'll be able to do all sorts of stuff with it and then nothing has happened with it.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.600]   People have talked about getting Google in the wireless business since 2006 and I wish
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.120]   they would do it.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.600]   Maybe it has to do with the idea of putting Wi-Fi everywhere.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.120]   It's Wi-Fi is an all 7,000 Starbucks stores.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.320]   It's from Google.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:56.320]   Apparently, this summer it's going to offer other store owners around the country.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.480]   Wi-Fi, it's those Comcasts.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.760]   They're now and they're in a race, right?
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.800]   Right, but that's their goal is to get everybody online.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.800]   Right.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.480]   Yeah, because they make money when people are online.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:15.920]   That's information from the information, Jessica Lesson's new site.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:21.640]   Oh, Google, I was so surprised.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.400]   I saw Google's stock went down and then I realized, "Oh, it went down because they split
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.400]   the stock."
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.280]   Which confused the hell out of people.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.720]   Yeah, it did me.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.720]   I was like, "What?
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.720]   What happened?
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:31.720]   What's the news?"
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.720]   I'm frantically getting online.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.720]   Google's stock, $500.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.720]   Oh, they split it.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:35.960]   Yeah, I was a split.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.960]   It's good.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:37.960]   It was good.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:44.760]   And I don't know why it confuses investors, but so it's 564, but because that's half the
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.560]   price, it's the equivalent of like 1,200 something.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.560]   Right.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.560]   Right.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.560]   The stock has rebounded.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.920]   In fact, it's doing quite well.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.920]   It's up nine bucks today.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:59.920]   We don't really call up cover stock days, but I just...
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.120]   It's good for them though, because when the stock price gets too high, people shy away
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.120]   from buying it.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.120]   Right.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.680]   So I'm surprised they didn't do it sooner.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:11.240]   I mean, the stock's from going up and up and up and they've got to have been feeling
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.240]   the pinch from people just saying, "I don't know if I want to buy a stock that high.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.760]   It seems like it's hit its peak."
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:21.560]   I wish we had somebody who's in all of this stuff, understands this finance stuff, because
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:30.560]   in addition to splitting the stock, they put 330 million new shares of Google into play,
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.040]   but these are non-voting C shares.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.800]   So they're a little less than the A shares.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:42.040]   That's what you're buying on the stock market, a few bucks less.
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:46.200]   But the reason you want these C shares, these non-voting shares, is so you can give them
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:53.480]   to employees without deluding the voting stake of the founders, Paige and Bryn.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:58.520]   Larry Page and Sergey own 56% of the vote through those B shares.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.800]   Those are not traded publicly.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.960]   And each B share is 10 votes.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:10.120]   Eric Schmidt has 8.2% of the B shares.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:14.520]   So this offers more value to employees, but...
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.520]   Not deluding.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.520]   Not deluding.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.520]   ...control by the founders.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.520]   Right.
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.520]   There's not a...
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:25.560]   Sergey and Larry can, if they agree, if their votes go a particular way, override everyone
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.560]   else's.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.520]   That's right, because they get 10 votes per share.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.520]   Right.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.520]   And they've got 56%.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.520]   Right.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:37.800]   And then the C class stocks are so complicated.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.040]   I don't understand all this stuff.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.600]   Anyway, if you do, thank you.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.600]   Good luck to you.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.640]   Better man than I am.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.240]   But that makes sense, right?
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:56.360]   So they did this split, but they also created this new class of non-voting shares, put a
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:00.640]   bunch of them into the market, but also they're going to keep a bunch so that they can reward
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.120]   employees without deluding their power.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.760]   Makes sense.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.760]   Yep.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.760]   Yep.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:11.040]   If Jeff were here, he'd probably do 22 as a number.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:16.000]   That's how long it took the project Loon Balloon to circle the Earth.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.280]   Apparently, that's a record.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.280]   That's incredible.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.280]   It's really fast for a...
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.720]   For a balloon, for a thing that just looks like, you know, I don't know, somebody's sheets
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.080]   flew off in the sky.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.720]   A jellyfish or something.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.680]   A jellyfish, yeah.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:37.760]   So I guess the plant was 33-day revolutions, but the...
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.160]   That must have gotten some good winds.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:47.080]   It enjoyed a few loop-de-loops over the Pacific Ocean before heading east on the winds towards
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:52.800]   Chile and Argentina, then made its way back around near Australia and New Zealand.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.280]   This is from the Google+ project Loon account.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.640]   Along the way it caught a ride on the roaring forties.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:03.320]   That's the strong west-to-east winds in the Southern Hemisphere that act like an autobahn
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.880]   in the sky where our balloons can quickly zoom over oceans to get...
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.240]   Oh, see, that's the problem.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.240]   You're sitting up there.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.240]   You're in the...
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.240]   They're in like the stratosphere or higher and you're at the mercy of the winds a little
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.240]   bit.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:18.320]   They can move them up and down, but you can't move them in any direction.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.920]   At some point, you're going to get over the ocean whether or not doing anybody any good.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:26.360]   So they want to get over the ocean quickly and get back to land.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:32.440]   They're navigating the stratospheric winds 12 miles above the surface of the Earth.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:37.760]   That's far higher than planes or anything else.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.760]   That's cool.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.840]   Yeah, that's really cool.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:41.840]   I don't know.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:42.840]   I'm looking at the flight path though.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:43.840]   It looks like they...
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.840]   It's not super-
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.840]   It's not like they circled Antarctica.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.840]   I don't know if they really circled them.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:47.840]   Oh yeah.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:48.840]   It's not equatorial.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.680]   It's not equatorial, but maybe they were doing distance.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.840]   So I don't know.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.240]   They went a long way.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.000]   They started in New Zealand.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   They went a long way.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   They went a long way.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.640]   It's actually starting its second lap right now.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:02.640]   Ibis 167.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:07.320]   I mean, it went in the third less time than they thought it would go.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.320]   Right.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.320]   Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.320]   It's a lot.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.320]   Yeah, they're moving.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.760]   I bet it's 311,000 miles.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:19.880]   And the wind ranges from two knots to 75 knots, which is very fast.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.800]   So what they're doing, I mean, all of this is a test to see if there's any of this is
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.040]   feasible.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.040]   I would...
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.760]   I'm guessing that this is good news, that it's doing well.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:33.400]   And avoided the polar vortex, you'll be glad in the...
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.600]   You can meet all odds.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.680]   A record setting trip around the earth, or at least around Antarctica.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.520]   Do you want to do a change log, Gina Trapani?
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.000]   Yeah, let's do it.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   All right.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.520]   Well, before we do, we'll do a little Squarespace ad.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.480]   And then the change log is coming up next.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.480]   Gina's back.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.200]   Are you going to do two weeks worth?
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.200]   No.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.200]   I'm just going to do this past week.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.200]   That's it.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.200]   We're being very zen.
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.000]   We just let go of the things we've been...
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.920]   If you weren't there, it doesn't matter.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.920]   You've embraced the stream of just new.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.760]   Yes, we love the stream.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.960]   Our show today brought to you by the simply the best place to start your next website,
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:16.760]   both the best hosting and the best software combined to give you an experience better
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.160]   than anyone else can offer.
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.960]   Squarespace.com, go there and check it out.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.000]   In fact, it's very easy to check it out.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.240]   All you have to do is press that Get Started button and you don't need to give them a credit
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.240]   card.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:35.000]   Just create an account with name and password, name your site, start designing.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.520]   You've got 25 beautiful designer templates to choose from.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:44.680]   Pick a template, but also look at what people have done with it because every Squarespace
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:45.680]   site looks different.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.680]   That's the beauty of this.
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.080]   It's not because you're a master of CSS.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.840]   You don't need to know anything.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:56.600]   You merely need to be able to point and click and you can customize the heck out.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.920]   I got to see what this site is.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:02.400]   This is based on the template front row.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.400]   It's called this mess.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.160]   Oh, it's a it's a band.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.160]   It's a group.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.160]   Okay.
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.560]   I love it.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.400]   This is really this is beautiful.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.560]   The thing is you don't have to know any special code.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:20.080]   Squarespace gives you all the tools that you need to create a beautiful website.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.560]   All sites are mobile responsive.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.160]   That means they look great no matter what size screen you're using.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.480]   You've got all sites have e-commerce enabled.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:33.880]   The best part of all is it's as little as $8 a month with the annual plan.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:37.080]   $8 also gets you e-commerce.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:42.120]   You could sell one product or accept donations per a charity or a school fundraiser, an all
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.680]   cash wedding registry.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:50.000]   If you want to go to the professional plan, $16 a month, you get unlimited bandwidth, unlimited
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.440]   storage, unlimited blogs, unlimited everything.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:56.760]   That's so cool and full business is $24 a month.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.880]   That is really affordable.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:03.000]   With every annual plan, you get a custom domain name free.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.440]   The developer platform is great.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:08.520]   If you do know CSS and you want to do more, they're also innovating in other ways.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:13.560]   They've got these great mobile apps on iOS that make it easier for you to manage your
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:17.840]   blog to post content to review metrics.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.400]   I just love everything Squarespace is doing.

[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.520]   I think what happens is they've got these great engineers and they're just doing cool
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:46.080]   stuff like crazy, just cranking it out.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.600]   Wonderful stuff.

[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.760]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, break out the trumpets.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:11.280]   It's time for the Google change log.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:16.960]   The Google change log.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:20.720]   Thank you, love for many.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:23.080]   Google Play is getting social.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:26.640]   Google has added a new people section to the Play Store app on Android.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.280]   So to get to it, you go tap on the hamburger icon and you select people from the menu and
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:36.320]   there you'll see activity recommendations from your Google+ friends within the Play Store,
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:41.200]   like apps your friends have plus one and reviewed and even recommendations for others
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.880]   to follow on Google+.
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:48.080]   This follows the new activity feed on the web, which I didn't mention in last week's change
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:52.120]   log because I wasn't here, which shows you your reviews and your plus ones in the Play
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.120]   Store.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:57.520]   And that you can get to at play.google.com/store, my play activity.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:03.320]   So just kind of a nice way to see recommendations of what your friends are using the Play Store.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:07.640]   Personally, I would love to see what are all the apps that Leo is running right now and
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.160]   how often.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:13.600]   So I kind of feel like this is kind of a step toward that.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.000]   I don't know if you remember Google Keep.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   I don't know.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   I still use it.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Awesome.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   See that you guys are both.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   And I'm an ever note guy.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   But that's everyone's in Wall Keep is just a really handy thing.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   It's always there.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Easy to use.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.920]   So how do you, so I'm curious, how do you decide, because I use ever know it too, how
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.920]   do you decide when to use keep and when to use ever know?
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.560]   If I'm going to keep it, I use ever know.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:34.920]   And if I just want to do a grocery list, I'll do it.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.560]   Oh, it's like the four Lain notes.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:42.560]   Well, Google gave the app an upgrade this week, new features and a fresh design.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.720]   The new version lets user search for text that's printed in images.
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.320]   That's not, it just cans the text.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.960]   Never know it does that too, but it's nice.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:50.960]   Yeah, it's really nice.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.880]   And you can easily copy existing notes and you can restore deleted notes from the trash
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.080]   can.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:59.040]   And the app just got a design refresh to the latest and greatest their mobile design.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:05.000]   There's also a new action bar that changes colors, depending on the color of the note.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.880]   We actually had this great discussion with the tumbler Android developer last night on
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:10.880]   all about Android.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.320]   Just talking about how this is kind of a new trend in mobile design where you have contextual
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.280]   clues like based on the content.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:22.160]   So he was saying in pocket casts, you know, that the scrubber is the color of the album
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.680]   art, picks a color from the album art and shows it, you know, color is the scrubber that
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.680]   way.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.560]   So you have these kind of contextual clues around the content and could keep is doing
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:35.000]   the similar thing that the action bar changes color based on the note.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.080]   And finally, this isn't really a change log item because this hasn't actually shipped,
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:44.320]   but I wanted to mention it screenshots that are allegedly a new Gmail user interface floating
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:48.960]   around geek.com published them first and they show a pretty radical redesign.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:55.480]   Some new features, new folders added to those, you know, the social and promotion tags.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.640]   They're called travel and finance.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:01.640]   You get the ability to snooze messages kind of say, Hey, mark this as unread and again
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.680]   in a day or two.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.200]   Marky messages as done.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:08.440]   And the new design is kind of flat with round avatars.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:13.560]   It kind of looks like Google's answer to mailbox actually, which which Dropbox owns, which actually
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:14.920]   just came out for Android.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:18.680]   So I don't know if we're actually going to see this redesign, but it's pretty, it's pretty
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.680]   different.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:24.800]   And I'm interested to see as someone who makes it to do list app what this kind of marking
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.880]   is done and, you know, snoozing ability is in Gmail.
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.800]   I'd like to see that come to fruition.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.040]   Very cool.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.040]   That's all I got.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.040]   It's quick.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.040]   It's easy.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.800]   It's the Google change.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:38.800]   So thank you.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   Sure.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   Annie.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:46.240]   Did you see the US Air Force?
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.320]   We covered this this morning on TNT last night on Tech News tonight.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:53.920]   The US Air Force is, I'm not sure I'm happy about this testing Google Glass and building
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.720]   apps for battlefield use.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:59.080]   I want to see a bunch of glass holes marching into battle.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.920]   Doesn't seem military grade.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:02.920]   Does it really?
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.960]   Well, it's basically a heads up display, right?
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.720]   I mean, that's what the pilot's used.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.720]   I feel like they could do, I don't know, something.
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.320]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:15.160]   Okay, glass, take a picture of that guy over there.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.160]   That's the enemy.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.760]   Okay, glass, show me my closest target.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.080]   I could see a heads up display.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.440]   This is not a heads up display.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:27.000]   It's a second screen above your eyebrow.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:33.160]   The Air Force says its positive attributes are low power, low footprint.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.160]   It's totally above the eyes.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.920]   Doesn't block images or hinder vision.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:36.920]   So I guess they don't.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.840]   That's what they want.
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:44.560]   That's a second lieutenant Anthony Easton, a behavioral scientist on the Batman team.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:49.280]   That's the name of the team testing the glasses at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:53.160]   It's the 711th human performance wing.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.960]   Let's hope battles only last six hours.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:00.840]   Well, that's one issue and you got to carry an Android phone.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:05.200]   So apparently I hear that the troops now are very smartphone enabled.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.200]   They like those smartphones.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:10.680]   Yeah, if you lost in Kandahar, you fire up Google Maps.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:11.680]   Say where's the base?
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:12.680]   Help me home.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:13.680]   Navigate.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.680]   They're Starbucks nearby.
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.720]   Yeah, might want to play a little ingress while you're out there.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:20.120]   Guys, I'm just suggesting you could just take over some bases.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.040]   So far, I love that picture you're looking at too.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.840]   You've got the three humans and a mannequin.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:29.480]   The humans, which are a little nerdery, I would say, and plus the guy in full battle
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.400]   dress, you know, it's like, yeah.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.360]   But that guy is in plastic dummy.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:40.960]   So the glass is not a silver bullet for many of the Air Force's needs, according to the
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.280]   Air Force.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.840]   They obtained two pairs of glass through the Glass Explorer program.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:51.960]   They tweeted, if I had glass, I would kill the enemy.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.560]   They did not know they didn't know they didn't.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:54:01.600]   The New York City Police Department is evaluating glass, their intelligence and analytics unit.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:05.280]   Well, should I, should I frisk that guy over there?
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.280]   Come on.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.760]   What do you say, glass?
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.680]   Virgin Atlantic is testing glass.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.000]   We don't know how.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.800]   Not for pilots, I pray.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:20.080]   The US Navy is testing smart glasses, but not Google smart glasses.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.080]   They're doing goggles.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:27.320]   I mean, the truth is that glass is interesting and could be potentially useful in any job
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.400]   that involves being out in the field and some capacity, right?
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.400]   We don't know.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:32.480]   I don't know if they're saying combat.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:36.400]   They might be saying, you know, the quartermaster is going to use it to take inventory.
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.000]   We don't know what they're going to do.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.120]   Glass Explorer programs.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.120]   This is Google's statement.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.600]   There's, first of all, I want to say we are, you know, we're not in any way working with
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:44.600]   the Air Force here.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.520]   The Glass Explorer program includes people from all walks of life, including doctors,
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.560]   firefighters and parents.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:54.880]   Anyone can apply to become a Glass Explorer if he or she is a US resident and over the
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.880]   age of 18.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:59.120]   In other words, I think Google wants to distant themselves a little bit, saying we know this.
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:02.280]   We're not doing Defense Department research here.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.280]   They borrowed them.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.280]   They bought some.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.080]   We're just the tools.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:10.000]   We're just the tools.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.720]   So I think maybe that story's a little overblown.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:12.720]   Of course they're testing them.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.720]   In fact, if they weren't, it'd be like, why not?
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:21.360]   Google did try to trademark the word glass.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:29.600]   USPTO in uncharacteristically uncooperative said, wait a minute.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:35.080]   What on there?
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:41.000]   The trademark examiner responded to Google with two main objections.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:47.240]   One that the trademark's kind of similar to other existing or pending computer software
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:49.080]   trademarks containing the word glass.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:53.160]   I think smart glass, isn't that a Microsoft trademark?
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.160]   Creating a risk of consumer confusion.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:58.960]   They also say glass, you know, it's just descriptive.
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:03.080]   Words that merely describe a product are not trademarkable.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:06.000]   Absent a showing of acquired distinctiveness.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.440]   For instance, a company that makes salsa can't say, we trademark spicy sauce.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.680]   That's a description.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:19.520]   I mean, this is not like a slap in the face to Google, but you're going to apply for it.
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.960]   They're disputing it and they're going back and forth.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:26.440]   In fact, they say, by the way, there's no glass in Google Glass, so it isn't descriptive
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.440]   at all.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:31.720]   Yeah, but think of all, I mean, the glass companies out, somebody else has tried this
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:32.720]   probably to--
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.240]   It seems very generic.
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.240]   It's really generic.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.240]   It's generic.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:40.040]   If you're going to pick a really generic brand name like this, don't expect to get a trademark.
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.040]   Right.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.080]   Yeah, and they trademark Google Glass.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:46.280]   Oh, so it's not that they don't have Google Glass.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   They have Google Glass.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:49.280]   They just couldn't get glass.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.680]   And I got to say, the patent office is in the right here, I think.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:52.680]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:56.040]   Not that I'm a lawyer, but this is just common sense.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.880]   Right.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:02.200]   I saw this, and I thought this was kind of interesting.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:07.200]   I loved to get your take.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:10.200]   You were talking about the Play Store.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:11.520]   And I saw this article that said the top paid app on the Google Play Store was uncovered
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.520]   as a fake.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.440]   Not exactly.
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:18.160]   It's a program called Virus Shield $3.99.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:26.160]   I guess it's a fake because it's an antivirus program, but it doesn't do anything.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:27.920]   It merely changes--
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:28.920]   The shield.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.520]   The shield is a checkmark.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:32.520]   To a checkmark.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:34.000]   You're protected.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.840]   Chris Dibona, I love it, posted on his Google Plus.
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:40.080]   We know Chris very well was former host of Floss Weekly.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:44.920]   He's the head of director of open source at Google.
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:48.520]   He wrote, and I think it's still somewhat true, no major.
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:50.200]   He wrote this a couple of years ago.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:54.520]   No major cell phone is a virus problem in the traditional sense that Windows and some
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.120]   Mac machines have seen.
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:59.200]   There have been some little things, but they haven't gotten very far because of the user's
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:03.280]   sandboxing models and the nature of the underlying kernels.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:06.480]   No Linux desktop is a real virus problem either.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:13.120]   He says virus companies are playing on your fears to try to sell you BS protection software.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:18.680]   For any mobile operating system, including BlackBerry and iOS, they are charlatans, says
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:24.000]   Dibona, and scammers, if you work for a company selling virus protection for Android, Rimmer
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.400]   and iOS, you should be ashamed of yourself.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.600]   Chris doesn't hold back.
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.600]   Wow.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.400]   I love that about him.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.160]   He says what he thinks.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:40.080]   He's, wow.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:42.440]   To be fair to Chris, this is from November 2011.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:43.440]   Right.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.240]   But I don't think things have changed significantly.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:48.040]   Not as far as viruses are concerned.
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.040]   Certainly there's vulnerabilities.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:53.680]   We're seeing those currently today, but it's not necessarily a virus problem.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:59.160]   There are malware issues, certainly, because you can download an app, especially if you
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.760]   don't download it from the Google Play Store, you know, a reputable Play Store, or if you
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:05.640]   just find it online and sideload it onto your phone.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:06.720]   Yeah, guess what?
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:07.880]   You're putting yourself at risk.
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:08.880]   So don't do that.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.080]   Sideloading is very dangerous.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:11.280]   Don't uncheck that box.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.280]   That's right.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:13.280]   Check it, I guess.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.280]   But not viruses, is my point.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:21.680]   I guess that's, and I kept thinking, boy, viruses are going to be an issue on these
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:22.680]   platforms.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:23.680]   They're always connected.
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:27.040]   They're everything as a bad guy that you would want.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.680]   They're always connected.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.760]   They're always on.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:37.280]   Now, I don't see virus shield in the top paid Android apps.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.280]   Maybe is it still around?
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.280]   They removed it, I believe.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.160]   Yeah, they must have even removed it.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.160]   Because it doesn't do anything.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:47.680]   But if I do a search for virus, there's probably still, I know ESET offers an antivirus.
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:53.120]   And people load them because they think, well, it's a platform.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.120]   I need a virus scanner.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.400]   I need a virus protection on there.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:58.280]   And we've recommended Lookout.
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:02.360]   Mostly what these, at best what these do, they don't do the same thing an antivirus does
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.360]   on a desktop machine.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:08.160]   At best what they do is they go through a database of known malware and see if you've
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.160]   got it.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:12.480]   And when you download a new app, they check it against that database to make sure it's
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.480]   not known malware.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:17.400]   But even by that, by itself, it's fairly useful.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.080]   Google has built in that capability.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.080]   Right.
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:24.720]   And the first time you download an app on a new Android phone, it says, would you like
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.160]   us to check for malware for a future?
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.080]   And of course, I'm sure you all said, yes.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.240]   Is what Google does sufficient?
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.320]   I think it's not much different from what any of these other ones do.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:38.680]   Look at all these Norton, McAfee, ESET.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.800]   They all offer Lookout.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:48.520]   These are all antivirus programs for Android and Sophos.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.760]   And I mean, these are good companies.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.760]   They're not scammers.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:58.200]   They're not scammers, but I think they are playing on a fear that we have, right?
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.360]   I should also point out that almost all of these are free.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.360]   McAfee's free.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.360]   Lookouts free.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.640]   The average user, I wonder if they know the difference between malware.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.680]   We talk about malware and things like that.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.680]   They don't know.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.680]   It's a virus.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:17.280]   It's the first thing that I'm asked is frequently when somebody gets a smartphone is, should
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.920]   I have an antivirus?
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:24.000]   Because they know it's a computer.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.400]   Most of these, like here's Norton, it's free, but for 30 bucks a year, you can get the premium
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:34.440]   version, which offers more protection, it says.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:38.200]   And this is often the case, remote lock and a race.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.760]   But that's built in the Android now too.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.760]   You're running Google edition.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.760]   You can just-
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.480]   Even on my M and M, you have to download it.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.480]   But what is it called?
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:47.480]   The device manager?
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.480]   The device manager.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.480]   Then it works.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:54.320]   I would guess it works on any Android phone, right?
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.680]   I immediately downloaded and installed it.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.760]   And it looks just like Find My iPhone does on iOS.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.880]   It knows where your phones are.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.040]   Pinpoints them.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:06.720]   It allows you to ring them, lock them or erase them.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.720]   Yep.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.720]   Really helpful.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:13.720]   Real alarming though, that one of the top paid apps that was a virus.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.720]   It did nothing.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.720]   It wasn't caught.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.720]   You know what I mean?
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:17.720]   It makes me worried.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.800]   Yeah, it makes me think, well, there's probably a lot of malicious software out there.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:26.160]   That's not one of the top paid apps that, you know, malicious, not just not doing anything,
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.160]   which is what this thing did.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:33.280]   Well, I guess what I would say, and certainly it's what I tell everybody, is you probably
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.600]   don't need an antivirus.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.800]   You should turn on the Google scanner.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.840]   You should not say, I can download from anywhere but the Play Store.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:47.440]   And with all that having been said, Google does not vet every app on the Play Store.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:52.960]   Not like Apple does, but it's a false sense of security, I think, on the iTunes store,
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.560]   if you say, oh, we'll see Apple that checks every app.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.720]   They literally have to look at tens of thousands of apps a day.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.000]   Stuff gets by all the time.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   Sure.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.520]   Same thing happens on iOS.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.520]   No doubt.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:10.320]   So it's a foolish thing to assume, well, because it's in the store, it's safe on either platform.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.920]   Take software from known good sources.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.000]   At least this wasn't malicious.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   It wasn't like this software.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   Did anything bad?
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   Right.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   It took your money.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   It took your money.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.240]   That's pretty expensive.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:29.440]   I mean, for a four dollar app being in the top 10, it's a lot.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:35.000]   That makes me think a lot of people bought it.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.240]   Have you heard the rumor about Android Silver?
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.240]   This doesn't sound bogus.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.280]   These are apparently slides that were leaked, internal slides that were leaked.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.560]   One of them is dated over a year ago.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.360]   So this might be really old information.
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.880]   But yeah, Android Silver is a rumor purportedly.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:04:01.640]   It's a new program that Google basically blesses four or five handsets, which run a pure version
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:05.440]   of Android or Google experience with very few customizations.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:09.560]   And they're set up in kind of a special area in stores.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:15.200]   And employees are trained by Google to sell these devices to customers, to normals, and
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.800]   to help them set up their Google account, transfer their data.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.920]   It's supposed to be kind of like the premium, easy Android experience.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.480]   We were talking about this on all about Android last night.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:27.760]   And it seems like if this is true, which it may not be, again, this is kind of dated
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.280]   information and these are leaked slides.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.280]   It's just a rumor.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:36.320]   But if this is true, it seems like this would be Google's way of exposing the pure Google
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.760]   experience to regular consumers the way that they do in the Nexus line for power users
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.600]   in the Play Store.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.760]   Maybe I was looking at it as more of a-- I know it doesn't-- it really does reference
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.200]   the consumer, I think, in the slides and things.
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:51.160]   But I was looking at it more like, OK, this is how they're going to pitch this to business
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.800]   users or businesses.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:57.880]   So it's not just that you get the phone, but you get the phone plus support, which is what
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.400]   a lot of businesses need.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:03.160]   They want to be able to have their users-- I think one of the things that it had in there
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.080]   was replacement options.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.520]   And maybe they would charge for this, right?
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:12.440]   So they charge a company, an extra $5 a user, kind of like a license thing.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:16.920]   And they get all of these additional benefits like support and replacement devices when they're
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:17.920]   lost.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:21.840]   So to me, I looked at this and said, oh, this is a business enterprise play, clearly.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.640]   But it doesn't really say that in the slides.
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:29.120]   And plus, it's a year ago, Android was still suffering.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:32.320]   And you can make an argument that they're getting over it now, but they were really suffering
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:38.280]   from the fragmentation issue because of all the different platforms out there.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:44.560]   And now, people are fairly standardized, at least, on jelly bean-ish type or getting
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.960]   close to jelly bean standardization out there.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:51.400]   So this may have been a way for them to try to address the fragmentation problem.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:54.560]   A year ago, and now it's like, ah, what kind of over that?
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.800]   We're not too worried about it.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.480]   So I don't know.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.480]   These things change, boy.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.040]   I can tell you I'm reading Fred Vogelstein's book.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.080]   I've mentioned this a few times before.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.800]   Stop me if you've heard it.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.440]   He's a wired writer who wrote the book Dogfight about Apple and Google.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.200]   It is great.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.800]   And what you learn from it is-- well, first of all, it's got a lot of behind the scenes
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:14.800]   stuff I didn't know.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.800]   As we're covering all these, this whole thing starting from the release of the iPhone in
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.800]   2007.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.480]   There's a lot of news response to that.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:27.040]   And there's fun stuff like the fact that Andy Rubin, when they first bought Android,
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:31.560]   to create either a Google operating system or Google phone, nobody really knew.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:35.720]   Andy Rubin drove a Ferrari because he'd made some money.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:39.080]   And he wasn't allowed to park it in the Google parking lot because at that time, Google
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.920]   did not allow fancy cars in their parking lot.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.960]   Even Larry and Sergey drove a Prius.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:49.760]   But you also learned that Google was very ambivalent about the whole thing.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.280]   That Larry and Sergey wanted to build a phone.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.280]   Eric didn't.
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:59.800]   Eric said, no, we should have-- Google should be everywhere.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.520]   And of course, they were doing very well on the iPhone at the time.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:09.880]   And so Andy Rubin, so as not to make waves, kept the Android project basically secret.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:14.560]   They even had their own cafe built in that area of the Googleplex so that people working
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:19.160]   on Android wouldn't eat with other people and other people wouldn't eat with them.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:23.400]   But then when the time came to release a phone and they went to the-- at the time it was
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:28.600]   Victor and Dutra running the apps for mobile.
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:33.280]   And they went to VIX team and said, OK, hey, we would really like Gmail and Calendar and
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.080]   Maps for our new Android phone.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.600]   And they said, you're not on the road map.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.840]   We didn't know anything about this just two years before you get anything.
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.200]   So there is a lot of ambivalence at Google about what to do.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:48.080]   And so if you project from this book to now, it wouldn't be at all surprising to me that
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.640]   a year ago, Google might have thought this was a good idea.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.640]   But now they don't.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:54.000]   I mean, there was a lot of back and forth.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.120]   This is a great-- What's the name of that book?
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.120]   It's called Dog Fight?
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.120]   Dog Fight.
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.360]   I'm listening to it on Audible, but you can get it in the bookstore.
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:01.360]   Oh, good.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.360]   I was just looking for it on Audible.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:03.360]   So you answered that question.
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.360]   Fred Vogelstein.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.360]   He writes it.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:10.560]   You read-- I know you guys read the excerpt that was published and wired, which was the
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:17.800]   story of the Apple engineer going to the iPhone announcement that Steve Jobs was doing.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:21.800]   And I was taking a drink every time a demo worked because there was-- it was supposed
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.240]   to be a 90-minute demo of all the features in the iPhone.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.640]   And this was a very early prototype.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.720]   It barely worked.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.920]   They had what they called the golden path.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.680]   You couldn't do email and then surf.
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.560]   You could surf and then do email.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:41.280]   You had to walk this very fine line in the demo, do it exactly right because at any point
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:43.360]   it would crash.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.440]   There were only 10, I think, iPhones at the time.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.200]   They had four of them on the stage.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.440]   So if one failed, you could immediately go to number two.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:55.040]   They programmatically painted five bars on every one of the phones for reception, not
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:59.760]   because they worried about reception because AT&T had put a cell site on backstage, but
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.560]   because the radios crashed periodically.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.120]   And what they didn't want you to be doing is looking at the phone and see the radio go
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.120]   "Bzzt, bzzt."
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.920]   They didn't want you to see the reboot.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.600]   So everything was painted five bars.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   That's all in this book.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.600]   It's really good.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.440]   Wow, that sounds amazing.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:17.440]   It is.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.880]   Now Chad started and got bored.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:24.600]   It's so funny because part of me thought that it was because all of these stories had
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:29.480]   been told in other books because he quoted the Isaacson book and he quoted--
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:30.480]   Yes.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.200]   You know, I should really go get this from the source.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.840]   I'm tired of him stealing from it.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:38.880]   And now hearing you talk about how all of this is fresh, I really want to go back and
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:39.880]   stuff.
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.880]   We didn't know.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:45.720]   We had no idea, for instance, about the ambivalence within Google about making a phone.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.720]   And I have that first Google phone, the G1.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.160]   They actually had to pay-- when they created open handset lines--
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.160]   The G1.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.160]   The G1 wreaked ambivalence.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.160]   Yeah, it did.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:57.160]   It did.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.160]   It did.
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.160]   I had a slide out keyboard.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:03.120]   They were so unsure about the idea of typing on the screen.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.240]   They said, "No, we better put a keyboard in this."
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:10.880]   But oh, it's just-- no, I thought it was full of really interesting stuff.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.880]   And I covered this, Chad.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.400]   I was here at the time.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.400]   So interesting that they ran the ambival and about it.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:19.920]   Well, because looking at it now, of course, hindsight is always 20/20.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:20.920]   It's like this, of course.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.920]   Oh, sure.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:22.920]   This is their biggest business.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:23.920]   They're one of their biggest businesses.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.920]   Oh, sure.
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:25.920]   But man, wow.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.120]   Between this book and the Twitter book, I really like all of this.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:36.280]   And all-- any sort of romanticism that I had around the tech industry is completely gone.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.000]   It's no one knows what to do.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   It seems like everyone--
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   Oh, what's that?
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.760]   And everyone's like, this is really difficult.
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:46.640]   Like, where everyone's head is just hitting the ceiling, it's-- yeah, it's really messy.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:47.640]   It's kind of--
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.400]   And making the iPhone was a very difficult task.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.680]   Nobody had ever done any of the things that Steve insisted on.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:58.120]   A lot of credit to Steve Jobs because he basically forced this thing to happen.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:04.520]   Yeah, you really see that you need a visionary to truly say, I don't care if you don't want
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:10.360]   to spend six weeks of your life working on something that you think is a detail.
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.640]   It's a feature for me.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.040]   Forceful visionary.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.440]   It's very interesting.
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:22.600]   Anyway, so it could very well be Android Silver was somebody's good idea.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:23.600]   It doesn't mean anything.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.600]   Right.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:25.600]   It could have been slides made.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.600]   It doesn't mean anything.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:27.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.400]   It's something called Signature because Windows computers were so crapped up, they tried to
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:37.480]   get manufacturers to do the Windows Signature Edition without any crap where with better
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.480]   services.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.440]   Much of what this Android Silver was.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.440]   And nobody bit.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.240]   Nobody-- Visio made some.
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.760]   Nobody made any.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.640]   It was a flop.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.160]   Android TV in the news.
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:55.080]   And of course, Amazon is kind of pushing this along by the release of their fire TV.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.280]   I reviewed it yesterday before you buy it.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.280]   I've been playing with it.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.640]   It's pretty cool.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.640]   I like it.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.880]   It's another set top box.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.000]   You know, I don't know how many you need.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.880]   800 ways to get Netflix.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:07.880]   But I like it.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:11.200]   It has one feature that I really like, which is as a microphone on their mouth.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.120]   And you don't say-- you don't do OK Siri, OK Goo.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.120]   You don't say anything.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.840]   You just say a couple of words, the title you're looking for.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:24.480]   Now, unfortunately, and some have slammed Amazon for this, the search only searches Amazon's
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.480]   own properties.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:26.920]   It doesn't search Netflix.
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:29.440]   But I think that's probably because Netflix doesn't give more way to search.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:34.160]   I don't know if there's an API for-- I know there's not an API, a public API for searching
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:35.520]   Netflix data.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.160]   So I'm not sure I blame Amazon for that one.
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.160]   But it does a very good job.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.640]   It's understood me every time.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:41.440]   Does it pass games?
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.440]   Is the microphone always on?
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.120]   Do you have to click a button to OK?
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.040]   Well, that's an interesting point, by the way.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.400]   You click the button-- it's very much like Siri.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.280]   You click and hold it while you're talking.
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.560]   And then you let go when you say search.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:13:01.520]   But according to R's Technica, Amazon keeps the voice recordings to learn your voice and
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:06.080]   how you speak to improve the accuracy of results.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.440]   And then deleting voice recordings made to grade your experience.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.640]   I don't know where they keep them.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.560]   They must keep them on their servers.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:19.200]   But there is an entry that will allow you to delete it, I guess it's in the settings,
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:25.400]   in the voice control options.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.400]   It works pretty well.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.440]   They say they keep all users-- oh, man, no, no, I'm sorry.
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:36.400]   That's Apple keeps all users' Siri-related voice data for up to two years.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:42.320]   Google Now and Connect probably do the same, but there are no deletion options.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.320]   So having--
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.840]   So it's delete my current voice recordings.
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:45.840]   It's not--
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:46.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:47.840]   Don't ever-- don't serve them.
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:48.840]   No.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:49.840]   OK, yeah, don't you?
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:55.640]   So if you searched for Debbie Des Dallas and you don't want anybody to know you searched
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.240]   for that, you could delete that right there.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.160]   So kind of like your history.
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.160]   It is history.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.160]   Yeah, it's voices history.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.040]   It is supposed to browse browsing history or something.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.680]   That's an interesting question mark.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.560]   So what do we know about Android TV?
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:10.560]   Well, isn't it?
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.280]   Yeah, kind of similar.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.440]   Like the Amazon Fire TV, it's going to have games.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.800]   Because you know what Amazon is-- the Amazon product is an Android device.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.240]   It's a quad core Qualcomm 600 processor.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:26.520]   We know that from the IFixit tear down with a dedicated GPU.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:30.880]   It's got two gigs of RAM, which is a lot for an Android device that helps with the speed
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.840]   and performance.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:38.960]   So I imagine Android TV from Google will be very similar.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:39.960]   But what do we know?
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:42.800]   This is-- the Verge has leaked screenshots, I guess.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.440]   Still unclear how this is different from Google TV.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.240]   Well, I don't think there's any pass through, right?
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.400]   Google TV was-- a lot of that was about cable pass through.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.400]   Which I loved.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.400]   Which I hated.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.400]   I don't use it.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:56.400]   OK.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.400]   That's OK.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:58.400]   But my Xbox One works the same way.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:01.560]   And that means I can be watching something and overlay on top of it.
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.160]   I mean, I don't like it because I'm a cord cutter, right?
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.480]   So I don't-- it doesn't do me any good.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:06.480]   You got nothing to pass through.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.480]   I've got nothing to pass through.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.480]   It's not that I don't like it.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.480]   It's a cool feature, but I don't use it.
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:13.680]   I got my Tivo hook to the cable passing through the Xbox One.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.280]   It all goes into my TV.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:19.320]   That means I can, without changing anything, just kind of route all sorts of stuff.
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.320]   Right.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.320]   Right.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.320]   So Android TV won't do that.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.320]   That makes sense.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.320]   Yeah, that's what I read anyway.
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.320]   I don't fire TV is not a pass through.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:31.160]   And also, I think the interface, even though it's going to be Android, I think the interface
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:36.560]   is going to be quite different from what I've read on Gigahome and other places.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:41.480]   A simplified-- you know, what I was kind of hoping was that they would just morph Google
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:44.480]   TV into like Jelly Bean, right?
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.600]   So like, instead of having a platform that you have to design--
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.600]   Oh, wouldn't that be cool?
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:49.600]   --you just designed for Jelly Bean.
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.960]   Have a lean back experience in Jelly Bean available.
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.240]   Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.400]   And that's what I was hoping for.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:55.400]   But we'll see.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.400]   It doesn't look like this is it.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:00.400]   They want to keep it really simple and allow people to, you know, like you said, kind of
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:05.000]   type something in or speak something in possibly and just have it kind of--
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   That's what's interesting.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.160]   I mean, in this slide from the Verge, if this is accurate, there is a microphone.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:13.280]   And a Google Now style search bar.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.720]   So I would expect that in there.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:16.720]   Yep.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.360]   The real question is how does this affect cast?
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.360]   What the hell to do with it?
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.360]   What the hell to do with it?
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.360]   Oh, Chromecast.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.960]   Well, Chromecast, which is one product, but I was talking to one of the product managers
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.400]   down at Google about this the other day.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.720]   And it seems like everything's going to be cast.
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.880]   So Chromecast is one product, right?
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.600]   And then cast, though, is like the overarching brand.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:39.920]   So there'll be Chromecast, TVcast, something else cast.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:40.920]   And--
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.120]   But this won't be cast.
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:43.120]   Right.
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.200]   It doesn't appear like it's cast.
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.520]   So how does that-- how do I understand?
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:49.360]   It seems to be very competitive with everything that they've got going on right now.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:53.640]   So now there's going to be Google TV, there's going to be Chromecast or the cast family
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.840]   of products, and Android TV.
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:57.840]   Mm.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:04.720]   Yeah, I don't think Google TV is too long for this world with Android TV.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.720]   But it's true.
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:06.720]   We were talking about that a little bit of it last night.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.720]   How does this fit with Chromecast?
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:12.640]   It seems like they're still setting up for that Chrome versus Android dichotomy there.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.000]   But one of the good points that Jason made last night was that they announced that a
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.800]   feature at Google I/O last year that allows-- that gives APIs for developers to-- to
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.640]   search APIs into content, into apps.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:30.600]   So that gives something like Android TV the ability to do for, you know, streaming content,
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:34.160]   what it does for web pages, and that you could do a search on Android TV and it could
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:40.280]   search within apps in one interface, you know, the Netflix and the HBO Go and the whatever,
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.240]   all the different-- the different kinds of apps.
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.680]   So that's what I really would like to see.
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:46.920]   And in that way, it would be different than what, you know, the Fire TV is doing right
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:50.400]   now, which is just searching, or at least with voice search anyway, just searching the
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.640]   Amazon library.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.640]   Mm-hmm.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:18:02.360]   You know, one interesting thing, Kosh has made his all cast work with Amazon's TV, Fire
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.360]   TV, which--
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.360]   So you can cast to Fire TV from all cast.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.360]   Right, because the cast capabilities are built--
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:11.360]   It's dialed.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:20.320]   So Amazon Fire TV supports dial, which is the standard-- the open standard that Google
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:23.320]   Chromecast sort of uses.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.120]   It's like dial plus.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:31.680]   Yeah, so that's why I can do things like from YouTube, I can stream directly to my Visio
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:37.800]   co-star, which is a Google TV device, but it's not really cast compliant, so to speak.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.800]   So that's confusing.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.800]   It is confusing.
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:45.160]   It's also streamed from Chromecast, from any, I think almost any Chromecast compatible device,
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:49.200]   I can stream to my LG TV, which is really interesting.
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.200]   That's dial.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.200]   I'm sure that's dialed with DLNA.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:52.200]   It's got to be dialed.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.000]   Yeah, because they didn't have it back then when I got my TV.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   Right.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   Yeah, DLNA.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   Dial and DLNA are different things, but they're related.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   I am related.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.920]   I think dial is more closely related to what Chromecast does.
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:03.920]   Yes.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.160]   DLNA is more of like a searchable network thing.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.160]   Right.
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.160]   It's like AirPlay.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.160]   Exactly.
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.160]   Then what about UPNP?
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:13.160]   All right, never mind.
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:14.160]   Forget it.
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.760]   Forget I mentioned it.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.160]   Bonjour.
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.160]   Privacy channel.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:25.720]   Okay, I'm curious about what you guys think of this because Quartz got all hot and bothered
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:30.700]   because of Google's sneaky new privacy change on iOS.
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:33.520]   I think this is just great and a convenience.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:38.640]   If you're logged in Gmail on iOS, then you're also logged into everything else.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:46.560]   YouTube, Chrome, Drive, Maps, just automatically you sign into one, you sign into a mall.
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.360]   I think that's nice.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:53.480]   But according to Leo Marani writing in Quartz, it's a sneaky new privacy change that just
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:58.720]   allows Google to gather more information about you because now you're instantly logged into
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:19:59.720]   YouTube.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.720]   That means you can't really use YouTube anonymously.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.240]   You can't use Maps anonymously.
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:07.000]   Google's going to be collecting information on all of those tools.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.080]   And this comes from their unified privacy policy, which they did a couple of years ago.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.080]   Right.
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.560]   This is the software manifestation of the unified privacy policy.
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.440]   They don't do it on Android or I guess they do.
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.720]   All you have to do is log into Android with your Google account and everything works, right?
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:21.720]   Yep.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.720]   You just say, "I want to access..."
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:25.480]   If you have multiple accounts, I want to access with this Google account.
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:29.720]   Occasionally I'll watch a new program and I'll say, "Which Google account do you want to
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:30.720]   use?"
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:33.240]   Even though I only have one, and I select that account and it goes on.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.080]   So you do have the first time.
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:40.080]   Now everything on my Android phone, all the Google services share with each other.
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:45.560]   That sync tab when you go into your account settings is getting longer and longer.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:46.560]   All the things.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.560]   What do you want to sync?
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:48.560]   Do you want to sync everything?
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:49.560]   No.
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.560]   Yes.
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:51.560]   Yes.
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:55.920]   So I do notice when I went to Google.com today that it said privacy and terms were updated.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:56.920]   So I guess...
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:00.080]   And those are always so fun to read.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.080]   I guess I have...
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.080]   And that's not enough for you to read.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.080]   You've got some reading to do.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:07.240]   I wish they'd put just a little new next to whatever's new.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:11.080]   Here's one modified March 31st.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:14.680]   I can't read.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:15.920]   I can't do it.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:16.920]   I'll fall asleep on you.
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.600]   You say you do like a diff.
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:19.600]   Oh, Jesus.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:20.600]   Yeah, I miss it.
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:21.600]   There you go.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.920]   I need a Python script stat.
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.640]   Let's do a diff on these terms of services.
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:28.640]   That's a one-liner example.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:31.000]   It's like just give me the plain English version of what changed.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000]   Yeah, just put...
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   That's what they do.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.080]   It's nice on the permissions, on Android Play.
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.080]   It's very nice.
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.080]   This is new.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.080]   This is new.
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:40.080]   Yep.
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.640]   Please tell me what's new.
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:42.640]   I know.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:45.640]   We'll take your second-born children as well.
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:46.640]   Yeah, right.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:50.560]   It could be buried in there as well as your right arm.
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.560]   The below terms...
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.360]   Okay, this is what changed.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.000]   The Google terms of service.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.200]   The below terms are effective April 14th, 2014.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:03.840]   To review previous versions, click here so you could do a diff if you want.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.400]   Okay.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:06.400]   Fire up the diff.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.400]   Yeah, there's the comparison.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.000]   Okay.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.600]   Is there on the page?
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:19.480]   So when you say, under April 14th, there's a link to a comparison and it's a pretty straightforward
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:20.480]   diff.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.480]   Okay.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:25.280]   With the new stuff in green and the old stuff crossed out and red.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.560]   Okay, cool.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:31.040]   There's very little, very few changes here.
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:33.480]   Won't worry about it.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.840]   Google, I trust you.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.640]   You're fine.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.640]   Okay.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.200]   Here's this is green.
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:43.640]   Our automated systems analyze your content, including emails, to provide you personally
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:48.640]   relevant product features such as customized search results, tailored advertising and spam
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:50.640]   and malware detection.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:54.960]   This analysis occurs as the content is sent received and when it is stored.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:55.960]   We knew that, right?
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.360]   Please do more of that Google.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.360]   That's good.
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.360]   I like it.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.360]   That's Google now.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.360]   All right.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.360]   That's like the definition of Google now.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.360]   Mind?
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:07.440]   I mean, that was almost what was in my, I know you guys probably talked about the birthday
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:08.440]   of Gmail.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:09.440]   We did.
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:10.440]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.200]   And I went back to my original Gmail email that I got when I signed up.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.200]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.200]   And that's right there.
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:19.240]   It said that in the in 2006 or whenever I signed up, it said almost those exact same
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:20.240]   words.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.240]   So.
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:24.440]   They've never hidden the fact that we are scanning the email looking for advertising.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.440]   Nope.
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:29.640]   That's or you know, looking for what to send you advertising for.
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:32.240]   They've never, they've never done otherwise.
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.880]   All right.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:39.640]   I'm Google paid 1.15 billion for ways according to the CEO.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.000]   That's, that's official.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.240]   And, but this is the interesting kind of between the lines thing here.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:49.960]   It sounds like he didn't want to sell.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:57.880]   So I'm Bardeen, who's CEO and co-founder of ways in a LinkedIn post, confirmed the, the
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:00.640]   actual deal.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.120]   One of ways is mistakes.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:07.000]   He writes was the valuation of its a round, which significantly diluted the founders.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.760]   Hey, sometimes that happens.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:14.160]   Perhaps we had, we held control of the company as the founders of Facebook, Google, Oracle
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:19.160]   or Microsoft had ways might still be an independent company today.
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:22.160]   He was forced to sell by the VCs, it sounds like.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:26.400]   It's like they should have introduced some of those B and C shares.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.400]   Yeah.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:32.640]   When they started when Google came out with free term by turn navigation, stealing our
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:39.400]   thunder, the response of our Israeli investors was that we should focus on Singapore or Romania
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:43.360]   instead of the US to avoid the inevitable confrontation.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:49.800]   We had a moment of fear and took our eyes off the ball, costing us valuable time.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.800]   John Malloy, one of the investors having lived through PayPal, competing with eBay, gave
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.680]   us invaluable experience.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:59.960]   Something only a unicorn grower would know and helps.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:00.960]   What?
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.960]   That's what it says.
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:03.960]   It's okay.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:04.960]   Just reading.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:05.960]   I don't know what it means.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:09.640]   This is a very honest or appears to be a really honest post.
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:10.640]   It's a really honest post.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:11.640]   After, after the sale.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.360]   You don't hear this kind of thing.
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:21.800]   Well, normally aren't you restricted from talking about the sale as part of the-
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:25.440]   This does seem like information they wouldn't be able to talk about.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:27.440]   At least not this soon.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:28.440]   Usually it's like at least a year.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:32.000]   There's a year moratorium on talking about the details.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.440]   So here's where that unicorn stuff comes from.
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:35.680]   If you read the whole post.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.560]   The title of the post is a unicorn in Israel.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:44.360]   The shock displayed by the British officers at the thought of finding a tiger in Africa
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:49.240]   in Madi Python's The Meaning of Life is similar to the shock displayed by most members of
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:53.960]   the venture capital community at the ways $1.1 billion exit.
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:59.240]   Israel had been written off as only being capable of producing small exits.
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:05.000]   Security or chip companies, not global internet brands, a unicorn in Israel.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   So I don't know.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   A unicorn growers, I guess, would be a venture capitalist who invested in Israeli startups
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.280]   trying to grow unicorns.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.840]   The US market is usually considered to be 50 times out of Israel.
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:21.480]   So if we normalize markets, one would have expected 0.8 unicorns to have been founded
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:24.320]   in Israeli to the US 39.
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:26.480]   That's 50x.
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:28.920]   So our one unicorn exit makes sense.
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:34.840]   This is a unicorn rich post.
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.040]   And people really like them.
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:41.040]   Reminds me when we first started to it somebody came up to us and said, I've got some words
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.040]   of advice for you.
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.040]   Yes, sir.
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:45.240]   Bikini rich content.
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:46.240]   Okay.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:50.720]   Didn't do that.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.640]   Maybe I'd be a unicorn today.
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.160]   The article kind of comes away.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.200]   I mean, it sounds like a little bit like they're complaining because they could have got more
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.200]   money.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.400]   But it's $1.15 billion.
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.560]   Well, you got it though.
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.480]   But he's in and he's looks at what's app.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:04.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:12.000]   Maybe we could, you know, even if you've got a billion dollars, it seems, maybe that's
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.200]   just a little greedy, but it seems like a billion dollars isn't what it used to be.
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.200]   Billion should be enough.
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:17.600]   It doesn't go as far as it used to go.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:18.600]   Come on.
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:19.600]   15 billion.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:22.200]   I mean, just look at McDonald's.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.440]   Look how many billions of users or customers they have.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:25.440]   Right.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.440]   Come on.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.440]   Or maybe they just wish they were running an independent company.
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.880]   That's that I understand, right?
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:30.880]   So that I understand.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:34.280]   I mean, that's, you know, it's not always about the exit or the biggest exit.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:38.880]   It often is, but have you guys been watching Silicon Valley on on HBO?
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:39.880]   Ah, yes.
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:40.880]   What do you think?
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:41.880]   I won't say yet.
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.880]   Not yet.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:43.880]   I haven't seen it.
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:44.880]   So, but it's okay.
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:45.880]   You can't, I don't think you.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:46.880]   There's no spoilers.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.880]   There's no spoilers in a comedy.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:48.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:49.880]   I'm going to watch the second episode.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:50.880]   It was okay.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:51.880]   It was okay.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:52.880]   I thought some of the jokes were pretty good.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:55.480]   There are a couple moments that made me crack a smile.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.280]   A couple of things made me a little uncomfortable.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.880]   A couple of things I thought were just dumb.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:02.640]   I mean, I like Mike Judge mostly.
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:03.640]   So I'll watch another one.
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:06.640]   It wasn't a Beavis and Budhead fan, but I loved Office Space.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.880]   I thought this was Office Space worthy.
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:10.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:11.880]   Yes.
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:12.880]   It definitely had shades of Office Space.
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:13.880]   I love that movie.
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:14.880]   Yeah, me too.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.880]   And I think, I think that our community, frankly deserves some poking fun at.
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.760]   And you know, it makes me, I actually love it.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:23.760]   I thought it was a stare.
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:24.760]   You did.
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:25.760]   You loved it.
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:26.760]   Oh, okay.
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:27.760]   Okay.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:28.760]   I was expecting you.
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.760]   There were moments.
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:32.080]   First of all, there's a company looks just like Google, but it's, but it's, because you
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:36.760]   know, it's not Google because it's headed by a kind of a Mark Benioff style or Larry
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:37.760]   Ellison style CEO.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:40.200]   Yeah, you can, you can recognize the character.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.200]   You could.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:47.920]   Oh, that's a pogram slash Peter, the guy who says, so one of the, so their venture capitalist
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:54.480]   guy or angel, really, he's an angel investor guy is on the spectrum of autism, right?
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.640]   He's like, he won't look you in the eyes.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:01.640]   He drives a very narrow car.
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:06.800]   And, and he, he's paying a hundred thousand dollars to anybody.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:09.080]   He doesn't drop out of college to form a company.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:10.080]   That's Peter Teal.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:14.080]   And one of the guys says, boy, he must really had a bad experience at college.
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:15.800]   He was really eight college.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:20.840]   In fact, then he comes up to us and he says, maybe we should go back to college so we can
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:23.040]   drop back.
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.320]   I thought it was very funny.
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.320]   I thought it was very fun.
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:29.600]   When the guys like, I better put on a better shirt.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.600]   And he puts on his old company.
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:33.200]   His other team is, yeah, company shirt.
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:36.920]   There's a scene where there's just a crazy, you know, concert going on in the backyard
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:38.680]   of some, you know, big company.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:39.680]   Chip rocks, man.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.760]   And like I've been in that con like I have.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:42.760]   It was awesome.
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.560]   I don't know how accurate is it.
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.200]   I mean, it's, it's television.
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:51.480]   It's probably as close to Silicon Valley as entourage is to Hollywood, right?
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.480]   It's, it's a.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.480]   Yeah.
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:54.480]   Of course.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:55.480]   But it's close enough.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.280]   I mean, you feel like there's some, the some humor in it.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:02.520]   Look, he's clearly, he clearly comes from a good back.
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:04.160]   It's not, it's not funny.
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:06.320]   Like, you know, made up stuff.
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:08.440]   It's all real at that concert.
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:11.240]   The founder comes up, cuterock.
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:13.680]   And then he goes, and I got six words for you.
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:14.680]   What was it?
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:15.680]   It was very funny.
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:19.400]   It was, I love who he's multi grew, multi integrated platform.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:20.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.400]   It was hysterical.
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:24.240]   They've got their lanyards.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.240]   It was terrible.
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:26.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:27.240]   It was funny.
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.240]   I took it out then.
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.240]   It sounds good.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.800]   Timbie, I loved it.
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:33.440]   And I can't wait to the next one.
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:34.840]   And they've got a ton of material.
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:39.240]   I mean, yeah, every, every day you could take something out of the news and just plug
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:40.760]   it into the show in a funny way.
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:41.760]   So.
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.840]   And the good news is they've put the first episode up for free on YouTube.
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.040]   So you can decide whether you want to tour it the rest of them.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:50.800]   Oh, you're not supposed to do that.
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:51.800]   I thought you're serious.
[01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:54.200]   Oh, I mean, I don't.
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:58.280]   I guess we could play a little bit of it.
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.280]   It's on YouTube.
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:00.280]   There's that bit.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:01.960]   There's that bit right there.
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.720]   Here, let's play that part.
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:05.760]   Can you get my audio?
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:06.760]   Why can't you?
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:07.760]   It's turned up once again.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:10.520]   I mean, even even the wardrobe is so perfect.
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.120]   You know these guys.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:13.880]   That's all it is.
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:15.520]   Let me check.
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:16.520]   Are you sending me?
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:17.520]   My sound.
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:20.640]   Ah, I'm not.
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:22.760]   That's odd that I wouldn't have been.
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:25.720]   Come on, send it out through the HDMI port.
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:27.520]   Why won't it?
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:28.520]   It just won't chat.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:29.520]   I'm to reboot.
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.920]   Do I have to reboot?
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:32.200]   I mean, just on plug and re-plug.
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:34.280]   I think that'll fix it.
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:38.320]   Just make it renegotiate.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.320]   Handshake.
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.320]   Handshake.
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:41.320]   Heartbeats.
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:44.480]   Anybody who watches, uh, yeah, then out.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:45.480]   Heartbleed.
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:46.480]   Oh, no.
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:47.480]   Here we go.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:50.480]   Um, Coolie Bibbs integrated multi-platform functionality.
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:51.480]   Yeah!
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:52.480]   Yeah!
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:53.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:54.480]   Yeah!
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:55.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:56.480]   You got to love that.
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:57.480]   I've been there.
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:59.480]   You've been at that party.
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:00.480]   Absolutely.
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:02.480]   And the people raised their beer kind of tepidly.
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:03.480]   Yeah.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:04.480]   Yeah.
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:06.480]   That's funny.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:11.480]   One of my favorite parts is Hoolie, which is basically, here's the Peter Teal character.
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:18.800]   But then if it's only the perpetrators of it, the bloated administrators.
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.480]   You are a dangerous man.
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:22.480]   You're a ignorance.
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:24.480]   I don't think so.
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:25.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.480]   He's a dead dog.
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:28.960]   That's all I have to say.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.480]   It's got the same pretension.
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:32.480]   Oh, man.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.520]   Um, here's pitches.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.360]   So this guy has a, this guy apparently made a little money.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:40.680]   He sold his company to Frontier Airlines.
[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:41.680]   And what is it?
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:42.680]   Aviotto.
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:43.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:50.400]   And he's taking, he's taking pitches from other people who want to move into his ink
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:52.400]   incubator, which is basically his house.
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:55.000]   Oops, there's a little, a little profanity there.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000]   Okay, here we go.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000]   Here we go.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000]   He's taking pitches.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.800]   And that's how I got to where I am.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:01.800]   So.
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:02.800]   I love the beard.
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:03.800]   What do you got?
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:04.800]   Okay.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:05.800]   Here it is.
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:06.800]   Bit soup.
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:10.400]   It's like alphabet soup.
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:13.800]   But it's ones and zeros.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:14.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.800]   I would buy it.
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.600]   Because it's binary.
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.000]   You know, binary is just ones and zeros.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.800]   Yeah, I know what binary is.
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:23.800]   Jesus Christ.
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:27.200]   I memorized the hexadecimal times tables when I was 14 writing machine code.
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.200]   Okay?
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:29.600]   Asked me what 9 times F is.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:30.600]   It's 11.5.
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:33.600]   But he not need you telling me what binary is.
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:37.000]   Just like I don't need you thinking about soup or taking pictures of it.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:42.000]   And he's you thinking about apps, software, websites, Silicon Valley, all right?
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000]   Not.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000]   He's Googling it.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000]   There is Texas.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000]   It's recamble.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000]   Okay, I'm sold.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000]   I'm sold.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000]   I'm going to watch it.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000]   I'm going to watch it.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000]   I might be the only one laughing in the room.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000]   Well, the family's watching.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000]   It's kind of programmer humor.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000]   Yeah.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:07.000]   And you know, he's at the ice cream machine getting his yogurt in the company cafeteria.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000]   And they go, "Uh-oh, here come the programmers."
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000]   And some programmers.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000]   And the programmers haze him mercilessly.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000]   It's very, you know?
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000]   Yeah.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000]   It's office space, though.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000]   It's the same idea, which is the downtrodden programmers.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000]   Right.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000]   You know, yep.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000]   I don't know.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000]   I like it.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000]   I like it.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000]   Just me, maybe.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000]   I think we talked to Jeff yesterday.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000]   I think he didn't hate it, but he didn't love it.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.000]   But he might be a TV critic.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000]   It's his job.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000]   And he liked Big Bang Theory, so you know.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000]   He did?
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.000]   Yeah, remember we talked to Big Bang Theory.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.000]   And where did you stand on that?
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000]   Okay.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000]   How about you?
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000]   You like Big Bang Theory?
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000]   I don't watch it.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000]   Yeah, I don't even.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]   This is good because there's no laugh track.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]   You have to decide whether Joe's funny on your eye.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000]   I like that.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000]   I really like that.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000]   Let's talk about manipulation.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000]   It's like up worthy.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000]   And you won't believe how funny this is.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000]   What happens next?
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000]   I'll tell you what happens next.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000]   And that for LegalZoom.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, the tool, the tip, and the number of the week.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000]   But first a word from LegalZoom.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000]   LegalZoom is not a law firm.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000]   No, no, no, much better.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:29.000]   They provide you with self-help services at your specific direction, so you can get the legal work you need done at a very low cost, and they can give you legal help through independent attorneys and self-help services.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000]   Not a law firm, much, much better, and much, much more affordable.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000]   I mean, for instance, if you're starting up a business, you can get an LLC.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000]   You can get an LLC for 99 bucks plus filing fees.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:47.000]   Now your white shoe attorney with eight different names on the front door is not going to give you a fee like that.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000]   That's how I did the LLC for Twitter.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000]   It's the work.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000]   It's the papers we're still using.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000]   You can do a chapter, S or chapter C corp too.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000]   Got to get that trademark chat.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000]   Have you finished trademarking OMG Chad?
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000]   No, you haven't.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000]   Yeah.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000]   It's 169 bucks, Chad.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000]   Trade market.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000]   It's like I already spent the money.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000]   I just need to go through the right now, you know, step by step thing and all of that.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000]   It's the trademark office.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000]   We need a specimen.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000]   You need a specimen.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000]   Send them a specimen.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000]   Sorry.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000]   It's not legal zoom.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000]   It's a trademark.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000]   No, but you got to give them an example so that they can file it.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000]   That's what they put on file.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000]   So I gave them the Twit name, and then I gave them the Twit logo, and it's just a drawing.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.000]   It doesn't have to be super fancy, but that's what that's on file, so somebody can look at that and say, oh yeah, we don't want it in fringe.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000]   Right.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000]   It's worth it.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000]   Let's face it.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000]   The legal system is complicated.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000]   It's expensive.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000]   There are better things you can do with your time and money, but legal zoom is there for
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.000]   you, making it so much easier and so much more affordable.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000]   Trademark will, living trust, all the personal stuff too.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000]   You get the personal attention you need, and they'll help you care.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000]   Take care of all the details.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000]   Legal zoom.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:02.000]   They've been helping families and small business owners for 14 years, including me, A+ from the Better Business Bureau.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.000]   They're great people, and it is a great service that is really empowering people.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000]   I'm all for that.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:14.000]   Legalzoom.com is the offer code TWIG to save on your legal needs and get access to the network
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000]   of legal plan attorneys for guidance.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000]   Legalzoom.com, offer code TWIG, you get 10 bucks off.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000]   Check out and we get a little thank you from LegalZoom.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000]   I say thank you.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000]   That guy, Joey, came over and he did an LLC.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000]   Thanks, TWIG.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000]   Legalzoom.com is the offer code TWIG.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000]   Gina Trapani, why don't we start things off with you a tip of the week?
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000]   All right, cool.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000]   A cute little new thing in Google's interface that new to me anyway, that Google operating
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]   system pointed out.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:51.000]   Google's app launcher on the web, that little box, you know, the squares in the box.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000]   It looks a lot like Android's app launcher, actually, but it's in the upper right hand corner.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000]   You can now customize that.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:03.000]   You can move around the icons that you want to put the apps that you use the most up top
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000]   and you can relocate apps that you don't use into a different page.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.000]   You can add new shortcuts like to Google Keep, for example, if you're a big Keep user.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000]   You just kind of customize that little launcher, make it a little more useful.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000]   I got to be honest, I don't use the launcher.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000]   I generally just navigate to the apps that I want.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:29.000]   I'm just used to doing the control L and typing into my browser address bar, but that button
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000]   is everywhere.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000]   It's in every app.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000]   So if you just want to quickly navigate to another Google app, you can do that and now
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000]   you can sort of arrange those icons very much like you would do on your Android home screen.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000]   So you're seeing a little bit of the web Android unification going on there.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000]   Now, is this the extension, the Chrome extension?
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000]   No, this is like, if you go to Google.com or if you go to Gmail, there's a little bit
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000]   of boxes on the top right.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000]   That's like their web app launcher.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000]   You click on that.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000]   It's actually on the web page.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000]   It's not a Chrome extension at all.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000]   It's just a little bit.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000]   I've been using a Chrome extension to do just this for the past couple of months.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000]   And I use it all the time.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000]   Oh, it's this little grid right here.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]   But I have a look.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000]   See, I'm fine.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000]   I guess they can't see mine.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.000]   But when I go to mine, I have that customized or configure at the bottom.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000]   So I downloaded a Chrome extension to do exactly this.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000]   You don't have to.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000]   But I don't have to anyway.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.000]   It says new, drag and drop to arrange your apps right there.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000]   And I can just--
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000]   That makes it much more useful.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000]   Yes, because see, I have a second page.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000]   Right.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000]   Right.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000]   And I would like to get photos up here, for instance, and get Google news down here.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000]   Things like that.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000]   And I've put keep up there.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000]   We talked about keep earlier.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000]   I put keep up in there because I use that a lot.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000]   So now whenever I'm at, I can just click the little grid and choose keep.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000]   So, yeah.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000]   Cool.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000]   Yeah, actually photos.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000]   I go to all the time.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000]   I get what the URL is and I wind up clicking through Google+ so this will be way better.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000]   For that, it's great.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000]   It's not-- it doesn't seem to be on Google Drive, is it?
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000]   Oh, yeah, there it is.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000]   Okay.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000]   Only on the top page.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000]   Once you're in a document, it goes away.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000]   Okay.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000]   Because I use this all the time.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000]   Yep.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000]   And there's all these pages of stuff.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000]   I can move this stuff down that I don't want.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000]   Cool.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000]   Good tip.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000]   Yeah, thanks.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000]   Aaron, you don't have to do a number.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000]   What would you like to add to the pot?
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000]   So, I've got a project.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000]   Is that okay?
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000]   I love your project.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000]   Oh, good.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000]   Good.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.560]   So, this is something really cool that I saw actually make post of this, the make-- oh,
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:28.560]   folks over at Make Magazine posted this.
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:32.200]   There's been a project for a long time called Paper Dweino, which is basically taking a
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.360]   piece of paper instead of using a breadboard.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:39.640]   You make your own Arduino compatible board, but using paper.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:41.800]   Well, now they've done-- they've gone one step further.
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:43.400]   Is there electronics in it?
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:44.400]   There is electronics in it.
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:45.400]   Yep.
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:46.400]   Absolutely.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.880]   So, instead of the breadboard, you use a piece of paper.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:49.880]   There's a piece of paper.
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:54.400]   And so, now they've gone one step further and they've created Paper Dweino Tiny, which
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:55.680]   is even smaller.
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:58.400]   So, my next project is taking this.
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:02.400]   Right now, this is about four inches by five inches of paper.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:03.840]   Is it stiff paper?
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:04.840]   You could use stiff paper.
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:05.840]   It's up to you, what kind of paper.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:06.840]   It's you.
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:07.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:08.840]   You just print it onto it.
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:09.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:10.840]   I get it.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:14.640]   So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this and re-jigger it to make it into business
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:15.640]   card size.
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:16.640]   That's going to be my new business card.
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:17.640]   Oh!
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:18.640]   Oh!
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:19.640]   Hand out a business card with a little circuit.
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:20.640]   What are you going to put on it?
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:21.640]   Yeah.
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:22.640]   I don't know.
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:23.640]   I mean, we'll see.
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:24.800]   I think I'm going to put like a speaker and make some LEDs blank and that way you can
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.440]   push a button and it'll kind of give my--
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:27.840]   But you actually put the components on it?
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:28.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.840]   You put the components right on it.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:30.840]   Yep.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:34.000]   Now, that'll be for-- what I can do is I can print out small ones like the ones that I
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.040]   give out to, you know, people that I just meet on the street or whatever.
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.440]   Then I can print-- I can actually do the components on the ones that I want to give to those A-class
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.640]   people that I really want to remember.
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:45.640]   These people on the street happen to have resistors and diodes in their pockets.
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:46.640]   Absolutely.
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:47.640]   They can do it themselves.
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:51.080]   Well, the great thing is on the back of this, you can put the instructions on where to download
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:52.080]   all this stuff.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.520]   It's about $4 worth of components.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.520]   Now, how do you solder it?
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:58.200]   Doesn't it set the paper on fire?
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.200]   Very carefully.
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:00.200]   Good question.
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:01.200]   Very carefully.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:02.200]   Yeah.
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.200]   No, it doesn't--
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:05.440]   It's burned up by paper do we know?
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:08.160]   Yeah, it doesn't-- if you look on the back of it, actually, there's another individual.
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.160]   All right, let's see here.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:10.160]   Let's go back.
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:11.960]   It'll show you the back of the-- there was a--
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:13.960]   It shows you where the wire is.
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:14.960]   No, click on the first one.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:16.160]   Click on the first one again.
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:17.160]   OK.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.160]   Can I flip the first one over?
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:19.160]   I think so.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:21.160]   I thought there was a back, a picture of the back.
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:22.960]   I don't think they want to show you the back.
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:23.960]   Let's see.
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:24.960]   There's a--
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:25.960]   There it is.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:26.960]   Is that--
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:27.960]   No, that's not it.
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:28.960]   I thought there was a picture of it.
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:29.960]   Is there a--
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:31.960]   I can just see.
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:33.640]   I don't have it on-- here's what it looks like.
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:37.160]   So you can see basically what they did was they connected everything with wires, kind
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.160]   of like you would do with--
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:39.160]   So they're not really--
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.160]   You're not a brag-borne solder.
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:41.160]   You're still a user solder.
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:43.960]   You see, if you look real closely on mine, you can see where they burned the paper.
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:46.360]   It's like a wire wrap, but you just have to be very careful.
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:48.160]   Just to be very careful.
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:52.440]   Set your temperature on your solder, going appropriately, so you don't have a problem.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.320]   But I thought that was really, really cool.
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:57.680]   The fact that, you know, $4 of components and a piece of paper, you have yourself--
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:01.240]   It's really a compatible device that you can do.
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:02.240]   It's kind of cool.
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:05.440]   So yeah, so this is basically kind of like a breadboard or a project board.
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:06.440]   Exactly.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:07.440]   Yeah.
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:08.440]   And yeah, I can see you can solder it.
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:11.720]   You know what, you don't touch the tip of the soldering iron to the paper.
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:12.720]   You just melt the solder.
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:13.720]   Right.
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:14.720]   The solder's going to cool very, very quickly.
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:15.720]   Yeah, it's not going to burn.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:17.720]   The solder itself probably won't burn the paper.
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:19.680]   I'm glad you found those images.
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:20.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:21.680]   So that's it.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:22.920]   And I thought that was so cool.
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:25.480]   So this is going to be my next project.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:29.160]   And I think for anybody that wants to do a little soldering, learn a little soldering,
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:30.160]   I might do this.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:33.720]   I'm thinking we could probably use this in a makerspace for project kids.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:35.720]   You know?
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:36.720]   Do they have low cost?
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:38.120]   What kinds of boards do they have?
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:40.880]   I mean, what kind of projects are they all?
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:41.880]   Well, this is basically...
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:42.880]   Oh, it's an Arduino.
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.280]   It doesn't do anything particular.
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.280]   Right.
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:47.800]   So you program it the same way you would an Arduino.
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.080]   So if I was doing this for kids, I'd probably do it with blinky lights.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:54.800]   And I would say, okay, now we're going to make the green light blink, and now we're
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:55.880]   going to make the red light blink.
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:58.160]   And here's how you change your sketch and upload that into the...
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:43:59.160]   Oh, you know what?
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:03.400]   I'm going to do this would be really fun to do.
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:04.400]   Where do you get your stuff?
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:05.400]   Do you get it at AidaFruit?
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:08.080]   Or where do you like getting your spark fun?
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:09.080]   So if I'm getting...
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.080]   It depends, right?
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:13.680]   So if I'm getting a bunch of resistors, I'd probably just get them off of eBay from China
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:16.600]   and just have them ship a ton of them over for like five bucks or something.
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:17.600]   You can look at a assortment.
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:18.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:19.600]   You can get a sort of...
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:20.600]   Resistor assortment.
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:21.600]   Absolutely.
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:22.600]   That's the way to go, actually.
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:23.600]   Because you never know what you're going to need, right?
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:24.600]   Right.
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:25.600]   So...
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:27.600]   And then you have to learn the ring code.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:28.600]   Do you know it by heart?
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:29.600]   You have to learn the...
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:30.600]   I looked at...
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:32.600]   I don't know it by heart.
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:33.600]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:34.600]   So you have to search through red, green, red.
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:35.600]   That could have been it.
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:40.600]   Pretty cool.
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:43.600]   Good thing to have on your own.
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:44.600]   I like it.
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:45.600]   If you're a maker.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:46.600]   So yeah.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:47.600]   Take that.
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:51.600]   And if you ever see me, you know, if you next time you see me in person, ask me if I've got a card for you.
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:53.600]   Maybe I'll have a fully baked card for you.
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:56.600]   And how much is it if you put an Arduino on it?
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:58.600]   How much is the total cost of it?
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:44:59.600]   Well, this is Arduino compatible.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:02.600]   So I mean, this whole thing is $4 worth of components.
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:03.600]   That's all.
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:04.600]   That's it.
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.600]   You're buying this right now, somehow.
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:07.600]   Oh, no, you don't want to...
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.600]   I think you're buying a paper, do we know...
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:14.600]   Tiny card, double-side printed hard paper, $3 USD for five pieces.
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:15.600]   Oh, they do.
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:16.600]   But that doesn't include components.
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:18.600]   Then you have to buy the components.
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:19.600]   You have to buy the components, yeah.
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:20.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:22.600]   And you use a thumbtack, a pushpin...
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:23.600]   Right.
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:24.600]   To make the holes.
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:25.600]   Exactly.
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:26.600]   Exactly.
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:27.600]   Do you have to have...
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:29.600]   See, I have sausage fingers.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:32.600]   Do you have to have really fine grilling fingers?
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:33.600]   No, I have pretty big fingers.
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:36.600]   They're probably about the same size as yours.
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:37.600]   I don't have to have like...
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.600]   I don't have to look like Adrian Brody in the pianist.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:40.600]   No.
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.600]   Well, you do need to get as a pair of helping hands.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:46.600]   You have those little magnifying glass and little alligator clips and hand.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:47.600]   Those are your components.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:49.600]   Definitely need that.
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.600]   And for people my age, you do need the magnifying glass.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:52.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:55.600]   That's essential at this point.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.600]   So let me quickly look at my Gmail.
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.600]   Because this was a suggestion from somebody.
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:02.600]   I was talking last week about how the only negative on using the M8...
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:07.600]   was that I didn't have the Moto X assist feature.
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:09.600]   And he said, "You know what?
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:15.600]   There is something that does everything the assist does on any Android phone."
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:17.600]   And he's right.
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:18.600]   And I downloaded it.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:20.600]   It's called Agent.
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:25.600]   And it allows you to set up any Android phone, use the accelerometers to do...
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:28.600]   Have you talked about this at all about Android or somewhere else?
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:29.600]   I've heard about this.
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:31.600]   I don't remember exactly when.
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:32.600]   We did talk about this.
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:36.600]   I'm looking for the email so I can give the guy credit.
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:39.600]   But this was really a nice tip.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:40.600]   And I can't find your email.
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:41.600]   I'm sorry, sir.
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:42.600]   So this is Agent.
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:43.600]   I've launched it.
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:45.600]   And I have five sections.
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:47.600]   Battery, sleep, parking, meeting and driving.
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:50.600]   And some of this stuff actually is better than the Moto X.
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:51.600]   But let's look at the drive.
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:54.600]   So it knows if I have a Bluetooth connection.
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:56.600]   It can also use its in beta.
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:00.600]   It can also use motion detection to see whether I'm driving.
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:03.600]   And then once I'm driving, it can do a variety of things.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:04.600]   Silence the phone.
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:08.600]   Or, and this is what I have it do, read text messages out loud.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:11.600]   I can respond with speech only.
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:14.600]   And then it will prompt me for a voice response.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:17.600]   Transcribe it and send it as a text message reply.
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:20.600]   That is what Motorola Assist does in the Moto X.
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:21.600]   That's awesome.
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:27.600]   If I'm sleeping and you can have sleeping activation times, I say, "Who can wake me?"
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:32.600]   But I can also say, send a text that says, "Hey, I'm asleep."
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:36.600]   But if this is urgent, text me the word urgent.
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:39.600]   And then my phone will actually play an alarm clock sound.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.600]   Wake me up.
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:44.600]   And then the phone call will go through.
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:47.600]   So I can say, then you can control whether, who gets this message.
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.600]   Most people will get nothing.
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:54.600]   But if, you know, my kids call me in the middle of the night, they'll get a text message saying,
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:57.600]   "Hey, I'm sleeping.
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:00.600]   If you text urgent, my phone will ring loudly and wake me up."
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:01.600]   Or whatever you want.
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:02.600]   You can change that.
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:05.600]   So right now we're in a meeting.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:06.600]   So it's on Do Not Disturb.
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:07.600]   And I can say, "Which calendars?"
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.600]   This is actually better than Moto Assist.
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.600]   Which calendars it looks for meetings with.
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:15.600]   If the meeting says busy, it will not ring my phone, or it will send out a text message saying,
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:16.600]   "I'm a busy."
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:18.600]   This is when the Moto Assist does not do.
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:23.600]   It will automatically record parking spots without me pressing a button because it knows I've stopped moving at that.
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:25.600]   I must have parked.
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:31.600]   So I will always know where I've parked without doing anything.
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:33.600]   It's a really nice little program.
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:34.600]   What's it called?
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:35.600]   I'm down looking at it right now.
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:36.600]   Agent.
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:38.600]   I don't know.
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:40.600]   If you need to search, it's Agent Do Not Disturb and more.
[01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:41.600]   Thank you.
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:42.600]   And how much is it, Chad?
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:43.600]   It's free.
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:44.600]   Ooh.
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:45.600]   Even better.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:46.600]   I just installed.
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:49.600]   Now my first question was, does Agent use up a lot of battery life?
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:50.600]   And he said, "No, it doesn't."
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:52.600]   You know, that was one of the things that I can say.
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:57.600]   One of the things that I thought made the Moto X so special is it had that special secondary
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:01.600]   low power processor to watch for things like that without actually waking up the phone.
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:02.600]   But he's right.
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:04.600]   I haven't noticed a huge drop.
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:08.600]   There are some GPS functions that conceivably would leave the GPS on longer than it would
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:11.600]   normally be on that might affect your battery life.
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:13.600]   But I haven't noticed it at all.
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:18.600]   And boy, that was one of the things that was holding me back from switching from the Moto
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:21.600]   X to the HTC One, I love Moto Assist.
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.000]   So this does that and more.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.400]   And it works fine on the M8.
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:28.600]   Yes, Faraday Cage and our chat rooms asking me, is it work?
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:29.600]   Wow.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:30.600]   Yeah.
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:31.600]   Awesome.
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:33.600]   That's great.
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:34.600]   It's like a, because I used Tasker for a lot of those things.
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:38.840]   But you have to do manual, you have to set it all up and it's complicated.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:42.440]   This is basically Tasker with preset things.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:43.440]   Right.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:44.600]   The five things you most likely wanted.
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:45.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:46.600]   I think that's great.
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:49.600]   And now if anybody wants to wake me up, you know how.
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:50.600]   Urgent.
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:55.600]   Lisa will love that.
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:57.600]   She is on the list.
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:00.600]   What if you were, what if you text you say, don't worry about this Leo.
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.600]   It's not urgent.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:02.600]   Then I will wake up.
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:04.600]   It's still, you're going to wake up.
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:06.600]   I'll be pissed.
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:08.600]   It's be like, text me Shazam.
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:10.600]   That's something really specific.
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.600]   I should maybe change that word.
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:15.600]   Now it's called agent, but look for agent.
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:17.600]   Do not disturb in the play store.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:20.600]   You want to search and find.
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:22.600]   Hey, that's it for this week in Google for this week.
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:23.600]   Gina Trappani.
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:24.600]   It's so great to have you back.
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:27.600]   Think up.com now open to the public.
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:28.600]   Yes, indeed.
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:29.600]   You want to get it was great to be back.
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:34.600]   Insights, did you get any signups from last week when we talked about it?
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:35.600]   We did.
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:36.600]   We did.
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:37.600]   Signups have been going really, really well.
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:43.040]   We obviously had a big spike when we first opened and then it kind of leveled out a little
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:44.040]   bit.
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:46.600]   But yeah, I really appreciate all the support from the Switch Network.
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:47.600]   Everyone has been has been so great.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:53.600]   You've all been you and Jason and Ron were all early backers and I really appreciate it.
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:57.600]   Looks like we might actually have a shot at a business model who would have thought we
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:58.600]   had a small shot.
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:50:59.600]   Here's my think up.
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:02.600]   So it takes my Facebook and Twitter and gives me analysis.
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:04.600]   And then it does it in a nice personal way.
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:07.600]   For instance, three interesting people who followed me and then I have this button that
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:09.600]   says actually please hide them.
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:11.600]   I don't want to see them.
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:13.600]   Here's the deal with Leo LaPorte status updates.
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.600]   Did you and Neil both write the copy on this or?
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:16.600]   We did.
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:17.600]   We did.
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:18.600]   Yeah.
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:20.600]   We collaborated on it.
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:21.600]   We tried to make it.
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:23.200]   It's analytics for humans, right?
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:26.720]   So it's supposed to be kind of conversational and cool, not robotic, not charge the sake
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:29.440]   of charts, but just kind of little stories that come out of those charts.
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:30.840]   So we're trying to tell those stories.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:31.840]   It's not easy.
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:35.480]   Everyone uses these networks different ways, but we're getting there.
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:36.480]   We're getting there.
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.040]   See, this is a good feeling.
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:42.320]   460,000, 519 more people saw Miguel Deacaz's tweet.
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:43.320]   Thanks to me.
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:46.040]   And using your network really well.
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:48.040]   You can find the right people.
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:50.040]   Good job.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.040]   You can thank me later, Miguel.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:52.040]   Here's what you tweeted.
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:55.280]   What I favorited on the last year.
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:57.680]   My most popular tweet two years ago.
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:58.680]   Oh, wow.
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:51:59.680]   Game on.
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:00.680]   Wow.
[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:01.680]   Last episode.
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:02.680]   Wow.
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:04.040]   It's been two years.
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:07.680]   Do social tech and tech sound like the descriptions?
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:13.720]   Donna Dubinsky, the founder of Palm, can thank me for 502,000 more people seeing her tweet.
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:15.200]   There you go.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:17.600]   See, I retweet the best people.
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:18.600]   You do.
[01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:19.600]   Wow.
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:20.600]   Chelsea Quarka followed me.
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:24.840]   I don't know who that is.
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:25.840]   This is fun.
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:29.160]   So that's thinkup.com if you want to sign up for that.
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:32.440]   It's really, you know, I don't know what I'm going to do with it.
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:33.440]   I just like it.
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:35.280]   Well, it's fun.
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:40.520]   We want to get to a place where it sort of helps you decide, you know, what to, you know,
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:41.880]   what to do different or better.
[01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:46.360]   But if you're trying to like have used social media for a purpose, this would be useful.
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:47.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:48.360]   Like if you're a business, right?
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:49.360]   Right.
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:50.400]   And that this is kind of crucial data.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:51.400]   Very valuable stuff.
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:54.760]   I mean, really anybody with an audience like can really can make a difference.
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:57.480]   I think can get messages out.
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:53:00.840]   And I think that these kind of we hope our hope is that these kinds of insights help.
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:04.440]   So thank you for checking it out, Leo.
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:05.440]   Thinkup.com.
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:06.440]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:07.440]   Thank you.
[01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:08.440]   We'll see you next week.
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:09.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:11.560]   I'm going to try get some more better lighting in here.
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:12.560]   Some stuff on the walls.
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:14.240]   It's going to be, it's going to be good.
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:20.880]   And tell that person next door to stop torrenting Game of Thrones or whatever was going on earlier.
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:24.320]   That's a co-working space.
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:25.520]   She can't be held responsible.
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:26.520]   Right.
[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:27.520]   Right.

[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:32.840]   He brought donuts this morning instead of bagels by popular demand.
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:36.000]   Tony's sought me out to thank me.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.320]   He's looking for me.
[01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:38.880]   I was like, what did I do?
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:41.080]   And he's like, thank you for the donuts.
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.080]   Ring donuts.
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:43.080]   Anytime.
[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:45.640]   Aaron is at App.
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:46.640]   NetApp.
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:47.640]   NetApp.
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:50.360]   What does that little company do?
[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:51.640]   Storage systems mostly.
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:57.800]   So we do a lot of stuff really, but we're known for our enterprise class storage systems
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:03.000]   that we a lot of integration with business apps like Oracle and SAP and stuff like that.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.360]   So it's storage plus.
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:05.360]   Storage plus.
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:06.360]   Plus a bunch more.
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:07.360]   I just came up with that.
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:08.600]   So I'll take my paycheck now.
[01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:09.600]   Thank you.
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:12.400]   No, it's a great company.
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:14.760]   In fact, one of the top companies to work for just about everywhere.
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:15.760]   All of our offices.
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:16.760]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:17.760]   Yeah, they always have.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:19.520]   Hey, we're going to a little both.
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:20.520]   Yeah, a little both.
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:22.240]   It's a track.
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:23.240]   It's two hours.
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:26.120]   Yeah, I used to give you two and a half hours down to Sunnyvale.
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:27.120]   No fun.
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:28.120]   One way.
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:32.160]   Yeah, so that makes it tough, but they're very flexible, very good.
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:33.160]   They treat their employees very well.
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:37.480]   So like, yeah, we're from home when you want to and then come in when you need to.
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:38.960]   That's why you're an audible subscriber.
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:39.960]   Yep, absolutely.
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:43.000]   That's how I first found Audibles when I was a community of Cupertino.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.480]   Oh, it's great for kids.
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:45.480]   Great for kids.
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:46.480]   Yep.
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:47.480]   Yep.
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:48.480]   And so it's Twit.
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:49.480]   Twit's great for kids too.
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:50.480]   Oh, yeah, that.
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:51.480]   Yeah.
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:52.480]   We do this show.
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:53.480]   In fact, Twit would be a good one.
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:58.720]   Every Wednesday afternoon, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time 2000 UTC on Twit.tv.
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:00.720]   If you can watch live, we like it if you do.
[01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:02.600]   But it's not a requirement by any means.
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:03.600]   That's why we make.
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:04.600]   Look, we just want you to watch it.
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:06.400]   We don't care how on demand.
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:07.400]   You don't have to torrent it.
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:09.640]   I don't think you can.
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:10.640]   Just go get it.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:15.880]   It's free at Twit.tv/Twigger, wherever finder, podcast or net caster, a stored audio and
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:17.000]   video available.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.840]   What else should I say?
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:22.560]   Thank you Chad Johnson, our producer for doing such a great job.
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:24.200]   No problem.
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:25.200]   And thank you for being here.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:26.200]   Yeah.
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:27.200]   Thanks for your audience.
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:29.160]   Yeah, and our studio audience.
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:30.160]   Hi.
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:31.160]   Way far away.
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:32.160]   How's it going?
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:33.160]   They didn't want to sit too close.
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:34.160]   Hi.
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:41.160]   They didn't want to sit too close.
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:43.740]   (upbeat music)
[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:46.480]   (dramatic music)
