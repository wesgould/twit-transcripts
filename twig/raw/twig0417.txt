[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.040]   The I don't know what stands for a E J MC which is the society of
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.960]   Somehow of journalism and mass communications professors. Oh, neat
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.200]   I would I know it's your trade group your union was sitting no
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.160]   I was sitting in these panels and things and inside I was screaming
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.640]   Just screaming and I decided I wasn't gonna ask
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.280]   Well, yeah, they're talking
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.280]   Nievely about business. They're talking
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.680]   Plus you think to prefer I'm gonna be real. I'm gonna get in such trouble
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.040]   You would think the professors would be really good at giving presentations because they're supposed to do it with classes
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.920]   So it's just it's just naive and thin and

[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.940]   And it was why copy order should exist because the headline was fire and furry fire and furry
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.520]   two arms
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.520]   Cats a flame
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.800]   Send some furries your way
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.440]   Also with a stacey Higgen Baugham she is at the IOT podcast and is I'm very proud to say the number 12
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.120]   most influential tech journalist in
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.960]   the world
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.840]   Yeah, I was a hoot well a twelfth in in the world no just a lot of journalists follow me on Twitter
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.240]   Which I'm so sad for them. This is a study
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.000]   Studies or is this a different study you want to give it a st? I don't even want to give it the yeah
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.720]   Where it's a Twitter map. It's a Twitter map by an analyst at Apollo 100
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.720]   I think he does he's done this a couple years in a row the hundred most influential tech people on
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.480]   Twitter or something like that and you I was very proud to see
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.960]   Of all the people we have on this show you are number one
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:33.880]   There we go. Yep, and Jeff and I I'm on the list Jeff isn't most of our hosts are lower than you
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.720]   Well Jeff isn't a journalist quite yeah, you're right you have to teach his journey
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:50.600]   Well, no, I didn't want to insult I was trying not to but I'd like I don't think of you you don't work at a
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.560]   Magazine in that sense. That's all I'm saying. I guess I don't work at a magazine. Never mind. You don't want to say
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.080]   I'm not so I did silly good get out of the joint what you're both of you dig holes
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.440]   I was like here I go
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:10.400]   Like it well as long as we're talking about let me pull up the the article
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:18.120]   Number one Cara swisher, which I think is you know, that's fair. Yeah, this is from Apollo research
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.520]   It's the top 30 technology writers followed by most other US Tech writers rich lavin and they made a tag cloud and
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.960]   Your name is right there. Look at that right above my kizak. There's Stacy Higginbotham big name in the tag cloud
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.000]   I was gonna say I think I'm a big name in the tag cloud. I'll remember that
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.120]   I think it's just because my name is so long. I'm a little
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.080]   Way down there. I'm a little little tiny little name under
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.000]   Joanna is on there join a stern who I adore is on their place
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.400]   June their twice and I'm trying to figure out why well that's she's right and I understand middle and then
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.280]   Vertical next to Quentin Hardy and Brian Chen Quentin isn't even a journalist anymore
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.840]   Well scobles on this list too, but I'm just I'm just thrilled
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.920]   Everywhere you are okay first of all your number eight and more importantly
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.240]   Your number 12. Yeah, Mary just always in there - you're you're
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:20.440]   You're the highest non-affiliated you know independent in here everybody else is with a big publication. Oh, that's really a big point. Yeah
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.560]   So swisher Mike Isaac who is like with a bullet he was like number 100 last year
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.280]   Because he's at the New York Times far and does great stuff. We like his stuff for how manju Walt Mossberg
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.360]   I think this is a Harry McCrack and more a testament to people were active on Twitter and post great stuff on Twitter
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.680]   So that other tech journalists follow them on Twitter. That's my story and I'm sticking with it. I think it's true. Yeah
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.400]   Lots of lots of lots of great people on here
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.400]   And I'm
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.120]   Really weird people I don't know these I have actually give them my email address and download
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.080]   the the the only
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.240]   Polish no first 30 and I'm not on it to download the other
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.000]   100 just to see if I was anywhere on there and I'm like being in who's who is terrible
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.240]   It's I get a give up information
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:13.840]   I'm number 63 and I'm very proud of that. I hope someday I'm tweeting more just to get up there with you Stacy
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.160]   I want to be up in the I think it's because you don't like Twitter. I think that's always gonna hold you back man
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.900]   I have completely revamped my Twitter strategy in response to this
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.880]   Oh, okay. Are you tweeting about your dog? No, it really works for me
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:34.240]   See I oh because I thought if you tweet a lot about tech and tech stories that you'd get more followers
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:41.320]   See I tweet about your dog. I tweet about my dog and I tweet about really esoteric studies from like
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.800]   Crazy places and then I also treat about or tweet about my gadget experiences. I
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.520]   Consider this little discussion here are a moose bush
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:08:02.880]   Not filling the little or they give you a fancy French restaurants to prepare you for the big course to come little goose liver
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.240]   I've been on toast. I've been trying to avoid I've been putting off the big story because I don't even want to talk about it
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.240]   But I guess we have to
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.160]   You all probably if you follow tech news know that last week a
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.040]   Googler at the time unnamed Googler posted
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.240]   on the on an internal board a memo about
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:32.640]   Why he felt googling I'm gonna try to phrase this in a neutral way why he felt that Google was
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.680]   Barking down the wrong pathless diversity initiatives and was perhaps too politically correct
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.240]   About it to do a good job. He wasn't anti diversity said right up front. I'm not against diversity
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.200]   I'm not against an attempt to make the workplace more diverse, but
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.840]   we have to understand the difference between men and women and I
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:09:01.760]   Think a lot of people read it and took it as women are not suited for tech jobs that of course got an immediate response
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:07.640]   Loud vociferous response gizmodo somehow got the actual memo and published it
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.960]   Yonatan zungar former senior engineer out former recently former. Yeah, we didn't even know he wasn't there until he wrote this piece
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.580]   It's a brilliant guy I could talk now because I'm not there anymore. So I can I can talk in a way. I wouldn't
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:28.640]   Completely dismissed a the factual material in the memo and be said the guy should be fired because this is destructive to Google
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.800]   The VP diversity at Google put out initially a memo saying you know
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:43.520]   This is unacceptable and Sundar Pichai apparently the CEO Google came back from a family holiday to address the issue and they ended up firing
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.080]   The person who wrote the memo
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.720]   It's a ten page
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.400]   screed
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.320]   At which point Julian Assange immediately offered a majority weeks
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.480]   Saying he was a victim of the political correct political correct culture of the United States
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:10.000]   Have I summarized that I think that's pretty much where we stand today. There have been articles since both in his favor and against
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.480]   Him, I'm not going to describe this as neutral is
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.200]   like
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:25.080]   You cannot describe what he did is neutral in a neutral fashion because what he did was basically take a position
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.920]   Which fine, let's talk about Google's diversity efforts, but the way he decided to do the conversation
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.960]   was by saying it was the equivalent of me walking into a
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.000]   Place and saying hey, let's talk about crime statistics
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.560]   And then saying something terrible about black people and accusing all of them of being a problem or not up to
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.520]   White people crime standards or something equally horrifying
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.560]   So to even describe this in neutral terms. I think does it gives it way more credit than it should even get this is a
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:06.800]   a terrible piece of writing in terms of just spewing hate in points that are
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:13.440]   Directly from men's rights activists, but two doing it in such a way
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:21.760]   that if any reasonable person had decided to take issue with the company's policy by saying
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.880]   By doing it like this they should be fired. This is not
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.880]   This is not a reasonable thing to do because anyone reading that memo is gonna be like holy cow
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.880]   I work with a guy who's a total
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.580]   Kind of misogynistic jerk. I would say bigger worst words, but I won't
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.600]   and so I
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:48.400]   Don't I get the people are like, oh, let's argue the science. I'm like screw the science. He is wrong
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.880]   he doesn't address all of the issues behind the science and
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:58.920]   Be the way he did this was like dropping a bomb in his his workplace in
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:06.760]   His I'm not gonna have to clean that up. I'm not sure what what I don't know. Maybe you do, but I don't know I
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.680]   Don't he posted it. We're told on a meme
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:17.280]   Board an internal board and then an internal equivalent of Google Plus. I don't know if it was not
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.560]   I don't know if this was sent to every single person of the company or was posted in a
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:29.360]   For this everybody could see it I gather but I don't know even and I was he said it to 10 people if he said it to 10 people
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:36.840]   Then then one of them is a woman so then then there's a hostile workplace and if they're all men then they're connected spiriters
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.280]   It doesn't matter how many in Google
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:46.200]   Okay, and think about when Facebook posted their wall where they they had their wall where employees could write stuff
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:52.880]   And then suddenly when Zuck had to come down and say hey guys you cannot I think was it white lives
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.880]   Also matter or someone took a stance and wrote that on the wall. Oh, I forgot that
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:04.360]   He is a CEO he had a responsibility to come in and say guys that is not our culture that is not okay
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.520]   Right well, and that's that's kind of what Google did and of course
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:12.560]   We should stipulate immediately that Google as a private company has the right to fire the person
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:18.840]   Or the right to discipline the person has the right to react anyway it chooses. There's no there's no free speech in the workplace in that sense
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.680]   right
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:26.160]   So he's not you know what he wrote was not protected because he published it on a company board
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.000]   so
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.880]   And I don't I don't think anybody would
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:37.320]   dispute that much of what he said was hurtful and inaccurate about women saying
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:43.080]   Things like women have a higher tendency to anxiety. So if you're gonna have an attack job
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.400]   You should have them in a place where it's you know, it's less anxious
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.880]   Women are extroverted men are introverted. That's you know blatant obviously not
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.000]   Generally is it true?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.240]   Neuroticism higher anxiety lowers stress tolerance this make it tribute to the higher levels anxiety
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.440]   I don't want to get stacey upset so has he seen a Woody Allen?
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:11.680]   Well, okay, so a couple of things first of all and he even says this these are these are generalities
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:19.360]   But you're generalizing about a gender just like generalizing about a race is offensive to people
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.920]   But Stacy's Stacy's on to something else here
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:26.120]   Which is really important you know, which is is and I could barely get through the damn thing because it was so badly written
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.920]   Yeah, I didn't read the whole thing either. I tried so that's part of part of the part of the case going on here
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:38.680]   Is whether it's political or technology the the Venn diagram we're getting here of the so-called men's rights movement
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:45.640]   Which is I as a man? I will say is BS. We've had plenty of rights for plenty of time and and it's a reaction to feminism
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.880]   It's a reaction to to to a perceived loss of power. It's a reaction all kinds of things
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:58.040]   Like nationalism like racism, you know the misogyny fits in there and so there's there's a set of dog whistles
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:03.800]   There's a set of ways to talk and you know when I criticized it then boom. I got it on Twitter like that, right?
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.440]   And and so what's what's disturbing to me is
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:14.800]   So so so that exists and that has a voice now because social enables it enables lots of things good and bad
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:21.040]   I don't care with that. I think we could clearly say there's a tenor in this country right now to tolerate
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.680]   Speech that we would not have tolerated ten years ago
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.440]   Well, then it goes well that though. Oh, that's that itself is an argument, right?
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:33.500]   Because if you go to NRO National Review and others there there are decrying his firing as a lack of free speech and as
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:38.800]   Political correctness but the point I'm trying to make here for the show that's relevant. So so don't send me your emails
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.800]   I'm being relevant oh send me emails anyway
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:47.400]   Is that's gonna stop them what disturbs me is the connection of the technology industry
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:56.160]   Because it's not gender diverse and the so-called men's rights movement and the misogyny that is inherent in that and how they come together and
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.440]   the whole gamer-gater world around technology and men and
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.880]   Technology not being open to respectful of
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.760]   women
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.560]   That's a huge cultural problem not just for the individual companies
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.920]   I don't think you can take this one guy as the Atlantic did and said well
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.040]   This shows the horrible core of Google and horrible core of technology. I'm gonna I'm gonna propose
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   I want to propose something
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.120]   I
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:26.000]   Was gonna go because I first of all if you if you just go to the end of his memo and look at his suggestions
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.200]   I think we can clearly throw out the
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.920]   bogus sociological
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.280]   Crap he's throwing in there although people are people with some
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:39.840]   Expetees are defending him. No, no, no, there are people with expertise defending him
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.760]   There are also people with expertise saying he's full of crap. So there's why we're throwing that out. There's some debate about it
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.760]   But we're just gonna throw that out
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:52.520]   Would you agree with he says my larger point is we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don't fit a certain ideology
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:17:00.360]   Would you agree with that? No because he's wrapping it. He's using my ideas and freedom of expression to espouse stereotypes
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:06.640]   Bigoted thinking then says I'm not saying we should restrict people to certain gender roles
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:12.360]   I'm advocating for quite the opposite treat and I don't I couldn't disagree with this line treat people as individuals
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.920]   Not as just another member of their group tribalism
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:22.160]   That's fine, but he in this memo lumped women under an entire group who's bad at engineering
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:28.640]   So I love the fact that he's like oh, yeah, that's all the individuals. That's not doing it or extraverted neurotic
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.320]   So here's what I'm gonna propose that maybe maybe we'll diffuse this a little bit
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:42.160]   Technology and frankly business in general but technology particularly has been a male playing field for so long
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.640]   that we have a certain picture of it and
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.480]   and people who have
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.400]   grown up in the industry
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.480]   Have have a picture of how it looks how the workplace looks how the product that we create looks
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:01.560]   I on Windows weekly. I said it's like we for years have been operating with a black
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:07.720]   Screen in white text. You know, it's it's in the black and white and it's and then all of a sudden
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.160]   People are saying no, but we want to make it a rainbow
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:18.880]   We want to include everybody we want technology to reflect all the people in the world not just this white
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.320]   You know short-sleeve pocket protector skinny black tie nerd glasses
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.120]   Speaking of story, but but well, but you know, that's the IBM
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.400]   Yeah thing, you know and and I think
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:36.280]   What we're saying is it should be in rainbows and it's upsetting to people who say but no
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.260]   But tech is this way and that's the this is what this guy really
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:46.400]   At bottom is saying on this. I'm just gonna what he's but I feel like what he's saying is
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.360]   He doesn't know it, but what he's saying is this is how it looks. This is how it should look
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.200]   This is how it's always looked. This is how it feels good and right to me
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.680]   And what we're saying what we're saying to him is I
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:07.840]   Understand what I would say is I understand why you'd feel that way, but the but there is it could be so much more
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.280]   And and there's so much more opportunity with diversity not just gender diversity racial diversity
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:18.520]   National origin that that that the melting pot is a melting pot of many colors
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:25.160]   It could be so much more interesting. Yes. It doesn't look like what it used to look like that's upsetting to people
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.680]   But the opportunity is
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.920]   So much better that it's worth opening up your mind to that idea. This is this is a
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:41.560]   against change and diverse diversity. That's what I think this is this is as all conservatives to vis-a-vis is ultimately
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.480]   Saying I don't want it to change. Yeah, yeah
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.600]   Did you did you see I don't know if you guys read what I wrote
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:55.280]   But I wrote something on this that was really about it speaking to those people who don't want the world to change
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.760]   Unfortunately, the world needs to change in tech especially because if you don't have
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:11.480]   Yotan actually did a great job if you don't have that empathy if you don't have that understanding of your consumer is tech becomes less about
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.600]   Computing and more infiltrated into everything you're gonna build crappy products, right?
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.280]   Furthermore you're gonna perpetuate
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:28.880]   The mono culture because the only people to be attracted to the products you build are gonna be the people you know like you
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.920]   So you create a mono culture. That's not a good test does this
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:41.720]   We've been doing that's it with young people teenagers. It does it against like oh, I don't want to build smartphones for old people
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:49.000]   You know meanwhile sugar bugs over there doing a successful business. I mean there's look adventure capital in the things they invest in
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.560]   So Stacey's article is on medium by the way not on her
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.360]   And put that on the rundown so I could see it ahead
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.360]   Oh, sorry
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.800]   No, no, no apologize
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:07.400]   I'm just so I can make sure I see it but I just looked for your Twitter feed and I couldn't stop laughing about your dog
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:13.840]   That was a traumatic moment this afternoon
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:20.480]   For people for people who want to know I dropped some habanero raspberry jam on the floor my dog swooped in
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.920]   Oh, she looked it up
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:28.080]   No, she actually helped and then she started pawing at her nose and I was I was the bad guy
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:34.960]   So I wanted to defend myself. I didn't read this ahead of time, but we're in agreement on this not the Raspberry habanero sauce
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.320]   We're in agreement on this you say the world has revolved around
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.040]   white men's needs for so long
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:47.160]   That as their parents began to set limits they rebel and claim that's not fair. Yeah, that's not fair
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:54.000]   It's not right and I think you're exactly right. That's what's happening is this reflexive. No, we don't want it to change
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.040]   Exactly, but it's not my job and this is this is like this is the angry Stacey
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:04.600]   It is not my job to hold this dude's hand and to teach him all of this in a lot of that
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.560]   I'll call it emotional labor. I feel kind of cliche saying that is
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.920]   Women have to do that. We have to say oh
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:19.120]   Engineering guy here's why it matters that you need to care about other people are oh you weird introverted creepy guy
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.120]   I'll work around your schedule
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:28.600]   You don't have to do it and I understand why you're angry and as anybody who's been oppressed would naturally say well
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.000]   I'm not gonna help the oppressor get over their
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.960]   misguided notions
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.640]   But I will say as a as a fellow oppressor
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:41.120]   I would like to do that because somebody's gonna have to do this somebody's gonna have to drag not drag
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.640]   That's the wrong phrase
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.640]   Coarse could Joel
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:52.120]   Encourage the this though this patriarchy to start to be inclusive we have to get a way to do it
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.160]   That's why I wrote that article. I don't understand you
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.160]   I don't at all at all fault you for being pissed off and not wanting to do that
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.080]   It isn't your job, but I will take that job on as a member of the patriarchy
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.880]   Because it's it's you're right. It's better for everyone
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:12.560]   We just have to get over our like but I like it when I'm you know in charge
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:17.880]   That's what that's exactly what's happening all around right disruption is bringing a react
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:25.720]   We're seeing equal and opposite reaction happening challenge the nation brings nationalism challenged to the white majority brings white nationalism
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:31.040]   Challenge to male hegemony brings the so-called men's right movement, but it's a little more complex than that
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.880]   I recommend once again the data and society report about
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.680]   Media manipulation that came out a few weeks ago. It goes into great detail
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.040]   Well, not great detail. It goes in a lot of things, but but it's a very good explainer
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.680]   about the backwards
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.080]   world of
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:55.360]   This kind of manipulation of the dog whistles that that that if you if you think something's bad or wrong that oh
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.400]   We're just we're just lulls. We're just trying to try to show something. We're just trying to get a discussion. It's all
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.360]   I was just joking about beating up
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.800]   Yeah
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:10.240]   Well now boys with boys is a different thing boys with the boys is not joking about it boys will be boys is saying oh
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.520]   Well men are that way you can't change them
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:18.680]   And that's a little bit of a fatalistic point of view that's actually the latest one
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.920]   It's really wrong. It's meaning earlier. It's this from May 15th
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:28.720]   The spread of false or misleading information is having a real and negative effects on the public consumption and is and so it also talks about how
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:35.560]   the part of them the so-called men's right stick is that being a so-called loser is
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.920]   What they want to be because that's what ties them together because that makes them oppressed, right?
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.880]   But let me let me just take this and make it less general and more specific to our topic
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:52.480]   Which which I mean yeah basically
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:58.080]   That's all we've been covering for the last decade is how technology
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:07.920]   Is disrupting all the incumbents all the ways we're used to having things be it's very upsetting to everybody who's you know
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.480]   Grown up in a different world including me. I'm 60 years old and
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:20.840]   It's it's you talk about techno panic. It's that Jeff. It's that it's the disruption of somebody who had a job and doesn't have a job
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:26.560]   It's in the nature of this we're seeing you know change happens all the time
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.800]   But this is happening. I think I would say an accelerated rate
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:34.800]   We've never seen before in humankind maybe in 30,000 years. So it's
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:39.840]   Incredibly upsetting to people all people and not all no
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.560]   Those who are losing no
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.760]   Yeah, so we're losing a little over every but no no everybody's losing something
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:55.600]   Everybody's losing something the world you grew up in even if you're only 20 is changing and it's changing very rapidly and
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:01.760]   The natural human inclination is to say no and to and it comes out in a lot of ways
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:10.280]   I don't I think it's a mistake to say oh, it's them that are upset and we're embracing change in in there's in everybody's life
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.400]   Some aspect of this but also something more dangerous
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:22.880]   No, one's no, you know what I think it's a I think it's a huge stay totally gaining in this I will say every time
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.960]   people I have sat through so much crap and not had it been validated and
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:37.920]   dealt with sexism dealt with all kinds of things and now I'm actually gaining the ability to speak out against that so I'm getting
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.280]   huge amounts of
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:47.200]   Not necessarily power but as you hope I think it's a risky thing to pick winners and losers in this
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.840]   Because that's gonna further polarize
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.840]   It's not
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.440]   Understand what you're saying you are gaining however
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:00.080]   More politic thing to say that
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:07.000]   We are going through is disruptive to everyone and we all are gonna have to buckle down and
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:14.360]   Start to understand that life is not gonna be as it was but that's but that's but that inherent what you're saying is
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:20.800]   And I don't mean you're saying this but but but but but my reason of rejecting is because it sounds then as if
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.000]   The change is bad. No, it feels
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.560]   It is neither bad nor good. It's neither winners or losers
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:39.400]   That's one of the big mistakes we make that turns this into that polarizing point of view polarizing because some people are losing
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:45.160]   The way it used to be
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.000]   Most of us don't look at that as a loss if you're an African American person
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.080]   You don't say wow, I really wish things could be the way they used to be back when and even today
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:03.400]   I mean if you're an African American cab driver, you might be glad that there's maybe perhaps less racism
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.400]   But you may also be out of work
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.440]   soon
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.600]   The point is that that we are living in an unprecedented
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.240]   Generation of change it's we are disruptive
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.280]   You're we're seeing huge disruption in every area there if you're a winner in one
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:26.680]   I promise you you'll be a loser in another and we just this is gonna be one of the most difficult things for humans to go through
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:34.320]   We're not built to accommodate this rate of change. That's all so I would say and I'll I'll expand on kind of the idea
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:39.120]   Cuz I was you actually said it you were like your instinctive response to change is ah
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.440]   I don't like this. This is not fun and I said that in my essay
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.360]   I said it's not fair, but the response that you have to things being
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:53.360]   Upsetting and change messing with your life isn't to say it's not fair. It's to say holy cow
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:29:01.360]   What's happening reflect on how you fit into that and that is actually a recipe for success right when you're a cab driver without a job
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.720]   We're in agreement. So I would say we're in agreement. Instead of picking winners are losers are fair and unfair good or bad
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.960]   It were okay. I don't yes, okay
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.760]   I'm not saying we're in agreement there because I don't agree with you on that but what I'm saying is
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:19.440]   Tangential to that or next to that is the reaction you have to something being unfair is what matters
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:25.160]   Right and some people are actually gonna be better equipped if you're equipped to say holy crap this sucks
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.880]   How can I get around it? You're actually gonna be better off in a changed in a constantly changing world?
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.440]   I agree. So there's a couple of things
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:38.320]   I think everybody it'd be great if everybody could do one is to start embracing change one is to acknowledge that
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:44.280]   Change is discomforting and that we are all discomfort in one way or the other and to have some sympathy for people who are
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:49.640]   Discomforted by understand if you don't want to have sympathy for your oppressors. That's completely understandable
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:54.200]   But but I think that in the long run as a general rule
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:30:01.360]   It'll be better if we can all acknowledge that this is uncomfortable for all of us in some way or other and that the best way to
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.640]   Deal with it is to acknowledge that and to embrace the change as best we can we could agree on that
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.560]   The only thing I think that was a lot of things in there
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:18.640]   Well, I think I'm trying to kind of take a little more of a Zen approach than say hate the oppressor and say well
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.920]   I understand your Zen approach, but as someone who is
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.760]   dealing with this
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.840]   Often in a negative light. Yeah, I feel that a Zen approach will get me nowhere
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.600]   And in the past having a Zen approach has gotten me nowhere. Yeah, no
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.280]   Understand that's convenient for the oppressor for you to be Zen
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.880]   The masses right I mean you could be
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:47.760]   You could be Martin Luther King or you can be Malcolm X. I mean there are ways and ways to resist
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.520]   and I
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.640]   Just think that
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:58.200]   The thing that we've been fundamentally covering on this network and in tech in general
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.200]   But particularly on this network as we take kind of more
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:08.120]   Philosophical bent to it is the vast disruptions that are be that are occurring in our lives and are about to occur in even greater ways
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:15.200]   You know, we haven't we haven't seen the disruptions that crisper is gonna bring you know, you want to have a big debate over
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.680]   Jen over gender
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:22.640]   You know wait, oh, we have the ability to genetically modify babies. Oh
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.560]   My gosh, have you guys am I the only person who does this?
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.600]   Have you thought about what you would want modified?
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:36.480]   Constantly it's like thinking about what superpower you want. What do you want? What do you want? I want Sunblock
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:43.320]   That's called being an African American. You just want a little more you just need a little more melanin in your skin
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.160]   No, they burn too
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:52.280]   I I just I'm like God how awesome would that be with climate change being crazy and and then I want some sort of like
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:58.480]   Bluetooth headset that's constantly in my head although when you start talking about implantables standards become a real thing
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   I want the metaphors. I want to jack in
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:07.160]   Hmm. I don't like to wear a visor. I want to jack in and be in the new world. I just want to live longer
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.600]   But you'll let me ask you an unfair question if
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.360]   somebody on your staff had written a
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.720]   memo like this internally or you know done a show
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:23.080]   How do you as not just manager, but also twig is your twit is your brand?
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.960]   putting yourself in Google shoes and
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:33.600]   And running a culture and trying to have empathy inside the company and all that how would you react this happened to a twit?
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:40.400]   That's an interesting question. I hadn't really thought about that. I mixed feelings about them firing this guy. I understand why they had to
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:48.200]   Because he was creating a hostile workplace and that's if anybody did that here and it was clearly a case of being a hostile workplace
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.480]   Understand that this company's mostly run by women
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.800]   That I don't think there would be much tolerance for that. I think that person would be gone
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.360]   However, our hosts here are encouraged
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:05.400]   It's a little different for a host right you're encouraged to have to stimulate discussions
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.640]   I wouldn't I'm not gonna put a Sean Hannity on the show
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:14.480]   And if somebody started becoming a propagandist for a point of view that might be different
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:21.120]   But I mean I you know you one could maybe argue that I should be fired because I'm not I'm not saying this guy
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.800]   Should have been you know quardron and quartered and hung out to dry
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:30.400]   No, but if you got on your show and you argued that
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:36.160]   Women are not good candidates for engineering because we're neurotic
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:43.360]   I guess we'd have to do something
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:48.960]   Actually, I know you know we never had a case like I only have intelligent people
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:54.800]   That's an interesting question we okay, I've had okay
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:00.320]   This is not exactly the same thing, but we had somebody on one of our shows say that moon landing was a hoax
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.880]   Never had him back on
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:07.680]   It's not exactly the same thing. Oh, we're landing. I think he said we're landing. I'm landing was a hoax
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   We have had hosts on who believe in UFOs and I don't I can't really
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.760]   I
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.000]   Can't knock them for that even though we might disagree
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.280]   But I don't think we've ever had anybody come on ever
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:28.000]   And say well women are somehow less suited to techs to tech jobs and men. I think that have you ever had besides the moon landing
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Have you ever had something that's dumb? Have you ever had anybody come on and say something offensive and you or someone on the staff said let's not have that person back?
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.080]   Oh, yeah, yeah
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.520]   All the time
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.800]   We don't make a big deal out of it usually
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.520]   Last week show
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.880]   But we don't
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:54.160]   I kind of don't I don't want to cross over in a censorship either and
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:59.040]   So it's a little different in a like if somebody says put something in a company wall
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.600]   That's very different than if somebody says something on a show, you know, I'm saying yeah, yeah, so
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.240]   I if something like that we're posting our company wall. We probably fire the person. Yeah
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.640]   Yeah, I don't think that I mean
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.560]   Your audience would react presumably to someone who's just right
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.320]   A hateful person and you know, there are plenty of people
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:24.800]   Who are hateful on the air or and then the other thing to think about with a host is you could be perfectly normal
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.240]   And then you could do something crazy and like that's all that's all your staff
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:34.160]   But yeah, well that will be fired for that. So that goes into that hostile workplace. Yeah, we do have an HR man
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.600]   You know a man
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.880]   Employee manual and we have very strict rules just as google does and there are absolutely firing
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:47.200]   Offenses, I don't really do the HR lease it does and I can tell you I doubt very much
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:53.360]   She would tolerate anything like that day more so the other interesting part of this is that google now and I
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:36:01.040]   I think y'all know did the best expression of this and and and and put forward a summary that said if you were my employee
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.800]   Here's what would happen and here's why and so I think I think as a manager
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:11.520]   He did a good job with that but google is now in position wherever more they're gonna be seen as political in their actions
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.240]   Whether it's this
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:20.400]   Okay, so let's I wish we could throw the memo out and just say do you think google is left wing
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:27.920]   In other words is liberal it's very liberal, but look at it
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:33.360]   Because speech is not tolerated there like if you're no no no so not liberal like that
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.240]   Google is the anti conservatism in conservatism in the most
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.120]   literal sense of the word don't change
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.560]   Google is pushing things forward. It is constantly changing. That's right. So
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.640]   That
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.120]   Correlates to a lot of policies
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.680]   Just but I don't think it's politically leaning one way or the other
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:01.360]   Except when it benefits google the irony of all this and one of the reasons google did have to fire this guy
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.920]   Is their diversity is terrible?
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.200]   I mean really terrible
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:13.600]   Not well, it is 20 percent of women in tech jobs 1 percent of african-americans at tech jobs. It's terrible
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:20.240]   But if you encountered this in google, I mean i've had friends who worked for google and google does have a very
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.440]   big culture of
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:28.560]   Worshipping the stereotypical engineer. That's my point and yes
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.960]   Break out of that. No, but that's what I said in the beginning break out of that
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:39.440]   We have this picture of what an engineer looks like what tech looks like how a computer should be and and we need to
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:45.440]   Part of the reason that exists is because there's been this monoculture. We need it. We've got to break out of this monoculture
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.760]   It's a it's a terrible thing
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.080]   It's a terrible thing and it really hurts technology
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.960]   I think we agree there
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:00.240]   Yeah, we're all gonna not our heads to that. I'm no that's I think that's that's really the fun at the bottom line
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.000]   That's kind of the fundamental bottom line of all of this is
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.560]   You don't create a monoculture is not a good thing for a company that wants to make products for all the people
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:15.360]   Not just all the people in the US. It is tech in a nutshell. It's yes
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.040]   Because in the early days of tech and I was you know there
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:25.520]   It was a bunch of us guys and was media in a nutshell too in the day media was a whole white man
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.240]   And in a yeah, here's here's a key difference
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:36.000]   Right. It's my master stick in a mass world. You were making a single product for everybody and so the majority could be favored
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.280]   Two things have changed the majority in majority anymore
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:46.320]   But also google does not make and facebook is not a mass product. It is a personal services product
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.280]   So it has to work for people personally
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.920]   As their own and if you don't if you're not able to do make a product that that the service that does that for people because you don't
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:00.000]   Understand them and their needs and their presumptions then you will fail in the business
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   It was a lot easier making a mass product because you could just and television
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.040]   News all those products. You said let's get to the most people we can and then you could go niche
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:14.720]   Yeah, you go to a portion of that but google's very different. It's not niche. It's not mass. It's personal
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:22.080]   Did connor freeze and door forget this wrong freeters door in the atlantic he said the
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:27.200]   Media completely got this memo wrong. He said by labeling at anti diversity
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.880]   They were really misleading their readers about the actual contents. I
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:37.520]   I was oh, I read that and I thought that was just kind of dog whistling in some ways. Um, I think so too
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.560]   Because he was he's like oh this memo is really arguing for diverse
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.680]   You know
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:48.160]   Poor diversity and this guy because he says in the beginning that he's not against diversity
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.000]   right, you know, I could say I'm not a racist, but I
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:59.680]   Rames starts off there. It's just not fair having black people in the olympics because we white people can't compete against them
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.160]   there you go, I mean
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.520]   or
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.000]   You know, I mean it's the problem is it it's
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.160]   So ingrained in us and so we're fighting all of us are fighting an uphill battle in some degree with that's true
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.400]   Yes, that is true and so
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.440]   the best thing in my opinion to do is to say
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.320]   just what I keep saying which is
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.080]   as hard as this may be a monoculture is bad
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:32.240]   especially in a company that wants to produce products for everybody and we've and diversity is just
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.440]   It's like skittles. It's just bringing the rainbow
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.200]   And that's what we want
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.080]   I I'm gonna write the skittles memo
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.600]   No, don't leave
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:54.320]   We'll save you for yourself. It seems obvious to me that a we're discomfited by this and b it's obviously the best way to
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:59.120]   Go forward and we have to acknowledge our discomfort and still go forward
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:05.200]   This is also why i'm jacked to your your notion before that says that everybody is uncomfortable by change if you have been oppressed
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.280]   If you had a crappy life
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:14.000]   Then then no, you could welcome the change and the problem is that conservatives are the one saying that the change is bad
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.080]   Everyone's uncomfortable to change so let's deal with it
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:20.400]   That's picking one slice. No, there's also celebrate the judge. Yeah, that's picking one slice
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.920]   of
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:27.760]   Men white men who are been in power for very very long time have written history and would like to keep it that way
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.280]   and uh
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:35.600]   Well, of course they're going to be discomfited by the notion that it's they they're not going to have a monopoly on history anymore
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:42.080]   Um, I understand that you you would be discomforted too, but but what i'm saying is that if we were interested
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.360]   He's not discomfited by that stacy says it long friggin last
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.880]   Right, but she might be discomfited by something else. I don't know
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.520]   I
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.680]   Don't know it's just confident because it's stacy
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:42:01.920]   I would say your job here isn't just to be like hey, can't we all just get along and have a multicultural society
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:08.240]   I think we actually all have to do real work around understanding other people's perspectives
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.800]   Oh, I'm not saying that's easy or you know, well, I'm just saying the goal should be that right
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:18.960]   Well, if the goal should be that but you can't just I mean any manager will tell you you can't just set a goal
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.800]   You have to tell people how to get to that goal and that's what google's doing
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:28.080]   And some people will argue that he's saying that oh the way we said about going about our goal is wrong
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:34.560]   And that's a totally different discussion that no one can have because he filled his essay with so many freaking
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:41.840]   insults and dog whistles that that kind of gets lost and mother was it mother jones
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:49.760]   Uh had an article that said hey guys this memo looks fishy and their their idea was that this was kind of a
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:57.680]   All right kind of push out there to argue for free speech in silicon valley. So I don't know if that's true or not but
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.840]   The idea here is my brothers and mother jones always did like a good conspiracy
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.800]   There is yeah, there you go
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.880]   So let me give you a different example. So, um
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:16.160]   I can't talk about this. We're dealing in an organization where there's where there's where there's some incense
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:20.480]   Insensitivity going on and and I think it would be fair to say that people who are incensive
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:24.160]   Don't aren't aware of how they're insensitive, but they're in positions of power
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.000]   It's not not where I work. Don't worry. It's just a one thing I'm watching from from a distance
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.480]   And then how how do people who are not in power try to educate those who are in power about how you treat
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.880]   Those with less power. It's a dynamic that's pretty much impossible to fight
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:43.120]   And so you can bring in outsiders, but it's easy to say oh, yeah, can we be brought in the consultants? Everything's okay
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.120]   Um
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:50.400]   Uh and and and there's an educational process to bring up a different thing. So did you have you seen to trade?
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.280]   Yeah, oh no, I haven't but I want to
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.400]   So well, I've had different reactions to this. I thought it was was excellent, but obviously there. Oh, I didn't see it. I saw Munich
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.320]   What's Detroit?
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:06.880]   Detroit is Catherine Bigelow's movie about the 67. Um, oh, you're being you're being
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.240]   No
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:14.960]   No, I haven't seen it. It's Catherine. I have a little bit of a problem with Catherine Bigelow in general. So well, that's that's why I haven't watched it
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:19.680]   That's an issue. Yeah, and I I I've African American colleagues who say I don't I'm not gonna see it
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:26.160]   And I always want to say to them I get it, but I almost wish you would so that you could give her critique that would be meaningful
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.080]   Rather than just wait media giving the critique. Um,
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.480]   Catherine Bigelow is like Oliver Stone
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.800]   She seems to there's an issue with facts polemic to
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:41.600]   But yeah, yeah, it's it's it's all it's it always seems to be a political statement
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:46.320]   Oh, it's definitely a political day, but this is a death. I don't join movies that are
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:54.880]   Arguing a political it's it's a very powerful political statement. You could look at it as saying that it was a white director exploiting
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:59.600]   Black history you could also say that it was a white person
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.400]   coming to grips with
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.120]   White oppression, you know a lot of ways you can combat it
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:09.360]   That's kind of where we are as a country now is all I'm saying is that is that
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:16.000]   Uh, and then so then it gets then then if you try to have the discussion then it gets slammed into the political correctness debate
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.240]   Supposedly we've got a
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.880]   Is what I'm trying to say is this
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.640]   We don't know how to address this person to person. We're still bad at that
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:30.960]   And so my that's what's going on. Yeah, so my friend who is german
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.400]   Um, he actually whenever we go out to dinner
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:39.520]   We sit down and we start getting into these discussions and he always
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:43.840]   He confessed to me. He's like I always get so frustrated with you guys because
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.720]   Americans they get right to the interesting part of the discussion. Yeah, we don't leave it back right up
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:54.480]   He's like in Germany. This is where it gets good. I was like, yeah, we like confrontation here
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:46:03.280]   But I I do think under like learning how to talk to people how to actually listen how to be respectful
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.840]   in acknowledge
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:06.800]   that
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:12.400]   Your experience is not everyone's experience, which I think a lot of people have a real hard time with
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.480]   Um, well is yeah because it's not our experience
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:22.320]   That's kind of that's called empathy. You girls are good at that. We're not so good
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:27.200]   Not even funny
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.560]   It's girls will be girls
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.680]   By the way, I I read the mother Jones article and I want to retract why I said because actually the writer has an interesting point
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:39.760]   He thinks that this memo was intentionally made offensive. Yeah. Yes, so that he could get fired
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.800]   So that he could portray himself as a martyr
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:48.720]   And even go to court funded by some nice right wing think tank that I don't think is incorrect
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.760]   I actually think that that's probably the case because he he
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.520]   Bias he didn't need to assert for instance that there's a biological
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:03.200]   Difference to make his points, but he did he kind of went farther than more offensive than he had to kevin drum writing in mother Jones
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.600]   So it was embedded. Yeah. Well, I don't know if he's embedded or he just said
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:13.760]   I have you know, I think this is not an uncommon thing among certain alt-right
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.480]   believers
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:21.760]   You know people like my lawyer in opolis who take it the extra step because they wanted to become a cause select yes, yes
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:29.120]   Cult's need enemies. That's a strategy. That's a very oh, absolutely. I'm so well used well-known strategy
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:34.240]   Um, I'm sorry, especially if you're not really a persecuted or oppressed
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.120]   Right
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.480]   Milo's gay. I mean he could say I you know, I know what it means to be oppressed
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:45.040]   You know, so is peter teal and that man is doing a number on
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:51.520]   I mean, that's kind of what i'm saying is that nobody's in real life. Nobody's got it going on everybody's got it
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.960]   Got issue. I don't know what you're talking about. I have it going on
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:02.720]   I am number eight on some survey in pike golly. You are the winner here
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:09.440]   I am I am working hard to make things better. I have to admit when I read this when this whole thing started the last week
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:14.320]   I said I can't wait to talk to stacey about this and I uh, I did not anticipate frankly
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:24.640]   How upset you would be by it? I underestimated it a little bit. I I think you upset it's also a loaded word too. Well, I think you were very insulted by this
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:31.600]   I was I I feel well, it's because I have to argue against this stuff all the time and also
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:37.040]   as a woman in tech I get very frustrated when people
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.080]   talk down to me or they
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:44.880]   They um, oh, what's the word i'm saying?
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:47.680]   They oh man's planning happens all the time
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:54.720]   But it's and they make these assumptions about my knowledge base and as a journalist my job is to ask
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.960]   questions and to
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.120]   To try to understand and learn things so
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:02.800]   I don't mind people explaining things to me that are difficult and hard
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.560]   But I do mind
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:09.840]   When people give me the equivalent of don't worry you're pretty little head over it as opposed to a real answer to something
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:15.360]   Right or I mind when people hit on me when I'm asking them questions or when I get excited about something
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:21.040]   They think my excitement over software defined networking is actually my excitement about them and they're wrong
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:24.240]   That's awesome
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.160]   So let me give you a great example sweet. No, I'm really excited about software defined networking honestly
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.640]   Yeah
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.640]   Sided as you are
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:41.280]   So there was I've been trying to read more of the of the right-wing sites just trying to understand somewhat of what's going on
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:45.440]   So and not not you know, I need the far right wing the national review and so I forget which side it went to
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:50.160]   I went to a piece where it was trying to buy a lot it was it was basically
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.840]   It was the google version. It should have been it should have been the onion, but it wasn't the onion
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.920]   It was biologically explaining and justifying man spreading
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:03.120]   That women's hips are better book being straight together men's are wasn't just the obvious
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:05.760]   It was also about the bones and the hips and the whole thing
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.840]   Is a little
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:12.800]   Overly political to assume that man spreading is an attempt to dominate
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.600]   Women oh, I can't stand
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:21.760]   It's just they're saying they're saying screw anybody else who wants to sit here
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:26.320]   I'm just I somebody with with with weak adductor muscles
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.040]   And a very tight
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.960]   Ti
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:34.080]   My legs just naturally go that way. That's how they fall
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.280]   You know what?
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:41.920]   I close them otherwise when there's when I would like to do so the New York subway, but I don't right when there's a lack of space
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.080]   I punch you yeah, but it's work
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:49.760]   My favorite tweet was so I I tweeted this and I said of course this site would say this is part of the man's rights movement now
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:53.840]   Is to man spread out of my but the the explanation the one the great answer come
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:59.120]   It was man's plating man's planning man spreading well. Let me tell you honey
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.520]   if you
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.520]   I don't want to go any further
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.160]   Right now
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:10.640]   Should we move on to yeah, this is a killer. I'm glad we talked about this
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.920]   Thank you. Uh, let me just work question Leo
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:17.920]   Because it's a it's a particular talent of yours
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:25.920]   That there's a topic like this and at some point you have to personally have a fatigue about it to say i've gone through this
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:28.000]   It's difficult. Okay. We've already discussed it
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   Well, especially the way we do shows because I I do like this topic's been a topic of discussion for four or five
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.280]   So how many shows has been a topic on how do you how do you do that?
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:41.200]   How do you keep that fresh? How do you not say at some point guys? I can't do it anymore. You can't well
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.160]   I'm kind of slow
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:48.800]   So a lot of times my first take on something
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:55.760]   Uh evolves over the period of discussions with people more intelligent than me like you and stacy
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:01.920]   And so it it this probably drives our audience crazy if they watch all the shows they go well Leo's changed his mind now
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.680]   Uh
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:07.040]   Because but my but i'm i am slow and sometimes i need to talk
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.120]   My or not your you listen
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:13.680]   Uh, my nature is uh, it takes i chew on i'm a chewer
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.040]   And it takes me a while the kind of drives Lisa crazy
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.920]   She's a she's a she's exact opposite very decisive
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:25.760]   And and lots of evidence that being decisive even if you're wrong some of the times is more effective and chewing on things
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:29.760]   But i chew about it. It's just the way i am so I always have been the way and drives you crazy
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:33.920]   And so i chew on it and so it takes me a while takes me about four or five days and a lot of these
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:38.800]   Complicated issues to understand them to think about my thought and I spend a lot of time
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:43.440]   The worst thing jeff it's not just the shows I go home and I think about this i've been thinking all yeah
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:47.120]   I thought all night about well, what are we gonna how are we gonna handle this or what are we gonna talk about?
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:53.040]   Um, that's just the way I am and so it's fine for me. It works for me. It may not work for our audience
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:59.920]   I always assume that which is wrong that everybody just watches one show so this isn't repeating anything
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:06.880]   So you have you have rapid fail many of our listeners we know from surveys listen to multiple shows and they're probably very sick of it
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.880]   But screaming at their car radios right now saying yes
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:14.000]   but I and I also
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   To a fault as you well know like to look at the other side of stuff and put and
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:27.120]   I'm I tend to be more empathetic to people and to think about well
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.760]   How does that feel and why do they say that and?
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.200]   What do they think in there and try to get it from their point of view?
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.480]   Which is you know makes makes for lousy?
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.880]   discussions, but
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:43.600]   Well, it isn't because it's better in this kind of a form to have a strong position
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:48.560]   I didn't mean to delay the transition. Let's take it. Well, I'm glad you asked because nobody ever asks about me
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:54:00.720]   Anything else you'd like to know I'm glad enough about google. How about me? What about me this weekend leo? It's a new show
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:04.800]   Yes, I knew show well some would say they're all this week in leo. All right
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:10.000]   Let me take a break and we're gonna come back and talk more stacey higginbotham is here from stacey on iot
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.760]   Iot podcast calm do read her post on medium. Why did you post it on medium?
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:19.840]   Because it's not iot related. Oh, that makes sense. Did you link to it though from anywhere?
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:27.760]   Twitter my I did I put it on facebook this is this is hard with the fragmentation of stuff
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:31.040]   I'll put it in my newsletter. I'll be like hey guys by the way. I wrote this. Oh good
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:37.760]   Yeah, but that is not just my stop. So the title of it is guys
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:44.880]   It's time to grow up and you could search for google stacey's ties. It's time to grow up on medium and you'll find it
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:49.840]   Our show today brought to you and jeff Jarvis is here all the way from chicago

[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:04.400]   I was sent around the country to personally judge the best pizza in america
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.680]   This is where your heart problems came from
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:14.880]   Like god. This will be the most controversial thing said on this show. What's the best pizza american?
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.920]   I'm gonna really be mad at you if you don't pick the right one. I
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.960]   Judged it to be ginos east in chicago. Wow

[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:30.080]   That is not a good you gotta install them
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:34.800]   I'm like like someone sent me around to test moly or queso or
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.200]   Best Italian cake

[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.760]   Yeah, so yeah
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:06.480]   It's uh send me out for moly. I could drink a case of queso and still be on my feet
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:11.040]   Moly you like moly? I love moly. Do you like a spicy moly?
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:14.560]   I do i like it spicier less chocolatey. Yeah
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:19.440]   I had some uh very good moly in south america
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:25.520]   The best moly would bet so yes the best moly though is in south, mexico
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:31.440]   Where you get the south american influence, but you also get a Mexican influence and i think it's very i would recommend anywhere in wohaka
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.560]   Okay excellent moly down there
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:36.960]   let's all go
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:41.680]   I'm tired like i'm there i'm tired of this tech battle
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:47.760]   I'm taking my spanish again. So i'm ready for you good. I've got a spanish-speaking child. So
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:50.240]   I'm working it. Oh
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:53.600]   She goes to it. She's bilingual school, right? She is that's a sony
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.840]   That's such a good idea
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:59.280]   Our show today brought to you but well it solves a problem. I think a lot of you have
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:03.440]   I know I when we're doing the radio show people always call me say what's the best
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.400]   business accounting software what's the
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:10.640]   Nobody's ever asked me what's the best medical office management software
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:13.280]   But i'm sure that's because they think well i'm not gonna ask that doofus
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:17.040]   But I bet you what you do when you're looking for that kind of thing is you google it
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:22.000]   And then you what do you get you get a lot of undifferentiated results a lot of research to do
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.240]   Why go there when you can go to capterra go to capterra.com
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:30.240]   slash twig this is a free service
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:37.200]   It's a software comparison site for business software over 400 categories
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:42.960]   Thousands of programs and best of all more than 200,000
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:48.320]   Reviews and ratings from actual users they vet them they're they curate them
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:55.120]   So you get the best information about the software you're looking for look at all these categories. Let's say um
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:59.440]   I don't know. What do you what do you pick one Carson construction? There's a good one
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.520]   So I don't know anything about construction software. So you click construction now
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.200]   It's going to give you a bunch of construction management products. I mean like a hundred
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:12.000]   Maybe you want to narrow that down so go on the right there you could choose what capabilities
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.680]   You could say I only want to see four star reviews that are web based or or local based
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.800]   You could tell it all the things you need to do press
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:22.960]   You know filter
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:26.960]   And now you've narrowed it down to just the programs that do what you need them to do
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.600]   You can take it a step further put a checkbox
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.240]   in the bottom of the icon there
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.040]   I'm walking Carson through the site
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:40.960]   To pick one for the comparison see that you could pick up to four and they'll make a nice comparison chart for you
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:45.280]   With everything you need to know and then you can read the reviews you can really narrow it down
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.360]   This is so much better than a google search
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:56.160]   Know exactly what software is out there what fulfills your exact specific needs how people who actually use it review it
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:02.400]   And this is all free. There's not even any register. There's no obligation. You nobody's going to call your email you
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:06.000]   This is just a great directory and they wanted you to know about it
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.080]   I'm want you to know about a cap terra ca p t e r r a
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.480]   Dot com slash twig business software is expensive
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:20.000]   You know it's really expensive picking the wrong business software find the right software for your business free
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.560]   Right now at cap terra ca p t e r r a
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:32.480]   Dot com slash twig and we thank you so much for being on the show this week in google cap terra dot com slash
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.360]   twig
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.960]   See any good iot devices lately stacy is there anything you're excited about I bet you get that question a lot
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:46.720]   Ooh, um, I'm excited about the changes coming to home kit. Oh my god. It's so dark in here
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:54.720]   Well, maybe you saw my screen you should give a command to your lights to turn on or something. Oh, yeah, you get storms, don't you?
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.760]   I do. I think that's what's happening. I don't have um
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:04.240]   This light is not actually tied into something yet because I've got to save switches to test out new switches
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.800]   I've a refuge somewhere somewhere that's not why
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:13.520]   Home kit is apples home solution and you know this is we've talked about this before every year
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.160]   I would go to at com decks and then later ces
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.240]   I'd go to the home automation pavilion and there'd be all these vendors
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:26.480]   And all this promise and it was never intended for home end users. It was always intended for installers
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.840]   and uh, and and even then it just wasn't really a great solution
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.280]   It was like for the
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:38.560]   Hollywood director that want to press one button and his bed would rotate the curtains would close the screen would come down
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:43.440]   The picture would come on or whatever. It was not something normal people would use and now the tech community
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:49.040]   Industry has promised all this stuff. It's still hard to work together and so we need a hub
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.400]   We need something ideally we could talk to that's what I think apples. Uh, what is it?
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:59.760]   I home home pod home pod home pod. I think that's the point of the apple thing is you could talk to it
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.960]   And it will it will become a hub right so you're saying home kit
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.240]   We're seeing some improvements in home kit to support this
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:12.240]   Yeah, so there's two things. There's actually three things that I think are interesting here one is uh
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.800]   Oh, I'm just looking at yes
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.040]   So they're taking away their search ship
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:21.680]   So you used to have a have a used to have to have a certification chip in the physical device
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:28.880]   And they introduced this at wwdc in may and said and it was a very much a little aside
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:34.560]   They were like by the way people can have software based home kit and everyone was like what?
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:40.400]   Um, now that's interesting because that would have been a cost right and it would have limited
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.880]   How many devices would support home kit?
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:48.160]   It does it and like I had to buy separate gear if I wanted to update my home kit stuff
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:53.600]   Right, so the second thing so this is great because now people can retroactively add home kit to existing products
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.880]   We're not 100 percent sure how this program works yet
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:02.480]   I've been begging people to tell me you know and want to tell me i will keep it off the record because it's not hard where you now you could just do it
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.480]   software on anything
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:11.520]   It's not you can't you have to do something with apple you can't just magically make your stuff home kit compatible without working
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.560]   What do you have to do?
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.640]   You have to license that's the question
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.840]   It used to be that you had to be an mfi developer, uh, and get that license
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.520]   Or made for i don't yeah made for i's i
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:31.120]   Uh, so I don't know what they're doing now, but two is when the home pod comes out in December
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:35.920]   People can actually control stuff in their home even if they don't have an apple phone
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:41.520]   so like as an android user this is really important to me because I would never go all in on home kit because
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:47.920]   I can't control it from my phone. I don't often need to control my devices from my home or my phone
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.920]   But I would still be pissed off if I couldn't control it, especially because i'm the iti at her house
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.800]   Um, and then three
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.640]   I'm forgetting the third one. What is the third one? Oh my gosh. Oh
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.760]   They made it easy to run things without
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.520]   Uh having to in the home app on the phone
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:10.320]   So you don't actually have to play with all of your devices in like the 30 different apps you have for each device
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.800]   So that's kind of cool
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.120]   It's interesting that um, they've dropped the mfi
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.200]   Requirement, isn't it? I think they realized
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.880]   It's not but I think they realized they had the smart home was a thing that was happening
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.840]   Right
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:34.720]   And they wouldn't be a player if they did this probably if they forced everyone. I mean, let me tell you the entire
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:41.040]   Smart home device community was just they hated it. They hated working with apple
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.080]   Right as much they wanted to they wanted that apple marketing heft and that that
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.720]   credibility, but they were just like
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:53.440]   And remember though, this is a new market in some ways for apple
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:55.440]   So it's not like you you know
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.960]   If apple does something with the iphone everybody has to tow the line because you have hundreds of millions of devices out there
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:03.920]   But the all the home stuff is real relatively new
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.200]   And so apple and apple is not dominant in this market
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:11.360]   So I think apple couldn't act in the dominant way it would like to it with ecosystem lock-in
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:14.400]   Because yeah, well that dominant
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:20.160]   Right now the only dominant thing is the amazon echo you have to launch something with an echo skill. Yep
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.040]   That's about it, but that's easy to do
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.480]   Yes, well, yes
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:31.760]   Uh, and in getting I mean, it's be better if you had native integration, but they're working on that
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:37.840]   So and yes, the home pod is the speaker. It's an echo speaker like device that apple introduced
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:42.960]   When recently and then it won't actually be out until like december
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.960]   Yeah
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.960]   All right, very good
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:52.560]   Oh, someone called me on being the it guy as I said it was like, oh crap. See it's sexism right there in action
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.480]   And they're right
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.960]   I'm the it gal. I'm gonna say her
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.560]   From now on my new pronoun is her
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.360]   Oh, I got trouble for that you did
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:06.080]   Yes, I did what's wrong with that. I
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:12.640]   I the logic I'll screw it up till I get in trouble again by saying it. Yes. I I used in my book. I used
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.360]   I my default was female
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:23.280]   And then I do that all my articles I would I got in trouble that somebody came after me in trouble by some
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:28.000]   Jerko jerk or an actually no no no it was it was a feminist argument against doing that
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:34.400]   I can't remember what the argument was no feminist argument against doing that. Oh, I know by that. That's a crypto
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.720]   something
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:42.640]   The book this came up for me in my mind the other day. I'm listening to a wonderful book, which I highly recommend called sapiens
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.520]   by uvall nora harari
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:51.360]   And harari I don't actually know if it's a it's a man. He's a man harari
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:59.680]   Is writing the kind of book I love which is probably anathema to social scientists and historians and anthropologists and geologists
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.080]   Which is the broad brush?
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.480]   Look at how
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:09.600]   Societies work and stuff like that. It's the you know the guns germs and steel Jared
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:16.880]   Diamond kind of stuff. I love that stuff. He was going back to Alfred Toynbee who said geography is destiny all that I love all that stuff
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.400]   so
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:24.960]   In this though, he always uses the feminine pronoun her to talk about cavemen or neander tall or early almost sapiens
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.720]   It's always her and at first it's a little jarring and now I love it
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:32.160]   Why should it be him? Why should it be he?
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:36.400]   It's just I mean what I don't understand
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:42.160]   Why would you presume one gender or another ones is you know once as good as another and if it
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:46.160]   Why shouldn't it be she so I've totally got used to it, but at first it was like what?
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.560]   Every time he said it. Oh, she yeah, he's being he's being politically correct
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:53.840]   He's being inclusive
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:58.640]   And the reason yeah, you're right in the chat room the reason I'm reading this is because his new one
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:05.760]   Which is about the future of our species homo deus just came out and I want to read this before I read that
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:11.200]   Yeah, I like do you I bet you like that kind of stuff stays you too. I think you like broad
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:18.000]   But when I was in college they said oh you just love generalizations, but I
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.120]   tend to aesthetic stuff since this I read them but some of them irritate me. I really I actually like really
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.760]   This is not gonna surprise anybody
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.560]   Really in-depth nerdy. Yeah, you're a geek
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:37.680]   Like if I could learn everything possible about the subject in one book that's like crazy textbook thick
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.040]   Yes, I will there is one book that combines both
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:48.320]   geekery and broad generalities that you must read and you probably have read it George Gilder's microcosm
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:54.800]   No, I don't think I never did I should have you know, I'm sending you both copy of it as soon as we get off the year
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:03.280]   There will be a quiz. It's old. This was written 27 years ago. This is not a new but it is fundamental to understand
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.720]   What's happening today because it's the it's about
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.320]   uh
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.960]   The unique situation that digital technology is that as time normally
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.920]   uh stuff as time goes by
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.880]   uh, you know
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.600]   The normal case of events like a car, you know, maybe it doesn't ever get less expensive
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:29.280]   It gets more capable at the same price. Maybe if you're lucky usually gets a little more expensive with digital technology
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:35.120]   It gets smaller and cheaper by orders of magnitude every year and a half
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:39.840]   And actually that doubles every year and a half so it's not quite an order of magnitude
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:45.680]   But that's the idea is a very exponential rate gets smaller and cheaper and that's what's made all of this possible
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.880]   And that's the revolution. I'll fundamentally that's causing all this disruption that's making us all nuts
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:54.320]   Did you read about the eye gen?
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:01.360]   Uh, is that the new generation? Yeah, okay. I was like, is this a divisor? Is this the
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.680]   It's both uh article in the atlantic. It's actually
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.600]   a
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:12.000]   By the way, the atlantic had so many good articles this week that I I bought a subscription
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.880]   I said, you know what this is wow. I got us give them some money
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.440]   You know who owns the majority of the atlantic now
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:22.800]   Yeah, well I do it's uh, it's uh, it's uh, steve ji. I don't want to call her steve jobs widow
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.720]   But she is
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.600]   rainfall jobs laurie and emberson collective
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.640]   yep
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.160]   her her uh
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.160]   What would you call it?
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.360]   Fund it's a fund
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:36.320]   Fund fund for journalism the emberson collective. Yeah, she bought it
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.600]   I know the thing is other cause of the
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.880]   Controlling steak in the atlantic which is another reason I gave him 20 bucks
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:44.320]   Anyway, eye gen is a book coming out soon from dr
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:49.760]   gene twangie why today's super connected kids are growing up less rebellious more tolerant less happy
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:54.480]   And completely unprepared for adulthood. Oh, this this kind of generality draws me
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:11:00.160]   I know I know we've had and this is another example of something we've been talking about all week
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.440]   um, but I just
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:09.920]   This is technopanica this and this presumes that our kids aren't our own children aren't smart and aren't able to do things and learn and
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.720]   Figure out their own world better than we did. I just
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:19.120]   The premise is that since 2007 since the advent of the iphone and the smartphone in general iphone specifically
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.520]   uh children have
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:26.640]   Had their lives have changed they don't go out as much they stay in more they're safer than they've ever been
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:31.360]   They're having sex at a later age and she by the way dr. Twangie is a specialist in
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.200]   um in generational differences. This is her field
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.720]   Uh and she and there she quotes a number of studies
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.480]   Um, they don't that kids here's the graphs the kids
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.960]   Since the release of the iphone, they don't hang out as much with friends. They don't
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:52.240]   Drive at they drive it a much older age. They're dating less. They're having less sex
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.360]   But they're also more likely to feel lonely
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.760]   To get not enough sleep. That's because I know a lot of kids go to bed with their phones
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:04.240]   I go to bed with my phone. I'm in that group. It's different though because they you know
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.760]   I was my brain was fully developed before this uh the advent of the iphone
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:16.000]   Uh, this is about the generation that's coming of age with smartphones and snapchat and always on a constant screen time and all that
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:16.960]   So
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.760]   I have a I have a daughter who fits into this
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:22.400]   generation that's why I brought it up
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:27.680]   And two one of my good friends does generational research. He is a famous
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:34.160]   Speaker on that topic. Um, so we actually have a lot of conversations about
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.880]   generational differences and
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:44.320]   I think the way this is framed is very techno panicky. I do think the relationship that kids have with their phones
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:52.400]   Is unprecedented. I don't I mean I imagine it is very similar to the relationship teens had with their cars
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:58.720]   When teenagers actually started getting cars or having access to them or their you know, pick your thing
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:02.880]   You know, you can find techno panic quotes about kids reading too much
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.680]   And you know not getting outside
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:08.320]   Pulp fiction books. Ah
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:14.160]   So every generation has been worried that comics generation isn't going to be anything like it
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:18.720]   This is another example of they're changing and I don't like it because change is big go
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.920]   But and and and it fundamentally doesn't trust
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.520]   the next generation to adapt and create a new world
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.640]   It's the old generation different cars. So it must be bad
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.720]   I do think that we should be discussing though. So
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:37.200]   I don't think technology isn't inherently bad, but I do think
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:42.720]   We we've talked about this in the past, but the manipulation that that websites and apps have
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.520]   to keep people engaged
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:51.360]   and to bring them back and the influence of the algorithms that facebook or
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.880]   You know snapchat or instagram uses
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.960]   to
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.960]   Decide what to show you
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.680]   Those all are things that I think we actually do need to look at in how that affects
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:08.160]   Not just kids, but kids are more vulnerable in the sense that
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:12.480]   They're trying to figure out the relationships with their peers their world
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:19.280]   They don't have a sense of identity always that they can fall back on like if someone's a jerk to me on twitter
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:22.800]   I just close it down because I have a whole other life
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:30.400]   But when all of your peer group is on they're not on twitter. I'm just no, but you're right that the the opportunity for bullying
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:37.280]   I think there are real things that we need to look at but I don't think that this is
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.760]   I don't think technology is
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:46.320]   Bad for kids. I do think it does change some aspects of growing up, but that's the constant in the world
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.000]   It's going to happen
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:54.160]   But I do think I also think it's unprecedented. I think it isn't like books and and and cars and television my
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:15:00.640]   My parents didn't want us to watch a lot of television. This is kind of unprecedented because Stacy nailed it of the of the
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:05.840]   Thanks to massive data. We now can make highly addictive games
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:13.040]   So I remind you of what was the what was the play? What was the musical bye bye birdie? Yeah
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:16.000]   Right on the phone
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.400]   Oh my god. What's it doing to teenagers? They're all on the phone. This is ruining their lives. There's changing their social situation
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.480]   They're addicted to each other. They're talking to each other. No, I have faith
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.280]   in our kids
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:32.080]   I have faith in sleep. Yes with my phone
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:38.160]   I would literally fall asleep talking to my friends on the phone on my own my parents had to buy a second line
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.640]   And have it you told us you snore too so that yes your friends
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.760]   Good thing they couldn't record balls in those days. That's that that is true
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.840]   I don't think I snored when I was that young go
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:54.400]   It's it's now with allergies and moving to Austin and but too much time on the phone
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:58.320]   There we go. I do worry about here is bye bye birdie by the way
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.600]   I do
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.680]   That's uh and Margaret on the left on the phone with her friend and they just talk and I think it
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:07.520]   I think is the as the number goes along. They're all talking to one another
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:14.960]   Yeah, yeah, it becomes split screen and that's but I remember that when I was a kid that's uh
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.600]   That was a constant complaint of parents because I can't use the phone
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:23.680]   Uh because you know everybody's the kids that are always on the phone talking to each other when Abbie
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:26.400]   It's kind of funny my kid my daughter is 25 when she was growing up
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:31.600]   Um, she would uh be on um skype while they were doing homework
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.920]   So that she'd have video calls group video calls with a bunch of people
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.920]   When but then my son who's three years younger. It's all been snapchat
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:44.640]   Uh for him and facebook and it's very interesting the generations are actually changing already
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:48.400]   From three years every three years or something new
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:51.040]   Well, it's exchanged
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.240]   Go ahead and say say
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.240]   Well, I was gonna say and there's also
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:59.040]   Something this article didn't talk about and I wish they've been doing it in the locker room
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.600]   I don't believe it
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.600]   Okay, this is the silliest movie ever
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:14.720]   It really is it really has I have not seen it. You haven't seen by by birdie. Oh, you got it. It's fun. Oh, it's I'm younger than you are
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.800]   I'm sorry
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.280]   but
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:22.640]   But what I was saying is there is a very predatory
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:27.680]   Way that companies are taking advantage of kids and that is
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.880]   I don't care if your kids have to be better or what but I think as parents we do need to be
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.880]   um
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.480]   More aware of that like my daughter is on a game and I spend
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:47.440]   It's called star stables online and I spend a huge amount of time talking to her about how the game is manipulating her to spend money
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:50.000]   good, but it's
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.120]   That's making it a valuable education experience for her
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.200]   And and detestualizing it's like when we're young our parents told us how
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.680]   Television ads were manipulating you right?
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:05.360]   Well, I tell my daughter how television ads are manipulating and I tell her she's not on Facebook
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:12.160]   But we taught she's a big youtube user and like I started a youtube channel and she asked me literally every day
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:18.320]   How many youtube subscribers I have because this is a very important number chart. Yeah, it is to her generation. It's huge
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:25.680]   I didn't realize this is a horse game full of adventures. I've got a place star stable. No, great. Oh, oh god
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:28.880]   for
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:34.400]   My star stable. I am leela. Oh, I can see the torture. Oh god
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:39.520]   I don't want my horse to be I'm gonna have it be amethyst champion. There's my horse's name
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:46.000]   You can play for free for the first five levels at 75 dollars for an unlimited thing
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.960]   And then you have to talk about the body image of that young woman. Well, I don't see my daughter actually brought that up
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.920]   She was like I don't like the way the girls look they look weird like eels and I was like they do
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.680]   They do look freaky. How come there's no boys in this game
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:05.600]   This is not for me. This I know this is apparently there are boys that play it
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:11.440]   And they say yes god look at her like she is freaky looking
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.400]   Uncanny valley
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.840]   Yeah, yeah, and body does more fail all rolled into one
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:23.440]   So anyway, given her red eyes because she's been up all night on her iPhone
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:30.240]   But there's actually like they have a whole twitchy kind of thing about this where they the girls do
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:36.720]   Videos of their horses and they talk about like, you know how there's those swag haul videos
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:40.160]   They do the haul videos in star stables
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:43.920]   So you buy these virtual things and then you show your new
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:50.800]   Things that you bought in the virtual world and this is a big deal with the two cannot jeff in any way claim that
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:57.200]   Anything but that this company whatever this horrific company is is designing a product to be absolutely
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:59.680]   a money
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.680]   Squeeze money out of children
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:08.640]   Yes, especially fake hay, but you know on the other hand Leo I complained to show many years ago
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:12.640]   Uh when my then young daughter was was playing with american girl
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:17.920]   Was american so much money on american girl doll that but then there was also there was a special
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:22.880]   Around it there in Chicago. You could go to the american girls doll store. They have a little bring your doll
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:26.400]   They have a tea part. I did this. I took my dog. I would look like a very dirty old man
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:30.800]   Party but I brought my daughter and she brought her best friend
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:35.760]   They both bought the american girl dolls the two dads and the two daughters and then we and then we said
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:40.720]   I said we'll go to the american girl will store in the tea party. They have a little chair
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:43.680]   But we're going on cubs game
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:48.320]   And then I never forget the image of me holding the american girl doll in the bleachers
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:51.280]   That wriggly field and my daughter sat in front of me
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.560]   Saying this is boring dad. I know but it's fun
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:21:00.880]   Now she liked it. She'll never forget that that was a great trip. We went they have a little hospital there for the american girls
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:04.000]   Yeah, yeah, so no, but that's not as a dick. They had a social
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.720]   They had a social network
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:12.240]   For right and you can argue on the one hand that this is a exploitation just for the brand and like the arguments facebook does everything
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:16.640]   Just to get you on war and but but my daughter when they closed it my daughter was crushed
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:21.040]   Yeah, it came as a community. She had it was a safe community with with friends. It was gone
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:25.840]   Um, you know that that's true the example you gave me yet. That's pretty awful
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:31.520]   But we shouldn't presume that just because the company makes it and the kids like it that it's necessarily awful
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:34.960]   It depends on how it's done. Oh, right. Well, well, yes, I just feel
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:39.280]   We do have to acknowledge that there are different
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.440]   different ways your kids are going to be preyed on in
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:50.000]   In each technological evolution and so we have to and in this one's particularly
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.800]   I guess insidious because it's
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:58.320]   It's woven into the fabric of some of these things and it happens a lot of time when
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:02.240]   The computer like on the computer or the phone you're not
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:10.000]   With them, you know, like it's not like you're teaching your kid how to drive or it's not like you're all watching tv as a family
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.360]   And you get a chance to talk about this together. You have to be very active
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.800]   And I don't spy on my child. I don't do anything like that
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.880]   So for all I know terra we do talk about not being able to unsee things
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:25.120]   And yeah, that's a big one right because kids will see things that they're really not ready for
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:27.920]   Uh, two things. I'm not ready
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:33.760]   Yeah, but we we can deal with it right. They don't have any context to deal with it. I have never
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:39.440]   Seen two girls one cup. I've never seen goat. See. Yeah, you don't want to see that stuff. Yeah, because right
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:45.280]   I just like I can as soon as you say either one of those I actually you know, I can see I bet you think about it
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:50.080]   I don't know. I don't think about it, but it's but you brought it up and it's in my mind. It's there. It's stored away
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:54.320]   So I don't know thanks a lot. Thanks a lot stacy
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:23:00.480]   Well, we're doing a grand social experience the truth I would say the truth is we are doing a grand social experiment
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:03.360]   for instance, uh, lisa's son is 14
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:06.160]   lots of screen time
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:11.360]   Fairly less a fair in fact. We made the decision. He's going in a high school that he could have the computer in his room now
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.360]   We're setting up tomorrow
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:16.560]   Uh, but uh, Megan moroni's kids
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.880]   She's very she's much stricter
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:21.760]   The all the all the digital stuff is kept in one
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.040]   Charging area and it has to be left there at night
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:28.320]   And she and I mean it's really and she's got controls on the thing
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:31.840]   So we're doing a social experiment to see which kid turns out to be a serial
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:35.120]   Killer
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.520]   I like how that's your opt
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:40.080]   Screen
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:43.360]   Uh, oh as a as a father god
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:51.440]   We couldn't drive by uh 7 11 without stopping to buy pokemon cards all lot and they're you know, it's a cardboard for 15
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.440]   Dollars. I mean they're really expensive
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:57.280]   Or they're tie care bear things those little bears right tema gotchis
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:02.400]   No now that too. No, no the little stuffed animal little stuffed. I would say it's not only content
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.680]   We have a thousand of those
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:10.800]   So much but that's your kids who young for that
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:13.440]   She's too young for that. Isn't she?
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:20.560]   They had baby. Yeah, she's only they be babies like 15 years ago. Oh, Leo saying it was all over
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:24.960]   It was over by the time she was oh no no no she's she has like
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:31.680]   I she does have more than 60 of them and you walk into a room and they all look at you with their big beanie eyes
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:38.000]   All our our old studio was actually uh where we because it used to be a drugstore before we moved in
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.320]   It was where we bought the beanie babies when my kids were little
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:44.160]   I used to bring them back from the airport whenever I travel
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:50.160]   That's fine. That's nice. That's a nice gift. That's good. That's not bad. You traveled a lot though
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:54.560]   Yeah, I was like my husband travels. I travel not so beanie babies
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:58.160]   I guess the point being is this a continuum from every generation?
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:01.600]   It's always been like this and it's just steady state or is it getting worse?
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:07.040]   I feel like it might be getting worse because of technology being better more adept at manipulating the kids
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.040]   Ah
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:12.800]   That's or the kids are getting smarter. This is where Dana Boyd
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.200]   I'm coming to know who used to study teenagers
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:20.640]   We have to have faith in your kids. They are inventing the systems to work around that right with so so she
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:25.840]   One of her great examples that I love this from Dana was that was the presumption that we old
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:30.000]   Oldsters make is that kids don't care about the privacy anymore. They just share everything and Dana said no
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.560]   They came up with languages to do things. I might have told the story on the show years ago
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.960]   But a girl was on Facebook
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.960]   Um, her mother was on Facebook. She was okay with that, but the girl was having trouble with the boyfriend
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:42.960]   She didn't let her mother just mother her with love
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:46.880]   So she went on to Facebook and she put up the lyrics to and I always forget this
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:49.920]   The end of life of brian when he's crucified
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:52.720]   Every sperm is sacred. No
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:01.120]   Always look on the bright side of life on the bright side. Yeah, right so her mother thought oh, oh good dear
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.240]   You're having a wonderful day and every friend came in and said oh my god. What's wrong?
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:11.360]   Because there was a secret language the protected privacy. That's right still communicated that exists. It's got to have
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:17.840]   Is that great? Did you see the study that that that you can tell whether somebody is depressed based on their instagram posts?
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.800]   I thought it was their facebook posts
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:22.560]   Uh
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:29.520]   Also their voice. Well, this is a race. This is a recent their general unwashed appearance. This is in fortune magazine
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.760]   Uh
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:39.200]   This is from uh, the university of vermont and harvard, uh, published in the e-p-e-p-j data science journal
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:45.120]   They built a tool to scan instagram posts that could accurately it could accurately identify depression
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:48.240]   in 70 of the studies participants
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:52.800]   Doctors are only at a successful 42 percent of the time
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:59.040]   They looked at 44,000 instagram photos posted by 166 study participants
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:02.880]   About half had been diagnosed with depression in the past
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.120]   They analyzed things like hue the use of filters the presence of people
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:10.320]   They were able to determine depression markers
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:14.800]   For example depressed people were more likely to post photos with darker gray colors
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:22.960]   They liked the inkwell filter you ever use the inkwell filter? Mm-hmm people aren't depressed use the valenciia filter
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:29.040]   So all the way back in 2014
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:35.200]   So this is this is a fast company article from 2014 and says your facebook status updates can show if you're depressed
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:38.160]   But now we've got a computer program that does it
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:43.200]   And with the greater accuracy than a clinician
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.760]   Now before okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna give you another data point on this
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:50.080]   my contention that
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.080]   it's getting worse that the that
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:28:00.000]   Kids growing up in you know playing video games all day or on their phone all night are more
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:07.600]   Uh, you know disassociated from real life and we'll end up growing up with social issues and it goes
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.120]   The theory
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.360]   Okay, but let me give you this data. Oh, it's not done. Okay. Sorry. It didn't point Steve bannon
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:16.480]   *laughs*
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:19.920]   Now now he didn't grow up in his basement. I don't know where he grew up, but the point being
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:26.080]   He had an insight because you remember after he he was at Goldman Sachs Goldman gave him money to create a
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:31.680]   gold farming business in Asia they hired Asian kids to
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:37.360]   Create wealth in world of warcraft which they would then make money on by selling it for real money
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:40.080]   to gamers world of warcrafters
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:46.400]   But his business ended getting shut down. Did you read this? His business ended up getting shut down
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.960]   because
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.800]   of gamers
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:54.800]   Who took this as a huge violation of integrity as cheating?
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.480]   And he discovered it this time. This was a late 2010 in around 2010
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:06.800]   That the that these this is the quote from Steve bannon these guys these rootless white males
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:09.440]   Had monster power
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:17.760]   It was the pre-read it he discovered a world populated by millions of intense young men who have been been socially maladripe or were smart
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.120]   focused
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:25.520]   Relatively wealthy and highly motivated about issues that mattered to them and it was this insight
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:28.160]   that
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.560]   Brought him to build up bright bark to bring in yylo yenop, my low yenopolis
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.560]   Because unopolis could whip up disaffected gamers and in fact
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.760]   was a big fueled gamergate, right?
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:44.560]   So is there a class of kids
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:49.440]   Who grew up kind of with his anomie who are being manipulated
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:53.600]   And are in fact a danger to our society. That's my thesis jeff jar
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:59.440]   Or did the anomie to the anomie come from us as parents being overly protective and and this is going to go back to that
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:03.920]   The basement no, that's how they ended up in the basement. I agree. We we don't go outside
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:08.240]   It's ranger danger. We had to schedule their play dates
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:14.480]   Uh, you know, this is a conservatism. Why dare we just the kids the parents just kicked us out of the house and we went out and played right?
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:17.040]   Well, i'm not i'm not debating the cause of it, of course, but
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:20.240]   So it could be
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.680]   Dangerous people
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:27.520]   I'm going to agree that kids today have a lot more anxiety and stress than we had it could be parents. I win
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:30.160]   It could be lots of things. I win
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:32.640]   victory
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.080]   All right, moving on
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:40.720]   Now you want something scary google has decided that the next project deep mind will take on i remember it's the goat champion is
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.720]   starcraft
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:47.120]   See i'm worried about about deep mind that it's going to have a bad adolescence
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:49.520]   I think this is unfair
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:56.320]   If deep mind beats everybody at go, that's one thing that's a human game, but starcraft is a game created on computers played by computers
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:00.800]   It seems like a computer would have a real advantage. Of course a computer can win
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:03.920]   starcraft
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:07.040]   There a deep mind is analyzing 65,000
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:10.400]   stark played past starcraft two games
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:15.520]   to apply machine learning techniques and become a starcraft master
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:22.320]   Well, how much is starcraft depends on hitting the right button at the right time all 100%
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:27.200]   Okay, so yeah, the computer is going to totally win at that. I wouldn't win
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:33.440]   I mean even even jeopardy which part part of jeopardy is hitting the button at the right time
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:35.920]   Right if you if you listen to ken jennings talk about it
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:44.720]   That was that was an advantage that watson had now to beat watson you had to buzz in before watson did right but
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:47.600]   Watson should do it perfectly every time right
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:54.880]   It did wait for the end of the question watson. Well, you have to that's the wrong you have to wait a lollocks stop stalking
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.440]   Then you can oh really? Yeah
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:00.000]   When I play at home shouting at my television
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.120]   Oh no, I take pride in answering it before Alex steps talking
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:10.960]   I I try to answer the first five words. Yes every grandfather does that yes, I know i'm that guy now
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:15.520]   I sit my easy chair. It's got a dent where my butt's been for the last 40 years and uh
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.480]   Shout all right. Here's the real litmus test
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:21.840]   Wheel of fortune. Yes or no. No
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:24.560]   Good. Thank you
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:27.520]   Sometimes i'm watching jeopardy and it comes on
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:35.360]   I don't actually watch any of those types of shows because I don't have uh tv. I don't have um
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:38.480]   Over the air television play it on your echo, you know
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:43.520]   Wheel of fortune no jeopardy. Oh
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:47.440]   I lost to watson at jeopardy. Oh, okay
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:54.160]   I keep saying i'm gonna take the jeopardy test and try to get on jeopardy, but I've always wanted to do that
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.400]   That would be the greatest thing
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:33:02.160]   I was better at what they should do they should do a geek because they're everybody on every on wheel of fortune is a geek
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.080]   Anyway, right, but then they should do a tech
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.240]   equation
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:10.400]   No, no jeopardy. He's not wheel of fortune. He's kidding. I'm with a fortune used
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:13.360]   Okay
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:19.520]   I'm just trying to take your pills. Jeff. It's time to take a break. Jeff. Jeff Jarvis is here. He's from chicago

[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:58.000]   That we have uno's out here, but I can't imagine it's as good as uno's in
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.680]   Chicago
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:02.720]   Uno's is like it's a chain a deep it's a change now

[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.360]   to scooter x who posted an explanation for something that just started driving me nuts which is
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:30.480]   Google photos requiring you to say boom delete before you can actually delete like to confirm a delete before you delete your
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:32.480]   You have to say boom
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:35.840]   You don't have to say boom. Sorry when you when you delete your photo
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:41.440]   We are you sure you want to say see clicks. She says boom. We now know that boom
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:48.400]   I do I'm very definitive and decisive in my clicking so the before they didn't ask you to confirm it
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:53.920]   They just deleted it. No, they just they just let you undo it but now and I was right there wasn't a do yeah
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:38:00.000]   I delete like my my accounts. I am so OCD about it
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.800]   I am like those are I go in and delete photos
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:06.240]   So this is like driving me absolutely bonkers because I'm like
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:09.520]   Yes, I want to delete it. Stop asking me
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:13.280]   Well, but there's it's not a big deal
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:16.560]   It is a big deal. It's an extra boom
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.800]   It's not
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.640]   Happening to you
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:23.200]   It's part of this like medium manipulation
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:28.800]   You're just making it that much more difficult for me to do the things to get my data and make it go away
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:32.080]   All right, let me just show everybody and they can decide if it's a boom
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:35.920]   So you're here in google photos. You say, you know, I don't really like that photo
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:40.640]   You click so I selected it click the trash can and then it says move to trash
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:42.720]   It will be removed from all photos
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:48.480]   A folders rather so that's good to know it's going to delete all and then move to trash boom. How hard is that?
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:51.360]   Three versus two clicks
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:56.480]   So I think it always did that you're saying you would just you would just press the trash can and we just throw it out
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:00.400]   It would just go and then it would do a slider that says would you like to undo this?
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.520]   Well, you still get the slider that you can undo it, which is nice
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:06.720]   Oh god, that's even two
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:07.840]   anyway
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.360]   I just
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.120]   I was irritated
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:13.120]   Thank you scooter in the past
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.720]   So this is a scooter linked to an article from 905 google in the past
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:21.280]   Deleading an image on google photos would automatically send that picture to the trash a snack bar
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:27.520]   I didn't know that's what you called it, but that's what they do apparently would slide up from the bottom of the display and offer users a chance to undo their action
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:31.440]   However, it would off would disappear after a few seconds and could go unnoticed
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:35.360]   So they're just trying to protect people from accidentally deleting their pictures
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:38.800]   You can undo it if you accidentally delete it now
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:45.280]   I've got to click an extra button and I delete like 50 or 60 photos at a time. So that's 50 or 60 extra
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:50.480]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it doesn't do that. It just does it once no
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:53.920]   No, it does it on your additional
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:56.720]   Let me delete let me delete six photos, okay
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:02.000]   Oh, so I I delete mine one at a time because I want to look at the photo before deleted well well
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.040]   Stacey there is an easier way
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:08.880]   You can select multiple photos just like that
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:12.960]   That's what I do when I delete all the receipts that I had to take you know for my expensive
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:18.160]   To save the time that they just used up you know that it will now in the assistant
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:24.480]   Pick up the receipts and say would you like to free up some space? These don't seem to be anything you want to you would want to keep
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:28.960]   Did you see that? Oh, I did not see that. Isn't that not because I don't have
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:33.440]   My photos are terrible. They're like me and my child my dog and then
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:38.720]   8,000 photos of gadgets and then a bunch of weird people from CES or whatever tech show I met
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.440]   so google's like
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:45.760]   I I now get a classification that says these uh these look like
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:50.960]   Diode's like receipts. I don't I don't think they do diodes. That would be pretty funny
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:56.320]   I that would actually be a very useful classification. You seem to have a lot of pictures of diodes
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.320]   Maybe you'd like to delete some of those
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.880]   I haven't seen that one yet
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:04.400]   I like google photos. I don't I don't find that onerous
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:08.960]   I like google photos in fact. I just sold my friend on google photo
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:12.080]   She's on an iphone and I was like, oh, yeah, let me show you if you
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:16.240]   Everybody should be using an iphone or android. There's no reason not to use it
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.240]   It's crazy if you don't use it
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:20.480]   Did you see that google is gonna buy snap?
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:23.360]   For 30 billion dollars
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:26.160]   No, no, that was last year
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:34.000]   You couldn't get it for 30 billion right? Yeah, right. Okay. Sorry. I don't know. Let's see
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.360]   Okay, google
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:40.800]   What's the market cap of snap? Do you think you'll find it faster or me?
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:44.240]   The market cap is
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:46.080]   15.9 billion
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:50.560]   Whoops, maybe they should have taken that 30 billion dollars when they could have
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:55.040]   Three people inside and close to the company according to Alex Heath the business insider separately confirmed
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:59.200]   They heard the chatter that google was going to buy or had floated an offer of
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:06.720]   30 billion dollars they confirmed the price to with one calling it an open secret among snaps upper ranks in certain industry
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:09.440]   circles
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:13.520]   So we'd heard this rumor last year, but this kind of confirms it
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:15.920]   and
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:17.920]   Yeah, with with
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:22.720]   So they got a valuation in may of 20 billion and they're currently at 15 billion in market cap
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:25.760]   Because their stock's been hurting after the instagram
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:28.960]   copy, right?
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:33.840]   But in fairness, you know getting bought by facebook versus getting bought by google
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:38.880]   You're gonna end up with very different trajectories anyway. I mean, it's not 30 billion from google
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:45.120]   Right. Sorry, but if you thought you could do a better job than google building a a picture centric
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:48.400]   social network, which I've had a lot of people thought
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:53.440]   Yeah, well, I think google learned a lesson in two in 2013 or google still trying
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:58.240]   Was we reported on a rumor four years ago that google had offered four billion
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:03.200]   Uh and that that snap had turned them down and zuckerberg
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:06.000]   but believe it
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000]   And four billion sounded like a lot
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.600]   30 billion that's hard to turn down 30 billion dollars
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:15.520]   But you know if you think the upside's bigger and they knew they were gonna go public and
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:20.560]   Wow
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:21.840]   Yeah
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:24.560]   All those kids eyeballs ready to be manipulated
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:28.320]   That's you know, that's exactly what it is
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:33.440]   Have we talked about the essential phone getting crazy dollars and coming out?
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:34.720]   Are we talking about that?
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:39.520]   Really? I mean, I ordered one. Uh, I don't know it's it was supposed to come out in june
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:45.760]   This is andy rubin the guy who created androids and was at google behind android until he
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:49.600]   Uh got promoted to robotics and then left the company
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:52.560]   Um
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:56.400]   What's the story? I mean, i'm waiting for it. I got I reserved. Let's see
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:00.160]   What is this? Was there a delivery date? Yeah, well, he said
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:04.000]   The launch date is coming next week now. Oh, I thought there was also some money
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.640]   He said it recode that they were gonna come out in 30 days that was in june so they didn't make
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:11.600]   Oh really? Oh, I think so 699. What is it?
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:16.800]   Five they've raised 500 300 million in funding. I said, okay 300 million
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:22.560]   So the wash and your own Amazon. Okay. Okay. Yes. That's what it was. Uh, I was like
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:24.560]   There's a lot of dollars in my brain
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:30.240]   Um, and then they also said that time to buy a phone right now or buy a phone company for that matter
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:36.960]   It's just you're everybody's waiting and I think rightly so to see what apple does and even if not apple
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:40.000]   We're gonna have august 23rd the galaxy note eight
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.120]   Uh, it's probably sometime in november google will uh announce its new pixel phone
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:50.320]   These are the big big players. I think this is a bad you think apple can do anything
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:53.360]   groundbreaking
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.360]   Yes
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:57.520]   Believe it or not
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:59.840]   Are they doing 3d image censoring? Yes
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:05.520]   Guys you guys when this happens i am ready to talk about it because i learned all about 3d sensors
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:11.520]   Sorry, we talk i'm not sorry. I don't think you were here last week. Don't be sorry about
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:19.040]   Uh, very good article in medium by an expert in augmented reality about why apple is going to eat the world and why google didn't
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:21.840]   Google's tango technology. Yeah, wasn't that good?
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:28.640]   That was good google's tango technology and holla lens from microsoft both are very similar to apple's technology
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:32.160]   In some cases, uh in some senses holla lens is superior
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:37.120]   But it won't be out till 2019 and google was at it as advanced because unlike apple
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:43.680]   They don't control the hardware platform and you need to do both hardware and software to make this work effectively
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:47.520]   Which is why apple when it releases an augmented reality phone
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:53.840]   Uh kind of like tango we've ordered the zen phone. Uh, just in hell ordered the zen phone ar
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:58.320]   So that's that's a tango phone one of the first consumer grade tango phones
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:02.720]   But i think apple be just by virtue of a hundred million phones
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:06.800]   Something like that the next six months will be dominant
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:10.000]   actually more than that because
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.800]   Every phone since the five s once it has ios 11 will be capable of augmented reality
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:18.160]   But you want the extra hardware that the new phone comes with
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:27.920]   Do you think stacy ar is is a gimmick like vr ended up being or is it no? No, I think ar is really exciting and
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:30.000]   Really useful
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.600]   not just in
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:34.480]   consumer things where I think it might end up being a gimmick for a while
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:38.080]   I think in industrial things it's gonna be it already is being
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:43.120]   Effectively used to increase productivity and make life a little easier for people
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:46.560]   So I am very excited about ar
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:50.000]   I know as as
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:55.360]   In the form apples proposing i'm not all that exciting, you know the idea that you hold up your phone and
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:57.920]   it's like pokemon go and you see
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:00.880]   That's why I think industrial is gonna be really
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:03.680]   Like google glass
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:06.800]   Well, it's the same way the personal computer
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:12.480]   We all looked at or the sorry the computer was a business machine first and we had to be to get the economies of scale
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:14.880]   The software written to get all of this done
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:20.640]   Cost a lot so you needed a customer who could pay a lot but the way electronics work
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:26.560]   You then push that out to the consumer. So I think we're actually with ar gonna need that business
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:30.960]   Kind of economies of scale and impetus to help develop the right ecosystem
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:35.120]   And then it'll come down to consumers and we'll start seeing better heads up displays
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:38.240]   Um
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:40.240]   Maybe then this is perfect
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:44.720]   For you and me and jeff team ovals new
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:49.360]   Jump on demand lets you upgrade your phone every 30 days
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:52.400]   I would hate that
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:54.400]   Even I even I
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:56.400]   Even I
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:02.400]   Wasteful shall we say you need to enter an 18-month lease agreement after which you could pay off the rest of the cost of device and trade it in
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.080]   Or start over
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:09.120]   But uh the original jump on demand was three device upgrades a year which seemed like an awful lot
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:13.040]   Um, they don't say what devices are included
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:19.680]   But according to a reddit thread s8 s8 plus g6 moto z2 force are all available through the program
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:24.800]   Do people not have a lot of things on authenticator and other apps that I mean jeez
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:26.400]   Well, I
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:29.600]   Will talk for this because I am always you know trying different phones
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:34.880]   It's not if you know what you're doing. It's very easy to set up a phone in such a way that it'll in an hour or two
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:39.440]   overnight your your new phone could do well. I don't have to spend that time
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:44.320]   But I mean I I you know you you copy copies over very quickly and you use like aawthi
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:49.600]   Which is a account based authenticators? So it has all of your authentication. It's not so hard to do
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:57.120]   That's the biggest complaint. How do I how do I move my authenticator stuff all over without having to start using aawthi a u
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:58.320]   Why?
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:03.280]   Okay, which is a it's exactly exactly the same as google authenticator with one exception you have an account
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:06.800]   And you it stores your authentication
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:12.000]   Information in an encrypted fashion on their servers. They can't see it only you can see it
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.760]   It's trust no one encryption
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:16.240]   But that means when you set up a new phone you put aawthi on it
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:21.040]   it down you can have it download all of your authentications and
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:25.680]   And then you want to encrypt them and you're good to go and that's what I do now. It's it's okay
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:31.520]   That could save me time. Oh, it's huge because that's the that's the biggest thing when I I'm like
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:36.480]   So I I do that I save my desktop layout, which is also complex
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:41.600]   You know a lot of widgets and stuff, but I use action launcher, but nova launcher a lot of launchers will do this
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:45.680]   Will let you save your layout not just to the phone, but I save it to google drive
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:51.120]   So when I get a new phone, I you know you log into your google account. You say download all my apps
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:53.920]   It downloads all your apps
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:59.040]   Then I download this set the layout and that's immediately applied
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:00.960]   And I'm pretty much good to go
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:05.360]   The only thing that takes time is logging into my accounts because your passwords aren't preserved
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:09.600]   For good reason, but if you use last pass or some sort of password manager that
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:15.600]   Fills in the logins. It's pretty quick to get everything up to speed. I can get a phone up to speed pretty quick
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:19.360]   Most of the what takes the longest time is downloading all the stuff. So I do that. I'm sleeping
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:23.360]   At least at least you don't have to do it anymore. Yeah, it's much easier
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:28.880]   That is it's pretty it's the worst. Well. Yeah, and you can do that with an iPhone by backing up the iPhone and restoring it so
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:36.000]   You're all gonna want an iPhone. I'm telling you I the more I think about it the more this new iPhone
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.640]   Is gonna be a game changer
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:41.200]   Oh, you want you want to know why I think that?
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.360]   Yes, I do number one camera
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:48.560]   Not just for augmented reality. I think that's gonna be interesting, but not something you're gonna have to have right
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:51.120]   That's it's gonna be kind of you know interesting
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:58.160]   But the camera itself I think the computational photography it's gonna be capable of partly because of these new sensors it needs it for ar
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:02.160]   Is going to be a truly remarkable camera. I'm hoping
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:04.800]   We've seen already
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:09.920]   But we have also seen we've also seen other evidence
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:13.360]   That the camera is gonna have some interesting new capabilities
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:18.160]   For instance, we talked about this on Mac break weekly yesterday. Um, it's going to store
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:21.840]   It's going to use a new format the
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:28.320]   High efficiency format instead of jpeg jpeg as as you probably know when you take a picture
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:34.960]   It it you are it makes decisions about what that picture should how it should be rendered it and then it's done. It's fixed
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:37.760]   Uh, the new high efficiency format
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:40.400]   stores all the raw data
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:47.040]   All the focal length focal plane data stores a much more data about that image in this image
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:53.200]   Uh, so that you can kind of change focal points you can do all sorts of stuff with this image that you can't do with it jpeg
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:58.880]   That's going to be huge. Uh, this is a style so standard, but it's going to be the first phone to implement it
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:03.680]   um and the camera, you know boffins on uh
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:10.880]   Mac break we were very excited about it h e i f high efficiency image file
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:12.800]   format
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:16.000]   Uh, then all that so that's one camera very exciting
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.080]   Uh to the screen is going to be OLED now that's catch up for a lot of other phones
[01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:25.760]   But I think it will be as good as the samsung galaxy s8 which is a very very good screen edge to edge display
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:29.760]   I think the end of the bezels is good and i'm very interested in how they
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:35.120]   It appears that they're going to get rid of the fingerprint reader and just go with face recognition and knowing apple
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:39.200]   It won't it won't be like the face recognition that we currently get on say the s8
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:42.720]   Which is a little slow and cumbersome you have to position yourself and so forth
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:44.560]   It will i'm
[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:49.600]   I will be shocked if it doesn't and maybe it won't but my prediction is it'll work even if the phone's lying flat
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:53.120]   So it'll it'll be able to see at all angles and again
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:56.400]   This I think comes down to better camera technology partly the support AR
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:00.800]   And so it will just unlock in your presence it will unlock and
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:08.000]   You don't like it or you i'm wondering if that's actually true in your presence that
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.880]   Not if it's over here, but as soon as you are close enough to use it it will unlock
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:21.520]   So I think and I don't know this for sure, but qualcom's got a sensor that is very power efficient that is a
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:26.960]   It can recognize hey, this is a face. It cannot do the type of
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:32.480]   intense facial recognition high quality facial recognition you need for security purposes
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:37.600]   But what I think they're going to do is implement that sensor since qualcom told me a major
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:41.920]   Phone manufacturer was going to use it. They're going to have a sensor like that
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:47.360]   That says oh my god. It's a face nearby and then they're going to wake up the battery sucking. Yes
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:50.560]   Sensing technology. Yes, but it's not going to be
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:57.200]   Your phone's still going to have to be able to see enough of your face to wreck to get the angles that it needs
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.840]   Well to shoot the light to get the angles
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:03.280]   If that's the case it's going to be a problem because
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:07.120]   Right now apple and and zam with the pixel the unlocking is so
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:11.120]   Straight forward and transparent and instant that it's not a burden
[01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:15.520]   But I could tell you the face recognition i've used on every other camera is burdensome. You have to do this
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:21.280]   Well, this will be faster because that tiny face recognition thing as you're picking up the phone is going to be like
[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:22.800]   Yeah
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:25.520]   And it won't be so that one would be spoofed by a copy
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:30.640]   But the 3d sensors are not spoofed by a copy because what they're measuring isn't your actual face
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:32.160]   It's
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:35.520]   The depth of will someone in the chat was saying that so i'm just i'm just saying that
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:38.560]   From a from a marketing point of view
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:43.440]   If you have to do this every time you want to unlock your phone and i'm holding it up in front of my face
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:47.840]   That's going to end up being a non-starter and what i think you're going to have to look down at it
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:52.720]   No, it would be interesting to see i can imagine a camera that has enough wide enough angle
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:55.440]   That it can pick up your face
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:01.840]   Look, you know if you use my sony camera and you say lock on faces you can move
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:08.320]   It actually does lock on i you can move around and all sorts of configuration and that lock focus lock stays right on you
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:12.400]   It does not lose focus. So i i don't think that that's impossible
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:17.440]   Well, their apple emmement it is unknown. I don't have any inside information on that
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:21.120]   I know and uh 17 monster. I did get sent
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:24.000]   I guess I can show this
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.480]   I did get sent a a rec a dummy. I think it was a dummy of
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:31.360]   the phone by a
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:33.200]   Well-known
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:35.440]   Let me make it big so you can't see the name
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:38.000]   Leaker
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:44.240]   Yeah, so this is this is he says this is a dummy of what the actual new iphone will look like that is a lightning connector
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:49.120]   Uh, no headphone jack, but the most interesting thing on this was the camera
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:53.440]   Which is stacked instead of side-by-side sensors
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:57.600]   The the camera lens. I don't let's see if I can get it in a good position
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:00.400]   is stacked on the
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:02.720]   See it's it's vertical not horizontal
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:06.880]   Uh, and it could be a complete bogus fake
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:11.040]   You never know another thing team mobile did you're gonna like this jeff. I like it
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:14.400]   We get a discount if we're over 55
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:19.200]   Wait what ages them
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:23.840]   We get $10 off the everything plan if we're over 55
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:27.040]   Because we won't be looking very long as we're old
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:33.920]   Well and because you're not probably using a lot of data because you're not watching those darn youtube videos on the cellular network
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:36.480]   kids with their internets
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:43.200]   Uh, it's it's unlimited 55 plus two lines for $60 a month. Actually, that's a bigger discount than I thought
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:48.880]   So the next time uh next time you say hey you're old. I'm gonna say yeah, but I get t-mobile for $60
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:52.240]   Please if I if I try to be a surfer dude. Look at this guy
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:55.520]   Shoot me
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:57.840]   Any war hole surfing so
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:03.280]   I want to I have to call him and say can I get this deal because that would save me a lot of money
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:09.760]   John ledger is 59. He says well, no, it's yeah, but you know what it really is. I think is a t-mobile
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:14.960]   Does not do well with people of a certain age that they are that's kind of a kids
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:21.120]   Because the magenta and everything it's kind of a kids network and they want to get I thought it was because it wasn't reliable
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:27.920]   And kids can pay for cheap unreliable service, but adults your parking t-mobile is fantastic
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:32.720]   T-mobile does not work where I live. Well, that's because you live in texas
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:35.360]   Yeah, well
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:37.600]   so does like
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:39.600]   other people so do a lot of
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:44.400]   That's your defense that's the problem. It's too many people using the phone
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:50.480]   Like there were so many people you know, you're right t-mobile t-mobile really is dependent
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:54.640]   It's very much dependent on where you live. I use actually google phy on this phone
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:57.040]   And that's nice because I get sprint t-mobile us cellular
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:59.600]   All that happens what they become the same
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:08.560]   So another data point confirming my contention that mark zuckerberg wants to be president of this here united states
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:14.000]   He has hired women. This isn't the article. He has hired hilary clinton's
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:18.640]   They say pollster, but she was all he was also chairman of her campaign
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:23.600]   Yeah, I also know him. Yeah, he also advises lots of corporations
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:27.520]   His company is more than politics. He advises corporations on strategy
[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:29.520]   About joe benenson a democrat
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:34.880]   Joel's a former reporter with daily news where I knew I know that top advisor obama chief
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:36.640]   strategist
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:38.640]   During oh actually that's not really a good
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:42.000]   Good thing on your resume chief strategist for hilly glinton's campaign
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:47.200]   Maybe that's a mark against you. I don't know but no you didn't have a lot of control of colby but
[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:49.360]   We'll go there
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:53.760]   Um, uh, yeah, he advises lots of corporations and this is he's advising the foundation
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:57.200]   I think that's a
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:58:59.440]   chance
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:02.800]   My favorite tweet of the week besides mansplaining mansplreading
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:10.080]   Was when somebody just said so zuckerberg's not running for president after all above a link to uh, the
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:17.120]   Automated automatic sound coming on on facebook. Oh, that's driving me crazy. I woke exactly so
[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:19.680]   Up last night
[01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:23.600]   All his noises coming at my phone is I can't stop it. I can't stop it. It's facebook
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:27.040]   That is the most annoying. Why did they do that?
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:36.000]   Wait, what is it that they're doing? Well, you know, they now they play video automatically. They just turn on audio. Yes
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:42.320]   So you're scrolling through your facebook at night because you can't sleep and all of a sudden the video comes on and so
[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:45.120]   Larry noise
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:47.440]   Got it. Yeah, that's not popular
[01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:53.280]   This is why I don't serve facebook at night
[01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:56.400]   Probably a good idea
[01:59:56.400 --> 02:00:02.000]   Stacy doesn't watch television. She doesn't wake up. Don't you? I do watch television. I just don't
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.480]   She's perfect. We're just
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:07.840]   Women I meditate and do yoga
[02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:12.000]   Oh, you have your green tea
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:16.720]   Oh, I hate green tea. That's terrible. Oh, good
[02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:19.760]   So, so there you go and I'm not a vegan
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:25.680]   Instagram. Oh, you're not you live in Austin the capital of barbecue gets along
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:33.360]   We do have a lot of vegans in Austin surprising. Oh, I'm not surprised. No. Yeah, me either. There's vegans everywhere
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:36.800]   There is there is no miserable because they can smell the barbecue
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:41.680]   You know for a while we were actually our city council was looking at doing
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:45.440]   uh, I guess it's a law or rule or an ordinance about
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:49.680]   barbecue places had to install scrubbers
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:54.960]   Because the smell was bothering some people which I thought was absolutely hilarious
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:58.880]   They did go with the with a friend who's Hindu many some years ago
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:03.520]   South and southwest and we're trying to find of course always somebody to eat was across we walk into fogu to chow
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:06.800]   Oh, gosh, there's nothing but me meat on source
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:12.400]   And me and more meat he just said the smell alone. He said I just can't do what I just can't
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:15.360]   No
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:19.840]   There's there's a lot of good places that have lovely vegetarian food, but that is not one of them
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:22.160]   They have a salad bar
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:25.920]   Instagram has now and I think we should do this Jeff. I should Instagram
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:29.760]   Go live and then you could join me. We can have a two person
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:33.840]   Instagram live thing. I'm not this must be
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:37.680]   This is another no, I'm not your friend. I'm
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:40.960]   No, I of course. Wait, why didn't you invite me to do this? Huh?
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:45.120]   Well, I would except you probably think I was hitting on you or something
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.840]   Oh, that was low and un-hull
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:53.440]   All right, you're right. Uh, I don't actually know how to do it. How do we do is how do you go live?
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:55.920]   do you um

[02:01:57.920 --> 02:01:59.920]   Yes, mr. Underscore Laport
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:07.360]   So now I gotta follow you that turned on that didn't follow me. How do you go live? Oh, that turned on the flash
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:16.240]   The phone is peeking to me now. Well, it's that's not it obviously
[02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:18.960]   uh camera

[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:36.160]   Uh, just go to the camera and it's on the left. It's just not it's uh, not immediately obvious. There's some text
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:41.360]   I'm now live. Okay. Now. How do I how do we add somebody? That's the thing
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:48.160]   Start live video. Okay. I'm live too. Okay. We're telling your followers that you started a live video turn off commenting. No
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:55.280]   So uh, nobody's actually watching this. Oh, it's got like all these people are watching me all of a sudden
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:03:01.440]   So how do I how do I do an experiment on this week in google now? How do I they said they're rolling it out?
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:06.960]   I mean, let me look at the article. Oh, see I don't have the double friend icon. You need a double friend icon in there. Do you have a

[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:08.800]   Download the icon. How do you know the icon so me in the somebody in the instagram says you can download the icon
[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:12.400]   To start with okay go go live toggle over from normal
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:18.800]   Okay, then tap the new faces icon that appears in the bottom right so you don't have to do faces. I got
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:21.680]   So we haven't got it yet. All right, i'm gonna have to stop
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:24.320]   All right. Bye
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:29.920]   Is that the stupidest thing you've ever seen?
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:31.520]   We've been appalled
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:33.920]   I I did not participate. I want it known
[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:37.440]   Let's look for the record. You were jealous that he asked me
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:44.560]   And now you're most jealous first you're right you're right first. I was a jealous
[02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:48.240]   Yes, you were
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:55.840]   It's my fault. I didn't update my instagram. I'm updating it. Oh, this is what kevin and I do we just do it before the show
[02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:59.360]   I was gonna ask you
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:06.480]   Yeah, we investigate all kinds of things, but we don't do it live on the air because we're not as comfortable
[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:12.400]   And we're amateurs true. No, no. Oh, that's right. Jeff. You're not a journalist
[02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:17.840]   That was a person that said state all right. I'm starting the live
[02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:23.280]   Start live video. I have updated. I've updated it. Well, let's see. I'm checking to see
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:29.120]   Nope still not there
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:32.000]   So it's one of those things where they're rolling it out
[02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:38.880]   Stage probably, you know, I wonder sometimes if we're not on the do not update list maybe
[02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:42.240]   They said they're adding it today. So I mean, you know
[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:45.280]   All right, what else is there anything else?
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:47.120]   multi room audio
[02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:51.760]   To echo speakers. That's gonna be that'll be the nail in the coffin for uh, sonos
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:56.000]   Man, I yes because I've been waiting for my
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.760]   I can learn about this this morning on my podcast
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:03.120]   Well, I feel like I've wasted I've wasted a lot of money on sonos now because
[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:05.840]   Amazon is reportedly gonna add
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:11.920]   The exact capability that sonos has it makes sonos unique the multi room audio and if you have dots you can have better speakers
[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:14.480]   You can have an emma room. This is awesome
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:17.680]   You'll be able to put your Alexa speakers into groups
[02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:22.080]   So you don't have to just do party mode. You can send it to individual groups
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:26.240]   Uh, I have so many uh dots lying around the house
[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:34.800]   Amazon did you see all the secret brands? This is actually we're to do a public service announcement here. Oh, that's it. Yeah, that was interesting
[02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:37.520]   Amazon has been busy trademarking
[02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:44.480]   Brands courts some by the way very good. I think uh reporting mike murphy at courts
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:50.240]   Courts is great courts is wonderful. He went through he crawled through the us patent a trademark database to find
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:51.440]   uh
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:55.840]   19 brands owned by amazon. So you must have cross referenced it
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:08:02.400]   So if you buy arabella lingerie happy belly happy belly, that's food
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:08.160]   You're buying a direct from amazon just under it's not a separate seller. It's a house brand
[02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:12.240]   It's a house brand beauty bar because I've bought pins on sheets
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:16.800]   They've had those for some time and they didn't even say pins on by amazon. So you know you're getting amazon sheets
[02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:23.680]   Um, I don't buy them anymore because they weren't very good beauty bar denali franklin and freeman happy belly james and erin
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:29.840]   Women's clothing lark and roe women's clothing may underwear mama bear
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:34.800]   Baby products my habit consumer goods north 11 new pro pike street pins on
[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:37.440]   scout and ro
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:39.440]   Kids clothing
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:44.240]   That's funny lark and roe women's clothing and scouton roe kids clothing single cow burger
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:48.320]   That that's a weird brand. It's not really an appetizing brand
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:55.200]   Small small parts smart is beautiful and strath would i've seen strath would there are other trademarks at amazon
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:09:02.560]   Owns, but don't currently have products, but I presume the plan is to do so bloom street concrete new york, which is for leather goods
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:05.200]   familyhood
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:13.120]   Fine, I know what you're thinking jeff knock it off find gt prime instant pretty rv me you could buy motorhomes on amazon
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:21.360]   Oh my single frozen food for sad lonely single people. I like the idea that the ubs guy has to deliver your rv to your house
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:27.280]   That's eight greek and swedderman. It'll be the amazon guy. Don't worry. Yeah. Yeah, that's true
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:35.920]   Uh good threads the fix coastal blue elle moon ocean blues paris sunday presser who do you think there's like a whole department coming up with names
[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:40.640]   And that there's oh oh no these are these are consultants i've gone through this with companies
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:46.000]   And I feel like there's a lot of thinking that goes into why you would for instance name a cleaning product
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:51.520]   Presto with an exclamation land door associates is in san francisco. Yeah, no land door. Yeah
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:57.360]   Yeah, well dr land or yeah, and and you you pay them a fortune to come up with names very expensive
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:05.600]   That so so they are house brands and there's quite a few of them. Why do you think they do that? What's the goal there?
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:08.800]   Uh
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:17.040]   Yeah, hire margin consumers. I'll buy it. Um brand amazon brand stuff is quote basic at the moment
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:20.640]   So you can make a brand look better. Yeah, you can also
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:27.680]   If someone hates amazon, I don't know why they'd be shopping on there, but you know courts asked a
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:31.360]   Quote direct economy expert mark damasimo
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:36.000]   He's at a new york based advertising agency. He said there's a logic to this
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:41.600]   The amazon brand name can only stretch so far quote. Can you imagine anyone ever saying oh lord?
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:44.560]   This amazon personal lubricant is just so sexy
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:50.880]   There are limits to the amazon brand that amazon works. Why is not to cross that makes sense that actually makes a lot
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:53.120]   I remind my father my dear departed father in law
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:58.240]   Uh, got a suit one day before I power the suit and even if the price he was great price and he got it from macy's he said look
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:00.240]   It's an alfani
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:04.800]   I never had the heart to tell him that was the macy's house brand. I know it works right now. It sounds a lot
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:07.520]   I was yeah nice. Yeah, it's not funny
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:16.480]   So I am I ran a recent we brought in the top people in commerce in media like gizmodo and and and
[02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:18.560]   um
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:19.600]   Perch
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:25.040]   And other places run from community of practice that I organized at at qni we organized our center
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:29.280]   And what was fascinating about it was that the consumer behavior now
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:31.680]   So so these are these are media companies that put up
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:35.040]   Commerce they want to sell you know most anything to you
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:41.200]   Uh, and and yeah, they start with amazon links, but then they want to go off make their own deals better deals, right because amazon
[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:44.160]   Affiliate money gets worse and it's not that great
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:51.040]   Consumer behavior is they want to buy at amazon you are if you do in commerce are stuck with amazon the way that the rest of us
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:53.040]   And advertising are stuck with
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:57.040]   Google the way the rest of the world and social is stuck with facebook. Yep
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:05.200]   This is the future we're going to be owned by just a few big giant multinationals and it's fine with me
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:07.840]   Um
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:14.000]   I don't I love the change. I have no embrace it jeff the past embrace it embracing it
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:21.440]   I for one admire our new masters. I am fine with the disruption disruption is good
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:24.640]   Keep saying that your mom. This is our mantra disruption is good
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:30.880]   Instruction is good. I'll have some green tea now. I'm not ashamed to be too old then try to go on instagram
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:35.760]   It's okay. I I embrace the change. I want I want to get ahead of the change
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:37.760]   He sounded like Stuart's small a now you can
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:40.320]   I'm like embrace the disruption
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:46.160]   Yes, let's embrace the end of this show we have we've got a long quite long enough
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:50.400]   Uh, stacey. You got a pick of any kind for us. I do
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:53.440]   Today's pick is
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:55.760]   B
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:57.760]   The be mighty player
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:02.240]   Is this is weird? Yes, it's not weird. It's awesome
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:07.840]   This is something I've been wanting which is basically an ipod shuffle
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:12.480]   For spotify. I didn't understand what this was. I'm sorry. I thought I was a speaker
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:16.080]   Nope. Nope. No speaker. So this it works with
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:17.040]   Yep
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:18.960]   Wired or wireless headset
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:24.400]   And basically I was looking for a way to have spotify on my when I walk the dog in the morning or when I run
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:28.640]   Without having to carry my phone with me because I hate carrying my phone. Yeah, and I don't have a
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:31.040]   Nano, so there's a real opportunity here
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:37.600]   So and yeah plus the nano, you know, you had to like load it into iTunes and iTunes is awful
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:43.840]   Um, so does it download the music? It downloads you select playlists on spotify
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:48.000]   Um, and you have to have a spotify account to use this it's $95
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:50.480]   And you
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:52.480]   It loads it over Wi-Fi
[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:57.440]   in your house and then basically you click this button here at the top and you
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:00.400]   Um, go skip through your playlist
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:06.640]   So if you want to listen to like a specific album, you're gonna have to make a playlist for that album to put on this
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:08.640]   No display
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:10.400]   Right, there's no display
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:14.640]   So it's not you know, it's it may be a little clunky, but it's not random
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:17.360]   You can actually get to songs you want if you you just click this
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:23.200]   This is interesting apple discontinued the shuffle because they figured people wanted spotify and I think apples play is
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:26.320]   We'll just do it on your watch. You'll be able to stream spotify in your watch
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:30.800]   This is a this is maybe what apple should have done with the nano. This is very smart
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:31.600]   I
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:33.600]   I thought this I mean because like
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:38.080]   I I'm already in spotify and I don't want to carry my phone
[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:42.560]   So the fact that spotify one I didn't I had been looking at this for a long time
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:44.960]   Do you have that premium?
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:50.960]   You do have to have the paid version you don't have to have the plant okay, yes
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:56.400]   And then every 30 days you're gonna have to click it to your okay
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:02.000]   You'll have to open, you know, have them connect to your phone and be like, I'm still legit on spotify
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.840]   I love it be mighty calm
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:10.640]   And of course nowadays we don't really ask about the sound quality or anything like that
[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:16.720]   It's good enough. It's good enough for running. I mean, it's five. It's five hours of playback
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:19.440]   The one grape I have is the clip on the back
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:21.200]   Hello clip
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:25.280]   It's a I want a smaller clip. It feels a little clunky, but that's okay
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:26.880]   Tada
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:31.840]   Tonya apple should have done this for apple music. That's what it is. That I wonder if they'd even considered that
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:33.840]   interesting
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:39.120]   Jeff Jarvis a number from you my friend. So this will probably pee view. That's why I'm doing it
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:45.200]   Okay, there is a now here. This is a three-day podcast festival
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:52.480]   The traffic center in new york. It's gonna be all npr podcasts all that kind of gimlin and gimlin
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:55.760]   All that right, right plus plus the political ones
[02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:58.320]   Uh, so I already bought my ticket three days
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:02.480]   I bought the regular ticket a hundred and seventy dollars for I think it's three hundred thirty dollars
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:06.400]   You have the VIP ticket for three days. You get you know in front you get
[02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:11.040]   So people are going wait a minute people are spending that much money to watch podcasts be made
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:14.240]   Yeah, Leo. There's a loss in this for you. Yeah, no kidding
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:21.600]   But oh, I think my husband's going to that. Oh my god. You should say hi. Uh-huh comedy bank

[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:52.720]   You know, I loved it when you used you did live audiences in places. I think it's great
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:58.320]   Yeah, we did this years ago. I think you could do a twin festival or don't attack podcast festival on the west coast
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:04.080]   Yeah, we you know early on we did that all the time and we stopped doing it. I mean it just got
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:06.000]   Yeah, but people it's a big hassle
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.960]   We just say people come to our place if you want and you can watch life
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:12.000]   Or what you can do too. No charge
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.720]   You can do also on the rundown
[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:19.760]   You can instead you could do the podcast from the new york subway man spreading the whole time
