[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.600]   It's time for Twig this week in Google
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.960]   to show the covers Google and the Cloud with the great Gina
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.200]   Trapani to my left.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.720]   Gina's smarter where.org.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.440]   Hello, Gina.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.400]   Good to be here.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.120]   So the author of Think Up, the app that takes your tweets
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.240]   and parses them, breaks them down, analyzes them,
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.840]   comes up with statistical probabilities,
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.520]   and then spits them out.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.360]   Exactly.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.360]   Yes.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.880]   Eat your tweet for breakfast.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.640]   I eat your tweets.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.680]   Also, we don't have to go to the crappy new Twitter
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.160]   homepage.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.080]   Thank you.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.240]   No.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.720]   Thank you.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.240]   I was going to ask you what your opinion was about the redesign.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.360]   I'll tell you in a second.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.320]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.560]   New haircut.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.120]   Yes.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.560]   You.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.960]   I like it.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.520]   Thank you.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.960]   Thank you.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.040]   Also with me, of course, Jeff Jarvis from the City University
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.520]   of New York.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.280]   He has a very nice haircut, too.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.000]   I don't know how you get--
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.640]   I have a bad hair days on the high mind.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.280]   Ah, look at him in a beautiful phez.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.400]   Your hair always looks good.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.360]   Jeff is a professor of journalism.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.680]   He's like, not soft.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.640]   The City University of New York also at buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.320]   And with us from Google+, Mike Elgin is also here.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.200]   He's not at Google+.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.400]   He just uses it to great effect.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.440]   Occupied Google+.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.760]   That's what he does.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.120]   And he's thinking right now.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.120]   He's thinking.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.840]   He's coming up with a retort.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.240]   He's contemplating.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.880]   Yes.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.320]   There we go.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.840]   We got you back, Mike.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.840]   And now he's muted.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.320]   Did you mute yourself, Mike?
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.680]   Merry Christmas.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.600]   I can't hear you.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.240]   Mr. Freeze attacked you.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.080]   I have taken your movement away.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.080]   We'll work on it while you start the show.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.920]   He was awesome.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.440]   There he is.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.400]   He was so set up.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.960]   He had his seven cannons.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.800]   So excited.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   D7,000 all set up.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.840]   Would have been beautiful.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.280]   Next time.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.480]   Charge the battery next time.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.760]   Let's talk SOPA.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.720]   I thought SOPA was done.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.040]   Ropa Dopa on SOPA.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.960]   I went to France thinking all was well.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.440]   And no, it's back, baby.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.000]   In fact, the committee vote is tomorrow.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.360]   This is the Senate.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.040]   Or is it the House?
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.600]   No, it's the House.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.480]   Who knows?
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.480]   Engine advocacy.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.280]   It is the House.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.800]   It is the House.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.880]   IP Protect was the Senate bill, which is gone, I think.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.800]   Now, you update me because I thought it was all gone.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.680]   I thought we won.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.520]   I thought 87,000 petitions and calls to members of Congress
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.480]   from Tumblr alone would have just put this thing to bed.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.160]   But no, they fixed it.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.600]   Oh, you utopian you.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.760]   You know, fool that I am.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.920]   The folks at the movie industry and the television industry
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.400]   and the music industry just went back and rewrote it.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.200]   And they kind of rewrote it.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.800]   Well, one article says, to isolate Google.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.400]   Google, of course, been very vocal against the--
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.760]   So the Google can't still oppose it.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.400]   Yeah, but they better.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.320]   On a better principle.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.880]   Yeah, well, in fact, they have.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.240]   Good.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.000]   Founders of Google, Twitter, ahead of eBay, and Yahoo.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.880]   All came out in vocal opposition.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.640]   Engine advocacy.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.560]   Yeah, you see Craigslist, a bunch of people.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.960]   Not Zuckerberg, though.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.760]   Well, at least not in his talk.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.480]   Come on, Zuck.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.360]   Or Zuck.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.720]   So SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.000]   Well, no one's in favor of online piracy.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.960]   What's wrong with that?
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.000]   Mike, explain to me why we have to do this.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.680]   Well, for starters, it's based on the bizarre premise
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.440]   that you can simply establish a law.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.080]   And the rest of the world doesn't respond.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.040]   So you've got to think, what's the response to this?
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.200]   And the response is going to be that the pirates will simply
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.880]   and very quickly and easily figure out
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.280]   how to put up an alternative site in minutes
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.360]   if they're ever taken down.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.160]   So first of all, it's not going to stop.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.520]   Pirate is not going to solve the problem that it claims to solve.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.440]   The bigger problem is what it does to the US government's
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.400]   relationship with essentially censoring the internet.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.960]   This is kind of a Chinese type of thing
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.280]   or an Iranian government type of thing where--
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.080]   well, in the case of China, I think, is a better case.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.280]   China censors the internet heavily and famously.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.520]   But they never do so.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.880]   And they never state the real reasons.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.560]   They never say, well, we're censoring the internet
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.520]   because we want to prevent the formation of an alternative
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.280]   political party to the Communist Party.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.320]   Or we want to censor the internet to make sure
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.200]   that people who call for democracy and freedom and so on
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   can be heard and so on.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.520]   What they say is that we're going to cut down on pornography.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.040]   We're going to crack down on looting and stuff.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.400]   Child pornography.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.920]   It's always-- we're doing it for the children.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.200]   It's always for the children.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.000]   So think of the children.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.240]   And in this case, there are all kinds of things
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.120]   that the government could do.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.560]   And when people bring that up and say, well, you could do x, y,
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.160]   and z, they say, well, we won't.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.400]   That's not going to happen.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.320]   And that's the thing that I'm most concerned about in all
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.440]   this information.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.640]   Yeah, trust us.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.040]   We're not going to create the great firewall of the US.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.640]   As if politics is going to stop.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.360]   I mean, you know, once they have the levers of power,
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.920]   they're going to use them for political purposes.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.120]   It's the nose under the camel's tent.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.280]   So the House Judiciary Committee will vote on this tomorrow.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.440]   It's Chairman Lamont Smith of Texas
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.760]   says, "Soap's opponents are spreading lies."
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.960]   Lawful companies and websites like Google, Twitter, Yahoo,
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.720]   and Facebook have nothing to worry about with this bill.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.160]   They said, oh--
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.200]   Do you like that cartoon rooster?
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:57.800]   I say, I say, I say, it only applies to foreign rogue websites.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.400]   Furners.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.920]   Furners.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.920]   Furners.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.960]   So they dropped-- this shows their moronic stupidity.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.280]   They said, well, OK, we'll exempt.com.net.org sites.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.800]   That means it's only foreigners, right?
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.080]   Yeah, except PirateBig is.org, you nitwits.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.880]   And Twit is.tv.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.120]   So what the hell?
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.720]   Do you not use the internet?
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.880]   What's an internet?
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.480]   Internet.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.640]   Well, I don't-- I say, I say, internet.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.640]   What's that?
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.720]   Companies like Google have made--
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.320]   I don't know if Lamar Smith talks like this,
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.520]   but he sure as hell ought to.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.080]   Oh, he's sure.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.560]   I see.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.520]   Companies like Google have made billions
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.440]   by working with and promoting foreign rogue websites.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.840]   That's why Google's against this.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.280]   They have a vested interest in preventing Congress
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.040]   from stopping rogue websites.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.680]   Lamar Smith, you're saying that Google has a vested interest
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.560]   in protecting piracy and preventing Congress
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.440]   from doing its job.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.200]   As their evidence, they cite articles--
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.760]   Google, I argue the Google or the Achilles
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.760]   pharmacist thing.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.360]   Sorry.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:01.920]   I'll go ahead.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.560]   I was just going to say that they--
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.760]   as evidence, they point out Google's fiasco
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.640]   where they were knowingly allowing
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.140]   pharmaceutical, shady pharmaceutical
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.280]   apps in the ad network, which is probably a bad example.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.040]   That's not an example of what they would do.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.720]   It's a shame that that did happen.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.400]   And they, of course, they paid half a billion fines.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.360]   Their opposition, this legislation,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.880]   is self-servant since they profit from doing business
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.560]   with rogue sites that steal and sell
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.080]   America's intellectual property.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.560]   What's that?
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.760]   It's institutions, defending institutions.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.280]   It's the same as-- we talked about this,
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.280]   I think, when you were gone, Leo, your good buddy,
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.920]   Sarko, saying that content has a distribution problem.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.840]   And in fact, I would argue the content has solved
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.680]   this distribution problem.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.040]   But he defends the old business model.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.000]   I'd like to point out--
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.400]   defend the old business model.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.440]   I did not shake Sarko's hand.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.080]   And he was crushed.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.560]   You know, his assistant for internet affairs or something,
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.680]   Nicholas something, came up to me and said, oh, we are so
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.520]   glad to have-- actually, he's had no access.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.280]   He's perfectly in this.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.160]   We're so glad to have you.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160]   Thank you for being here.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.520]   And then, Loique was going around with Sarko.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.880]   The reason this all happened--
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.720]   Loique Lomer, who puts on Loeb-- and by the way, if you ever
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.040]   get a chance to go, this is a great show.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.200]   This is, I think, now--
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.240]   It sounded like your coverage.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.800]   It's like South by Southwest.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.080]   The news that used to be broken in South by is now being
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.560]   broken in France at Loeb.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.560]   And part of that is because of this great upsurge of European
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.560]   startups like Spotify and SoundCloud.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.480]   We interviewed some really interesting people who were
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.640]   doing really, I think, innovative, exciting things in
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.400]   Europe.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.440]   It's the renaissance of internet stuff in Europe.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.520]   Anyway, so Loique was back when he was a very influential
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.280]   blogger in France.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.160]   That's how Loique got started.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.160]   Now he's an entrepreneur.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.520]   He's a founder of Seismic and lives in the US with his
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.320]   family.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.880]   But Loique, when he was back, if this was 10 years or eight
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.360]   years ago or something, was a very influential blogger and
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.720]   was approached when Sarkozy, before Sarkozy, became
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.240]   president by the Sarkozy campaign, they were looking for
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.600]   some support from bloggers.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.560]   And Loique advised him on social media strategy.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.040]   And so he became an insider in the circle.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.520]   And I actually haven't asked Loique how it feels about
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.200]   Hadoop and the Three Strikes Laws.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.800]   But Loique was introducing him around
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.160]   scoble, met him, Alexia Sotsis met him.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.400]   And they said, well, we could-- and I said, I'm just
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.200]   going to watch.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.840]   Really?
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.800]   First of all, I wasn't going to say to him, hey, my
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.840]   friend Jeff Jarvis says, will you do any harm?
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.400]   So I just thought--
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.640]   So you feel kind of obligated to say something?
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.960]   I didn't want to mean him because I didn't want to have
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.920]   to say--
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.800]   I didn't want to have this glad hand and say, pleasure to
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.040]   meet you.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.120]   And I would have felt compelled to say, this
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.960]   stuff has to--
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.080]   I understand that he gave a fairly long speech off the
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:57.920]   cuff.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.480]   He had notes, but he ran off the notes.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.720]   He said, I know you guys aren't crazy about me.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.360]   Google just opened in Paris the day before.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.400]   Something like, what was it?
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.440]   174,000 square-- a huge square office in a beautiful
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:10.800]   building.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.080]   I mean, they really have a huge Paris presence now.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.320]   And he said, I was damned if I didn't.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.160]   And damned if I didn't.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.600]   If I went to the opening, there were people who would
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.440]   have hated me for doing that.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.840]   If I hadn't done it, if I didn't do it, people would hate me.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.560]   So he just--
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.800]   but Eric Schmidt, by the way, was in this audience.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.440]   He shook his hand.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.360]   He talked to Eric.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.840]   He said, I need to reach out to you.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.080]   I need to represent publishers and the rights of publishers.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.840]   But we need the internet economy.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.080]   We need you guys that we're struggling here in Europe.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.440]   And we need the information.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.840]   So he said, I'm just trying to find a balance.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.240]   You know, on face value, that sounds good.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.080]   But actions speak louder than words.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.560]   I got the feeling that one of the interesting things
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.440]   about this story was that, of all the European powers,
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.680]   the major European powers, France is probably
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.880]   one of the biggest challenges in the long run for Google.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.800]   Germany is another one.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.440]   But France is a difficult government
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.360]   to deal with because, as we were talking about before,
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.400]   earlier it's hard to control.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.560]   They like to control everything, like the general language.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.640]   They'd like to make sure French languages preserved
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.640]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.760]   And so I got the feeling that Google established
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.760]   its European headquarters in France
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.160]   as a way to influence the French government.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.560]   And I think Sarkozy's appearance
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.800]   is kind of an example of that.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.800]   You're exactly right.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.920]   I mean, and they also established a research
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.200]   institute in Berlin.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:34.960]   Exactly.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.480]   The same time.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.200]   Some people complained about that.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.560]   But what are you complaining about?
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.800]   You can't win.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.360]   You don't want Europeans to be the can't win continent.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.920]   Google's trying to reach out.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.360]   And I think that's not a bad thing.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.040]   Here is Eric Schmidt.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.040]   He says with President Sarkozy, that is not.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.600]   I believe actually that's Nicholas, the guy I talk to,
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.760]   Sarkozy's advisor on Internet Affairs in their new office,
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.960]   where they have apparently Rubik's cubes, snow glades.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.000]   All the French say.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.920]   They all.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.840]   And notice they have those balls that I sit on.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.800]   It's so bourgeois.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.880]   So bourgeois.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.480]   So I guess Sarkozy did go to the opening, but it was--
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:13.960]   Yes, he did.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.760]   He said, I know how controversial that is.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.440]   If he's walking a fine line, he's not very popular in France,
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.400]   either, by the way.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.280]   He's on his way out.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.000]   Although with a fear, is there somebody
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.600]   who is more rightist will be elected.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.200]   Did the week before I was in Paris
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.440]   and spoke at La Cantine, which is a great incubator space
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.560]   on the book, because it's just out in France
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.520]   as of last week.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.000]   And I took swipes at Sarkozy, and nobody
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.080]   swiped back for me for that.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.040]   It was fairly popular to do.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.440]   Here's a picture of Sarkozy and Eric
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.120]   cozying up, so to speak.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.200]   How short is he?
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.560]   Tiny.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.840]   He's a Regis-Filbin short.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.400]   I want to.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.680]   That actually reminds me a lot of Regis.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.600]   If Kelly's still looking--
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.280]   OK, OK, OK.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.080]   --after the election--
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:04.960]   OK, how did you--
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.080]   You have to do Regis with a French accent, please.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.400]   Was it king of men?
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.600]   I don't know what you're talking about, Leo.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.680]   Well, it's like, I don't know if I can mix those two together.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.440]   How does it work?
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.760]   The internet?
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.440]   No, he's--
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:21.920]   Yeah, he's--
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.280]   A new dish.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.120]   Filbin is kind of mixed.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.760]   Well, Filbin kind of has that.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.360]   Anyway, he's yay-high.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.720]   And like Regis, very naddy, well put together.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.920]   And like Regis had heavy pancake makeup on.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.480]   So that's my only observation.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.640]   He seemed like quite a nice fellow.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.080]   I'm sure that he's a perfectly fine fellow.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.800]   And politics is complicated.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:52.600]   And I'm sure he believes that he's representing
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.520]   the interests of France.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.040]   Oh, he does, yeah.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.520]   I blew back.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.200]   Google--
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.000]   But he defines France as the power structure.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.040]   Well, and that's a little--
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.000]   I think after the currency deal that they just made in Europe,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.960]   it's pretty clear that all the power is in Germany.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.120]   And most of the euros are in Germany.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.880]   When I got to Germany, I read in Velt,
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.040]   which is the newspaper saying that all of Europe
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.160]   basically becomes German.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.160]   Yes.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.920]   Do they see the irony in saying that?
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.200]   Well, if you can't win one way--
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.600]   Well, yeah, that's the great irony.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.320]   Currency reform.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.600]   It's a united Europe and Germany's in charge.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.360]   Well, there's a certain logic to that, which
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.480]   is that Germany is the biggest country in Europe.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.680]   And it's also the most industrialized.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.880]   France may disagree with that.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.240]   But it's-- the thing that has prevented Germany
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.000]   from being the clear leader in Europe for all these years
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.920]   has been the legacy of World War II.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.440]   And every decade that goes by, that restriction fades
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.000]   a little bit.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.840]   But Mike, what's interesting about this to me
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.560]   is-- and this is why I tried to think about in terms
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.440]   of a beta culture--
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.400]   is that, yes, Germany is the industrial miracle.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.400]   It's so far, even though there's a lot of good development
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.560]   going on in Berlin, is it yet the digital miracle?
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.880]   And will its culture support a digital beta
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.200]   fail in public culture?
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.920]   If they can't handle street view, can they--
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.800]   Well, exactly.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.720]   Precisely.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.640]   And can France be farther ahead?
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.840]   The UK, which is probably a little more fertile for digital.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.760]   But now they're more separated from Europe
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.360]   because of Cameron and what he did with this agreement.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.680]   Eastern Europe.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.600]   It's really interesting to see that in an internet world,
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.960]   if there's going to be a center of digital in Europe,
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.920]   where is it going to be?
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.400]   And I don't think that's at all settled.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.440]   I think Lowique's trying to help France.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.080]   No, I think that--
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.600]   I think Lou Webb is pan-European.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.960]   And I don't--
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.200]   it's very international.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:06.000]   Half the people there are Americans, more than half.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.440]   And Lowique told me once that the original plan--
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.280]   and I think--
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.800]   originally it was called LeBlanc, by the way.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.120]   I came to LoweB a few years ago.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.760]   The original plan, I think, was to bring American entrepreneurs
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.520]   to Europe to have some of that gold rub off.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.160]   And I think mission accomplished.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.000]   There are some issues in Europe.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.920]   You know, there are many different languages.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:34.440]   They don't have a venture capital infrastructure like we do here.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.560]   They maybe have some risk aversion.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.640]   But I think that's changing very rapidly.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.520]   And the testament to that is the number
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.600]   of very successful startups.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.440]   From Finland, you've got Rovio with Angry Birds.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.760]   From Sweden, you've got Spotify.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.120]   From Germany, you've got SoundCloud, and On and On and On.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.520]   And these companies are doing very well.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.560]   They're really exciting American-style startups.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.240]   That's one of the things that's interesting.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.320]   Well, really good point, Leo, but the way Germany used to do it--
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.800]   and I used to invest for my old employer and German companies--
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.120]   is they would tend to copy the American company,
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:09.880]   which was a very--
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.360]   There are a couple of companies in Germany
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.800]   that do-- did unabashedly do that.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.160]   They've done that, and it's not a bad strategy,
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.760]   because then you get bought by the one you copy.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.280]   But all the lists you just gave-- and this is vital.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.520]   All the lists you just gave is original companies
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.520]   that are doing new things.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.800]   And I think that's critically important.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.560]   And that's the way they're going to win.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.360]   Daniel Ekkop, Spotify, was very interesting.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.480]   He said, well, one of the reasons I did this is--
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.280]   Sweden was becoming known as the pirate country.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.160]   He said, probably because of the penetration
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.080]   of high-speed internet, widespread penetration
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.360]   of high-speed internet, we had Pirate Bay.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.000]   We had-- that's where Kazah came from.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.360]   And so he said, I love music, and I
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.720]   kind of wanted to create a company that
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.640]   promoted legitimate use of music.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.880]   And Spotify, there's no question in my mind,
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.560]   is taken over the world.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.600]   The startup scene in Europe is more robust than people
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.160]   think it is.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.760]   And the reason for that is that when you look at--
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.440]   first of all, you look at the United States versus Europe.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.280]   People tend to look at individual countries in Europe,
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.600]   whereas the United States, of course,
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.000]   is a single country.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.360]   And so comparing US to Europe, it's
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.120]   not a comparison that happens all that often.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.720]   Also, the bigger issue is that the giant companies,
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.600]   the Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook, and so on,
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.640]   if you remove those from the US technology scene
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.120]   and just compare the smaller companies in the US
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.800]   versus the smaller companies in Europe,
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.760]   Europe is-- it's a vital segment of the technology industry.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.560]   Oh, and especially with apps.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.400]   You know, one of the things that's really happening
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.200]   is it's the barrier to entry for creating apps and raising
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.960]   crazy money.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.400]   Task grab it just raised.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.600]   We interviewed Task Grab at Lea Busking.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.800]   They just raised $28 million for an app that basically
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.720]   has somebody do your shopping for you.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.000]   And the barrier-- not to a US company,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.480]   but the point is that the barrier in entry
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.680]   to creating these is very low.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.800]   And the potential win is huge.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.480]   So we met a ton of new apps.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.440]   And it was very exciting, very vital.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.880]   You don't have to be-- you don't have
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.000]   to be working on the next Microsoft Word
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.400]   or even the next Spotify or Skype.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.480]   You could be working on an app.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.120]   And we saw a lot of people there.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.400]   It was actually really exciting to me.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.240]   And what's interesting, a number of American companies
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.120]   made announcements there.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.400]   Evan now announced two new apps,
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.520]   Flipboard announced Flipboard for the iPhone, which
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.560]   is huge.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.120]   Spotify announced-- and this was funny because they
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.680]   had the week before done an event,
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.280]   which they announced apps for the Spotify platform.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.680]   And they didn't mention this.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.840]   And they came on stage at the web to say, oh, and by the way,
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.920]   we're going to do radio, which if I were Pandora,
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.440]   I'd be shaking on my boots.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.560]   But most-- I think most telling-- in the past,
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.560]   Marissa Meyer has always come and been the flagship representative
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.920]   of Google at this conference.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.600]   In fact, she got engaged at the web four years ago
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.200]   and goes back with her husband each year
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.640]   because it's a romantic thing for them.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.360]   But Eric Chalk--
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.680]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.680]   Is that geeky?
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.600]   That would be a merger.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.600]   A merger.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.600]   OK.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.720]   Let's call it a merger.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.480]   Marissa might have had to wear with all to acquire a husband,
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.480]   but I appreciate it.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.600]   Oh, that's true.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.520]   I do believe it was an equal partnership.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.480]   But the fact that Eric Schmidt was there--
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.280]   and not even the keynote-- the keynote was Carl Lagerfeld.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.280]   Wait, isn't that wacky?
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.440]   They-- well, he was of Chanel, but he's
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.520]   doing a deal with another company
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.360]   to do a Lagerfeld line online only.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.960]   I know that was really wacky.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.000]   Wait, of Chanel?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.560]   No, not Chanel.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.160]   It's anymore.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.400]   Let me look it up.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.600]   But didn't they, aren't they suing?
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.600]   Didn't they involve in that case that they took over those
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.240]   domains?
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.760]   Like the handbag company?
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.600]   That's another thing.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.440]   OK, that's another thing.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:57.960]   OK.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.460]   OK.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.760]   Lagerfeld is no-- I don't think he designs anymore for Chanel.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.440]   I don't know what he does.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.040]   Where did he buy those shirts?
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.120]   Such a strange looking fellow.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.840]   And he says, I do not use the internet.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:16.560]   However, I will be selling many things on the internet.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.520]   He's a very--
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.720]   so that's one of the things that's fun about the web.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.200]   South By Really is about Austin and really has that Austin
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:25.400]   feel.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.400]   This has very much a European continental feel.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.040]   Barbicue is terrible in the web.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.560]   Your coverage may definitely be--
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.880]   The Barbicue is terrible, but the wine is excellent.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.880]   And caviar and pate--
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.960]   They serve.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:44.520]   They serve pate and wine at the conference for lunch.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.880]   They serve pate and wine to the soldiers-- French soldiers
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.960]   stationed abroad.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.880]   It wouldn't be lunch with a pate and wine.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:23:03.600]   So he-- Lagerfeld is making an audacious bid
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.120]   to make history and fashion and technology.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.960]   He's going to launch a lower priced lime named Carl.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:21.600]   200 pound jacket instead of 25,000 pound jacket.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.720]   And it'll be all online.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.320]   You can only buy it online.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.160]   He says--
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.440]   Who of this group, Gina?
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.440]   When you go buy clothes, how do you buy them?
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.120]   Oh.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.240]   I'm not a fashion person at all.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.680]   I mean, what do you mean by brand or--
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.760]   You ever go into stores anymore?
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.280]   That's what I'm asking you simply.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.280]   Oh.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.280]   Is it as little as I have to?
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.840]   When was the last time you were in a department store?
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:49.680]   Oh, a department store?
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.520]   Are you asking her?
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.120]   Is she the token woman?
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.040]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   I'm going to ask you all, don't worry.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.120]   Gina's been silent, so I'm asking her all.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.240]   Yeah, I apologize.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.520]   I'm going to antihistamine Hayes today.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.600]   I haven't been in a department store forever,
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.960]   but I'm really not like a fashion person at all.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.960]   So I'm not a good example of a woman my age, I think.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.560]   But yeah, it was as little as possible.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.960]   On the type that I find the stuff that I like,
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:16.440]   and then I just order a bunch of them online.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.440]   I think all of you can do that underwear thing we guys have.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.560]   Yeah, right exactly.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.920]   Oh, yeah, man packs.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.320]   Love the man packs.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.320]   I need a woman pack.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.400]   Do you ever shop in person anymore?
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.520]   Well, my wife does all of my shopping.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.200]   I say, I need another shirt, and then a day or two later,
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.080]   it one appears.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.320]   And it's a great system.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:35.960]   It works for me.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.640]   But what's more interesting is that recently,
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.320]   my wife has discovered the joy of buying footwear online.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.720]   And because you can--
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.960]   Oh, Zappos is great.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.440]   --because of the growth of free shipping and stuff,
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.000]   and she's just been buying boots like it's going crazy.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.120]   And so she's getting sucked into the whole online thing,
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.960]   and it's really working for her.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.680]   I buy all my shoes at Zappos.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.600]   Absolutely.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.680]   Zappos is great.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.760]   Where I'm headed here is that as the retail's gone online
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.440]   first, the designers who resisted
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.920]   because they thought it was cheapening them
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.240]   now have no choice but to.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:07.880]   Right.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.600]   Then they got throughout the appropriate way to do it.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.760]   You're not going to buy $25,000 jacket online, obviously.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.400]   The new Carl Lagerfeld line, I've
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.960]   had on the screen here, is car is coming,
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.800]   is at Net-A-Porte, which is an amazing company.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.800]   Is it?
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.080]   Yeah, it's owned by-- it was bought by Rishmaul,
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.360]   which is a very high-end company that
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.000]   has all kinds of wildly expensive watches
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.560]   and fashion and things like that.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.120]   And they realized that they were kind of trapped with--
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.440]   I spoke for them once in South Africa.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.440]   But they realized they're kind of trapped with their retailers,
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.480]   and Net-A-Porte gets them out of that.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.160]   And Net-A-Porte does--
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.280]   They've got Jimmy Chu, Yves Saint Laurent, Donna Karen,
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.880]   Chloe Burberry, I mean, Batakah Veneta.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.000]   They've got everybody here on this.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.760]   The thing is that I would think high-end fashion
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.560]   would really love the internet, because that whole industry
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.480]   is based on what's really, really new.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.640]   And it's really expensive, because it's brand new.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.840]   Nobody else has got it, and it's going to be gone in six weeks.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:13.280]   Right.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.920]   And that's perfect for the internet.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.920]   You just have to make sure you get the kinds of people who
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.240]   buy that kind of stuff online.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.400]   And this guy with his Carl line is not helping by saying
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.760]   that he doesn't use the internet.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.600]   He should be really embarrassing the internet.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.960]   They even have-- look at this-- Net-A-Porte live.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.080]   You can watch what people are buying as they buy.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:39.120]   16,262 people are on this website right now buying crap.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.200]   Friction-free snooping.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.840]   So wow.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.960]   Up to now what the Hoke Couture companies have used the internet
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.280]   for, and it's actually been very successful for them,
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.120]   is kind of their remainders.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:58.320]   They don't want to sell the old stuff at a discount,
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.720]   because it cheapens the name.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.040]   So they go to sites like fab.com.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.000]   They're a whole bunch of sites.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:04.720]   Guilt.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.200]   Guilt.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:05.720]   Guilt.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.240]   Guilt.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.080]   He didn't--
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.080]   Didn't mercy-- shame.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.360]   Apathy.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.920]   Didn't Marissa Meyer have--
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.520]   didn't Google have a site like this as well?
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:16.960]   They did.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.960]   They had a fashion site at some point.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.520]   So what they can do--
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.760]   somebody explained this to me.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.320]   It was a visual--
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.680]   it was a visual matching thing.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:25.960]   Oh, that's right.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.960]   Right.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.640]   Right.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.160]   But--
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.240]   Like.com.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.320]   What was it?
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:30.960]   Like.com.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.000]   Like.com.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.320]   That's right.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.480]   So-- and I figured Marissa must have had a lot to do this,
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.680]   because she's very focused on it.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.120]   I know.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:37.120]   Oh.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.360]   Vashions a big deal for her.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.000]   Like.com, I guess, is gone.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.440]   I think they folded it into Google Image Search
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.520]   and took away the commerce thing.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.600]   Butteeds.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.360]   That's it.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.240]   I think you're right.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.080]   Let's see.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.600]   I signed up for that.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.120]   There's the fashion voice coming in.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:56.800]   Also gone.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.200]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.920]   In representing Rula La Houtlok--
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.800]   It's all there.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.520]   Rula La.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.080]   I'm a member of the Rula.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.080]   I'm a member of the Rula.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.760]   So someone explained this to me.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.440]   That the whole deal is they don't want--
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.120]   they got to get rid of this old stuff.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.360]   So they-- but they don't want a deep discount in the stores,
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.200]   because it really hurts sales.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.120]   So they have initially been using the internet.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.960]   It is a dumping ground.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.720]   That's where they put the reduced cost stuff
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.360]   on Rula La Houtlok places like that.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.280]   But I think they're discovering--
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:23.880]   wait a minute.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.840]   Maybe we should also be selling the new stuff.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.640]   I think your point about being--
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.840]   I think it was your point, Mike, about being current.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.280]   They should be more than current,
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.040]   waiting for the first designer to discover
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.440]   the wonders of Kickstarter.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.800]   If enough people want this, we'll make it.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.880]   If you don't, we won't.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.360]   And if you buy early, you get it before everybody else.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.240]   I mean, there's a great system of benefit there
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.720]   that people could have.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.640]   It's a shame that boutiques.com is gone.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.320]   And they've replaced it with-- they said,
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.840]   go to Google product search, which is--
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.720]   not where women go.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.880]   That's where guys who watch their hair was soap go.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.360]   That's not--
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.360]   Right.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.880]   I'm trying to-- I mean, I think the last time
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.520]   what's Macy's was I needed a suit,
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.560]   I had a meeting at the White House,
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.960]   and it was like I needed a suit before I go to DC.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.320]   It's a rock, so I went to Macy's.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.880]   I need a suit.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.080]   Help me, Macy's.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:12.960]   Help me, Nordstrom.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.240]   Exactly.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:14.920]   All right, move--
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.720]   So the perils are working at home.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.160]   Somebody just bought a pair of flip flops in Sydney.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.880]   I just want you to know from Neta Porte.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.520]   I love the name Neta Porte.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:29.000]   It's a completely obscure pun that maybe, I guess,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.680]   fashion people would get.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.120]   I love how it's zipping around.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.400]   Somebody just bought a pair of slacks in West Africa.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.280]   I like to see returns.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.000]   Yeah, wouldn't that be fun?
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.840]   A shirt named Acne.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.360]   Good.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.240]   Just purchased in Egypt.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.160]   You really want to see who's buying this stuff?
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.080]   I would love to.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.880]   Oh, look, somebody in France just bought a Michael Michael
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.360]   Cores hot boots.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.000]   Oh, those are good.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.040]   Those boots are made for walking through the net.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.080]   Handbag just sold to the United Kingdom in London.
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.880]   OK, this goes beyond a glee, guys.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:08.120]   Oh, Tory Pravor, Lucy's smocked Bando swimsuit
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.120]   just sold to Stockholm, Sweden.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.320]   This could be a whole TV show right here.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.880]   Cooked strapless crepe jumpsuits.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880]   Please go.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.880]   I'll do this, but you can fashion it.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.080]   Look at those Python and suede sandals just sold to Chicago.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.760]   My goodness.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.560]   Hey, so how about your galaxy Nexus?
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.600]   OK, thank you.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.600]   Yeah, let's go for the telephonic.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.080]   Thank you for redirecting me.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.480]   Let's do that.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.800]   I mean, I'm really anxious to see it myself.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:38.000]   So I ordered this speaking of online commerce
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.960]   from a British site, Expanse, says,
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.880]   now, have they announced Verizon when it'll be available?
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.800]   And we know it's Verizon.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.040]   They still have-- I thought for sure--
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.360]   Supposedly the 15th, man.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.360]   I shut for sure the nights.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.520]   So I'm glad I actually-- I almost canceled this.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.440]   I thought, well, when I get back, I'll be able to get it.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.880]   So it did arrive.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.280]   Here it is.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.680]   This is the Google Galaxy Nexus running ice cream sandwich.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.760]   So if you've unlocked--
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.960]   If you've unlocked.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.760]   And GSM only.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.600]   It's not LTE.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.120]   So if you've seen--
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.280]   How much of the cost you?
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.760]   $749.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.640]   You was.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.320]   But that's actually about right.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.720]   Anyway, I don't know if it's right or not.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:19.240]   It looks very similar to the Galaxy 2.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.320]   S2 from Samsung.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.560]   This is similar back.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.880]   It's a little bit-- I don't know if you could tell,
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.200]   but it's slightly curved.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.640]   It's got the mulch at the bottom for the--
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.360]   I guess for the antenna.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.040]   OK, so ice cream sandwich really is the big change here.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.320]   Because everything else is-- it's a big screen.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.520]   Oh, and one other thing.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.000]   And it's 1280 by 720.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.240]   It's the highest red screen out there.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.880]   But I'm going to tell you a little bit about that.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:42.680]   There's a caveat.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.240]   First, though, I turned on the face recognition.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.760]   Now let's see how well this works.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.680]   Whoa.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.480]   A demo that might actually work.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.800]   Nope, couldn't find my face.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.520]   So it fails back to this.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.480]   Let me try it again.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.000]   Because, you know, go ahead.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.040]   Put me on camera one.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.960]   Because the truth is it works better if I'm in a more--
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.920]   this over the shoulder shot is not ideal.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.480]   But if I just do this-- and it has to be-- by the way,
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.320]   I try this and the dark doesn't work.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.880]   And there it unlocked it.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.520]   So it takes a couple of seconds.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.360]   It's cool.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.040]   It fails pretty quickly over to just the swipe.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:17.880]   I'll leave it on.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.320]   So you have to hold it up in front of you.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.760]   So you lift your arm and hold it on.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.320]   Like the shot straight on to your face
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.520]   is the one that's most likely to work?
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.520]   Seems to be.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.640]   Another stupid thing people will be doing in the street.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.880]   And you do spend a lot of energy getting it just right.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.040]   And it worked again.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.160]   I was just whooping around.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.760]   So glasses, I think, kind of didn't like.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.800]   I haven't-- I have to try it again with my glasses on.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.680]   But sometimes it spends an inordinate amount of time.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.720]   And then it says, I don't know who you are.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.920]   So it's not-- you're going to go.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.560]   It's a gimmick.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:48.240]   It's not.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.960]   But it's a cool gimmick now.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.680]   But OK.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.960]   And in every other respect, it's a snappy phone.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.720]   There's a few things that are immediately
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.680]   throw you-- throw me anyway on a bad ice cream sandwich.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.560]   One is there's no physical buttons anymore.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.800]   The three buttons that are generally
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.160]   at this edge of the screen, although they're soft--
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.160]   they're not real buttons.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:10.840]   They're on the screen.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.960]   So they could move around anywhere.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.000]   You can barely see it.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.320]   There's the back button.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.760]   There's the home button.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.200]   And there's a recent apps button.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.200]   If you've used Honeycomb, you'll recognize that
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.840]   from the tablet interface.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.800]   That's the recently run apps button.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.000]   Search-- not here anymore.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.760]   It's up here.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.520]   But it is on every page.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.040]   And you don't have to press and hold.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.520]   It's just one tap.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.240]   And you'll get the voice dictation and the search
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.280]   capabilities that you're used to.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.000]   Although this has been much upgraded,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.480]   we're going to talk in a little bit about a new Google
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.280]   voice dictation system that I think they're going to implement
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.320]   soon on this.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.880]   So I have to say Siri quality dictation.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.000]   I'll show you in a second.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.960]   Well, I could show you that now.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:55.320]   Let me start a message here.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.800]   New message.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.360]   Yeah, I don't want to show phone numbers.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.760]   Thank you.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.640]   Let's send one to Gina here.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.480]   So the voice dictation, if you're using--
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.840]   I don't want to show any phone numbers, do I?
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.400]   I'm not showing it.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.120]   No, don't show it.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:07.720]   Don't stop.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.520]   Oh my god.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.520]   That's not--
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.120]   That's not showing it.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.720]   OK, so here we go.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.080]   Here we go.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.800]   So I'll do the dictation thing here.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.080]   So this is the ICS keyboard.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.000]   But one thing they've done differently now with the dictation
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   is it starts typing almost immediately.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.840]   So it's quicker to make corrections
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:33.160]   because you can see what it is typing and change it as you go.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.200]   And as you can see, it hasn't made a single mistake yet.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.080]   Exclamation mark.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:38.960]   That's amazing.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.160]   That's really nice.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.240]   I think this is comparable to Siri.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:48.040]   I think Siri's actually gotten less accurate.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.600]   Well, and Siri's down all the freaking time,
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.920]   which means if it's accurate or not, if it doesn't work,
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.320]   I really like Siri.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.200]   And I was using it a lot to dictate on the iPhone 4S.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.840]   This works.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:04.280]   And that's making the requests over the network, Leo,
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.040]   as you speak.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:05.960]   I can't tell.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.600]   I think it is.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.560]   But boy, watch.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.200]   I'll do it again.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.320]   It's fast.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.160]   It's really fast.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.360]   This is almost dictating in real time, which means--
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.520]   I mean, I do love the fact that I can see the results as I go,
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.200]   which makes it much easier to catch a mistake before you've
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.520]   gone on and on and on.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.320]   And then you have to go back and so forth.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.560]   But I don't know how this could possibly be online.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.880]   It's doing it practically in real time.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.320]   This is like dragging dictate on a desktop.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.680]   Can't you go into airplane mode and see?
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.560]   Oh, I could.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.080]   But that would be too easy.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.000]   It does seem a little too fast for me.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.360]   I'll go into airplane mode in a second.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.120]   But OK, you want to know the negatives.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.280]   And the only negative-- and it's a hardware negative.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.360]   It's not a nice--
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.320]   OK, let me talk about ice cream sandwich briefly.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.120]   Let me finish that.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.160]   And I'm going to tell you what I don't like about this phone.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.760]   A couple of things that are different.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.000]   We've got the bar down here.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.920]   These are easily customizable.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:04.480]   When I go to the apps page, it's slide sideways, not up and down.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.720]   And widgets are here.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.600]   They're no longer on press and hold on the desktop.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.840]   And this is just like Honeycomb, where you get a preview
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.920]   of the widget.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.040]   And if you want to put a widget on any page, you press and hold
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.600]   it and you can drag it around from page to page like that.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.600]   The Google widgets are resizable.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.200]   So if I've decided-- this is the Google+ widget.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.120]   If I decided-- you know, I don't want to occupy the whole page.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.320]   I do have handles that I can drag it and make it resizable.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.360]   There have been third party launchers like Launcher Pro
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.480]   that give you that capability.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.400]   But it's nice to have it built into the OS.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:41.240]   Unfortunately, it doesn't apply to all widgets, just to a few
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.400]   and no Google-- no non-Google widgets that I can tell.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.560]   Although, I guess as time goes by, more people will release
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.680]   versions.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.880]   And that's just how to catch up.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.440]   Yep.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.680]   The folder look is new.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.920]   It's a circle.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.520]   And it works like the iPhone does, where you drag--
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.720]   if you drag an icon-- let's see--
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.680]   you drag an icon on top of another one,
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.400]   they will immediately create a folder.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.480]   Doesn't name the folder until you open it up, and then you
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.000]   can name it there like that.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:08.840]   I like that.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:13.080]   I think that, in fact, as you can see, I'm using folders a lot
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:17.120]   to give me access to more things on the desktop.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.000]   It comes with, interestingly enough-- this
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.920]   is the vanilla Google experience.
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.760]   It comes with a Google folder out of the box with all the
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.440]   Google apps in a single folder.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.960]   That's kind of smart, I think, on Google's part.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.600]   Can you read on apps in there because of ice cream?
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.320]   Gmail looks the same.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.040]   Yes, the context--
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.720]   I'm not going to launch context because I don't want to
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:40.960]   show you--
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:41.800]   Right.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.880]   But the context is very nice.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.640]   Lots more space.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.520]   It's white.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.160]   It's got a light background.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.760]   It looks more like a rola-dex.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.560]   It's nice.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.680]   I think they've done a really good job with the
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.920]   context app.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.840]   I think the Maps app is the same--
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.280]   Google+ different?
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.960]   Google+ is different, only in the respect that it's got a
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.120]   new widget that is a full screen widget.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.720]   But the Google+ app is really just an app.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.440]   But I do like the fact that I can do a full screen
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.360]   scrolling widget of Google+ right on my desktop.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.960]   Widgets are one of the things that really
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.480]   distinguishes Android.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.440]   I'm sorry, go ahead, Leo.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.520]   This is not a widget.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.360]   This you cannot get rid of.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.840]   This Google search bar.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.040]   So Google's really taking a front page.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.000]   They're really saying, no, we want some real estate right
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.560]   on the front of the top of the screen.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.960]   So now, 1280 by 720.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.320]   But you're going to lose this.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.160]   And you're going to lose this because of the buttons.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:41.000]   So the available screen real estate is exactly the same
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.800]   as any other phone.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:48.080]   The only negative to the super high resolution is that
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.520]   sometimes this is path, which by the way, I love.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.280]   Thank you, Dave Moran, for making it available on Android.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.840]   The typeface on this.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.280]   I'm glad they knew that new font, because it is tiny.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.760]   And right now, there's no way to make it bigger.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.360]   So here's the coolest thing about Ice Cream Sandwich
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.920]   that hardly anybody talks about.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.600]   And I buttoned hold the head of the Ice Cream Sandwich
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.480]   project at Google.io.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.800]   And ask him point blank, is there anything that would
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:20.440]   prevent somebody from using this on a desktop computer?
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.280]   And he said no, nothing.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.440]   Well, we know the ACES transformer, for instance,
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.760]   is really kind of a laptop with Android on it.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.040]   Oh, really?
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:31.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.800]   And I see people using Honeycomb, frankly.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.640]   They don't have Ice Cream Sandwich yet.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.680]   Somebody tell me that I can turn off--
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.000]   I don't know where I'll look at display.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.520]   I can turn off that Google search in the settings.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.120]   They have reorganized settings in a very much nicer way.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.440]   So we have wireless and networks here.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.880]   I could see data usage in a very granular way
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:57.280]   that I couldn't see before, including set a bar for my warning.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.200]   So I set it to gigabytes right now,
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.560]   but I can make it more or less.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.760]   And I can see which apps are using the most amount of data.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.760]   I think that's the kind of granularity people are going
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.120]   to need more and more.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.880]   These are the device-specific control panels.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.000]   Somebody's calling me because they know my phone number.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.560]   So you see this is that Honeycomb--
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.080]   Go ahead.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:18.580]   Oh, sorry.
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.160]   I don't care if we show their number.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.400]   This is that Honeycomb slider.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.400]   You see, I can slide left or right to pick up or not.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:29.360]   Developer options-- because it's a Google experience phone,
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.240]   we have USB debugging, stay awake,
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.600]   allow mock locations, desktop backup, password, strict mode.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.920]   There's a whole bunch of developer options in here.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.520]   So clearly, this is going to be the developer phone
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.920]   for Google going forward.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.680]   Makes sense.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.560]   Yeah, makes sense.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.960]   There's NFC is built into here, by the way.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.440]   And apparently, a barometer.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.040]   I don't know what you do.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:52.400]   That's right.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.760]   I forgot about the barometer.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.440]   No app yet has taken advantage of this,
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.600]   but I want to know what the barometric pressure is.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.080]   And apparently, that's in here.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.120]   Battery life, exactly the same.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.080]   Here's the negative, the stupid pen tile display.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.400]   So even though this is--
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.040]   Samsung says it's a super AMOLED display,
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.760]   it is not as deep and rich as the Galaxy 2 S2.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.240]   It's--
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.880]   Path is a good example because it puts up this white screen.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.600]   You can see banding in here.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.360]   You can see pixelation in here.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.960]   When you turn it up to bright, it looks better.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.840]   The brighter you get it.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.280]   But of course, you don't want to do that.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.160]   You want to use automatic brightness
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.800]   to protect your battery life.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.200]   It's not a consistent color.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.600]   Pen tile is absolutely not as good as the super AMOLED.
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.080]   But I love the resolution.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.800]   And when you're watching videos on this thing
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.520]   and you turn it sideways, there's a nice 4.6-something screen.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.560]   So there's definitely--
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.880]   I think this is a good size.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.880]   I think it's--
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.280]   What's putting your default phone lately, Leo?
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.120]   You haven't been using the iPhone 4S a lot.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.560]   So how would you compare this to that?
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.880]   The screen is not as good as the iPhone 4S.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.920]   It's roughly the same pixel per inch,
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.520]   a little bit less.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.440]   But the iPhone 4S color is much more accurate.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.840]   And I think that's a little bit of a negative on this.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.240]   Camera's comparable.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.720]   Not exactly as good.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.280]   There's a nice new feature in the camera
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.480]   that actually I've been using a lot.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.080]   It works really well.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.120]   This is the-- again, this is--
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.120]   Motorola and others have been putting features
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.440]   into the camera software they shipped with Android.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.080]   But this is the Google camera.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.080]   And it now has a pano.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.760]   So there's still-- there's film.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.000]   And there's pano.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.880]   And if I want to take a pano picture,
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.640]   I literally just rotate the camera.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.880]   I don't even have to press the take button.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.720]   And it just records the images and stitches them.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.920]   And does a fairly nice job.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.240]   I've found artifacts.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.960]   But the trick is to go slow enough so that--
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:45.320]   it does seem-- I've posted a couple on my--
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.320]   where did I put them?
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.320]   I guess.
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.960]   Oh, a Euronerd says that the barometer
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.720]   is used for altitude measurement, which improves GPS
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:52.720]   accuracy.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.720]   Right.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.720]   Right.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.720]   That makes sense.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.720]   Yeah, there's certainly on path.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.840]   So there's one in my gallery.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.760]   There's one I took.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.920]   And here's another one.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:05.800]   And it's kind of neat to be able to do a pano without,
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.600]   quickly and built in.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.400]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.760]   I like that feature a lot.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:13.120]   Yeah, I'll certainly do a lot more panos.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.600]   Chase the pano.
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:18.040]   What I'd like to see is that this feature replacing
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:19.680]   the degree of wide angle, I'd like
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.680]   to see flatter lenses as the default in phones.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.720]   And then you can capture a whole room by panning around.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.040]   That would be better than the weird wide angle lenses
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:28.800]   that currently exist.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.080]   These are all-- I would guess around 24 millimeter lenses.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.720]   They're fairly wide, which means it's fine if you're
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.400]   in close.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.880]   And for most uses of a camera phone, that's what you want.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.520]   But if you're going to take a picture of a sunset,
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.280]   the sun is moving.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.360]   The moon is evolving.
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.400]   And so it's not great for distances.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.840]   On balance, this is a great phone.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.240]   I wish the display were better.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.480]   That's probably my only negative.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.080]   I've been very happy with it.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.800]   It does get really hot on the back of it, which
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.120]   is a feature in the winter.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.280]   Sure.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.360]   It could be a hand warmer and a phone.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.840]   And some people have complained.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.080]   MG Seagler complained about-- of course, he loves the iPhone--
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.280]   complain about how chintzy this back cover is.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.320]   We didn't use to that.
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.640]   Samsung Galaxy S2--
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:14.200]   It's the same.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.120]   Same problem.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.440]   And I just pointed out, well, MG, yeah,
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.640]   because who would want to ever change their battery?
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.960]   It should be glass.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.400]   I should just make it glass and glue it down.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:24.720]   The fact--
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.080]   As an iPhone 4S user, I'd like to change my battery.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:28.320]   No kidding.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.800]   Well, you know what I do with the iPhone 4S?
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.760]   I have a big Mophie Juice pack.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.400]   And you know what?
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.720]   Everybody at Lueb practically had a Mophie Juice pack.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.360]   If you're going to have an iPhone 4S,
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.880]   you have to have an external monster, external battery.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.080]   It's like carrying around a car battery with you.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.160]   This is this-- but you know, this is not great battery life,
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.080]   either, but at least I can order another battery
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.960]   and have it charged up and pop it in there, which
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.840]   is a lot more convenient than the Mophie.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.880]   So on balance, yeah.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:56.280]   I like it.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.520]   Could you go to airport mode?
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:58.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.200]   Let's do the experiment.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.200]   Let's do the dictation experiment.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.080]   Siri has a scientific moment for me, so--
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.880]   Siri, as you know, won't even set an alarm
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.320]   without network access.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.000]   Siri says, no, everything I do must be sent back
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.680]   to the mothership.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.000]   So we'll show you.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.600]   Now, here's an interesting thing.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.920]   They've hidden--
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.880]   it used to be airport--
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.800]   airplane mode would be right on top there.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.320]   It isn't anymore.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.240]   You have to click the More button.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.040]   It's here as fourth known as the Alec Baldwin button.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:32.760]   I am not playing--
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.080]   You get it if you hold the power button?
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.000]   Oh, that's-- yeah, no.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.520]   If you hold the power button, you get those choices.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.080]   Silent, you're playing a power off.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:40.920]   That's how you do it.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.120]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.480]   All right, hide my screen.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.280]   I don't want to show any phone numbers.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.880]   I can't remember.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.040]   Here, I'll just pull it over here.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:50.680]   Sorry.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:51.080]   I can't remember.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:51.360]   Oh, good.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.760]   No, I'm still in this bogus message.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:59.080]   So let's continue on with my dictation.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.000]   Nope.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.400]   It's not even-- you can't even press it.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.880]   The button is gone.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.480]   Well, that's-- I mean, that's a pain,
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.320]   but it is so miraculous how the speed is.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.480]   Need to be online.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.840]   I wonder if it's not using both at the same time,
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.200]   spinning off the job locally and remotely.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.160]   It seems so fast.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.680]   I don't know how-- well, maybe--
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:21.960]   I wonder, how does it behave on a slow connection
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.320]   or a connection that's flaky and going in and out?
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.120]   It's interesting.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.320]   It looks super fast.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.120]   Were you connected to the Wi-Fi, Elio?
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.120]   Yes.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.400]   So let me turn off Wi-Fi.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.400]   That's-- let's do one more experiment.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.440]   If you will all bear with us, we'll turn off Wi-Fi.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:43.120]   So now I'm going to be on T-Mobile's HSPA plus 3G.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.440]   And let's dictate now.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:50.840]   So the good news is the dictation button is back on.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.640]   But as you can see, with 3G dictation,
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.640]   it isn't nearly as fast.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.640]   Ah.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.640]   Ah.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.640]   It's a bummer.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.760]   Well, it's not awful, though.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.960]   And what I do like is it types as you go.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:08.960]   And a big improvement over the gingerbread implementation
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.680]   of dictation is it lets you continue until you press done,
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.360]   which is what Siri does as well.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.240]   The problem I have with gingerbread is if you pause,
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.720]   it says, oh, no, you're done and starts recognizing.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.600]   So I think this is actually really good.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.200]   This is not too bad.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:28.920]   I would say it's about five seconds behind, maybe 10.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.400]   So yeah, it definitely is tied to the speed.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.160]   So it is going out to--
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.040]   But it's going to optimize it as best they can.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.120]   Can you use it for any--
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.440]   well, right up, we have some kind of story.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.640]   Could you use it number one in any app or most apps?
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.160]   Yes.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:46.680]   Read port.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.360]   That's part of the keyboard.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:48.720]   OK.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:52.000]   And then second, is it good for commands?
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.360]   Open email.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.360]   Yes.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.680]   And in this respect, it is superior to Siri.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.800]   Siri, for instance, will not open an app.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.480]   This will open apps.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.640]   I've always liked the fact that I could say something
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:07.520]   like listen to Bob Dylan.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.240]   And because I have Spotify on here,
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:12.680]   you could tell it what you want to have that listen command go to.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.640]   But because I have Spotify on here,
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:20.280]   I can play any music that is on Spotify, which is fantastic,
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.440]   all kind of automatically.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.240]   Search that off line.
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:26.600]   How do you queue it that you're going to talk like you just did?
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.920]   You have to-- and remember, there was used to be search buttons
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.440]   at the bottom.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.800]   The search button is now always at the top.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:32.520]   Right.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.680]   So--
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:34.200]   I'd say that.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:37.720]   Was it weird to get used to having two layers of buttons
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.280]   at the bottom of the screen?
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.480]   Yeah, I wish they had physical buttons still.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.880]   I don't really understand why we're using screen real estate
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:44.840]   for these buttons.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.000]   You know, I'll give you an example.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.200]   When you go to camera mode, the camera kind of rotate--
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.800]   you can't really see these buttons.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.840]   It turns the buttons into little dots,
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.840]   but they're still there.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:58.920]   They don't-- it's not like they're rotating them
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.160]   to different sides of the screen.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.840]   They're always in the same position.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.840]   So these could easily have been physical buttons.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.680]   Maybe that's a way of saving money.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.480]   I don't know.
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:09.240]   And I don't really-- maybe others like this,
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.440]   but the recent apps button--
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.040]   I don't find that particularly useful,
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:14.120]   but maybe some do.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.960]   I know that it's on Honeycomb too,
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.760]   and they kept it in Ice Cream Sandwich.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.640]   There must be some reason that they do that.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.360]   It's cool.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:23.240]   I mean, there are thumbnails of every app that's running.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:27.160]   So that's kind of cool, but to me, I don't need that on a phone.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:27.600]   That's more of a--
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:31.560]   It's surprising that they bumped the search button for that.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.680]   Right now, when you build an app,
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:34.360]   you can attach search--
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:37.640]   like your internal app search to the global search button.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.920]   But that global search button doesn't exist anymore.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.240]   That's-- that's right.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:44.160]   Well, it doesn't, because it's only on the desktop.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:44.520]   You're right.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.480]   It's only on the home screen, right?
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:46.840]   So that's--
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:49.640]   Well, it's on every screen, but it's not an app.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.240]   Well, let me see.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:50.640]   Let me see.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.160]   I don't know.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.600]   I think you're right.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.920]   Let me launch Force Square.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.120]   Yeah, I know it goes away.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.760]   Because so Force Square uses-- by the way,
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.320]   that's another point is Force Square
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.640]   does get to use the whole screen,
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.880]   except for this little row on the bottom.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.880]   The other thing is the menu command now
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.240]   is this dot dot dot.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.920]   It looks like a sideways ellipsis.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:11.920]   And there is inconsistency about where it lives.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.320]   Sometimes it's down here.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.120]   Sometimes it's up there.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:17.840]   I just really prefer physical buttons that don't move.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.000]   But that's now--
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.440]   Google made a big point about it.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.520]   You'll go to bar, made a big point about that.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.000]   No, we don't have physical buttons anymore.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:25.600]   They're gone.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.160]   Apple and big.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:27.520]   Yep.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:28.400]   Exactly.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.400]   It's very jobsy.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.920]   And you still have volume control.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:32.400]   You still have an on/off button.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.000]   I don't see the point.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.560]   If an app is designed for ICS or Honeycomb and ICS,
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:38.920]   it will use the action bar, which
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.120]   is having that menu drop down on the bar
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.080]   across the top of the app.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:42.680]   But if it's not--
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.920]   That's what you liked is the action bar, right?
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:45.800]   Right, right.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.160]   So that's why they show that ellipsis.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.800]   That's like the old school apps that--
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.000]   that's just backwards compatibility with the old menu
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:51.560]   button.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:52.560]   Got it.
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:53.840]   It's in case it's in one place.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.360]   I wonder if they're trying to get people to use voice
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:00.600]   recognition instead of lunging for the search bar,
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.760]   again, out of Siri.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.680]   But the problem is the voice recognition button
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.200]   is on the search bar.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:07.400]   Right.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:08.720]   So how do you invoke search?
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.400]   Like, I'm thinking about my app that's--
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.360]   my to-do app.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.760]   It's like, how do you launch search within an app?
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.680]   I guess you have to do it from the action bar.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.440]   Or you have to put-- yeah, you have to probably
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.560]   put a search button on your action bar.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:19.440]   That's what you do.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.080]   Just dang.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.240]   That's probably what they want.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.960]   Anyway, it's a nice phone.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:26.920]   It's not the Jesus phone.
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.640]   But what is?
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.840]   What is?
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.400]   And I can understand Google's going-- I
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.560]   had to say, for two days, I was uncomfortable with ice cream
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.600]   sandwich.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.440]   It was different enough.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:45.040]   And it didn't feel like better, just different.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.240]   I'm coming to get used to it.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:47.960]   Maybe it's better.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.960]   I don't know.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:52.360]   There's some things that are certainly better.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:55.280]   Camera app, by the way, very fast on this.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.280]   Faster than an iPhone 4S.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.080]   So that's nice.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.720]   And the gallery loads.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.920]   Yeah, let's see here.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.000]   I'll show you the gallery.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.280]   Look at me.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.640]   That's me.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.560]   See?
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.560]   No.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:14.960]   I only--
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:15.520]   audibly--
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:15.880]   Can you--
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.080]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.080]   What to work?
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:19.680]   What to work?
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.400]   What to work?
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.120]   So let's look.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.080]   Where did I put the gallery?
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:24.160]   I guess I don't have it out.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.640]   The sounds of an Android user.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.280]   Oh, the new calendar, by the way, very nice.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.920]   That's one thing that has been changed.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:35.240]   And this is the context style, contactless style.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.760]   With-- it's white now.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:39.840]   I think the calendar is much better.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.200]   Very modern feeling.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.280]   That's one thing that's aesthetically, I think, gotten
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.920]   really, really nice.
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.040]   Yeah, it looks nice.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.800]   Yeah, it's much better.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.880]   They already had a very nice gallery app.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:54.320]   And so that's not changed a lot.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.560]   Let's launch it.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.840]   Da-da-da-da.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.160]   It has changed.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:52:59.720]   I take it back.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:03.880]   Because this is the tile in her face now, which is nice.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.040]   I like this.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.160]   They've done a nice job.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.880]   Dumb nails at the bottom.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:11.960]   Yeah, I'm snappy.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.080]   You see how fast that is?
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.000]   Yep.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:19.080]   You certainly don't ever feel like, oh, this is laggy.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.320]   So I think that-- you can see I've customized it already
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:21.760]   quite a bit.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.720]   I have the beautiful widgets.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.480]   By the way, Google, $0.10.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:29.320]   Right now, a lot of apps are $0.10 on the market,
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:33.440]   including beautiful widgets, which everyone should have.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:36.320]   Is there any way to know that on the market?
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.200]   To know what--
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.200]   What's $0.10?
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.680]   Yeah, there's a--
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.600]   A $0.10 button?
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.760]   Oh, that's another thing that's changed.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:43.960]   Is now we have apps widgets.
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:46.280]   And there's always a market button on the--
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:49.760]   just kind of like the bookstore, how it should be.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.560]   You should always have a market.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.080]   So right there.
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.160]   Is this search?
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.680]   So right there, premium apps, $0.90.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.360]   9% off, two days left.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.720]   And every day it changes.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.400]   Oh, so check this.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.520]   This is their response to Amazon's app of the day,
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:01.040]   free app of the day.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:03.600]   I think it's limited time.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.080]   Right.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:07.040]   Nexus arrives, Verizon tomorrow, $2.99.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.680]   Tomorrow, $2.99.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.080]   Go to the next web.com.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.360]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.760]   That is expensive.
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:19.000]   So $7.49, for unlocked, GSM doesn't seem so bad.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.040]   Verizon will deck out with mobile hotspot servers
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.320]   for an additional $20.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:24.840]   Additional.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.800]   Well, they've been doing that before.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.120]   And they have.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.440]   So that's supposed to be the 4G LTE network.
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:31.440]   Right.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.680]   I don't mind not having 4G.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.760]   I'm just rationalizing.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.360]   The browser-- oh, I like the browser.
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:37.680]   Let me show it.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.240]   One more thing.
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.840]   I know this is dragging.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:40.400]   One more thing.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.800]   The browser.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.560]   Share location.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:43.720]   Yes, thank you.
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:44.720]   Oops.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.200]   So this is why I don't like soft buttons.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.680]   It's too easy to push them.
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:51.760]   Share location.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.040]   See, it's right by the button there.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.000]   So it's very easy to do that.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.560]   The browser now has-- so you saw I drag it down
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.240]   to see the address bar.
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.240]   This is Windows.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.720]   So if you have multiple windows open,
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.680]   you'll see them here.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.840]   Bookmarking.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.400]   Sharing was there as well.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.600]   And this is that dot, dot, dot menu.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.720]   I don't like it that you don't know exactly where it's going to be, right?
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:20.280]   It's so weird it goes bottom to top.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.000]   I do like the browser, though.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.720]   It's very, very snappy.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:27.320]   I used to have--
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:32.280]   I used to have a-- actually, those tabs are part of the Google.
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:36.720]   I used to have a variety of third party like Dolphin and X-scope apps
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:37.520]   used for browsing.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.320]   And I'm sticking with this one.
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:40.480]   That's good.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.000]   Nice job.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.800]   So when you pull down, you can see the address bar.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:49.480]   But if you open a new tab, it shows the thumbnail, right?
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.000]   It's not like a tab the way it is in Dolphin.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:52.400]   OK.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.400]   Right.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.040]   So that's plus here, right?
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:58.200]   So that new tab.
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:00.680]   And let's see.
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.080]   Where is it?
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.160]   What should we render?
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:04.360]   How about-- what's--
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.600]   Galaxy Nexus.
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:08.760]   I just-- I want to go to a site with Flash.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:10.240]   Oh.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:12.240]   Vimeo.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:15.200]   You saw-- I mean, you feel how snappy this is.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.080]   It really-- it's actually snappy with my desktop.
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:19.960]   It feels pretty good.
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:20.960]   It's on Wi-Fi.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:22.080]   I should point out.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:30.560]   I hope the tablets are the snappy.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:31.480]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:32.360]   What is the processor?
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:34.400]   And this is at one point.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.400]   Two.
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:35.840]   I don't remember.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.840]   I'm not sure.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.840]   OK.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.440]   So I get this supply.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:43.040]   Maybe it's not going to-- so maybe it's Flash.
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:46.480]   Anyway, there you go.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.920]   That's my extremely lengthy and detailed review.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.880]   No, it was a good tour.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:52.280]   It was rehearsal for our product show, Mark.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.120]   Yeah, we're going to do this on the product show.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.920]   It was one of the things I'm going to review on the product show,
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:02.600]   including one of these new UM-alterm mobile PCs.
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.200]   Yeah, I think it's probably the best Android phone out there.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.080]   But if you already have a Galaxy S2,
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:10.040]   do not feel the need to jump, especially
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.080]   since I think you'll get ice cream sandwich pretty quickly,
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:15.560]   especially since there's CM9.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:17.400]   It might be the way to put it on a lot of phones
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:20.000]   is you see CM9, a signage and mod,
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.680]   instead of official ICS.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.200]   Well, take a break, and then we're
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.520]   going to talk about the--
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:31.000]   how many-- this is a quiz question.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   How many private jets do Larry, Sergey, and Eric
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.160]   have between them?
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.920]   Just a little quiz question.
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.000]   But before we do that, let's talk about my private jet,
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.240]   my Ford Mustang.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:46.720]   I'm a big Ford fan, as you know.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:52.160]   In fact, earlier today, I was test driving a Fiesta, the Focus,
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:55.400]   and then later today, I think I have a 2012 Mustang to try.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:58.440]   And in every case, we're trying out the new Ford Sync
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:02.360]   and my Ford Touch and these Sync services, which
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.760]   are really awesome if you haven't tried these.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.960]   So what you do is you press the button again,
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.720]   steering wheel right, eyes on the road steering wheel,
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.320]   you press the button on the Focus,
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.360]   it's a little paddle behind the wheel, I like that.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.600]   Very easy to hit.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:18.560]   And you say services, and you can get news, stocks, sports,
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.760]   weather, horoscopes.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.560]   You can say, what's the traffic like on my route home?
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.640]   What's the traffic like on my route to work?
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:28.760]   What's traffic like on the way to San Francisco?
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.600]   And it will tell you.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.560]   You can have an in-dash display that does this,
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:35.680]   or you can have it read it to you as you drive.
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:39.000]   You can even have it text it to your mobile phone.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.800]   How about that?
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:43.440]   And of course, all the personalizations available online.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.600]   So you don't have to do it in the car when you're at home.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:49.120]   You can even say, I'm going here, here, here, here,
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:52.760]   on Google Maps and send it to the car.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:55.840]   I love what they're doing with Sync and Sync services.
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:59.560]   I encourage you to go to your Ford dealer and drive a 2012
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:02.560]   Focus Awesome car today.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:06.560]   Or visit the website, Ford.com/technology.
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:08.360]   Some great stuff.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:10.080]   And we'll get the video.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:11.760]   I shot a bunch of video on these new cars
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:14.840]   so you can see me at work.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:15.680]   Although tell Tom--
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:16.680]   Tom--
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.920]   For some reason, I asked for tech news today
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:20.560]   and I got Freak-a-Leak.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.800]   I don't know why.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:25.280]   Freak-a-Leak.
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:26.520]   Tom's looking at you.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:29.760]   I think the Universal Music Group has infiltrated even
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:31.200]   my Ford Sync.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.520]   I don't know.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:33.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.080]   I'm sorry, Dave.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.800]   That video's been pulled down.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.720]   We have Ford.com/technology.
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:41.560]   We actually haven't talked about that issue.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.680]   We should talk about it briefly.
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:45.680]   YouTube's screwing me and Tom.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:50.360]   And every freedom-loving American who wants the internet
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:53.280]   to be free and open.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.560]   So you've heard the saga of mega upload.
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:58.400]   Did you guys talk about this last week?
[00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.720]   We didn't, actually.
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:05.160]   So mega upload is a site that some say is used for piracy.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.040]   Certainly it's a way to upload large files.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.720]   Although who was it?
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.160]   50 Cent, Snoop?
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.640]   Dr. Dre, somebody said, oh, I use this all the time
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.200]   to share music with my buddies.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.840]   Oh, I needed an update to Adobe Flash Player.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:27.600]   So mega upload made a mega upload kind of promotional video
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.720]   with Will I Am and a lot of big names.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.200]   Who is Beyonce in that?
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.800]   No.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.280]   I can't remember who's in the video.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.320]   Lot of big names.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.840]   I know.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:46.080]   And weirdly, even though mega upload says we own this video,
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:49.360]   we've got permission to use everything in this video,
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.960]   Universal Music Group just kind of took advantage
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.000]   of the fact that there's automated takedowns
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.800]   and took down somebody else's video.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.800]   Mega uploads video.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.360]   They said, well, I know we don't like it.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:05.600]   It's still down if you go there, which sucks.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.840]   Tom Merritt on Tech News Today was talking about it this week.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.560]   He played the video, right?
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.520]   They took Tech News today down.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:20.320]   So here's the problem with this.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.320]   First of all, megaupload.com says we have the rights
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:27.200]   of this video and it's illegally taken down from YouTube.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.000]   Second, even if that weren't the case, this is a news show.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   It's a news story.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.960]   We're using a clip of it in a news show, which is absolutely
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:38.000]   legal and fair use and always has been, go home and watch
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.160]   the news tonight.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.760]   And you'll see this happen all the time.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:46.880]   This is completely permissible.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.080]   They pulled down TNT.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.480]   We appealed it.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.640]   The automatic takedown.
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:52.640]   They put it back up.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.960]   And then Universal Music Group filed a--
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.000]   and junk, right?
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.800]   They filed an automatic injunction, took it down again.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.920]   We've appealed that.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.080]   Now they have 10 days to get a court order.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.480]   And if they do pull it down again,
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.960]   and I'm-- U-M-G-I encourage you to pull it down again, please.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.680]   We will go to court because that is not OK.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.800]   Now, unfortunately, and maybe Jeff, you know this better than I,
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.480]   I'm told that the fair use is a defense.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:21.880]   It's not a--
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:22.320]   Yes.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.120]   So I can't use it proactively.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.280]   I have to go to court.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:26.640]   Right.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.640]   And the fair use, as Lawrence Lusack said,
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.720]   is a right to hire lawyers.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.760]   So that sucks because I don't want to spend a lot of money
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.720]   to have the right--
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.240]   But you have the incredible Twitter army.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.240]   Just today, writing the pathtrain in Virginia,
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.800]   as I sit down and see a guy next to me,
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.560]   he's coding on his Mac.
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.640]   He looks over and he says, you Jeff Jarvis?
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.920]   This is the show.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.640]   You have the Twitter army, man.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.320]   So the question is--
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.920]   Well, if it's expensive, we'll have to do a defense fund,
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.880]   or not an offense fund.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.680]   But even if not, I'm going to pursue it.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.520]   Because I just think that this is--
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.160]   if we cannot sit silent as stuff like this continues.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:10.400]   And they pull down a lot of our shows all the time.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.800]   And I guess really what we have to do is go to Congress
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.720]   and say, dudes, you're killing online content.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.280]   Exactly.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.720]   But here's the other thing I think we have to do
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.680]   is we have to give Google cover on this.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.280]   I'm not saying this is a Google fanboy.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.520]   I'm not defending what Google does automatically.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.080]   Corey Doctorow has a piece in the Guardian right now
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.760]   talking about how YouTube's system is screwed up.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.480]   It's broken.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.920]   But what we have to do is put Google in a position where
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:37.040]   they say, whoa, you know, we're going to get in an S
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:40.400]   load of trouble for following your orders all the time.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.560]   You know, come on, you're getting us in trouble here.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.920]   Well, we've got to get Google in trouble.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.960]   We've got to go protest these things happen
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.560]   in organized ways.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.720]   Otherwise, Google is going to the path of least resistance,
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.320]   which is to listen to the big media when they're
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.720]   trying to do deals with.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.720]   So we've got to create pressure on the other end.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:59.400]   Time to bring the Twitter army to march behind Tom.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.560]   This would-- if I can't think of a better reason to mobilize,
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.880]   I'm always very grateful that we have such a great community
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.160]   and active community.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:15.560]   I don't like to mobilize them unnecessarily.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:16.720]   But this really is important.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:16.920]   Right.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.080]   And I think in this case, what we're doing
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.680]   is we go to YouTube.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:25.440]   We go into Congress, you know, Occupy Washington.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.800]   I think that if we go to YouTube and Google and say,
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.000]   you know, there's two sides to this, darn it.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:31.440]   Right.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.800]   And stop just going automatically to the big media side.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.720]   Right.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.040]   And we're the future of media, damn it.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.280]   And what you're doing is you're empowering big media,
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.960]   at worst, you're empowering people like UMG.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:53.520]   You're empowering content rights holders to squash the future.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.080]   So let's knock that off, or we can't do our jobs.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.080]   Now, I can't look at YouTube as a revenue source,
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:04.760]   because this happens at least, you know, weekly.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.160]   On this show, it happens a lot because we play a lot of clips.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.120]   It happens all the time on Twitch.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:10.520]   I don't know.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.320]   It just happened a lot to TNT for Tech News 2.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.960]   No, it actually doesn't.
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:14.680]   It's happening.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.440]   It's happened to us on Frame Rate-- highly, oh.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.160]   It's happened to us on Frame Rate a couple of times
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.480]   because we play movie trailers.
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.600]   That's murkier ground.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.880]   With Tech News today, we played a portion, not the entire video,
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:31.320]   in order to illustrate the news story, which we were commenting
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.920]   and critiquing on.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:37.280]   That is absolutely fair use of 99.9% certain we
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.600]   are in the right here.
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.960]   It's not like, well, we were playing the trailer,
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.080]   but, you know, maybe it's not-- no, this
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.200]   is what fair use exemption is carved out exactly for.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:51.400]   And the way the law is written, universal can legally get
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:55.080]   YouTube to take down our show until it is no longer relevant
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.120]   10 days later with no chance of remediation.
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:58.600]   Right.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.080]   The only chance of remediation we would have
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:03.080]   would be to go to court if YouTube puts it back up
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:04.240]   after the 10 days.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:07.360]   The only chance of remediation would be we would have to proactively sue
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.040]   universal music group and try to prove in court
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.560]   that they in bad faith took us down.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.680]   That is incredibly difficult to prove.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:19.400]   The typical fair use exemptions for this kind of thing
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.200]   are for criticism or comment.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.800]   That was what that was.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.240]   Or news reporting.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.440]   That's what that was.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.680]   Research and scholarship, nonprofit educational
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.640]   uses, and parity.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.960]   Any of those would be traditionally accepted by a court
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:36.800]   as a defense.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.320]   That's the problem.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.320]   The DMCA has written such a way that this takedown
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.840]   request is automated.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:44.880]   It happens.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.120]   YouTube just says, yes, they don't even--
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.680]   there's no human involved.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.200]   Which is why a company like UMG could pull something down
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.880]   that they don't even own.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.120]   And then pull down a news show that covers the story, which
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.640]   is absolutely censorship.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:04.040]   The whole reason UMG is doing this is not because piracy is
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:04.840]   involved here.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:07.520]   They don't want you to hear the story.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:11.600]   Right.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:16.160]   And that's-- I mean, appalling.
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:17.480]   This is censorship.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:21.640]   This is them saying that's a story that doesn't reflect well
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.040]   on us, make sure it doesn't get out.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.040]   So here's a question.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.080]   We've got to get these stories in.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.520]   And you take them down.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.320]   Well, I don't know.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.040]   Should we?
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.280]   Why don't you try it?
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.960]   If they can do it to you, why can't you do it to them?
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.520]   Well, because--
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.440]   I don't know if I want to--
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.240]   Well, because they have better lawyers than us.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.560]   So they can afford to take us to court and say,
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.800]   this was a bad faith takedown.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.440]   They said on this week in Google that they were going to do
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.080]   this as a matter of retribution.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:49.880]   It's not about the outcome of the court case.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.040]   It's about the public opinion.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:51.520]   Right.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:55.080]   And there was a case when there was a New Hampshire where
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:59.280]   some people did an eminent domain on the home of a judge
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:03.040]   who had ruled in favor of a company that was using a domain
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.920]   to take white people's homes.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:08.000]   And so this would be a fantastic publicity stunt.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.560]   Well, I'm not going to do it as a publicity stunt.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:12.880]   I just think we need to really stand up.
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.680]   And the problem is--
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.200]   I don't think I would do that for that person.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.480]   I think you do need a publicity.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.440]   The problem is--
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.200]   Don't put the stunt.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:21.560]   That it costs us money every time they do this,
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.920]   because those 10 days go by.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.960]   This stuff is like fish wrap.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.880]   It doesn't-- nobody's going to watch a new show that's 10
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.320]   days old.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:30.520]   So it's done.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.520]   That means it's not--
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.960]   It's not a restraint of trade action.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.120]   Yes.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:37.760]   It costs me-- every time they do something like this,
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:38.960]   thousands of dollars.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.480]   All right, Twitter army.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:44.280]   We need good pro bono legal help on this for Leo et al.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:45.280]   Leo and Tom et al.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:45.760]   Well, not yet.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.240]   Not yet.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.120]   Let's see what happens.
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:47.960]   No, we need to advice.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:48.640]   We need to advice.
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.560]   Advice would be good.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.400]   Best pads.
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:55.840]   What are the options for a twit?
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.560]   And then choose the best options.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.800]   By the way-- and we've had so much to talk about,
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.160]   and we're already 15 minutes late.
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:06.000]   So Tom, we're going to get back-- get to you in just a moment.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.120]   The answer to the question-- and it should be your number
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.440]   of the week, but it's not, I hope.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:10.960]   Eight.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.840]   Go on.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.040]   Yes.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.360]   Eight.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.440]   Larry, Sergey, and Eric Schmidt
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:19.880]   have eight private jets between three of them.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:23.080]   That's why they're renovating for $33 million,
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.080]   the airship hangar at Moffat Field.
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.040]   Anybody who lives in the Bay Area is driven by this.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.680]   Mm, ginormous hangar.
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.840]   They used to put blimps in on Moffat Field.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.640]   They're going to spend $33 million
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.560]   to renovate the 1930s, "anger one."
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:42.040]   And that's where they're going to store their eight planes.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:42.440]   Why?
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.880]   Because it's really cool.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.400]   Yes.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.200]   It's also really close.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.360]   They have-- OK.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.000]   There's a modified Boeing 7--
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.120]   we're not talking about G5s, baby.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:10:05.000]   Modified Boeing 767, two G5s, a 757.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.160]   And apparently, they've added a fighter jet.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.520]   What the-- there's a first book.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.760]   It's just really bad.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.080]   Well, we said last week that Google's not a nuclear power.
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:16.880]   Maybe it is.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.160]   Marvel is fast.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.240]   So that's five.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.920]   And apparently, there's three more
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.840]   that are-- we're looking for.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:24.360]   People are--
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:27.320]   Are they personal property or company property?
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.320]   They're not clear.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.560]   They do lease these back to NASA, apparently.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.240]   Yeah, NASA uses them as well.
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.760]   It's part of the deal to allow them to--
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:36.280]   Oh.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.240]   So they're kind of--
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.320]   and this is uncomfortable for NASA,
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.280]   because here's this government agency that
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.960]   is favoring a specific company.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.480]   I'm sure Larry Allison would love to get his plane in there.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.480]   I mean, there's all kinds of weird politics about this.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:54.280]   So the TechCrunch is reporting this.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.440]   But the San Jose Mercury News said eight.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.840]   TechCrunch found five.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.080]   We're still looking for the other three.
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.320]   Maybe one of them is that giant plane
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.280]   that Paul Allen is building.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:05.760]   Oh, right.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.200]   It's an amazing story.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.080]   That's another story for another day,
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.000]   because we got so much more to talk about.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.960]   And I really want to get to Majel.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.920]   We got to talk about Majel.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.280]   That should be like a wrap.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:21.760]   Majel?
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.440]   I want-- is it Majel?
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:24.080]   It's Majel.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.240]   Tom is the expert on geek culture.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.120]   Majel Barrett.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.160]   Majel Rodenberry.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:28.720]   Are you know it?
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.400]   Majel Barrett Rodenberry.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:35.400]   And it's a new thing that Google's going to do, apparently.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.720]   But before we do that, I do want to mention our friends
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:38.880]   at Newegg.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:43.280]   If you've ever bought computer hardware, or gadgets,
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.520]   or cameras, or anything, really, that with technology involved,
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.440]   you know about Newegg.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.880]   Everybody who's into technology knows about Newegg.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.240]   It's a place to go to get great deals on, I think,
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:58.600]   85,000 products, 1.9 million customer reviews
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.120]   on their site.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.200]   So you always know if what you're getting
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.720]   is going to do what it wants to do.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:07.320]   The only problem I have with Newegg is my budget,
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.560]   because I could spend millions.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.000]   And I don't dare.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.440]   I got to save some money for the UMG battle.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.360]   Fortunately, you can trade in your used electronics
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.840]   for a Newegg gift card.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.200]   And this is a great way to do it.
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:23.320]   Newegg.com/tray.
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:26.240]   They're using our old friends at Gazelle.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.960]   So you can bring your old iPhones there, your old Kindles,
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.600]   your digital cameras, your D90 with lens, 171 bucks,
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:40.960]   Cybershot, 82 bucks, Kindle, 43 bucks,
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:41.920]   Droid Bionic.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.840]   I would trade that in for a Nexus.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.320]   You bet.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.200]   The camera on that thing is you could wait a day for your camera
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:49.760]   to take pictures.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.760]   It's awful.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:51.760]   It's horrible.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.120]   But don't tell anybody, because they're
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:13:00.240]   290 bucks for Droid Bionic, so 290 bucks for Droid Bionic.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.600]   Newegg.com/tray.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.560]   Get rid of the old, bring in the new.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:10.360]   Once you know, you Newegg, Newegg.com/trayed.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:12.920]   Just think of it next time you want to get some fun at Newegg
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:13.640]   for yourself.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.040]   No, I end up holiday shopping for myself,
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.400]   because nobody's going to buy me the eight gigs Corsair SD
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.000]   ram stick that I want.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.080]   So I do that for geeks.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.040]   We have to buy for ourselves.
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.360]   Google Chrome 16 is out with multiple user profiles.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.320]   That's a nice feature.
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.400]   Thank you, Google, something Firefox set for ages.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:36.640]   Yeah, that doesn't mean for you.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.640]   Before you move on from that, I have a theory about that,
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.360]   which is that if they can get everybody--
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.520]   I think this is what they're going to do with many,
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:47.000]   many of their online products and services and so on.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.280]   Get you to add your password in order to use it.
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:52.920]   Because if you enter in your Google password,
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.640]   you are now using Google+.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.640]   Oh.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.000]   It's all about the plus, baby, isn't it?
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.080]   It's soon as you do that, everywhere you go on Google sites,
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.520]   it's going to show you how many notifications you have.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.840]   You're going to put your name up there.
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.720]   What's going on over there?
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:08.680]   You click it.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.240]   They're going to suck everybody.
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.400]   Google has way more than a billion users per month.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.400]   Where do I sign in?
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.440]   I'm not finding it online.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.360]   Go into the wrench menu, and they'll
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.920]   say like sign in as whoever you are.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.480]   And then you can add any users there.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:24.520]   I don't get it there.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.840]   I've got burden 16, and I'm not getting it.
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:27.600]   Let me see here.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.680]   Let's try this here.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:29.040]   OK.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:32.080]   Here's the wrench.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.840]   And see, I'm signed in as Leo will think.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.280]   As, but I didn't get signed in.
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.520]   No, you don't have the newest version.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.480]   So here's what you do to make sure you get the--
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.000]   you go to Chrome about Google Chrome.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.960]   And I got some checking for updates.
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:48.600]   16.0.912.63.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.280]   I love the version numbers, by the way.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.560]   The version numbers are like IP addresses.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.400]   It is.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.960]   It's a dotted quad.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.720]   So update now-- of course, 9.12 would be illegal.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.920]   But update now, if you don't have it.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:00.520]   Oh my god.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.680]   Yeah, aren't you?
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:02.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:06.320]   Well, why don't you have what we have, which is signed in as?
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:09.840]   Well, if you choose sync does, Jeff, what happens?
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:10.280]   Nothing.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:11.240]   I'm not getting these things.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:11.920]   I'll find it.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:12.960]   I'll figure it out for people.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.920]   It does show up in your personal stuff
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.440]   and the preferences how you're signed in.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:22.440]   You can manage your sync's data on Google Dashboard.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.000]   But if you see here, it says users,
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.760]   you're currently the only Google Chrome user
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:29.440]   I can add a new user right here under personal stuff.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.680]   Actually, my Chrome, for some reason on my Mac,
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.120]   is really slow right now.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.000]   So I just started using Safari again.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.040]   So there.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.160]   And--
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:41.440]   You'll have to take the omnibar from my cold--
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:41.960]   I know.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:43.800]   I hate that one so far.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.480]   I keep typing the--
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:47.640]   typing a search term in the address bar.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.360]   I know.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.200]   It feels so old.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.800]   That would go to the alt K or control K or whatever
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:56.200]   it is to get to the search bar.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.560]   I think that's a good theory, though, Mike.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.560]   I think that the classification of everything continues.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:02.520]   I think it makes sense that they want to know who you are.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:04.480]   Add those plus one buttons everywhere.
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.160]   But it's not--
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.400]   Oh, no, we're tracking you everywhere.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.120]   They don't have any games.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.600]   Everywhere.
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.920]   Well, my theory is that Google is heading toward having one product.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:17.400]   They were initially a company with one product, which is Search.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.480]   And then they spun out one product after another.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.760]   And now they're scattered all over the place.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.400]   And being threatened by Facebook, which
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.560]   is a single walled garden type of place
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.920]   where you use all these different things,
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.840]   but always inside the context of Facebook.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.480]   And they found that that's very powerful.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.200]   So what they're doing, the big strategy,
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.920]   it appears to be make everybody who uses Google anything,
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:40.920]   a user of Google+, and it's a powerful strategy.
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:41.920]   It is.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.920]   It is.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.420]   Yeah.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:46.680]   One of the aspects about it that I think is underappreciated
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.280]   is that they're going to featureize everything.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.480]   They're going to take things that are currently products
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.560]   elsewhere and make them Google+ features.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.320]   Now, you see them doing that with Hangouts,
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.600]   which is now--
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.240]   Skype has been a product all these years.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.560]   And now, pretty much all the basic things that
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:04.080]   are available in Skype are now simple features that
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.080]   are already there, free, right there.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.880]   You already signed in, ready to go, click a button.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:12.480]   You're using the feature of Hangouts and so on.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:16.360]   And so how do you exist as a product
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:19.560]   when your product is just a feature that everybody already
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:20.440]   has?
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.120]   And they're going to just lay waste
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.560]   to all these smaller companies, I think,
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.480]   that by simply product--
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:30.000]   by featureizing their products.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.920]   So you can now add Hangout to a post,
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:35.440]   or actually, is added automatically.
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:38.240]   You can be having a conversation, click a Hangout button,
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.120]   and that conversation turns into--
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:40.640]   It goes live.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.480]   --line video Hangout.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:42.960]   Holy come on.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.880]   Has that happened to you?
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:49.080]   I got the link about half an hour before the show started.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.240]   Yeah, I'm getting it on my post, too.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.240]   Wow.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.680]   Haven't tried it yet, though.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:54.680]   I haven't either.
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:56.240]   I'm seeing it actually on everyone's posts.
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.200]   Yeah, I see it now.
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.120]   Yep.
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.160]   So Herbert posted this, Galaxy Nexus available tomorrow of
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:02.440]   resin.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.960]   If I wanted to talk to Herbert about it,
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.360]   I just clicked the Hangout button,
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:09.760]   and it would say, Herbert, Leo wants to talk to you.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:13.440]   I guess this is going to use Google Talk, or what?
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.400]   No, it's really nice.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.160]   Hangouts.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:15.720]   Use Hangouts.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.920]   And the other thing is that Herbert will see that a
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.960]   persistent button now on the right saying Leo's trying to
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.240]   have a Hangout with you or call.
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.440]   Because you can also call phones now.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.440]   Thank God no one's there.
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:35.720]   But Hangouts is just a lot more kind of there all the time
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.720]   starting today.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.440]   That was kind of a reegis phone moment.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.320]   Well, I'm such a nerd.
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.360]   And this is my problem with Hangouts FaceTime all this.
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.360]   I don't want to talk to anybody.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.880]   Oh, no, you don't want to talk to anybody, Leo.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:48.640]   I talk.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:49.160]   I talk.
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:49.640]   Hangout.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:50.400]   Hey.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.520]   I talk at people.
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.520]   I don't want to talk with people.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.480]   Well, that's another thing they announced, actually.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:02.520]   The ability to broadcast your Hangouts and then automatically
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:05.160]   record them to YouTube is something they announced today.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.600]   They're rolling out to a lot more people.
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:09.000]   So in fact, you will be one of those people.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.840]   I guarantee it because you have a lot of circle friends on
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.080]   Google+, and so now you're going to be able to--
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.080]   You're going to be able to--
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.080]   Circle jerks too, but most of them are friends.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.080]   Circle jerks as well.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.200]   But if you want to talk at people, Hangouts is a great way
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:20.720]   to do it.
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.240]   Just restrict who can get on the call.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:23.680]   I mute them.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.880]   And then you just broadcast.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:26.880]   I said this before.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.080]   If I had this five years ago when we were starting Twit,
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:31.600]   this whole network would have been very, very different.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.840]   We had a labor to get multiple people in video conferences
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.520]   and all that.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:36.840]   This is like push a button.
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.920]   But by the way, I have an announcement.
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:40.880]   I think I can announce this.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.960]   Trey Rackliff, the great photographer who was here yesterday
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.600]   for Twit Photo, and has been doing at least weekly,
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.320]   sometimes twice weekly, Google Hangouts
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.160]   with other photographers.
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.560]   He really been doing a show.
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.160]   And I love it.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:55.520]   And he's agreed to add it to the Twit network.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.440]   So we are going to do, in fact, exactly that.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:01.400]   We're going to do Hangouts, but we're going to broadcast him.
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.760]   We're going to restore him.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:06.280]   We're going to offer him his podcasts automatically.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:07.120]   Fantastic.
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.160]   Isn't that great?
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:08.520]   That's wonderful.
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:09.560]   It's a great experiment.
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.320]   And I'm very grateful to Trey.
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:14.320]   He actually came to us and said, we'd like to do that.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:17.040]   I said, Trey, are you kidding?
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.560]   You got it.
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:21.000]   Now are you going to be able to add ads into that?
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.560]   Well, Trey and I talked a little bit about how would we do ads?
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:25.360]   So I don't know.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.040]   I don't know.
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.560]   What I was thinking is, what if--
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:28.680]   OK, it's a photography show.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:33.400]   So what if we got somebody like a B&H photo, which
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.800]   is big photography salespeople, to say,
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.880]   sponsored by-- brought to you by B&H Photo.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:40.320]   And then maybe had just a little logo on the page or something.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.920]   I don't want to interrupt.
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.560]   No, no, but it's the same as you do now.
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.360]   And then their hosts read.
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.800]   Well, I wasn't even thinking that, although you could have me
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:49.400]   as one of the nine.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.600]   I could just be sitting there.
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.160]   And then Trey could say, well, now we're
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.440]   going to take a break and click on me.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:54.440]   And I get a big.
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.160]   Now I'm going to do it ad.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:56.880]   I don't know.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.280]   If you're going to shoot on location,
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.480]   you're going to need to get there and afford the new
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.040]   four-month--
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.040]   Exactly.
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:03.040]   --for the fast.
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.880]   Exactly.
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:05.400]   Exactly.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:05.920]   OK.
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.280]   We're going for pics and--
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:07.780]   I know.
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.000]   They're trying to rush us along here.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:09.520]   Well, because--
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.440]   Well, we have Chipotle news first.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:12.000]   OK.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.480]   Real quick.
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:15.560]   So a manager of store told me that they're
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:19.120]   going to bring back the chorizo, because it's
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.000]   going to be part of the breakfast menu.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.920]   Yum.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.840]   That mollified--
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.880]   Eileen was in such a hurry until you said that.
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.760]   Now she says, oh, we can keep doing this show.
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:29.560]   Yeah, tell us more.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:30.040]   I'm Twitter.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.960]   Chipotle tweets came in and said, well, not so fast.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:33.640]   I mean, everywhere.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:35.040]   But I said, listen to your people.
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.640]   The people were going nuts for this.
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:37.760]   Yes.
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.160]   End of drinking game now on to--
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.240]   I don't even know what it means.
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:42.360]   Any of that means.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.440]   I was going to talk about--
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:45.640]   Majel?
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:46.080]   Me.
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.000]   Majel?
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:47.560]   Majel.
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:48.880]   Majel Barrett, Roddenberry.
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:51.880]   So it's just a rumor that apparently Google will have,
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:54.360]   maybe even by the end of the year--
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:56.360]   this according to Android and me--
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:59.040]   a Siri-like dictation system that
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:02.600]   improves on the existing system, which is already pretty damn good.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.240]   And they've been working on it for some time.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:08.240]   And evolution of voice actions-- the only difference
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:10.760]   with Siri and voice actions as far as I'm concerned is voice
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.160]   actions has limited vocabulary.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.680]   Siri has more natural language.
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.200]   This would add natural language.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.920]   So Google has to do this because Siri can
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:20.040]   disintermediate them.
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:25.480]   It can say, yeah, we'll search for it on Wolfram Alpha or Bing.
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:26.400]   Go ahead.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:30.160]   I have the feeling that Google is going to take this tool
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.080]   and Googleify it by essentially automating
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:37.440]   the process of finding out what real people say in real life
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:41.360]   and building those common phrases and responses in
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.720]   in a hugely scaled version of that.
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:48.760]   And the power of that is that it's not just American English.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:51.360]   Siri is the English-speaking person
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:54.040]   who speaks a few of the major dialects
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:55.920]   and essentially talks like an American.
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:58.800]   But imagine every little dialect, every little regional thing.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.920]   It could detect how you talk and talk back at you
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:01.800]   in the same language.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.400]   You said this, Mike, when Siri came out,
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:07.880]   you said Siri's a game changer, but it ain't going to be Apple
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:08.480]   in the long run.
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:11.120]   It's going to be somebody who has a lot of information.
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.080]   It's going to be Google.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:12.880]   It's going to be Google.
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.320]   It's going to be-- I agree with you.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.720]   And they're already pretty darn close.
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:18.560]   This ice cream sandwich is pretty darn close.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:23.080]   So Gina's tip of the week.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:26.400]   The GML iOS app just got another update.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.800]   You know when it first launched, they had that bug,
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.280]   that they had to pull it within a day.
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.520]   And the reception was kind of lukewarm.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.240]   It doesn't have that many features.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.600]   Well, it just got this new update with a couple of new features.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.040]   It supports nested labels.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.840]   There's a new notification sound.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:44.720]   But my new favorite feature is this thing called Scribbles.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:46.680]   If you're composing a message in Gmail--
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:48.520]   this works especially well on your iPad
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.080]   because you get the bigger screen,
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:51.680]   but it works on the iPhone as well--
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.960]   you can sketch something out.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:54.720]   Like if you're sketching on a napkin
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:56.440]   or if you want to draw something real quick
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.600]   and attach it to your email really quickly.
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.040]   So it's kind of like a very basic paint tools.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.360]   It's got colors and brushes and that kind of thing.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.560]   And you can send it as an attachment to your email,
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:06.760]   which is just an image attachment.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.200]   It's kind of fun little thing for kids
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:09.760]   or if you're the kind of person who
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:11.360]   likes to do things visually.
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:14.760]   I just bought-- and this is a confession or admission.
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.840]   I just got a stylist from my iPad,
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.600]   which I know you're not supposed to get a stylist.
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:19.080]   Oh, no, no.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.960]   I've been using some art apps and I wanted a little more
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.080]   precision.
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:25.360]   So I've been drawing and writing and drawing a lot on my iPad.
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:26.600]   So I'm really excited about Scribbles.
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.040]   So that's in the new update to Gmail and iOS.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.480]   Which one did you get, just so that curiosity?
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:34.040]   I got the--
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.840]   bamboo?
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:37.400]   That's the hot one right now.
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:37.760]   So walk--
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:40.640]   No, I think it's the Logitech.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:43.880]   Well, it's a silver one.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:44.840]   I forget now.
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.760]   Logitech's got a dummy at the end.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:49.320]   Yeah, well, it's got kind of just like a rubber.
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.680]   Yeah, I know what you mean you got.
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:52.440]   I can't remember the name because that's the one that
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:53.000]   originally came out.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.080]   Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is a Logitech.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:00.480]   By the way, this just in, it's snowing in Mountain View.
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:00.920]   Good.
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:01.440]   They did this.
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:03.480]   Google does this every year.
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:06.920]   They bring in snow machines for their employees.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:10.720]   And they've snowed on the honeycomb and the donut
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:12.800]   and the eclair and all the little
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.680]   androids gingerbread men.
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.800]   I thought the ice cream was leaking.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.880]   It looks like it's the ice cream.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.680]   The fro-yo.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.360]   Let's get Jeff's number, actually numbers.
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.200]   Well, I was going to do five.
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:30.680]   The New York Times did this ridiculous fake trend story.
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:32.320]   They found five people who aren't on Facebook
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:33.200]   and running a trend.
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.200]   And I hate that.
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:34.840]   We're not going to do that.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.120]   There's 800 million people using it five not.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.040]   That's a trend.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:38.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:42.120]   I was going to do 10 because this is the season of the time
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.840]   person thing of the year and 10 best lists and predictions.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.440]   And I hate all that BS.
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:49.320]   By the way, time picked the right person.
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:49.720]   Yeah, they did.
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.040]   The pro---
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:52.600]   I thought the protesters, which is the time person
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.800]   of the year this year is exactly right.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:59.760]   Whether it's Tunisia, Syria, Egypt, or Zakati Park,
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:01.280]   I think it's the year the protesters.
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:01.680]   Absolutely.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:03.120]   I think you're right.
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.440]   But here's the number I'm going to do, which is 500,000,
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:07.280]   which is how much Lewis C.K. netted.
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:07.760]   Yes.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.280]   A growth is grossed for his video.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:12.120]   Just announced on a site.
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.080]   It means he netted--
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:14.520]   In three days.
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.560]   Three days, $200,000.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.040]   Or as he said after taxes, $75.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.000]   He actually--
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.320]   His math is completely wrong because he says
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.640]   at the beginning of the blog post,
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:25.640]   the cost of production were essentially covered
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.680]   by ticket prices to this show.
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:30.080]   So it's all profit or close to it.
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:35.320]   It's all profit, $500,000, $110,000 copies, $5 each, $550,000.
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.520]   People thought he was crazy doing this.
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:39.400]   Some PayPal charges.
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:42.040]   The site cost $32,000, which is expensive,
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:45.040]   but he said it really had to be robust and good.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.920]   And so he said he probably wouldn't
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:49.520]   have paid a little bit more if a company had just
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:50.880]   paid him for the rights.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:53.560]   But they would have charged everybody $20.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.120]   Meanwhile, people are going to keep buying this.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:55.960]   He's going to make an F--
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.600]   Yes, this is the first three days.
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:58.240]   Three days.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.520]   He's going to make a million bucks on this thing.
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:04.320]   And it's going to change comedy on the net.
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:04.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:05.280]   So he--
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:05.800]   Huge.
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:06.480]   --he did it.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.400]   It's an education.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:10.720]   And what delights me so much about this is that--
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:13.160]   I try to get-- I wish that Howard Stern had been somebody
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.560]   to prove that the net is ready for stars.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:17.400]   We only have Glenn Beck.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.360]   So now this is an anecdote to Glenn Beck
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.320]   to say that you know, hey, stars, you really
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:24.120]   can do it on your own to heck with SOPA,
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.120]   to heck with all this stuff.
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:26.960]   This is where we're going.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.880]   Your fans will buy your stuff, make it easy for them.
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:32.360]   And Louis Cique is a half million dollars richer
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.480]   because of it.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.880]   I watched last night.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.400]   I watched like eight Louis episodes.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:41.200]   He is so smart, so funny, so creative.
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:43.120]   And he's smart enough-- and I know
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:46.120]   that he's not a super techie, but he's smart enough to trust
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:48.840]   his gut and say, you know, I bet if I charge five bucks,
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:51.840]   I have no DRM, I have no copy protection.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.600]   I think I can do OK.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.720]   He did more than OK.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:55.560]   Good for you.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.520]   So if people, no doubt, did copy it
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.120]   and did pass it around for free, he's still
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:00.600]   made a half million dollars.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:01.880]   And his fans love him.
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.040]   He found new fans.
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.800]   And this is a smart way to go.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:05.120]   Yep.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.440]   And he did it right, too.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.640]   He did it kind of in the same way you do it, Leo, which
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:11.880]   is that you're broadcasting before and after the show.
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.840]   There's a lot of transparency.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.680]   The live audience can come in.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:19.040]   And it's a very transparent and open process.
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:20.160]   And he did the same thing.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.240]   They filmed him in the beginning, walking down the street.
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.440]   And you're like, oh, he's walking down the street.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.200]   And then he walks up to the theater
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:30.360]   where the show is taking place and walks
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:31.760]   in the front door of the theater.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.440]   It doesn't-- not a limo in the back,
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.800]   but walks in the front door of the theater, shaking hands.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.480]   Everybody's patting him on the back.
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:39.520]   And when he starts the show, there's no announcer.
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.960]   There's no opening act, nothing.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:44.160]   He just walks out on the stage, asks people not
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.160]   to use their cell phones and then does this thing
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:46.880]   and walks off.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:47.840]   And that was it.
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.200]   It was totally bare bones.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.160]   Love it.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.440]   Yeah, really, really well done.
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:52.560]   Really, really, really great.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.400]   By the way, maybe he's more techy than I thought,
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.880]   because two days ago, he did a Reddit AMA, which
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:58.320]   is Ask Me Anything.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:02.360]   Hi, I'm Louis CK, and this is a thing.
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.200]   He said he had no idea what AMA was.
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:05.600]   He was going to try and do it anyway.
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.560]   Somebody's telling him--
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:08.320]   I don't know what.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.960]   Somebody's telling him--
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.320]   he's not-- I think he's got--
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.680]   I think he is-- he's geeky in the sense he gets it.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:14.480]   He gets it.
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:16.000]   This is changing.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.360]   He understands his respect for his fans.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:19.920]   He's a pioneer.
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:21.320]   And to take somebody of his stature
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:25.160]   to take that chance and make it work is huge.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:25.960]   Huge.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:30.280]   Mike, did you have a tip or any thing you'd like to pass along?
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:30.880]   I do.
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:34.640]   How to do a poll on Google+, there isn't a plug-in.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:37.280]   But what you can do is you ask your question,
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:40.640]   what flavor ice cream do you like, chocolate vanilla strawberry.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.000]   And then you put in the comments what the answers are,
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.120]   the options, one for each option.
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:49.000]   So chocolate, it's one, vanilla, and so on.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.040]   And then people can vote by clicking plus one.
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:54.520]   What you then do is you turn off comments.
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:57.240]   You inform people in the post that comments are off.
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:00.960]   So don't try to comment and vote by clicking plus one.
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:04.320]   And then what you end up with is 340 people like this one,
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:05.520]   200 people like that one.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:08.160]   And you can do a poll of any length.
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:09.800]   I'm going to see if-- are there any polls
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:10.760]   that you've done recently on?
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:14.000]   I have pretty recently, maybe three or four days ago.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.680]   Of course, I post 1,000 things a day.
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:16.280]   That's the problem.
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:18.120]   You write so much on here.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:21.440]   But you could do your own poll, actually.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:22.760]   It's instantaneous.
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.720]   But it really works, and people really enjoy it.
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:28.640]   And it's a great way to-- if you have a really contentious
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:34.560]   issue, like religion or Android versus iOS,
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:37.880]   you end up with some comments nobody could possibly read them
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:37.920]   all.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:40.720]   But a poll, everybody can get the snapshot of--
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.160]   And are people pretty ruley?
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:44.480]   I mean, do they follow the rules and do it?
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:45.840]   Or do they start commenting?
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.040]   Because if they start commenting,
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.240]   you could screw the thing up.
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:51.000]   You turn comments off to one of the features.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.640]   And sometimes people post a comment
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:56.760]   before you can turn them off, because you're typing as fast.
[01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:58.240]   And then you just delete them.
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:00.400]   And people seem to understand.
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:04.440]   And you get a lot of shares for these polls,
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:08.160]   which amplifies the response.
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:09.040]   So it works.
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.360]   And it's a lot of fun.
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:14.000]   And it's still a pretty new practice.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.680]   So people really like it.
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:16.440]   I like it.
[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:19.040]   That's Mike Elgin, the world's only lovable technology
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.240]   writer computer world.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.680]   And of course, Google+--
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:22.760]   Plus.
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:26.320]   Mike, he makes his newsletter out of it, Elgin.com.
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:26.920]   Just go there.
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:28.040]   You'll find him.
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:29.080]   Thank you, Mike, for being here.
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.280]   Always a great pleasure to have you.
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:32.200]   Pleasure was all mine.
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.080]   This is such a good show.
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:35.400]   We didn't even get to the new Twitter.
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.640]   We had so much to talk about.
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.720]   We'll just come back and do it again next week.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.920]   Actually, I won't be here next week.
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:46.080]   Tom will be back, which means TNT will start on time for a change.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:48.600]   But I think we're going to do twig--
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:50.200]   We'll talk about a lizard video.
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:51.080]   Yeah.
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.280]   Really fast.
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:53.000]   Really, really fast.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:57.240]   We won't hold up TNT anymore.
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.240]   Oh, why not?
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:01.400]   I think we have to show this lizard video.
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:02.200]   What was I going to say?
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:05.360]   I was going to say the 28th that we're going to do a show.
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:08.440]   20th, we are going to do a show if you guys are up for it.
[01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:09.800]   Gina can't just be flying.
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:11.800]   I'm happy to be on a plane.
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:16.080]   I proposed, Leo, that it is a tribute to Gina's show.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:16.840]   Sounds good to me.
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:19.400]   But let's do lots of good Katrina.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:22.160]   We love you, Gina.
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.760]   Oh, yes, we do.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:26.040]   I'll be on the plane very nervous about what's
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.040]   happening on the ground.
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:30.040]   We love you, Gina.
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:32.960]   We do Kotki.org.
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:38.600]   Lizard, plays, and crushing game.
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:39.600]   Do I need audio for this?
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.440]   Because I won't have it.
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:41.440]   No.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.280]   Oh, you don't need audio.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:46.040]   On an Android tablet, see, lizards, even lizards.
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.800]   Oh, I'm the Geico Gecko.
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:49.280]   Oh, I hate ants.
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:51.480]   I'm going to squish these ants right now.
[01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:53.280]   Oh, oh.
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:53.780]   Dead ants.
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:54.280]   He's really good.
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:55.040]   Dead ants.
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:55.640]   Yeah, good.
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.560]   Oh, I love them.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:57.920]   More ants.
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.320]   They keep coming off the screen, but they
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:01.640]   don't taste like anything.
[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:03.840]   This is so weird.
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:04.760]   This is great.
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:05.880]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:06.880]   We'll see you next time.
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.080]   We do this show every Wednesday, by the way, at 1 PM,
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:12.680]   Pacific, 4 PM Eastern, 2100 UTC.
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:14.200]   Twit.tv, if you missed a show, you
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:15.920]   can catch the video after the fact.
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:16.880]   Ooh.
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:20.600]   Now he's going to have lizard juice all over his screen.
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:21.240]   You know what's great?
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:23.560]   He's not fooled by the non-ant stuff.
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.000]   Well, there he was.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.520]   Game over, man.
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:28.360]   Game over.
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.760]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:33.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:47.560]   Oh, I didn't see the guy spraying him.
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:50.280]   Oh, it's pepper spray.
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:53.680]   So yeah, I think Tom is really being--
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:56.240]   well, not just Tom, all of us.
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:57.240]   Yep.
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:00.320]   And we've appealed twice now.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:02.000]   How many times have we appealed, Tom?
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:02.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:04.720]   So there's the robotic takedown we appeal.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:06.120]   We appeal the robotic takedown.
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:09.600]   So the DMCA takedown kicks in when universal resubmits.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:10.120]   Right.
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.400]   And so we have actually appealed that.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:15.360]   Universalized 10 days to respond to that with a court
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:19.200]   order or our show goes back up.
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:20.520]   Oh, that's good news.
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:23.400]   So I didn't sure you didn't hear that, but I will re-explain.
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:24.080]   And we do this.
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:25.800]   It happens frequently in our news shows
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.800]   because we put clips in there.
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:31.600]   In this case, the clip Tom uses mega-- the mega uploaded--
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.920]   famous mega upload video on YouTube that had everything
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:38.160]   in there was approved by the owners of the content by--
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.720]   Mega Upload.
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:40.840]   You got to prove it.
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:43.560]   They filed a waiver from Will I Am today in court.
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:47.080]   So every personality in there has said, yes, you
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:47.920]   may use my stuff.
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:50.240]   The universal music group still pulled it down.
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.280]   And Google exceeded to that.
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:54.400]   Now, maybe the dispute is, well, these
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:57.280]   are artists that do not have the right to say that.
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:00.080]   Yeah, there could be all kinds of reasons universal gets
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:02.680]   to say that mega upload can't use that footage.
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:04.000]   And that can be determined in court.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.280]   But they shouldn't be able to pull down a daily news show
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:09.600]   because they are commenting and critiquing on it.
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:09.640]   Yes.
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:12.720]   So there's two parts in our favor.
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:16.440]   One is that mega upload says we own the content.
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:19.760]   So who is UMG to talk about somebody else's content?
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:20.440]   Pull it down.
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:22.840]   And why YouTube lets them is beyond me.
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:25.880]   But then there's an exemption for us.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:27.120]   We're news shows.
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.360]   And we're showing these clips in that context, right?
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.160]   Using them to dress up the show.
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.440]   We're talking about the news.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:33.400]   And that's fair use.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:37.520]   Now, the problem with fair use is it's not a proactive defense.
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:38.400]   It's--
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:39.600]   It's a defense, yeah.
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:40.240]   It's a defense.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:40.840]   It's not a--
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:42.920]   And YouTube's following the DMCA.
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:43.400]   They're saying--
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:43.400]   They're saying--
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:43.900]   They're saying--
[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:44.400]   They're saying--
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:45.680]   They're saying, this is what we have
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:48.680]   to do to maintain our ability to stay online.
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.000]   Well, I certainly don't want YouTube to disappear.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000]   But what it means--
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.240]   You can censor anybody anytime they want by claiming
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:55.680]   there's a copyright violation.
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:58.200]   So then it's automatically taken down.
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.360]   We appeal that.
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:02.000]   YouTube then goes back to UMG, right?
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.640]   And then there's an official DMCA takedown,
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:07.200]   which they probably have a stack of them by the door.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:08.480]   And they just go, you hear.
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:11.680]   And then-- and then-- so then we appealed again.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:15.680]   And now there's a 10-day period in which the UMG would now
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.840]   have to go to a judge.
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.920]   Yeah, they'd have to get an injunction saying--
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:19.800]   Against us.
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:23.880]   And then the quit is breaking the law,
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:25.560]   and they have to pull this down.
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.120]   Otherwise, YouTube puts it back up.
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:32.720]   So then if that happens, then we will go to court.
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:34.520]   No, it just stays down at that point.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:36.480]   We wouldn't necessarily have to do anything unless we
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:37.120]   would fight it.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:38.040]   I would like to fight it.
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:40.040]   Yeah, then we would have to go to court and say, no,
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:41.280]   this is wrong.
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:44.920]   OK, so we will pursue that.
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:45.920]   You have my commitment to pursue that.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:46.960]   My guess-- well, thank you.
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:50.280]   My guess is universal won't file the injunction.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.080]   Because they don't care.
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:52.240]   10 days later, it's all over.
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:53.000]   It's not worth their time.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:53.500]   Exactly.
[01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:54.720]   And that's the problem with the law,
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:57.040]   is it gets to take a daily dues showdown for 10 days
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:58.320]   with no actual evidence.
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:02.640]   So that happens to us on Twitter, almost every other show.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:05.080]   And if a show of Twitter, for instance, is down 10 days,
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:07.840]   we've lost most of the revenue.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.240]   Same up thing for TNT.
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:10.880]   You're a daily show, but a weekly show.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:11.600]   That's really--
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.760]   That's-- that's-- yeah, it really is effective.
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:17.720]   So Eddie Pie in the chat just put up a link for a piece
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:20.200]   that Corey Dr. Rowe wrote in "The Guardian."
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:25.280]   Saying the content system sucks, which it does.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:28.400]   But I guess it's--
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:29.600]   I don't know.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:32.320]   Is it incumbent on Google to come up with something better?
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.160]   What's incumbent on Congress?
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.080]   Congress needs to come.
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:35.600]   Yeah, let's--
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:36.640]   YouTube's basically just--
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:37.360]   Oh, they're doing it.
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:38.200]   It's called SOPA.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:38.920]   It's wonderful.
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:39.680]   Much better.
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:40.160]   That's right.
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.360]   It's being voted on today.
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:45.080]   And by the way, you know who will be exempt.com.net.org,
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:46.160]   but not.tv.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:48.240]   So we're still screwed.
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:50.920]   Yeah, don't we follow and follow under the rules of Tovalo
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:52.440]   in that case?
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:53.840]   Yes.
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:57.200]   Tovalo decides what's legal here, baby.
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:59.560]   We should just move the damn show to Tovalo.
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:00.880]   I'm with you.
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:05.000]   Who's up for going to the Pacific Islands?
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.400]   It's warm there, right?
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:07.240]   It's sinking.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:08.120]   Those are my people.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:09.480]   It's sinking.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:11.280]   That's Bill, Trit, Island.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:12.600]   So we'd have to kind of put--
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.200]   I don't know what, but it's sinking.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:15.680]   It's going to be gone in a few years.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:16.960]   We're going to sell more bricks.
