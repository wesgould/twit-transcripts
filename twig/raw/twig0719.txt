[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.240]   The SEC is going after Binance and Coinbase.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.640]   But should they?
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.920]   Minecraft comes to the Chromebook.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.520]   Jeff's really, really happy about that.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.880]   And we'll talk about the state of media today.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.880]   It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.920]   This is Twig.

[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.920]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.920]   We can't remember the latest news from Google, from Microsoft, from Facebook and Twitter.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.920]   No Apple!
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.920]   No Apple today!
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.920]   That's Mr. Ant Pruitt sitting right next to me.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.920]   Hello, sir.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.920]   With Snoopy on your chest.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.920]   Did I mention that Apple is so cool?
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.920]   I was about to say which Apple is going to put on a watch.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920]   There you go!
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   Look at that!
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.920]   From Hands-On Stagrami High Ant, that was Stacey Igamathem from Stacey on IOT.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920]   Hello Stacey!
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.920]   Hello!
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.920]   What's showing your band?
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.920]   On your wrist?
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.920]   Bracelets?
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.920]   Oh, by Bracelets?
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.920]   Yeah, that's pretty.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.920]   Is that pride?
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.920]   I really like that.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   No, there are...
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.920]   It's like...
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.920]   It's pride-ish.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.920]   It is.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.920]   I mean, I am proud.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   So, yeah, this is actually a good gift for people, y'all.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.920]   If you have women in your life or men who have come home...
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.920]   Is it a USB key in a bracelet?
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.920]   No, it's just a nice looking bracelet.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.920]   It's by a woman named Roxanne Oscelin.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.920]   I don't know.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.920]   I bet there's a secret code to it.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.920]   Oh, yeah, maybe.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.920]   That's what it means.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.920]   That's what it means.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920]   That's what it means.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.920]   They're great.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.920]   It could be a barcode.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.920]   It can't just be a regular bracelet.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.920]   No, it's trying really hard.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.920]   You can't give it a tech angle on some kind.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.920]   It doesn't have a tech angle.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.920]   It just looks nice.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.920]   It doesn't play that way.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.920]   It's a tech angle.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.920]   You hit the turquoise and something happens.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.920]   The white and something else happens.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.920]   That is Jeff.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.920]   He's the letter to Professor Fonerless.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.920]   The point of innovation at the...
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.920]   ...Rig.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.920]   Newmark.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.920]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.920]   Won't be seeing tomorrow.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.920]   He is a company...
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.920]   ...an autographed copy of my book.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.920]   On ice, the Gutenberg parentheses.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.920]   And happy birthday to Mr. Newmark.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.920]   Oh, it's birthday today.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.920]   It's not today.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.920]   Around this time?
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.920]   I think I missed it.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.920]   Jeff, I want to say, and I know you wouldn't bring this up because you're not that kind of guy.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:04.920]   But I do want to say that I am hurt and chagrined that the school is dropping the Engagement Journalism Program.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.920]   Thank you very much.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.920]   Yeah, I'm not talking about it.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.920]   They say they're pausing it, but I'm not sure exactly what that means.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.920]   Tell us what engagement journalism is and why it's important.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.920]   Kind of so engagement journalism is a program that I've...
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.920]   ...it's a promise to accomplish of my career to start this program.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.920]   And the idea is that you don't start with the journalists and our ideas.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.920]   You start by listening to and observing and understanding and relating to communities.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.920]   And only then can you imagine what journalism they might need.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.920]   And our students come out and they get the most amazing jobs.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.920]   They are changing newsrooms.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   They're the Trojan horses to change the relationship of the journalists to the public.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.920]   And they're just great.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.920]   Oh my God, they were talking about this.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.920]   And it's a great, great program.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.920]   And somehow, some way, the flame will continue, damn it.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   Good.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.920]   Yeah, it's too bad.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.920]   And this wasn't the entirety of your job there at...
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.920]   No, no, no.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.920]   I started three bachelor's degrees.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.920]   And I don't have a bachelor's degree.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.920]   That's hysterical.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.920]   Wow.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.920]   But you're a working journalist.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.920]   I started entrepreneurial journalism.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.920]   But that's now a slightly different program, though.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   I would love to see that become something different.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.920]   I started our executive program, News Innovation Leadership, which is phenomenal.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.920]   It's people, the order of managing editors and editors and CEO, vice presidents and such,
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.920]   the next leaders.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.920]   And then I started engagement with my colleague, Kerry Brown, who's just brilliant.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.920]   And what I admire, of course, is that while everybody is talking about the death of journalism,
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.920]   and death of local news, and death of newspapers, you're doing something about it, which I think
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.920]   you deserve some praise for.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.920]   You're really looking for new ways for journalism to be relevant.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.920]   And the students do that.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.920]   They spend the entire year and a half with one community.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.920]   So they get very much in depth with that community, understand that community's needs.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.920]   And they do creative things.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.920]   One of our students, one of our brain students, for example, used the theater of the oppressed
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.920]   to get women who had been abused to be able to tell their own stories and change their
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.920]   endings.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.920]   One student was recovering addict, and she found ways to serve addicts with data.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.920]   Another student lost a sister to addiction and found ways to bring their families together.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.920]   Oh, that's great.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.920]   It's journalism of a very different stripe.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.920]   So I thank you for noticing.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.920]   I'm really grateful.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.920]   I'm very, very proud of everything the students done.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.920]   The school says it's going to come back in some form.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   We're going to have to see what they say.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.920]   Well, I put in my vote to support.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.920]   Thank you.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   Thank you very much for that.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.920]   Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.920]   And we need these new ways to become, to be relevant because we need journalism for crying
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.920]   out loud.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.920]   And speaking of which big changes CNN.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.920]   You know, I read the Atlantic.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.920]   Oh, that's what we're leading with.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.920]   Well, I thought we'll get you a whole journalism block.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.920]   You're a journalist.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.920]   Okay.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.920]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.920]   Yeah, sure.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.920]   It seems relevant.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   I think it's a great thing.

[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   It's not exactly what you're looking for.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.920]   It's insufficient.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.920]   Yes.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.920]   In some instances, right.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.920]   In some instances, yeah, I would want some.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.920]   You want to know why?
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.920]   You've been with sports.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   Think about a sporting event.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.920]   When you watch someone broadcast sports, obviously you want the facts.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.920]   You want the scores and the stats that go with the person.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.920]   But there's a tremendous value in having a commentator who knows the team and can be like,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.920]   "Oh, and Ricky Bob has just lost his father last week, so he's probably playing pretty
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.920]   poorly.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.920]   Let's see how he's going to handle this."
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.920]   Ricky Bob's right.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.920]   It's a cricket player.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   You don't know the cricket.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.920]   That's good.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   Actually probably is.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.920]   I would know.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   That's good.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:18.920]   What I don't necessarily want is if I turn on NBC to watch the game of the week in, say,
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:24.920]   Oklahoma versus Texas and the broadcasters are clearly for the Oklahoma softwares.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:26.920]   That's a problem.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.920]   I agree.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.920]   Neither one of those are my teams, but I don't want to enjoy the fact that it is a competitive
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.920]   football.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.920]   Here's the proof of what Stacey said.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.920]   You could just watch the game.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.920]   But you want commentary?
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.920]   You could turn the sound off and just give me the commentary of First and Team.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.920]   It's a color.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.920]   It's a 28-yard line and it's a little warm out here today, so I expect a lot of drop balls
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.920]   and humidity.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:53.920]   I love it when Tony Romo does his color because he was a quarterback.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.920]   Right.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   He was here.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.920]   They're playing the...
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   He's an eight-man front, so they probably expect to run on third and two.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.920]   I love that kind of stuff.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.920]   Let me try this out on you.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.920]   Not sports, but by the way, that's what I have Lisa for.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.920]   I turn the sound off and I say, "Lisa, what's going on?"
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.920]   Shit, I got one!
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.920]   Only if the Niners are not doing well.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.920]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.920]   So, Ant, there's a movement called Solutions Journalism.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:26.920]   The idea is that the journalists don't solve anything, but that when you report a problem,
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.920]   if a community is working on a solution, you should also report that.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.920]   Yes.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.920]   You should let people know what they're working on and we can judge that.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.920]   We can judge the excesser failure, but to leave it alone was saying, "The world's effed
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   up here and effed up there and effed up here is insufficient."
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.920]   The fact that they're mentioning that there is a solution out there that's factual.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   That's giving me the facts.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   All right.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.920]   Yeah, let me channel you one more time.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.920]   Good.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.680]   Because what news does now, and it's all about ratings, it's the same reason Twitter is the
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.920]   way it is, is you're going to stick around longer if you're upset, if you're outraged.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.920]   Whether it's MSNBC or Fox or CNN, if they want ratings, the thing to do...
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.920]   They know that.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:12.920]   The thing to do is get you pissed off and then you're tired of being pissed off.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.920]   That's the thing, why aren't...
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.200]   I'm not saying everybody needs to be like, "Can't prove it," even though there's nothing
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.920]   really wrong with that, but why...
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.920]   Well, there's a lot right with that.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.440]   I'm not prying the side of saying, "Hey, yo, this is not good.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.840]   Stop giving us this garbage."
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.800]   I bet you, you feel manipulated by these guys.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.920]   It's very easy to be manipulated, very easy.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.920]   It is.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.360]   They know how and they've refined it over years and it's a challenge.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.240]   Now, the reason I bring it up, there is a tech angle, although I'm fascinated by the soap
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:51.360]   opera as well, but there is a tech angle because somebody say, "You see what Alberta did to
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.360]   licked?
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.360]   Watch out."
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.680]   Because Michael Lewis has been embedded with Elon Musk for the same amount of time, watch
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.520]   out.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.960]   This is an interesting new form of journalism where you spend a year with the subject,
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.960]   a long time with the subject and create a profile, and there's a high risk level to
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.600]   giving that person that kind of access.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.600]   Michael Lewis has been...
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.600]   Samuel Bankman-Freedie was embedded with.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.600]   Who was embedded with Elon?
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.600]   Somebody else was embedded with Elon.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.600]   Hold on.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.600]   Walt Rosigson.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.600]   That's it.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.600]   But now, Isaacson is not going to do...
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.600]   Isaacson is a H.G.ographer.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.600]   He's good.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.600]   No, he's a H.G.ographer.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.600]   He's not going to...
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.600]   But Michael Lewis will make you look both dramatic.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.600]   That's who he is.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.600]   Oh, well, that'll be good.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.600]   That'll be the most important one.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   Yeah, that'll be the most important one.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.600]   Who's interested?
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.600]   Who's it with?
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   S.B.F.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.600]   Samuel Bankman-Freedie.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.600]   S.B.F.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.600]   The whole way from the tip of the top of the pops to the bottom of the barrel.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.600]   Well, your Honor, I'd prefer not to hand over my recordings, but...
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.600]   Anyway, I guess I have.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.600]   So that's a vintage from a tech point of view.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   Thanks.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.680]   Speaking of him, if I may for a minute, I was doing research this week for the Internet
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.680]   Book I'm working on.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.680]   And I was on the AI chapter, and I started digging into long-termism.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.680]   Whoa!
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.680]   What a rabbit hole, a rat hole, that is.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.680]   Have you looked at that much?
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.680]   What is long-termism?
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.680]   Are those like the clock of the long now type people?
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.680]   Really?
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.680]   It's more than that.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.680]   So it's what Peter Teal believes in.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.680]   I think there's a little bit of Sam Albin.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.680]   Freed was also there.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   It's related to effective altruism.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.680]   Musk is into this.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.680]   So the deal is...
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:39.680]   This is where, by the way, from previous shows, the term existential risk comes from.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:45.680]   This whole notion of AI being an existential risk, when you see that in that 20-word statement,
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.680]   that's long-termism.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.680]   Right.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.680]   So it's related to a whole bunch of things.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.680]   Let me find it here, right?
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.680]   Am I right up?
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   So they believe that in the future, there will be 10 to the 54th human beings.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:08.680]   If we do a good job, and if we populate the solar system and maybe the universe, the future has so many more people than we have today or the past.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.680]   So that really changes our priorities about things.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:20.680]   And we should really worry about our obligation in that future, which on the one hand sounds okay, because like, let's get rid of climate change, because we want to be nice to our great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.680]   Okay.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:27.680]   But it brings with it all kinds of things, like...
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.680]   So it's the attack here.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.680]   I'll give test Creole.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:39.680]   I'll give you the real problem here, which is it ends up becoming something that Nazis used to say, the ends justify the means.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.680]   Exactly.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.680]   And it says that, but it also means other things too.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.680]   It's like enhanced human beings as part of this, so that you can move ahead.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.680]   Well, that starts to look like eugenics pretty quickly, which is another Nazi thing.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:59.680]   The idea that you should maybe you should push resources and money to rich people, because they're more likely to improve the future.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.680]   It's very beneficial to billionaires.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.680]   The first act is all you really need to know, and then you can stop.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.680]   So there's an acronym, test Creole.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:17.680]   So it's a combination of transhumanism, extropeanism, the belief that technology can make us immortal.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.680]   Singulitarianism, right? You know what that is, the singularity.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:29.680]   A cosmism, a cosmic belief in promoting life off Earth, rationalism, we know what that is from our philosophy courses.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:36.680]   Effective altruism is good to make a fortune, and long-termism, which also a little utilitarianism in there too.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:41.680]   You start digging into the beliefs, and it gets wacky.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.680]   It ends up justifying a lot of...
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.680]   A lot of means. And the things that happen like the Holocaust are just ripples in the bigger context.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.680]   It justifies a lot of bad behavior in the present, because you're projecting down the road.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:19:01.680]   And oh, it's all about, trust me, it's okay for me to be rich and build a house in a silo, because it's all about the future, and not the present.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.680]   And I think it really is a terrible point of view.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:12.680]   I'm going to talk more about this as a guy named Emil Torus, who was a long-termist, who's now a non-believer,
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:18.680]   and he's written a lot. They have written, pardon me, a lot of really interesting things digging into this.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.680]   But it so informs what these tech boys are thinking.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.680]   Yeah, I don't think... I think it's appealing, because the principles aren't wrong.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:31.680]   And so it's very appealing, especially if you have a sci-fi, futurist mindset.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.680]   Right, exactly.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.680]   But it's used to justify really poor behavior.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.680]   It's really why Elon Musk and Peter Thiel...
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.680]   Why would all these guys support RFPH?
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.680]   Everybody has to have babies. Why does he want to go to Mars? It all fits into this.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:51.680]   Yeah. And it's a great way of avoiding responsibility for what's happening right now in your factories.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.680]   But I'm thinking of the future.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.680]   Right, exactly.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:06.680]   Anyway, the other side of this that I thought of when all of this came out, because of course one of the issues,
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:11.680]   the great issues that Jeff Zucker had to face and Chris Licht had to face at CNN,
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.680]   is this issue of 2020 denialism.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:21.680]   2020, the election was a lie and Trump won.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:30.680]   And of course, the very first thing that happened in the Donald Trump rally that CNN hosted was...
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:35.680]   You know, Caitlyn Collins said, "Well, who won the election in 2020?" And Trump said, "I did."
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   And as much as she would try, there was no way she could interject on that.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.680]   Which they knew was going to happen. They knew there was going to happen.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:50.680]   So you may remember Twitter, Facebook, YouTube all blocked election denialism.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.680]   What is the term for this 2020 lie?
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.680]   Big lie.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680]   The big lie.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:03.680]   They have now, and this is an article from platformer Casey Newton, all given up blocking those.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:09.680]   And it amounts this week. Yeah, we're not going to block videos with the big lie anymore.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.680]   Twitter has long blocked. Stop blocking that.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   There's this huge movement.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.680]   And one of the things Casey says, which is really interesting, is that Elon has been the stalking horse for all this.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:26.680]   Companies like YouTube and Facebook watch carefully when Elon gets away with it Twitter.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:31.680]   And go, "Oh, okay, we can do it now too."
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.680]   This does not bode. If you ask me, bode well for 2020.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.680]   Forget the future.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   What's the rationale?
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.680]   I didn't get to just read the whole thing, Leo. What's the platform's excuse?
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.680]   That's actually, I don't know.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.680]   I couldn't find any.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:57.680]   Casey says, "One function must now serve in the tech ecosystem is to give cover to other companies seeking to make unpalatable decisions.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.680]   Across a variety of dimensions, Musk has moved fast and loudest.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:07.680]   And when others have followed, the response has been Bailey and whimper because we're all paying attention to Elon, right?
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.680]   Mass layoffs, a strict job performance requirement.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.680]   Remember, Twitter laid off almost more than half of its down.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   Damn near everybody.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.680]   Strict job performance requirements. You will show up or death.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.680]   A war on remote work paid verification for social accounts.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.680]   Twitter, JEX.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.680]   All of these served as a kind of effort. This is Casey Newton writing.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:34.680]   AFREDIGIAC for other Silicon Valley CEOs who proceeded to implement their own slightly softer versions of Musk's cultural reset.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:39.680]   In effect, he moved the overton window, I guess. He was so extreme.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:45.680]   Didn't the Wall Street Journal just have a story about Elon Musk and why he's focused on the grind?
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.680]   And it was kind of, I was surprised because it was in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.680]   I have to say, I have stopped paying attention to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.680]   Did they show him in a good light?
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.680]   In the last few months, the Rupert Murdochs.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:04.680]   No, no, no. They were saying his focus on the grind, he's basically focused on this despite the fact that employees hate it.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.680]   And he's trying to convince them to work more than they really should.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.680]   Again, I was surprised to see it in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.680]   Leo's right. They've been promoting Musk. They've talked about the Musk doctrine.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.680]   They've been trying to make him seem more serious than we know he is.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.680]   Elon Musk is all about the non-stop grind and he can't stop talking about it.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.680]   Yeah, I'm not sure this is negative.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.680]   Billionaire tries to motivate workers with focus on sacrifice.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.680]   Wall Street Journal we're talking about.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.680]   As many push for work-life balance.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.680]   Okay, interesting. So this is kind of negative.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.680]   It was a little skeptical of his focus on the grind.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:44.680]   Basically saying that it's really just designed to make employees work harder without any sort of compensation.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   Basically, it's, yeah.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.680]   Musk says he works 120 hours a week.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.680]   Works on what?
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.680]   Asked at the Wall Street Journal CEO counsel summit in May about managing his workload.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.680]   Musk says he tries to divide his time predominantly between one company each day.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.680]   So Tesla's Tuesday's.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.680]   No, he thought it was Taco's.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.680]   Tesla's a Tesla's.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.680]   So he might end his day working on Twitter, which also has a T.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.680]   So it could be Twitter Tuesday.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.680]   Musk says that with the acquisition of Twitter, his work has exploded to more than 100%.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.680]   More than 120 hours a week.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.680]   How is that possible for all?
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.680]   Leadership.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   17 hours a day.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.680]   I mean,
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.680]   Thanks for the math.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   We needed that.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.680]   Let me calculate that real fast.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   He says he takes off.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.680]   Does he ever be or was there a calculator involved?
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.680]   Oh, a camera.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.680]   He's very good.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   He's got a mind.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   I know he's steel trapped.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   A week earlier Musk suggested to CNBC in an interview.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.680]   He takes off two or three days every year.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.680]   Well, it's kind of like my life.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.680]   I don't know, man.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:57.680]   There is a fine line between the quote unquote grind and just stupid idiocy.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:03.180]   Yes, you should work hard and try to improve your company, improve yourself or what have
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.680]   you, but you should also sleep.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.680]   Just stay alive.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.680]   I think reasonable management.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.680]   We are always telling you to take a vacation.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.680]   Right.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:16.180]   reasonable management should include employees well being in the equation unless you're all
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.680]   interchangeable cogs.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.680]   Well, this is an easy idea.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.680]   Stop talking.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:30.180]   Anyway, I don't trust anything Elon says.
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.680]   I find that hard to believe, Elon, but okay, maybe he is.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:39.180]   I mean, we've all, well, maybe I shouldn't say we've all, but I've done a lot of time with
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:46.080]   just working ridiculously long hours, but it was, I saw, I had an end goal and I could
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.380]   see it and said, you know what, when I get to that goal, all of that is going to change.
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.180]   I don't have to work as hard because, you know, everybody on the team was working for
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.180]   that same goal.
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.980]   We knew it was just going to be a little bit of a rough patch right now, but just get there
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.620]   and then things would even out and we all agreed on it.
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.060]   It wasn't something that was just forced upon us.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:08.920]   It was, you know what, it's worth it to go ahead and push these extra hours to push this
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.780]   extra 20 hours a week in overtime or something, you know.
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.860]   Hear from, go ahead.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:19.180]   Oh, yeah, Andy, that's Elon's own companies.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.020]   Like if Elon wants to work 17 hours a day, go for it, man.
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.020]   It's your company.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.420]   Yeah, because he gets the, that's what makes him the workers.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.420]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.420]   Yeah.
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.420]   Yeah.
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:33.480]   You kind of work for me really, really hard so I can reap the benefits of your ruined
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.480]   life.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.480]   No, I can't do it.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:44.580]   YouTube's official blog post, an update on an approach to US election misinformation.
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.300]   We craft our policies.
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:51.300]   We always keep two goals in mind protecting our community and providing a home.
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.420]   Oh boy, here you go for open discussion and debate.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:27:00.180]   These goals are sometimes in tension with each other.
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:04.140]   They feel it's important to be able to openly debate political ideas.
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.520]   Is it really a fair thing to say that a political idea is Donald Trump's assertion that he did
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.720]   not lose the election four years ago?
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.040]   It's not three years ago.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.880]   That doesn't seem like, that's like flat earth or sing.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:20.640]   Well, you know, if you had an open mind, you might consider anyway, when we first go
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.560]   to ways, you could, you can say this is a place where anybody can say anything and it's
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.240]   up to you to judge and we're not going to do that.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.160]   Or this is a place where we're going to try to have a quality conversation and we're
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.160]   going to act upon that and put the investment into that.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.900]   But you can't kind of be in the middle of that.
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.620]   You can't, you know, and that's where that's where section two or thirty came in as you
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:43.200]   is you can't kind of say, I'm going to, I'm going to warrant that I have a good place
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.740]   but then I'm not going to do anything.
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:45.740]   Right.
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:50.940]   Because so YouTube is saying we have taken down tens of thousands of videos, but we
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:56.460]   decided to reevaluate the effects of this policy in today's changed landscape in the
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.460]   current environment.
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.940]   Now, listen carefully to this logic.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:06.800]   We find that while removing this content does curb some misinformation, some, it could also
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:14.600]   have the unintended effect of curtailing political speech without meaningfully reducing the risk
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.240]   of violence or other real world harm.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.480]   What did I debate?
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.020]   I debate all those points.
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:25.380]   First of all, a lie about something that happened three years ago is not, I mean, that's
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.380]   misinformation.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.040]   Is that, is that you also were making?
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   Hey, we want you to have your speech.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.040]   That's not political speech.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   Maybe it is.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:37.040]   Yeah, political speech is women deserve the right to vote, which at long ago in the past,
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.600]   and actually not that long ago was a crazy assertion.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   People were like, what?
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.080]   No, women are at all adults.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.360]   They even say, they even say, but there's no fact there.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.360]   Right.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.920]   They even say we will stop removing content that advances false claims.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.960]   So they stipulate these are false claims that widespread fraud errors or glitches are
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.560]   occurred in the 2020 and other.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.280]   I think that's wrong, but let me play Leo from it.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.280]   Okay.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.880]   Are you going to be the Leo whisper?
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.880]   Let's let's say I have something to say about that.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.720]   I have to, I have to touch your thigh and get the vibration.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.720]   Oh boy.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.720]   You did with that.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.720]   Uh, catch that in pre show on Twitter plus.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.520]   This is why you want to be around for the club folks.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:23.120]   You get all the fun moments.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:31.640]   So, um, when this stuff is taken down, the paradox we're stuck in is that it amplifies
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.640]   it itself.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.000]   See, they don't want you to know.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.520]   They don't want you to know this stuff.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.520]   Okay.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.480]   And so, duh, I'm not going to play doubles advocate here.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.720]   I'm not necessarily believing this.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:45.520]   I'm not as good at this as Leo is, but one could argue that you're better off to leave
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.400]   the crap up and let the best stuff win.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.640]   That's kind of the argument about the, the, you know, marketplace of ideas and that by
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:58.080]   thinking that we can get rid of all wrong and stupid and bad things, um, we're going
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.000]   to constantly fail against that.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.040]   And so why try that we're being argued.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.360]   I'm going to channel ant in response to that.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.360]   Go ahead.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.360]   You can't fix stupid.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.360]   That sounds like me.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:15.320]   That sounds exactly like me.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.720]   I mean, you can't win on that one.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.840]   If we, if we take it down, then people say we see that proves it.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.960]   If you leave it up, it just convinces more people that it's true.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960]   You just can't, you can't win.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.160]   The only answer to this is, is what the, what the, what the certain part of this country
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.880]   is going against constantly is education.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.960]   People who are educated tend to believe fewer stupid things.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.840]   All of our election misinformation is YouTube again.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:44.120]   Misinformation policies remain in place, including those that disallow content aiming
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:49.400]   to mislead voters about the time, place, means or eligibility requirements for voting.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.400]   That's good.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.840]   One of the voter suppression is a very big issue, right?
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:58.920]   False claims that could materially discourage voting, including those disputing the validity
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:03.400]   of voting by mail and content encourages others to interfere with the democratic processes.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.280]   So they're going to keep taking that down.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:11.080]   Does any of this discuss what their tools are for, for fact checking what is, what they
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.160]   are assuming is misinformation?
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.680]   Is this humans?
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.000]   Is this just some?
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.600]   They have these infra, they have in, they have panels, death panels.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.800]   No, that's a different kind of panel.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:32.960]   They have, it sounds like, so we have an election focused team, including members of our intelligence
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:38.680]   desk, trust and safety and product teams, monitoring real time developments and making
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.680]   adjustments to our strategy is needed.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.640]   So maybe they're saying, look, if this really does get to be out of control, maybe we'll
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.400]   change this policy.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.320]   We'll have more details to share about our approaches.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:54.400]   The election comes, I think all social networks, it's really you're going to have to pay attention
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:59.040]   to what's going on, because it is going to be a very changing landscape with AI, misinformation
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.600]   and all sorts of stuff.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:07.680]   So it's absolutely prudent to say we're going to watch this closely.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.920]   I don't think, do you?
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:16.160]   So remember that we just recently had a Supreme Court case where the plaintiffs asserted that
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:23.320]   YouTube by recommending terrorist videos was in fact liable for terrorist attacks.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:29.840]   By the way, YouTube was protected, the plaintiffs lost that case, as did Twitter one as well,
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.360]   both YouTube and Twitter one in those two cases.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.280]   So they're not liable.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:41.520]   In a way, that's the section 230, that's good, that gets them off the hook if they do recommend
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:47.440]   election denialism or if they take down election denial videos.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:53.520]   So really, basically all that happened is you can do whatever you think is right.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.200]   I don't want to be in any of their shoes when it comes to content.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.200]   We know that, right?
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   I want no horrible job.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.720]   Because you have to figure this stuff out.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.720]   You can't do it.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.840]   You can't do it.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:12.240]   I don't know how I feel about this.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.760]   When I read the headline, it was like, "Why?
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.520]   How dare they?"
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.560]   But maybe you're right, Jeff.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.000]   Maybe it's...
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   What do we expect?
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.360]   I think we've got to set the expectations.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:29.120]   I think Blue Sky is starting from scratch.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:33.400]   And Blue Sky has the opportunity to say, "We are not going to tolerate Nazis."
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.400]   They're struggling like hell with moderation.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.960]   But it is already a figure out there on my knees.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:38.960]   100,000 users.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.320]   And by the way, I just opened Blue Sky.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.520]   And what do I get?
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.520]   Oh no.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.960]   It's you, Leo.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.800]   It's not the internet.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   It's you.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   If it starts recommending election and remedies.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.520]   Wow, and this is under following though.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.760]   Yeah, no, these are people...
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.760]   Well, okay.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.760]   They're following?
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:57.760]   They're walking.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.160]   That's on you right there, brother.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.440]   I'm like, "You know what I get?
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.440]   I get a cat."
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.440]   Oh, there's a cat.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.680]   John Scalsy's Kitty Cat.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.280]   Yeah, that's popular with friends.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.280]   Mine's following.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.520]   Why am I following this guy?
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.160]   Wait a minute, let's see who this guy is.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.160]   I got the same cat.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.160]   I got Scalsy's cat.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.160]   Scalsy's popular right now.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.640]   I guess I could unfollow this guy.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.640]   He's got a nice butt.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.640]   I got a man.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:27.720]   Oh, oh, you know what's number two right after...
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.400]   Is John Scalsy's cat?
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.600]   I look one's three.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   Look one's three.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.600]   Yep.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   Yep.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.600]   You, Mr. Gutenberg parenthesis Jarvis.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   I don't have the guys behind.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.000]   Yeah, it is very much.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.320]   It feels very small town still.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.120]   It's not though, because it's 100,000 people.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.920]   It's pretty big.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.520]   I don't know about blue sky right now.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.160]   But here's the question.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.160]   If you're...
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:55.320]   And you've made this decision, Leo, when it comes to your instance on Mastodon.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:01.240]   And you're able to do it because it is small and because it is somewhat homogeneous.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.240]   Yes.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.240]   In desire and intent.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   Yes.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.160]   That may be the model where this works in the future.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.640]   And if you want to go off and do 8chan and you want to go off and do Musk's Twitter and
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:13.080]   you want to do crazy stuff on YouTube and the big places, it's there.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.240]   I'm increasingly a fan of decentralized.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.240]   Artisport is fantastic.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.640]   I mean, I love hanging out there.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.840]   I love hanging out with that social.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.320]   You know, our forums are not very active.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.280]   I wish they were a little more active.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.080]   Oh, no, no.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.840]   You're in there a lot, which is great.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.840]   Which is our community?
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.840]   Yeah, I like to a community.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:37.000]   It's kind of the place that we think people will go to comment on shows mostly.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.400]   And board the way it is.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.400]   It's different.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   You noticed that.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.400]   Every Sunday.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.200]   You know the problem, Leo, it's a technology story.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.200]   It's when...
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.200]   Watch out.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.280]   Broot, this is history moment coming up right now.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:58.160]   And when Steve Power presses Atlanta types and stereotyping came in, the average circulation
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.720]   of a daily newspaper in America before that was 4,000.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.000]   It was a sub-stack newsletter.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.840]   It was smaller than your newspaper.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.920]   It was smaller than your instance.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.280]   And then it went into the millions.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.280]   And that led to mass media and led to a whole attention economy and advertising.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.480]   And this presumption that everything had to be huge to be worthwhile.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.560]   I think that's what corrupted so much of our worldview.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.480]   And it came from media and it went into the internet.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.760]   And now we've got to try to get rid of that.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.080]   So you're saying niche down is more effective?
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.680]   Yeah, just get changed the scale.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.800]   Everything doesn't need to be mass.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.160]   Mass itself is an insult.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.160]   It just puts people in buckets.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.280]   It's a way not to hear them and not to listen to them, not recognize their...
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.960]   But you can't make any money if you're not going B.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.920]   Why if you're trying to make money the old way, but you've got to find new ways.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.920]   Well, we're not, Matt.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.920]   And there's strangers in niche.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:51.120]   Well, I was just going to say, some things have to be mass.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:56.480]   We should be talking about climate change in mass media because we need to have everybody
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.640]   participate and understand.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:04.960]   And also if weird subcommutities start niche and then they come out and start affecting
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:11.400]   things and that's where we are with some of these weird Q&A and self communities.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.480]   So I mean, as a niche publisher myself, I'm all about it.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.800]   Yeah, we're both niche, right?
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.520]   Yeah, super niche.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.520]   Super niche.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.920]   I'm of the mind that you can be niche, but still every now and then have a couple of
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:32.760]   those nuggets out there for everybody to potentially help grow your reach.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.760]   Does that make sense?
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.520]   I am, you know, actually it's interesting.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.120]   So obviously we're not going to become billionaires at TWIT.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:50.120]   Nor is Stacy and IOT going to make you, you're not going to be buying a 60,000 square foot
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.640]   mansion covering the entire Bainbridge island.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:56.000]   That would be horrifying from a climate perspective.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Yes.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.800]   Who knew that cement is actually one of the big polluters?
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:08.760]   But I think I like stuff at that scale and that's kind of what humans are built for.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.360]   We're not built for mass scale.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:16.640]   So how do we get Gutenberg, Mr. Gutenberg parenthesis?
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.720]   How do we get to this mass thing?
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.720]   I could tell you exactly.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.720]   I could tell you exactly.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:26.560]   And I covered that in the book in a whole chapter about the mass because the real idea
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.200]   I wanted to write about was the death of mass because I think that's what the Internet
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.200]   potential is.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.200]   I think you're right.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.200]   Yes.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:37.440]   And it came from that, again, there's a technology story.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:42.480]   It was because of number one, the steam powered press, number two, cheap paper made from wood,
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.000]   three paper made into rolls.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.240]   But that made it possible for the Lanotype.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.600]   But who made it happen?
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.680]   Why did it happen?
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.640]   It was that combination of events that came together.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.800]   And then some oligarchs came along and said, "If we could sell a million newspapers, now
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.000]   we got some money."
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.200]   Well, before the Lanotype, all of the text in the entire world was set one letter at
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.360]   a time by hand.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.440]   And there was only so much you could set in a day.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.960]   And before cheap paper, you couldn't afford to have more than four pages.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.240]   You couldn't afford to make a million copies.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.040]   You didn't have advertising at that scale.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.800]   You charged a penny for it.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.280]   And that's what you got.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:23.720]   In this book is the directory of American newspapers in 1900.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.800]   And when you look at the time, and this is what to your point Stacy, the reason I ran
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:32.000]   away to get this is because if you look at New York City, it's just phenomenal what
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   existed together.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.800]   Yeah, all these small neighborhood papers and then Jewish community papers.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   Exactly.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.600]   So the time is the Tribune, the folks, Cytongue, the Fortevettes, the Wall Street Daily Investigator,
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.520]   the Wall Street Journal, the Wall Street News.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.920]   That's the W's.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.680]   The news, metal market report, Jewish Herald, and on and on.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.280]   It's interesting though isn't it?
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:01.160]   Kind of what you're promoting with engagement journalism is this notion that a journal should
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.200]   serve a community, not just a mass market.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.200]   Yes, a mass community.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.200]   A mass community.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:12.400]   It's good for the the gannets of the world, but really for the people, it's better to
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.040]   have a local market and engaged market.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.200]   Why don't you have both?
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.200]   Okay.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.040]   Because there is value in the whole story.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.840]   Like a Joe Rogan, for instance.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:22.840]   Okay.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:29.160]   I was going to say there's value in pulling small stories and niche stories up from those
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:36.480]   places to the mass because normal people aren't going to care about a particular topic, but
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.480]   it could be like, "Let's look at a solution."
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:44.640]   Maybe a small community in New York has come up with a really cool solution to stop people
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:50.360]   from idling at schools, which is terrible for air pollution.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.760]   It's bad for kids.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.600]   So they've created a great program.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.960]   It's really important that a mass media picks up that niche solution that has been written
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.120]   about in a local paper to broadcast it to other places.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:06.400]   Does it have to be mass media or can it just be an idea whose time has come that spreads
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.400]   through the small media?
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   How do you think it spreads?
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.400]   It's going to help it spread.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.400]   It's the same way everything spreads.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:14.520]   That's how things, how did Black Lives Matter and me too spread?
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.920]   Mass media came late to that party and mass media did not cover those stories that have
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.080]   existed for decades and generations.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.520]   It spread because the people had the mechanism to do.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:27.720]   But it's always spread through social media, which were kind of in his era of...
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.720]   Yes.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:37.680]   So we don't have a mechanism that's good for the viral flow of compelling stories.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:42.680]   And there's always going to be a culture, there's going to be a point in the culture
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:48.080]   or a position in the culture that decide what the culture wants to care about.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.080]   Yes.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.080]   And that is mass.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.080]   And so...
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.080]   No.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.080]   Why?
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.080]   Really?
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.080]   I'll disagree there.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.080]   I disagree.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:01.920]   Again, that comes to the economics of mass, which is what Ant was saying, is how you make
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.880]   money by getting as many people as possible.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:10.840]   Before broadcast, before mechanized print, that wasn't the case.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.760]   And it was big enough to have a vaudeville show.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.600]   It was big enough to have a newspaper that covered your community.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.240]   It was big enough to have a magazine.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.240]   Okay.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:25.080]   Maybe it was before today's economic climate and the desire of PE and the stage we are
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.080]   maybe in capitalism.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.080]   Yeah, capitalism.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.080]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.080]   Yep.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.880]   I cannot believe we're just spending this time on media.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.120]   I really want to talk about Apple.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.360]   We're going to talk about Apple next.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:38.120]   And by the way, what about the US phones?
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.360]   Adrian Alenksen says, "We have to talk about the UFOs."
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.360]   She...
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.360]   She's sweet.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.360]   We'll talk about the UFOs.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.360]   I'm going to talk about golf.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.360]   I want to hear Anne about the PE.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.360]   PGA plus LIV.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.360]   That's scary.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.560]   What the hell happened there?
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.560]   Anyway, capitalism.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.560]   See, mass.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.560]   Mass.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.560]   You don't...
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.560]   Capitalism hates local.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.560]   It hates small businesses.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.560]   Businesses business.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.120]   It hates Aunt Molly's Huckleberry Jam roadside stand.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.920]   It wants smokers.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:11.800]   And that's a problem, I think, because Aunt Polly's is better than smokers.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:17.040]   And the internet enabled Aunt Polly to advertise on Google and change all that and finally
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.400]   get a marketing audience.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.040]   I knew Mrs. Fields.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.920]   And let me tell you, it was a sad day.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:24.920]   Sad, sad day.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:29.560]   When Mrs. Fields started making her cookies for the world...
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.560]   Oh gosh.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.560]   Are...
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.560]   Are you sure today?
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:40.400]   Brought to you by Melissa, the address experts.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.400]   Love these guys.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:45.840]   They've been a sponsor for quite some time because they have a product that makes sense
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.320]   for every business.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:52.360]   From forms on a webpage to checking out in your shopping cart, customer data comes into
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:55.480]   your business in a lot of different ways.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.920]   But it also comes into your business with a lot of different errors.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.440]   As soon as you've got somebody, even somebody who works for you, your customer service rep,
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.880]   keying in stuff, customer information is going to have errors.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.760]   It's going to be incomplete.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.480]   Melissa's got the solution.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.320]   Melissa's...
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.880]   Personator consumer tool.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.040]   You can get superior snapshots of your customers.

[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:26.160]   and marketing campaigns, helps with fraud detection, something many businesses now have
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.920]   to do with know your customer regulations.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:33.920]   Personator consumer not only appends data, but it'll also verify name, address and contact
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.320]   information.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:40.960]   It can verify or add data birth if necessary social security numbers for quick identity
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:41.960]   verification.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:46.280]   It also enriches data, add geographic and demographic information for you.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.600]   You can even add longitude and latitude.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:53.400]   So not only are you verifying your customer, you're also able to provide them the best
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.680]   possible experience with your business.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:00.760]   When you have highly specific demographics, you could personalize your marketing.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.280]   You could find the best leads.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:07.640]   You can offer the best service, the best deal for your customer's situations.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:11.400]   With Melissa, you gain access to appendable demographics, including...
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:17.360]   This is just a partial list, deceased information, occupation, presence of children, number of
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:23.480]   adults, marital status, homeowner, renter, household income, a range, length of residence.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:28.680]   Melissa's address verification tools leverage 38 years of address verification expertise.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.680]   And it's flexible.
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:34.760]   It'll fit any business model from on-prem to SaaS to a full API you can add to your own
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.080]   software.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:43.080]   And you'll love this.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.240]   And counting.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.640]   To ensure only valid billing and shipping addresses, enter your system.

[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:01.560]   Get started.
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.280]   With 1000 records cleaned for free.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:11.960]   At Melissa.com/twitmalissa.com/twitmalissa.com/twit we thank them so much.
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.200]   For their support...
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.320]   Oh, it's good rex has another media story.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.320]   Oh, Stacey left.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.600]   You just killed Stacey.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.920]   You know, that should be a new thing we could do on every show.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.400]   You killed Stacey!
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.120]   We need a new stinger.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:30.120]   Every show we can have...
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.120]   It would be very funny.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.000]   It'd be kind of our trademark.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   What does Scooter X say?
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Tucker did his first show last night.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.480]   There's Tucker Carlson breached his contract by putting his show up.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.080]   Yeah, we knew that would be the case, right?
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.080]   He was anti-non-competes.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.080]   That'll...
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.080]   I can hear y'all.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:47.400]   I mean, does it matter to Tucker Carlson?
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.320]   Probably not because I'm sure he wants to be here.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.880]   You know what I thought was interesting?
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:56.880]   So he posted a 10 minute video and somebody said, "Tucker's gotta get some producers
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.960]   who understand that social is not Fox News.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.840]   He's gotta have some jump cuts.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.840]   He's gotta have some...
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.960]   It's gotta be less of him just talking.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:10.080]   You know, he's gotta say smash the bell and hit the subscribe.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   He's gotta...
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.320]   He's just not...
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.480]   Don't give many hints, Leo.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.960]   Don't tell him how to do it.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:22.400]   I actually went to our staff today and said, "We've gotta get that smash the dumb, the
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.160]   red the thing going."
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.160]   Hi guys!
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.120]   I got to tell you, sir.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.040]   Let's talk about the Vision Pro helmet.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.040]   Can't do it, sir.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.040]   Sorry.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.040]   I can't either.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.040]   I know.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.040]   I know.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.040]   It's so hard to...
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.440]   I think we need a bell that goes off on the show whenever a new member joins.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.440]   I could do that.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.080]   What about the punch Leo thing?
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.080]   That would be perfect.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.080]   Perfect for home.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.080]   Perfect for you.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.880]   Just give me the signal.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.680]   Oh yeah, you got it in now.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.680]   Go ahead, try it.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.680]   Go ahead, try it.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.680]   That's a lethal weapon.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.280]   That's a registered weapon.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.280]   Sorry, I don't...
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.000]   I need a button though.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   I really want the button.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.120]   So if I have a button that vibrates something like...
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.920]   You need that a little...
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:05.920]   Just a little...
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.920]   You know, one of those cricket things.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.920]   You go...
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.920]   And it's...
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:09.920]   Just try it.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.920]   Go with your voice and go ahead.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.920]   Let's see.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:12.920]   Oh, I do have a clearing.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:13.920]   Oh!
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.920]   Let's breathe in.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.920]   That's a little latent, but...
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:25.400]   I'm glad it wasn't wearing the Vision Pro.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:29.120]   That might have been very realistic.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.520]   You said you wanted to talk about Apple, Miss Stacy.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.040]   Oh man, like, so...
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.000]   Like 40 minutes ago.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   Yes.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Well, well...
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   Well, well, well.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.640]   I'm getting the well.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.640]   Just think about it.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:44.640]   By the way, Stacy, it's...
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:50.240]   I said before we get there, I just wanted your finger to polish color is great.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.240]   Let's see.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.240]   It's orange.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   Ooh!
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.240]   It matches your shield.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.240]   Really hard.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.840]   It's the color of my style here, but you're doing a thing.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.720]   This is UT Burtn orange.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:02.080]   This is actually Clemson, or University of Tennessee.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.640]   Oh, somebody likes that.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.640]   There you go.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:08.640]   Clemson orange is not the same as the Tennessee orange, but those are all three beautiful
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.640]   oranges, Miss Stacy.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.640]   I'm like...
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:12.840]   I like David S.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:13.840]   Pumpkins orange.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:14.840]   Sorry.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:15.840]   Apple.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:16.840]   Okay, Apple.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.840]   Apple.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.840]   Headset.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.840]   On oranges.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:20.840]   Apple.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.840]   I think I'm suffering some brain.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:24.840]   Nice.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:31.560]   Okay, I think Stacy needs...
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.560]   So were you...
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.560]   So you watched the...
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.720]   We did a whole live stream of the event on Monday.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:42.080]   Apple announced a lot of stuff, but I think you always are watching with an eye towards
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.800]   IoT and apples.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.040]   They didn't mention HomeKit much.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:52.760]   So I watched it because I was like, if they launch a headset, I'm very curious because
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:58.520]   this has been marketed as the next generation of computing.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.200]   And ultimately, I just care about computing, right?
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.200]   So we watched...
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.680]   Kevin and I watched it together.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.680]   Sure.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.680]   HomeKit.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.680]   Yes, we were definitely like, oh, do we care?
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.680]   Do we care?
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.680]   Do we care?
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.680]   But we also watched it because, oh my God, was Apple going to actually do a headset and
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.440]   would it be compelling?
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.560]   And we thought, well, yes, they did.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:21.760]   And it was compelling for...
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.760]   It was compelling.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:26.480]   We'll throw out the caveats later, but I was really excited by this.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.240]   I really thought...
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:32.560]   You will buy this $3,500 headset when it comes out next year?
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:36.800]   I will not buy this when it comes out next year for $3,500.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   Will you be...
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:38.800]   I might have to.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.800]   You don't miss...
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   Ms. Lisa has already said you have to, just so you know.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.800]   Yeah, I know.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.720]   It's nice of a wife that makes you buy.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:46.720]   She's already said it.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:47.720]   I heard it when I went in years.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:48.720]   I want to buy it.
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.720]   I want to buy it.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.840]   She's hoping that you don't like it.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:52.840]   You sent it to her.
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:54.800]   That's what the Stacey's done before.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:00.400]   They solved a lot of the issues.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:04.360]   There is a role for this sort of device in our lives.
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.680]   If you take it for that role and not for...
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:09.440]   It is not an iPhone.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:14.240]   It is probably more of an additional device, like the watch and maybe even the HomePod,
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.040]   which we're not sure if it's ever going to be.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.640]   But the watch is a success that we were first like, "What the heck?"
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.160]   But it's not a replacement for your phone.
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:30.760]   What it is, it's a device that will give you deep immersive entertainment.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:35.200]   It's also a device that could really has the potential to change the way we work.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.960]   I think that's really compelling.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.560]   I also love the sensor integration.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:45.720]   I think the work that Apple's doing there on low latency sensor integration on a computing
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:48.920]   device will be useful for robotics.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:52.680]   It'll be mostly useful for robotics.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:59.280]   It'll also be useful for bringing a spatial computing that's not limited to a headset,
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:06.640]   but for computing and sensor integration throughout our devices on our bodies to a central device.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.200]   I think there's a lot of potential here.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:12.280]   But, Ms. Stacey, there's been a gazillion different headsets and things out there these
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.840]   last couple of years.
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.840]   I guess time end is everything.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:16.840]   That's the difference now.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:19.880]   No, let's talk about what Apple did right.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:20.880]   I know.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.320]   I think Apple did a couple of things that really address some of the issues.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.800]   I've tried both the Oculus.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.280]   I've tried the Magic Leap.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.480]   I've tried the HoloLens.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.800]   Those are the four headsets that I've had in my life.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.840]   I have not tried this device.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:36.960]   I hate virtual reality.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:42.520]   I hate augmented reality a lot because I don't feel safe in it because I can't see my environment
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.520]   around me.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.360]   I thought the fact that it lets me see the environment around me.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:48.800]   This is as long as I saw it.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.720]   But I thought AR did let you see.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.720]   Okay.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.720]   AR does.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.720]   The HoloLens does.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.720]   So to the Magic Leap.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:56.720]   Yes.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.720]   In the fact that you could go either direction.
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:58.720]   I was going to say the...
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:06.920]   A little digital crown that lets you tune in or out.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:07.920]   The background.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:08.920]   The real world.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:09.920]   I think that's really compelling.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.320]   That gives you a lot of power.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:15.160]   The ability to tune in and out.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.920]   And then it also gives, I think the context is pretty creepy.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.640]   The little eyes, the vision of my eyes is creepy.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:28.840]   But that is a nice way to clue people into what's happening.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:33.480]   And then the ability to actually do smaller gestures and not have additional hardware
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.480]   I think is important.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:35.480]   That is cool.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:41.400]   So I think this isn't something I don't even think Apple wants you to wear this all the
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.400]   time.
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.400]   And I think that's really important.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:47.040]   You can only do it two hours at a time according to their specs.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:51.000]   Two hours on that battery are all day plugged in or however long you want.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.400]   This is not something you're going to see people walking around with it on their face.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.880]   Oh, Scoble will be.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.280]   I guarantee it's a different.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.280]   Yes.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:04.520]   Because I mean we got battery packs out there that cost nothing to throw in your pocket.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:07.560]   There may be one or I don't think normal people will walk around.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.680]   If five years from now, I don't think we're going to see people walking around with us
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:11.680]   on their face.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:16.880]   I think this is going to be like the iPad in the sense like it's a great entertainment
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.880]   consumption device.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:19.880]   Right.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.000]   And some people like it for work because it lets them bring their work to like their couch
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.600]   or someplace a little more comfortable.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.600]   And see, I think this is a similar type of device.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:33.000]   And see you're saying pretty much the same things that I was thinking the other day because
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   it popped up on the screen.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.280]   All I can think about was Google Daydream and how Google just totally ruined that because
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.440]   it was something from an entertainment standpoint.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.920]   I thought was quite good.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:47.040]   It could have been a little bit more refined down the road and not necessarily require
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:51.760]   you to have your phone right there and heating up on your forehead.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:55.520]   I'm sure Apple has figured all of that out from a heat dissipation and all that stuff.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:00.040]   But the whole immersion with entertainment, I thought that was brilliant.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:05.000]   I used to love taking a break from work, just sitting in my workspace or whatever and then
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.800]   take a little 10 minute break, grab the daydream, turn on Netflix and watch something and just
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:13.680]   totally forget about work for 15, 20 minutes.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:20.640]   I've already spoken about this on Mac Break Weekly and Windows Weekly.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:25.880]   No, I don't want to inject myself into this, but you guys are full of crap.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.280]   All right.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.280]   Say more.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:29.280]   Look here.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.280]   Three grand is the problem.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.400]   No, that's not the problem.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:36.880]   Because one thing people say is, "Oh, well, it's three grand a day, three to 500 a day."
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:39.200]   But in a couple of years it will be less and so forth.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.200]   That's not the problem.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.040]   I get this going on in fundamental.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.560]   I think there's a fundamental flaw.
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:52.080]   To me, I've seen many technologies with fundamental flaws flop, not because they, A+ on the technologies,
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:55.520]   A+ on execution, A+ on marketing.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.960]   I'm sure there'll spend billions, literally billions over the next six months marketing
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:55:59.960]   it.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:00.960]   That's what they do.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.800]   But no, maybe I'm wrong.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:07.680]   You tell me, I have this visceral reaction to strapping a computer or strapping a screen
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.680]   on my face.
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.600]   I don't think anybody wants to do that.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.160]   I certainly don't.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.160]   I've done it.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.800]   You've done it.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:17.040]   It's cool, but I don't want to do it.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.040]   I don't like it.
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:19.040]   I don't think it's normal.
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.720]   I think it's briefly cool.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:28.200]   I think you will strap a computer on your face for an immersive entertainment, like,
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.520]   luxury immersive entertainment experience.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.520]   I really do.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.680]   I think some of the things they presented are so compelling that you will not mind strapping
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:36.680]   a computer to your face.
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:42.400]   I have a pretty good 4K TV, same resolution, by the way, is the Vision Pro with an excellent
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:47.320]   sound system and I can sit within about six feet of it, so it's pretty immersive.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:52.160]   And I'm very happy about that.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:57.160]   I can also look around and see my family.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:58.160]   Exactly.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:01.160]   I didn't want to see my family.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.160]   I wanted to be isolated and it did.
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:04.160]   I love that about it.
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:07.160]   It took me away for quite a time.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:10.160]   There are people who hate other people so much.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.760]   They like me isolating themselves, but I think it's kind of counter to what really humans
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:13.760]   want.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.400]   I think there's a visceral problem with this.
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.400]   You're still going to hang out with your friends and you're still going to have the
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:25.240]   people reaction, but for something like, "In your house," "How do people watch TV?
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:28.320]   How does your family watch television?"
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.280]   About eight feet away on the couch.
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.280]   Is that what you mean?
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:36.840]   Okay, so no, like, in my house, my husband will have an iPad and he'll watch us his own
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:37.840]   thing.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:38.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:41.840]   They're either on their phone or a tablet or separate television.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:45.040]   I sit next to my lovely wife every single night.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.040]   I hold her hand.
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.280]   I rub her feet.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:50.440]   As we together, watch a program will pause it.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:54.040]   You have better than me, brother.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:56.040]   So maybe this isn't for you.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.040]   I love me.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.040]   I don't want to sit with her.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.200]   Yeah, I'm just saying sometimes I don't want to win.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:06.080]   I think maybe there's people, maybe 10, 20, 30, even 30% of the market that will do this.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.320]   I'm not saying nobody will do it.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.800]   I'm just saying that- I think young people will love it.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.000]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.360]   I think this may be a younger generation, doesn't have the same aversion I do.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.480]   I don't think humans want to strap screens to their faces.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.480]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.480]   I agree with you.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.480]   I don't think-
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:25.320]   Here, I'm going to say something surprising, which is the only use case that I can get out
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:26.320]   of all those things.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:27.320]   You left one out.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:28.320]   Mm-hmm.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:29.320]   Is Google class.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:32.880]   As absurd as it is, augmented information to what I can see.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.880]   It was so cool.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:34.880]   It was totally sensitive to me.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:35.880]   I agree.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:38.800]   Once the spectacles you're wearing right now, Jeff Jarvis, or the ones I wear when I'm not
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:42.200]   on TV, can have augmented reality.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.200]   Fantastic.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.200]   Fantastic.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.680]   I will pay $5,000 for that.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.000]   I'm not against that idea.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.440]   There's a big leap from what we've got today to that.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.640]   Many of those technologies are not existent.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:59:00.200]   So if the vision will be further more, there's a real risk that just like the Segway, which
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:05.720]   was a great technology, but it was DOA because people said you look like a dork on that thing.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:09.600]   If enough people go, "I don't like it."
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:14.840]   It could kill the real valuable technology down the road, spectacles.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:19.960]   If Apple says, "Geez, we spent $50 billion and nobody bought it, I ain't going to develop
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:20.960]   spectacles."
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.960]   It's AR.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:22.960]   I want to go ahead and help.
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:24.600]   AR winner, I like that.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:25.600]   AR winner.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.240]   Maybe if it was...
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:31.240]   So you're saying if the Division Pro was a quarter of the size, form factor wise.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:34.880]   If it was lightweight and it was like your spectacles and you can see the world around
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.320]   it, yeah, but they can't do that.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:37.320]   They can't even...
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.560]   Not only does it want to watch a movie that way, that's not a way to watch a movie.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:41.560]   Well, it could be.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:45.520]   You know, your glasses could darken Jeff and you could be watching of 8K.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:47.160]   You know, you're getting close to that.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.320]   I don't look at the...
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:54.320]   Stacey, I want to hear your vision for work with the goggles.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:56.240]   I don't get that.
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.240]   Sure.
[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.800]   So I was excited about this because I thought the fine resolution, the fact that I could
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:07.120]   start consuming more information and manipulating it was really compelling because I deal with
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.920]   a lot of information in my day, right?
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.920]   So...
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:15.040]   Oh, I love the idea of having all those big screens, like 120-inch.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:21.120]   So when I'm sitting down to do a finance story as a great example, because I need a lot of
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.120]   information for me and instead of going back and forth, like having all of my relevant
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:32.720]   information while I'm sitting there, and I tend to write and then leave a lot of TKs
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720]   to fill in.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:39.160]   But if I had, and I do that because it's too distracting for me to go find it.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:46.240]   But if I can organize a story like that and then just sit there and be like, "Okay, it's
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.200]   $60 million a year.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.720]   Okay, and oh, this happened in 1942."
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.720]   That's really compelling to me.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.000]   That's very nice.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.320]   It is niche, but there are lots of people who are trying to assimilate information.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.320]   I understand.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.320]   So let's talk about...
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:10.920]   When I was in Rome and we were wandering around on the forum and on Nero's palace,
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.920]   I thought...
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:17.200]   I even said it out loud to our tour guide in Delisa, probably the next time I come back,
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:22.200]   I will be wearing some sort of augmented reality device that lets me go switch back and forth
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.560]   between what I'm seeing right now and what it looked like 2,000 years ago.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.560]   It just can't look...
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.560]   That would be amazing.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.720]   That would be amazing, pro is what you're saying.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.480]   Well, and it could look like a vision fro.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:34.840]   And so I'm not saying there's no use for it at all.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.840]   I mean, that would be cool.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:41.000]   And I can see going up to the kiosk as I go towards the Palatine Hill and say, "Can
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.680]   I rent that for a day?"
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.680]   Because that would be really cool.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.920]   And so I agree with you Stacy.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.760]   There's some definite educational valuable.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.600]   If you're going to train a mechanic, if you're...
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.600]   I mean, there's a lot of possible...
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.160]   I think these are all very niche.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:57.960]   And I think in the long run, aren't enough to sustain a market that Apple needs a big
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.440]   market for this to succeed.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.240]   Was it Fujitsu doing AR stuff on the assembly line?
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.840]   Yeah, we've seen this for years.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:05.840]   Yeah, no.
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:06.840]   For the decade.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:11.840]   Fujitsu Hershey's, there's tons of actual AR on assembly lines.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.880]   But first off, I use this on the show and maybe this will help.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.200]   Like when they talked about capturing moments and stuff.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.880]   Obviously, think of this like your old school DSLR camera.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:29.080]   So you had situations like maybe your trip to Rome where you would bring this in when
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.760]   it comes to capturing memories.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.440]   Maybe when you're thinking about like, "Should I bring my headset on this trip?"
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:39.380]   This is the device that you're going to bring with you consciously because you want the
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:40.380]   features it offers.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.380]   Okay.
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:44.800]   And you're going to pick it up at decisive moments.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.640]   It's not like a casual thing like your smartphone where you're like, "Oh, cool picture, snap."
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:52.400]   It's going to be like, "Oh, they're about to bring the cake into this birthday party.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.400]   Let me grab my camera."
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.760]   I want to have spooky eyes and isolate myself from everybody.
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:58.560]   I want the kids to go, "Ah, ah, ah."
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.280]   It's the same thing with the camera to your face.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.720]   And you're going to take it all out of you.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.160]   No, this is far worse than that, Mrs. Farwurst.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.520]   It's worse than that.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.520]   It's very isolating.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.520]   I understand what you're saying.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:12.880]   And I may be completely wrong here.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.840]   I mean, I stipulate that.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.080]   And I think we won't know for five years.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.680]   For five years from now, I may be wearing them on the show.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.680]   Okay.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:22.680]   Long bet.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:23.680]   Long bet.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.680]   This may also be a play of Apple saying, "All right, we're going to put this out here.
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.680]   Yes, $3,500.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.840]   We're probably not going to make a lot of money on it, but we're going to get a lot of feedback.
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:36.040]   I would figure out how we can refine this to make this into the iPhone 4.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.040]   Based on the bill materials.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.040]   Yeah, we're still working with lots.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.720]   Based on the bill materials, I would guess Apple's not making a penny on these.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.720]   That's the first thing I understand.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.720]   This probably costs them almost exactly what they're charging.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.720]   Right.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.560]   It's a lot of stuff they got.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.560]   It is.
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:49.560]   It's 11 cameras.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.560]   They're 7 screens.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.560]   It's a huge effort.
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.560]   It's 12 cameras.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:53.960]   Not to mention 12 cameras.
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:54.960]   Sorry.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:59.520]   And not to mention what must have been 10 years of sunk cost in developing it.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.160]   I mean, this is a massive effort.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:07.680]   And I'm wondering if Apple's was a good idea as we all did five years ago and it has kind
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:11.400]   of made them put it out because I don't think there's a market for it.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.400]   No, sunk cost.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.600]   Do you believe that computing is going to be everywhere?
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.000]   That we're going to have smarter devices?
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.880]   So it does that though, by disappearing, not by strapping it.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:21.880]   Hold on.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.880]   Hold on.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.240]   They designed the R1.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:29.880]   This is a chip designed to deal at a low latency level with dozens of inputs from high
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:30.880]   powered sensors.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:33.160]   So it is a fancy DSP.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.560]   It is a fancy DSP.
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.680]   But they now have this.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:43.840]   So when you look at that development and developing an operating system for that and
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:49.640]   understanding just the drama that's going to come from trying to deal with all of that
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:54.440]   signal coming in and managing it, that's valuable for them.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.080]   That's going to be valuable even if this flops.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:04.600]   In Apple builds stuff with an eye towards the future and everything.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:09.560]   I mean, the fact that they're focused on vision for all the stupid things for health kit because
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:13.960]   of this stupid device or because of this device.
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.720]   And I'm like, oh, okay, go Apple.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:22.760]   And I think if you think about like a future with an Apple watch, think about the earbuds
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.760]   talking to something, you've got your phone on your body.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:29.880]   Maybe you've got some health sensors that are like maybe you're wearing a continuous glucose
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:31.520]   monitor.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:37.360]   Imagine being able to take all of that data in processing it locally and privately and
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.880]   being able to, you know.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.960]   I'm not arguing against that at all.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:41.960]   I completely agree with you.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:42.960]   That will be great.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:45.160]   But this is not waste of development.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:49.520]   No, they are developing this to build.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.760]   This is a device that they use.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.760]   I agree.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.320]   If they can get there from here, that's great.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.320]   I'm sure that's what they're thinking.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.680]   It's like the pilot device.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.320]   But there's a lot of, you know, what about the batteries?
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.320]   Plus.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.320]   What about what?
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.320]   How do you carry them?
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.320]   What about?
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.320]   I mean, there's all sorts of what abouts.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.320]   There's technologies.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.840]   I understand you need to take the first step.
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.640]   And so maybe this is just the first step.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:16.480]   I think there's a great risk though that this first step is going to be such a horrendous
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:19.480]   experience for everybody that people don't take the second step.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.920]   People aren't going to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into this.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:24.080]   I don't think they're worried about it.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.080]   They might, but you know what?
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.680]   They got in the bank looking for it.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.600]   Like they could have been a bit.
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:34.000]   If you can find a technology to give you the AR glasses that you want, like the always
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.200]   on wear them forever glasses that might talk to your phone.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.280]   People, even if this flops, people are still going to develop that.
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.280]   So don't worry about that.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.280]   20 years from it's going to be 20 years though.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.280]   That's the problem.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.280]   It's a really a lot.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.080]   So I have a suggestion and a question suggested.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:54.080]   Jason, can you put in the rundown for a year from now that we play a little bit of this
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.840]   and see it won't be a year.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.840]   It'll be.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.840]   Well, this device isn't going to be out until next year.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.840]   Believe me.
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:03.840]   I have been so outspoken on this that there will be many people who will post on.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:08.600]   The successor to Twitter, the video of Leo saying these things are these here.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.600]   I'll give it to you right now.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.600]   It's going to take a couple of weeks.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.600]   Vision Pro.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:12.600]   This sucks.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.960]   No one's going to buy this.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.240]   This is a product that's dead on arrival.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.240]   Go ahead.
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.240]   Now you got it.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.240]   Just say that.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.440]   Well, somewhere there's there's my review.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.440]   There's my review.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.240]   There's my iPad.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.240]   You know what?
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.400]   It really makes people mad for me to say this.
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:31.080]   So I apologize for, you know, as I said, pissing in your corn flakes.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:41.480]   But I think as it's my responsibility as a tech journalist to say this is what are you
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.480]   talking about?
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:45.600]   The emperor's wearing is naked naked.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.600]   I see his twig and berries swinging in the wind.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.280]   And I'm sorry.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.200]   That's just it's my job to call him as I see him.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.200]   And you know what?
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.200]   I hope I saw.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.200]   That's how you should be.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.200]   I hope I'm wrong.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:03.120]   I hope in five years I'm wearing spectacles that are full AR with earbuds in that are
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.440]   detecting my blood glucose.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:10.440]   And you know, I mean, I pray that that that will be better technology before we get there.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.840]   This is just a launch pad, right?
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.440]   Yeah, but there's missing pieces.
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.760]   This is a launch pad to get to that potential.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.240]   So this is Project Mercury.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.840]   You know, you're launching an astronaut hoping that you're going to get to the moon in 10
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.840]   years.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:24.840]   We've done it.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:29.080]   We've done it in the country and a huge national debt.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:34.240]   Apple has the resources of a country, a pretty good sized country.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.240]   All the Apple could do this.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.400]   And we actually talked about that yesterday at Macrigue.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:40.360]   This is something only a handful of companies could do.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:43.280]   This is the argument for mass.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:49.560]   This is the argument for massive giant corporations because no individual guy in his garage could
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:50.560]   create this.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.080]   You needed a giant entity with lots of money.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:09:01.200]   From a Google standpoint, would Google be interested in partnering up with several different companies
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:04.520]   to try to compete with this?
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.440]   I think we have already seen.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:11.240]   Especially being in the information and data business.
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:18.680]   Let me post a little image here of what I believe Android users are going to look like.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.520]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.080]   Oh, did he take it down?
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:26.720]   Somebody sent me this image.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:27.720]   Oh, shoot.
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.640]   I should have kept it up.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.640]   Never mind.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.640]   Forget it.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.920]   Oh, there was a great joke in here, but it's if latency.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.320]   Let me click it again and see if it comes up now.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:43.720]   This is what Android users are going to look like.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.720]   [laughter]
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.520]   InVision Pro.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.920]   Thank you, Adam Singer.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.880]   It's a picture of Jim Carrey as the mask.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.880]   I get it.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.880]   The green.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:53.880]   That is true.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:10:01.360]   Honestly, as an Android user, this is an absolute ecosystem lock-in.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.400]   To use Vision Pro, you scan your face with an iPhone.
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:10.760]   This is never, ever going to be available to Android users.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.360]   You will not be able to call an Android user, message it.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.760]   We're going to lie.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:15.760]   That's their prerogative.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:16.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:17.760]   I've been on Apple.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.480]   That's part of the benefit for Apple is this is massive ecosystem lock-in.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:24.080]   For 10 people, yeah.
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.320]   We're already Apple fanatics anyway.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.120]   Well, that's why they could charge 3,500.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.680]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:30.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.920]   ScooterX, you do not scan your face with the Vision Pro.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:33.920]   You should read the articles.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.280]   No, that's first thing they do is they scan your phone.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:39.120]   Later to create your avatar, you scan it with the Vision Pro.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:43.280]   But in order to do the iris scan and stuff, you have to have a late model iPhone with
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.920]   the LiDAR on the front of it.
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:46.800]   Now, that may change when it comes out.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.360]   Who knows what the requirements are.
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.360]   But think about it.
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.680]   People are going to allow you to know.
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.680]   Oh, no.
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.680]   I mean, look at what they did also just to screw over Android users.
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:02.240]   I was like, oh, my little new contact poster will just be like, Stacey is lame when I call
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.240]   someone with an iPhone.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.040]   I'll be like, damn it, man.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:09.680]   The world will be a better place if you just would let go and let Apple.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.680]   Sure.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.880]   Oh, final thing.
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:19.640]   I will say the other benefit to this is the user interaction information that they're
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:20.640]   going to get.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.960]   So the work they've done on gaze detection here is very compelling.
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.320]   I actually thought Google solely would be amazing for the gesture sensing.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.880]   They're using camera data.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.880]   That's fine.
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:35.960]   But that's going to be really important for what I would call true spatial computing,
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:39.120]   which is when the computing is actually all around you and you're trying to interact with
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.120]   that.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:46.440]   But sure, they can call this face computing spatial computing too.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:51.400]   So I just want like in a real world of spatial computing, the user interaction data and work
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:55.880]   that they've done here is also going to come in super handy.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:56.880]   That's all.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:03.880]   And I do want to say I enjoy watching some stuff with my family together.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:04.880]   We do have those.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:05.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.880]   But you still have that.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:13.160]   And like post post twigs, sometimes I just need to decompress and that usually means
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:18.600]   let me go to the den by myself or let me go to the back porch with a cigar by myself.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.400]   So yeah, that's all I've seen.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.400]   Sorry.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.400]   Let him be.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.400]   Let Paul be.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.080]   He's had a rough day.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.080]   Just let him be.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.080]   And you can do that now.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.080]   That way going into your man cave.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.080]   I mean, you've got it.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.720]   So, you know, there we got it.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:38.680]   Many of us, many people do not have me in caves where we're cramming people into smaller
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.680]   and smaller places.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.680]   No, I agree.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.120]   This is not for the mass audience.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.080]   No, this is for people who can afford to have a woman cave.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.080]   Yes.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.240]   I have a man cave animal.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.760]   It's called a she shed.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.600]   She is called a she shed.
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.600]   That's right.
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.880]   She said that's good.
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.760]   I was supposed to build one a couple of years.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.720]   Were you that never happened?
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.760]   So Queen Pruitt said, where's my she shed?
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:02.760]   She wanted a she shed.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.840]   It's funny you bring that up, Miss Stacy.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.280]   I totally forgot about that.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:07.280]   Thanks a lot, Stacy.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.280]   You got a bit of trouble.
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.680]   You're going to watch the show and say, where's my she shed?
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.640]   So, see the fuck is fast.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:17.720]   Do you want to talk about UFOs?
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:21.480]   I'm probably talking about it Friday on Disc Week in Space, but sure.
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.880]   Yeah, I'm curious what Rod and Torett are.
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:26.120]   We'll think of it.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:36.400]   The whole thing is this unnamed Air Force guys said, I saw parts of dead ETS and parts
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:42.240]   of UFO technology at the when I was at the Air Force, they're hiding something from you.
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.240]   This comes up.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.680]   I got a little boy.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:46.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:47.680]   I don't know.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:48.680]   UFO whistleblower.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.680]   Let's see.
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.680]   Should I get it from the?
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.680]   We're talking about it.
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:53.680]   You should just do it.
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.080]   Should I get a post or the Fox News?
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.080]   Or news nation.
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:03.400]   I got a choice of fine US collects intact UFOs as part of secret program.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.200]   Oh, he's not a name.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.960]   There he is, the Air Force whistleblower.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:10.440]   Showing his name.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:15.160]   He's an Air Force veteran and former intelligence official claims US government has been collecting
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:18.960]   intact extraterrestrial aircraft for decades.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.960]   David Charl.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.000]   Former intelligence is the operative.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.520]   He's only 36.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.320]   Why isn't he still intelligent?
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.320]   He told news nation.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:32.840]   He recently turned over quote proof end quote of the alleged covert program to Congress and
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:36.320]   the inspector general of the intelligence community.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:42.360]   These are retrieving nonhuman origin technical vehicles called spacecraft, if you will, nonhuman
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:45.840]   exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:46.840]   I don't know.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:47.840]   I'm skeptical.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:48.840]   Could be.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:49.840]   I'm skeptical.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.800]   All I noticed, they come to my house.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.280]   They're going to be like, yeah, no, we'll see.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:00.440]   Yeah, later, we want no part of this stuff with these two dogs and these hard-headed kids.
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:04.640]   No, we want no part of the he says he's seen evidence of a secret crash retrieval program
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:11.800]   and alleges we've even retrieved bodies from other species, all according to news nation
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.280]   and his interview with news nation.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:19.880]   I call on the United States Congress to stop hiding the truth.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:20.880]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.880]   They're busy.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.880]   I hope he's I hope he's wrong.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:29.240]   I don't, but if he's not wrong, I'm glad I don't know anything about it.
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.240]   There's no he tees.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:34.640]   Can I tell you how far away the nearest habitable planet is?
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:38.640]   Can I just say ask ask your buddies at this week?
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:44.960]   It's so far away, a gazillion gazillion years proven that as a civilization evolves and
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:49.480]   becomes close to space faring, it destroys itself with pollution.
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:52.000]   And that's that.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.320]   And I also think we're probably one of the few, if any, intelligent.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:00.080]   I mean, it's hard to believe maybe it's just a, you know, weird coenkey thing that we even
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.080]   exist.
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:02.680]   But you don't know.
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:09.800]   Put that in the same bucket as the tape of me saying the vision pro is DOA.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:10.800]   I'll say it now.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.800]   You can record this.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.800]   Put it on Twitter.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.080]   There are no ETS.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.080]   That's nuts.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:20.640]   There's no do your E.T. voice of the alien coming to look for the old report.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.640]   I'm here.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.640]   Ouch.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:27.800]   No, there's no aliens.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.800]   There's no ETS.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:29.800]   You know what?
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.480]   We're not going to Mars either.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.800]   We better fix this planet or we're done so in a hundred years.
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:35.800]   Look here.
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:36.800]   Thank you very much.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.840]   If everybody wants to go to Mars, I'm fine with that too.
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:42.040]   But don't, but you're going to stay here in your man cave.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.280]   Yeah, let me stay here.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.280]   Okay.
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.280]   I'm fine.
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.280]   If you want to try to get there, isn't it?
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.280]   You're trying to get there.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.280]   I'm trying to get there.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.280]   Have at it.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.120]   I'm fine.
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.120]   Just go.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.120]   That's good.
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.120]   Bye bye.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.760]   Just go.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:00.160]   All the phone sanitizers, all the admin, all the PR reps.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.320]   You just go, you go on.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.320]   You go on.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:07.560]   Yes, I know my auto warranty will expire without you.
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:11.400]   But you just go on and have yourself a good time.
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:12.400]   Let's take a little break.
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.400]   We're going to come back a second.
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.480]   Got some more stories to talk about.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.680]   But first, I want to show you.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:16.680]   I'm so excited.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.800]   My Brooklyn is here.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:19.800]   My Brooklyn is here.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.480]   Who haven't been waiting for this?
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.480]   Brooklyn.
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:26.960]   I love the name like Brooklyn, but with linen, right?
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:28.720]   Brooklyn is a home essentials company.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.720]   Their mission.
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.000]   Yes, I need a special device.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.680]   This has my face on it.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.920]   So I know it's safe to use.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.640]   Did you know I had this?
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.200]   A box opener with my own face on it.

[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.400]   What did you order?
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.400]   Did you order some?
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.000]   You didn't get your Brooklyn in yet?
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   No, or Danny.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.320]   Oh, not yet anyway.
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.920]   We offered it to you, didn't we?
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:21.920]   I thought we did.
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.000]   Brooklyn has been making a dream space's reality for almost a decade.

[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:45.160]   Striped jammies.
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.720]   They're so cute.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:49.400]   She says you look like you escaped from San Quentin.

[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.200]   One reviewer said, oh, and this is important, right?
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:28.800]   I seem to get that wonderful sleeping temperature very quickly and stay there throughout the
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.800]   night versus my older cotton sheet sets.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.960]   Best sheets in the world like butter said another one like butter.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:38.880]   Now these, as I said, these are the Luke's.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:41.520]   I don't, you know, I think thread count is kind of BS.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:44.720]   I'm not a big thread count guy, but I was getting ready to say you didn't mention thread
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.920]   count, but it doesn't matter.
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:46.920]   I can feel it.
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.080]   You could tell it's high thread count.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.080]   I'm looking.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:53.200]   Sometimes you can get, I have gotten in the past very expensive sheets from other companies
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:56.720]   with a very 600 thread count and they're not great.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:59.760]   I don't know what this thread count is, but it feels like it's as high as you can go,
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.760]   right?
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:01.760]   You can't.
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:02.760]   It's very soft and beautiful.
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:03.760]   This isn't very nice.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.760]   And these are the Luke's sheets.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:09.720]   But as I said, Micah says, I sleep hot onto something a little lighter.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:10.720]   All right.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:13.920]   So you got the lightweight sheets, check out the sheets, the pillows, the towels.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:20.400]   I swear by those, I love my towels, bath rugs, totes, tops, robes and more.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:21.400]   What are you waiting for?
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.760]   Shop in store or online?

[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.360]   Thanks to Paskys.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.360]   Jeff was so jealous.
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:52.360]   Oh, we can't know.
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.360]   Jeff was, well I don't know.
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.360]   Yep.
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.360]   Yep.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:56.360]   Jeff was so jealous.
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.360]   Yes, today and couldn't.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:02.700]   Patrick Delahandy, our esteemed guy, and I don't know what he does so I just got a
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:04.500]   more esteemed guy.
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:05.500]   Yeah.
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.900]   He's our workspace admin.
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:09.380]   I said can you flip the switch?
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:10.380]   Not everybody's.
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:11.380]   I think we don't have it yet.
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:12.380]   Not everybody's got it.
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:13.380]   Okay.
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.380]   Paul Therat didn't have it yet.
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:15.380]   Because I tried yesterday.
[01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:16.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:17.380]   Be patient.
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:19.380]   Your workspace administrator has to enable it first.
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:20.380]   Okay.
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:21.980]   And then yeah, we use Google workspaces here.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:24.940]   So then you'll be able to use Paskys.
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:26.540]   As we already do have you tried Paskys.
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.540]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:28.540]   I know it's great.
[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:30.080]   It's really great.
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.600]   Remind everybody.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:34.940]   What, what, how they use a Pasky?
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:36.500]   I don't know.
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.500]   Okay.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.500]   No, no.
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:45.500]   So the whole idea is that your device, especially nowadays modern smartphones with their biometrics,
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:49.720]   whether it's fingerprint or face recognition, sometimes iris recognition, these things are
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:51.040]   super secure devices.
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:55.440]   The whole idea of Paskys is this becomes your authentication device.
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:56.800]   Your smartphone does.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:01.520]   So when I go to Google.com and I haven't logged in yet, it'll, it'll, it'll either.
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.280]   There's a couple of ways you can do this.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.680]   It'll either by Bluetooth communicate with my phone if I'm on a PC, if I'm on my phone,
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:12.560]   it doesn't have to, but if I'm on a PC communicate with my phone, say, is this Leo authenticate?
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:13.800]   And it is.
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.560]   I may have to authenticate on the phone, but I may not.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.520]   If, because if I'm already logged in and authenticated, it'll say, no, he's, yeah, he's,
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:21.520]   he's Leo.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:26.440]   And then I don't need a password or anything, which is, which is what is going on.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.760]   DMS behind you.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.960]   The aliens have arrived.
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:30.200]   What does it take you away, Leo?
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.200]   Oh man.
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:32.200]   E.T.
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.200]   Get out from back there.
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:34.200]   I told you there's no alien.
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:38.840]   Is the DMX just collapsed?
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:39.840]   It just.
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:41.840]   Burks working on it.
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:42.480]   Oh, Mr.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.040]   Wonder up in the rafters.
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.040]   What is he?
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.040]   He is.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.040]   Don't go up there in the.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.800]   Burk it down from there.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.400]   What are you a monkey?
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:54.400]   All right.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.400]   He's, please.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.400]   All right.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:58.400]   Said what else?
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:24:59.400]   What other?
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.360]   Oh, good news for you, Jeff.
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.840]   You can finally play Minecraft in your Chromebook.
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:08.040]   Oh boy, I can't wait to do that.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.800]   I have been waiting all my life.
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:11.800]   You know what?
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:14.680]   Don't you be knocking Minecraft.
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:19.120]   It is now available for many late model Chromebooks.
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.080]   It has to be in the last three years.
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:24.160]   It is the bedrock edition, not the Java edition.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:27.280]   You actually can download it from the Play Store.
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:28.280]   I'm here $20.
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.640]   That's a lifetime pass.
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:31.640]   Not bad.
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:32.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:36.200]   You'll also get Android Minecraft at no extra cost.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.160]   That's a $7 value.
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:43.200]   And if you already bought the game on Android, you can just get the Chromebook version for
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.000]   $13.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.320]   So I like Minecraft.
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.600]   Not my thing, but that's still pretty cool.
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:54.840]   You know, we have a Java Minecraft Java server running in our club.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:56.200]   In fact, sorry.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:57.200]   I haven't.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:58.200]   I know people been asking me.
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:59.200]   Have you rebooted it?
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.200]   I don't know.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.200]   I probably.
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:05.200]   I've seen those messages from time to time.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:10.120]   No, I have to, you know, hey, hey, you're not the only one putting effort into the club
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:11.360]   every once in a while.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.360]   Let me just.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.360]   There we go.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:14.360]   SSH.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:15.360]   Leo.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:19.240]   Let me just log into the server, see if everything's up.
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:21.160]   Teamux, attach.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.160]   I could tell you.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.160]   BN.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.160]   Yep.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:26.160]   The server's running.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.080]   That's the, that's Michael's server.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.960]   There's the Twitch server.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.520]   And here's the survival server.
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:33.520]   That's a tough one.
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:37.360]   If you go on the survival server, you better be a good Minecraft player.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.800]   Double O 11.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.800]   Wow.
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.800]   Just left the game.
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.800]   Yeah, they're all up and running.
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:44.800]   Okay.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:45.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:46.800]   Cool.
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:48.800]   You're welcome members.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:49.800]   I just checked.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:50.800]   What else?
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.800]   I guess I was hoping to.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:55.440]   Do you want to talk about air quality?
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.040]   What is, what is the air quality right now, Jeff, in beautiful Bedminster New Jersey?
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.040]   It was 437.
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.040]   It's down to 388.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.640]   So I'm just going to take a deep breath.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:07.640]   Anything over a hundred is risky, right?
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.120]   Just, Stacy, what is the, what is the?
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.080]   Oh, I thought it was like 250.
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.080]   It depends.
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:14.080]   It's different classes.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:18.080]   So like babies and immunocosuppressed people have, or at one level.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.800]   Man, you're trying to, I would say in that.
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:20.800]   Thank you.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:21.800]   What?
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:22.800]   Oh yeah.
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:26.520]   Actually, Jeff probably you should be really careful.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.520]   Come to think of it.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:36.880]   According to the EPA, here's your AQI fact sheet for 101 to 150 is unhealthy for sensitive
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.440]   groups, which you might be in.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:39.440]   Very sensitive.
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.440]   Purple.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:45.360]   So 301 is anything higher than 300 is hazardous to everybody.
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.120]   Like, just everyone's going to be affected.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.400]   You should not go outside.
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:52.160]   Yeah, anything over 150 is unhealthy period.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.880]   200 is very unhealthy.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:57.680]   300 is hazardous.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.000]   And your pets should be inside too.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000]   Do not let your pets.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   I know that.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000]   Do they smell it?
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000]   Do they know that?
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000]   Oh crap.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   The more fire.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000]   Yes.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000]   Birds were dropping out of the sky.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.280]   That's why, that's why if canaries in the coal mines, they don't like bad air.
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:13.760]   Wow.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:15.320]   I learned that from a minor fire.
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.320]   That's fine.
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.320]   That's fine.
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:22.880]   So Stacey is an expert on all this, believe it or not.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:26.280]   Because I live in Washington state, you're probably an expert too.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:29.920]   We had to a couple of years ago when the wildfires hit Northern California, we were
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:36.200]   six miles away from one of the biggest fires in the Sonoma County.
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:38.200]   And in fact, we had our GoBags packed.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:42.920]   It was so scary and we had a backup plan for the studio in case it burned to the ground.
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:46.880]   And at that time, I got purple air sensors in the house because I want to know what the
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:49.920]   air quality inside was as well as outside the house.
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:56.320]   And the benefit of purple air is these are expensive like an outside air quality monitor
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.920]   is like 200 bucks.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:03.080]   But if you put it outside, you're actually contributing to the purple air network, which
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:06.000]   takes data from all of those sensors.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.800]   And that's how I can find out what that's three miles from me, right?
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:15.560]   So there's actually one down the street for me and air quality dramatically differs based
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.640]   on distance, based on all kinds of things.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:22.360]   Like if you're a lower elevation, you're going to have poor air quality typically.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:27.640]   You know, so like I live on an island and the air quality across the island can differ
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:31.720]   on the air quality index by like 50 or even 60 points sometimes.
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:32.720]   Wow.
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.640]   So outside.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:35.640]   That's great, right?
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:40.760]   The purple air quality sensor that data feeds into things like Google, Google on your displays
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:45.080]   has a air, a QI air quality index measurement.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:49.200]   It has both the color and the number and your color you're looking for is green or maybe
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:52.200]   yellow.
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:57.880]   Jeff, you should stick with green being sickly and all.
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:58.880]   Yeah.
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:29:59.880]   Okay.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.440]   And elderly yellow is it's acceptable.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.960]   And if you're really sensitive, usually that's asthmatics, okay?
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.760]   Or kids because they have developing months.
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:08.760]   You know what?
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:09.760]   It's so awful.
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:10.760]   You don't want to go out.
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:14.800]   Now I have to point out that the purple only measures particulate pollution, right?
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:15.800]   Right.
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.960]   So let's talk about your inside.
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:20.600]   So that's measuring things outside and being a citizen scientist.
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:22.000]   Yay for you if you've decided to do it.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.400]   But let's say you're just a normal person and life is just sucky and you're looking for
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:27.400]   a good air quality.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:31.280]   Well, and I wanted to know what it was like inside because we fled the outside because
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.200]   it was unsafe, but I wanted to make sure it wasn't getting in, right?
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.440]   Yeah.
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:40.920]   So some things you need to know about you need to close like I was talking to somebody
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.360]   had their windows open today.
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:45.640]   Oh, close the windows area and I was like closure windows.
[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.240]   Normal pressure is your friend.
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.440]   But if it's smokey outside, it's not.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.440]   Yeah.
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:53.800]   Yeah, your air conditioner is going to pull in outside air.
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:55.600]   That's what your air filters for.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:00.240]   If you're having like wildfires, like we would change our like when I was bad, we would
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:04.160]   change our air filters like every week and they were they needed it.
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:06.160]   So you need to keep an eye on that.
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.560]   Not every three months.
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.400]   That is not like when it's this bad, you need to change them.
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.400]   Is it visible?
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:12.400]   Is that you can look at it?
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.400]   It's yellow.
[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:14.400]   You could see.
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.400]   I mean, it's it's mucky.
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:17.200]   We got I think maybe we got suckered.
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:27.840]   But we had the guy come out and he gave we bought a thing that goes on the furnace on
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:32.200]   the heat pump on the first slash air conditioner that does some sort of static charge.
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:35.120]   And then we bought filters that are electrified.
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:41.040]   The idea being the eye and eyes and as a result, attract particles and do a better job than
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:42.040]   regular filters.
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.040]   I don't know.
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:48.200]   But you know, I was just I like whatever we can do to be.
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:49.680]   Ionization does.
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:51.360]   Yeah, it does help.
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:57.440]   And so once you're inside, so there are air quality monitors for indoors.
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:02.360]   Air makes one air things makes them Amazon even has one.
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:08.200]   Usually so for fire damage, you need to check for one that measures particular particulate
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.200]   matter.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:10.200]   PM 2.5.
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.200]   Yes.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:17.280]   And that's that's your big so because the big things they're going to monitor is temperature
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.280]   and humidity.
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:20.040]   Almost every single one will do that.
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:24.840]   Some of them will monitor carbon dioxide and ideas of carbon dioxide gets high.
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:29.320]   You want to open a window because it's going to make you sleepy, but not in the case of
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:30.320]   fires.
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.320]   It's complicated.
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:33.760]   Particular matter and then the OCs.
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:36.880]   Volatile organic compounds.
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:37.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:40.560]   And that's another open the window situation.
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:44.720]   But a lot of them don't measure VOCs or they won't measure a particular matter.
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:49.800]   So you really in this case, look for a particular matter because that's what you're looking
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:50.800]   for.
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:56.000]   And the 2.5 and PM 2.5 is the microns, the size of the particles.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000]   Yes.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000]   Okay.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000]   They're very bad.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000]   You can get PM 1.0.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.200]   Those are going to be much more expensive, I think, because the smaller particles.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.200]   Yes.
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:06.080]   And your filters may not tackle that.
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.480]   So these are just like warning systems, right?
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:09.840]   Now we're going to talk about filtration.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:12.360]   So you got your filtration of your indoor air.
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:16.400]   I can tell you there's tons of great smart options that'll be like, Oh crap, your air
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.400]   is terrible.
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:18.400]   Boom.
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:20.120]   Take it out.
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:22.800]   And what Leo's about to show you is the CoA.
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.440]   This is like my favorite air filter.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.440]   You know what?
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.440]   Really?
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.440]   It's expensive.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:31.120]   It's funny when we had the fires out here, a lot of people made TikToks on how you can
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:36.280]   make your own HEPA filter by those furnace filters and build a box around a fan and
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.280]   strap it in.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.280]   But that's cool.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:40.120]   You actually just need to tape it.
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.120]   Yeah.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.960]   This is basically inside here.
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:47.440]   There's a there's a physical filter which is capturing dog hairs and things like that.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:52.080]   But inside the physical filter, there's a HEPA filter, which is kind of a paper, a
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.440]   corrugated paper filter.
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:56.600]   And that's what's catching the poly, the, we got to clean this.
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:59.520]   So in your next thing.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:04.000]   So there are two things you need to know when you have these air filters, the CoA.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.240]   Most of them will have the air megas.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.240]   I have an air mega that is also really good.
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:12.720]   The air mega inside our house at home because that's, that's a vast area.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:13.720]   It's a bigger room.
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:14.720]   This has a little pet.
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:15.720]   You've got to wash that.
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:16.720]   Yes.
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:18.640]   I wash this and this is this you replace.
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:20.560]   This is for smells.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:21.560]   This is an active.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.320]   Yeah, there's you've got two filters there.
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.320]   Yeah.
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:25.320]   And then all of them.
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:26.320]   This is the HEPA filter.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.320]   If I take this out, you see it.
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.800]   So you wash that screen one looks just like a furnace filter.
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:32.800]   Really?
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:34.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:36.800]   You replace that guy.
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:40.640]   And the co-ways have a reminder when to replace and all of that stuff.
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:45.040]   I think it's the same stuff people were putting in because of COVID when we thought.
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:46.040]   Yes.
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:48.640]   That's the fact that's the virus.
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:49.640]   Yeah.
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:51.800]   Virus particles are also there.
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:58.440]   There's smaller than the PM5, but the PM5s are what people were two point five, sorry,
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.440]   two point five.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:04.400]   So once you have these, so I have used in like, oh, the other important thing you need
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:07.640]   to know about this is these are sized for rooms.
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:10.840]   So if you have one running in your room, you need to close the door.
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:16.760]   So the co-way that Leo has is about what would you say a 10 or a 10 by 15 room, 10 by 10
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:17.760]   room?
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:19.760]   It's probably too small for this.
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:20.760]   This room.
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:21.760]   I have one in my other studio.
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:22.880]   It's exactly the right size.
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:27.040]   And the mega, which is a big cube, that'll do 600 square feet.
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:29.000]   That's a pretty big device.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.200]   I think this is a hotter thing.
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:33.100]   So, yeah.
[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:37.880]   So you want to close off those areas if you can and you want to sleep with that running.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:42.520]   And a lot of them will have a, if you're buying one, you want to look for some of them have
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:46.280]   a smart mode where it'll be like, oh, I detect problems and then it'll go.
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:48.280]   Yeah, we have these.
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:52.440]   And it's that doesn't mean internet connected.
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:53.440]   That's just a nice feature.
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:56.680]   And the other feature you want to look for is the ability to turn the LEDs off at night.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:57.680]   Yes.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:59.480]   So they'll have a sleep or night mode.
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.280]   Yes, I agree.
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.280]   So this is good.
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:05.520]   We have co-ways all over the place.
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:07.560]   And we're very happy with those.
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:11.440]   There is a secondary issue of ozone, which these things don't take care of.
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:15.840]   Some of these fires are so nasty, they're actually putting not only particulate matter
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:17.240]   in the air, but ozone in the air.
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.560]   I don't know what you do for that.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:19.560]   I really don't.
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.800]   So you don't want to say?
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:23.200]   Well, don't you have something?
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:25.760]   The molecules help with ozone.
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:30.280]   They're really more for things VOCs like formaldehyde.
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:31.640]   They're more for that kind of stuff.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:36.000]   So I don't know how you get rid of ozone, to be honest with you.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.520]   One of the problems with a lot of filters, and you should always look and see, is they
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:42.120]   put more ozone into the air than they take out.
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:45.080]   Sometimes it's a side effect of the filters.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.000]   So you want to be careful about that.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.160]   And Wirecutter did a very good job at least talking about these particular HEPA filters,
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.440]   and they recommended the co-ways.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:55.440]   So that's why we got co-ways.
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:56.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:01.640]   Or get yourself some nice and face filter headphones.
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:05.480]   And if you wear them with a Vision Pro, you don't have to worry about people because
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:07.480]   you're run when they see you.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:09.800]   Does that work?
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:12.840]   I want to say I saw a story.
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:13.840]   Someone tried to.
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:15.640]   It was on a flight recently.
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:21.360]   Oh, I know someone wandered around trying it, but I don't know where that is.
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:25.520]   You know, it's funny because of COVID, I think we actually are better equipped for these
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:29.000]   kinds of, you know, bad air condition situations.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.520]   So in Club Twit had actually a really good tip, one that I have not followed and because
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:37.600]   of my life, but his pro tip is if you're going to get multiple air purifiers, get the
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.520]   same brand so you can stop a stock up on the same filters.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:45.400]   And your air purifier, y'all, is only as good as your filters.
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:49.000]   So you when it, and they'll all give you a notification say, Hey, watch that screen.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.400]   And that happens like every probably couple of weeks in my house.
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.680]   And then they'll be like, okay, it's time to change the filter.
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:57.840]   And that's, that's what's filtering your air.
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:00.120]   So you actually do need to have those.
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:04.520]   And if you go outside and 95, not a surgical mask.
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:10.040]   But again, if there's a problem, and unfortunately the purple air doesn't tell you, but if there's
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:12.480]   ozone in the air, the N95 does nothing.
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.880]   It doesn't help you at all.
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:18.760]   It goes right through it because it's really a, just it's not even a particulate problem.
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:19.760]   It's just bad air.
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:21.760]   I know it's problematic.
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:22.760]   I don't know.
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:31.240]   Here's a, a, a, Insta from a Yankee stadium from MLB on Fox.
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:33.160]   It is nasty and it looks pretty.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:37.800]   I hope the weather changes for y'all because it's, it's awful.
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:41.640]   And you'll, you'll wake up in the morning and you'll see that really orange sun and you're
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:44.280]   just going to be like, Oh, it feels apocalyptic.
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:45.280]   Doesn't it?
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:46.280]   It's like it does.
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:47.280]   It's the end of the race.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.280]   We know.
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:53.560]   The guy said, my wife is from Latin America and the pictures of that sky is how they always
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:58.360]   depict Latin America in TV and movies as if they're true.
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.360]   Right?
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:03.000]   U.S. has sued Coinbase and Binance.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:10.680]   The SEC says these crypto exchanges are basically fraudulent.
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:12.720]   They are subject to SEC rules.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.600]   They haven't registered.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.120]   Coinbase said, wait, what?
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:17.680]   Hold on.
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:24.000]   We wanted you to tell us this a long time ago, but you refused.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:31.880]   I saw Jim Kramer, not that I trust Jim Kramer say, this is the time to get out of, to get
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:32.880]   out of cryptocurrency.
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:36.240]   Yeah, you know, that's probably right.
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:40.760]   And then I don't know if you saw this financial times piece.
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:42.560]   It's unfortunately behind a paywall.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:50.560]   The SEC is wrong about crypto exchanges.
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:58.720]   He says, let's see, he says, I on the other hand can only die on the hill where I planted
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.600]   my flag back in November.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:03.000]   Cryptocurrencies are not securities.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.960]   And so the SEC should leave them alone.
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:10.480]   This by the way, not based on a view that crypto has a special value that needs to preserve
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:12.240]   on the contrary.
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:14.240]   Cryptocurrencies are dangerous nonsense.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:18.560]   One in the market can be trusted to kill before long.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:22.480]   If this does not happen, cryptocurrencies should be regulated like smoking, gambling,
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:23.480]   or pyramid schemes.
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:25.360]   Is that Leo LaPort or someone else?
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.160]   Sounds like me, doesn't it?
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:31.280]   In either case, this stuff should not be granted the dignity of regulation under securities
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:32.280]   law.
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:33.280]   I kind of agree with them.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:35.160]   They're not securities.
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.160]   They're mad.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.080]   People are losing their shirts on it.
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:39.080]   I know.
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.080]   You can't just let people be.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:42.080]   I don't know.
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:45.240]   I think the SEC is right to go after these guys.
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:51.360]   And I hope people take it if they haven't already realized the danger of this stuff.
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:56.960]   And of course, just like all kinds of conspiracy theories in election denialism, the more people
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:01.440]   get cracked down on the more they say, see, see governments, they want to preserve their
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:02.440]   fiat currency.
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.160]   They don't want, they don't want this much better system.
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:06.920]   I've seen a little bit of that.
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:09.160]   I've seen a little bit of that.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:20.200]   So the SEC has sued Binance, the world's largest crypto trading platform, and now Coinbase,
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:25.080]   accusing the firm of mishandling customer funds, inflating trading volume on the site
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:31.200]   and taking steps to evade US regulation.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:35.600]   In addition, yesterday, financial regulators from 10 states, including California also
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:41.320]   filed legal actions alleging Coinbase was operating as an unregistered securities dealer.
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:46.240]   And I understand the FT's point that it's, you shouldn't even think of it as a security.
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:47.240]   It's just gambling.
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:49.240]   That's all it is.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:50.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:51.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:52.240]   So you shouldn't regulate it?
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:54.080]   There's going to be more reason to regulate it.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:59.400]   Well, but the problem is I think he's worried that what will happen is there'll be a settlement
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:04.240]   between Coinbase and Binance and the SEC that says, yeah, we're security.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:05.240]   I say.
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:06.960]   And we're regulated as securities.
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:09.120]   We'll pay a big fine.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:11.800]   And now we'll continue to operate now as regulated securities.
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:13.640]   And he's saying, no, they're not.
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:14.640]   God.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:17.520]   Which I agree, they really shouldn't be thought of as securities.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:18.520]   I don't know.
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:24.880]   I mean, is it more risky to invest your $1,000 in Bitcoin than it is?
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:26.600]   Put your $1,000 in McDonald's stock.
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:27.600]   And Lotto tickets?
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:28.600]   No, it's still.
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.800]   Well, it's more like Lotto tickets in McDonald's stock.
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:31.800]   Yes.
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.880]   But yeah, I was like McDonald's stock is infinitely safer.
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:34.880]   Is it though?
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:35.880]   I mean, yes.
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:36.880]   Yes.
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:37.880]   Yes.
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:38.880]   Really?
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:42.800]   This is not a straw man you want to toss up because McDonald's they're regulated by
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:43.800]   the SEC.
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:44.800]   They have to follow gap accounting.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:46.040]   They're not going to lie to you.
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:48.040]   They can't lie to you.
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:49.040]   Not too much.
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:50.040]   They can't obfuscate.
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:51.040]   But the ice cream machine breaks down.
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:52.040]   Yeah, they never have.
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:53.040]   That is.
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:54.040]   Yes.
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:55.040]   McDonald's is infinitely more safe.
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:56.040]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:57.040]   Don't even ask that question.
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:58.040]   I can't believe in them.
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:01.080]   If I can't walk in McDonald's ice cream.
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:02.880]   Has McDonald's ever passed your lips?
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:05.080]   You're talking about the McFlurry machines.
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:07.080]   They're always broken.
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:09.360]   I can't trust them.
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:10.360]   They can't keep that right.
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:11.360]   So this is going to be-
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.080]   It's a right to repair issue right there.
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:14.080]   That's right.
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:17.040]   This is going to be really interesting.
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:25.200]   This story from Engadget says that Amazon is preparing to offer prime subscribers free
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.640]   cell phone service.
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:27.640]   Free or-
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:28.800]   Okay, stop.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:37.160]   Stop because I have seen in all of my telco coverage, no one can find a carrier.
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:40.600]   Wireless operators are flat out denying this as is Amazon.
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.600]   Like-
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:44.960]   According to Bloomberg, Scott Moritz met the dispenser soap.
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:51.080]   The company's negotiating with Verizon, T-Mobile and Dish to get the lowest possible wholesale
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.080]   prices.
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:54.080]   So they want to be an MPNO.
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:55.080]   Yes.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:44:02.120]   So there's T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T have all vehemently denied that this.
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:06.760]   So Dish has not responded to Ritesh for comment.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:07.760]   Yes.
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:15.680]   So, but AT&T says, "AT&T is not in discussions with Amazon to resell wireless services."
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:16.680]   And Amazon says-
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:20.240]   And Amazon's spokesperson told Bloomberg, "We don't have plans to add wireless at this
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.240]   time.
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:22.240]   They denied it as well."
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:23.960]   What if this is a super micro situation?
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:28.360]   Another Bloomberg McGuffin could be.
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.360]   They've never ever ever did.
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:31.360]   Never did.
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:32.360]   Hello?
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:33.360]   Super micro.
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:34.360]   How long ago was that?
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:35.360]   There's a couple of years ago.
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:38.280]   I don't know, but it sticks in your brain because that was horrible.
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:39.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:40.280]   Sorry.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:48.160]   And analysts say Prime Membership has stagnated since Amazon boosted the price to $139 a year.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:49.160]   That is a lot.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.160]   It's a lot, but at the same time-
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:51.960]   But it's there like a hundred million people?
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:54.760]   Who knows somebody that has Prime?
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:56.560]   And hey, can you order this on Prime for me?
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:57.560]   Thanks.
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:03.040]   According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, 167 million Amazon Prime members
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:04.040]   as of March.
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:05.040]   I don't want to know.
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:06.040]   It's poor stuff.
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:07.040]   Amazon doesn't say.
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:08.040]   Of course.
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:11.400]   There's 360 million people and that includes children and people who don't even know what
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:12.400]   Amazon is.
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:14.680]   How much bigger are they?
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:18.600]   So that's why growth is slowed.
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:19.600]   Everybody has one.
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:20.600]   Everybody already has it.
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:22.600]   I'm just saying that like-
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:26.240]   I'm sure owners are upset.
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:30.920]   I don't know if I would switch, but that's got to be pretty compelling if you get free
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:32.600]   mobile phone service in addition.
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:35.320]   I mean, Amazon gives you a lot of benefits.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:37.600]   I guess it would depend on the truck, right?
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:38.600]   It depends on-
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.600]   Yeah, if they use T-Mobile.
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:48.000]   Now, would I believe that Amazon is talking to wireless carriers about doing backup for
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:56.760]   some sort of commercial IoT network or other, like addendum to AWS 100%.
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:02.840]   Bloomberg says the carriers aren't really in a position to say no to Amazon because despite
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:07.840]   having poured billions into high capacity 5G networks, they've little to show for the
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:08.840]   effort.
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:11.480]   They're looking for new ways to utilize those networks.
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:13.400]   They spent so much money to build.
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:16.320]   But isn't they- if Amazon takes a customer, don't they lose that customer?
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:17.320]   No, no, no.
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.080]   Because Amazon pays them.
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:20.080]   Yeah.
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:21.080]   I understood.
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:24.640]   Amazon buys it at wholesale from one of these companies.
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:26.840]   Yeah, but it's not a net growth.
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:27.840]   It's not a-
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:28.840]   It is gross.
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:29.840]   It doesn't grow as a result.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:30.840]   It is gross.
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:31.840]   No, it's just-
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:32.840]   How?
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:33.840]   It's just a discounted growth.
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:38.400]   Instead of getting you as a retail customer, I'm getting Amazon and getting a smaller amount
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.040]   of money per customer, but I'm still getting-
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:41.040]   Right.
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:42.520]   If AT&T gets it for rising, it doesn't.
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:43.520]   It's gross for AT&T.
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:44.520]   Right.
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:45.520]   Well, yes.
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:47.520]   Everybody for themselves.
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:48.520]   Or you can see-
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:49.520]   Let's see.
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:51.720]   Now, what did you think?
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:53.360]   Business is business.
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:59.280]   It's possible that Amazon could do- like, I do think Amazon is interested in providing
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:02.720]   some sort of wireless service for device companies.
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:07.960]   So like, I could see them being an MVNO for like connected dog collars.
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:11.200]   Yeah, maybe that's it, right?
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:13.200]   Not necessarily just a carrier for-
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.320]   Well, analysts are pointing out the dish phones.
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:22.400]   Remember the whole T-Mobile sprint deal required, the government required that they offload
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:27.680]   a lot of their stuff to dish, boost mobile particularly, and that they would support
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:32.000]   dish in creating a- because the regulators are concerned on now you're down to three
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.520]   big carriers.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:38.480]   So T-Mobile said, "No, no, no, we're going to make dish the new fourth carrier."
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.480]   Right?
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:41.800]   But dish has a lot of debt.
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:42.800]   They're struggling a little bit.
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:45.800]   They still haven't launched boost infinite wireless service.
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:47.800]   Why not just buy them?
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:48.800]   Amazon.
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:52.320]   Well, I think there might be regulatory issues there too.
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:53.320]   Oh, okay.
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:54.320]   Oh, okay.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:56.360]   Who wants to buy anything from Charlie Hurkin?
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:00.080]   Well, the dish is already working with Amazon according to Bloomberg, whose AWS division
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:05.680]   is providing cloud computing to run the core network for its wireless service and is expected
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:10.360]   to start selling boost infinite wireless service on Amazon as soon as next month.
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:13.160]   So maybe there is something there with the dish.
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:18.800]   They talked to one analyst who said this is perceived as a lifeline for dish.
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:22.000]   For the three big carriers, Amazon's entry is troublesome.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:23.000]   Yes.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.600]   I'm sure it is.
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:28.720]   Anyway, yeah, it's just a rumor still.
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:30.680]   It's from Bloomberg, consider the source.
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:34.520]   I said in gadget earlier, but in gadget is quoting Bloomberg.
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:35.520]   Okay.
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:39.320]   Oh, this is great news.
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:42.600]   This actually is a cautionary tale.
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:50.200]   There's a Menlo Park, California company called Grail that sold a very expensive $950
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:53.440]   blood test to detect cancer.
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:55.280]   Hmm.
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:56.680]   Customer signed up.
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:00.720]   Grail inadvertently told about 400 of them.
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.600]   You've got cancer.
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:06.240]   They didn't.
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:14.080]   The company said it sent a form letter to some customers who had bought its gallery test,
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:19.040]   which detects a marker for more than 50 types of cancer, stating incorrectly that a cancer
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:20.560]   signal was detected.
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:23.080]   I don't know if that means you've got cancer or not.
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.560]   Means you might have this gene.
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:28.240]   It means call your doctor and they'll tell you about it because we can't.
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:35.480]   A company spokesperson said that the company blamed a vendor for the error sighting.
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:36.480]   Well, this is good.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:38.520]   A software configuration issue.
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:45.160]   Oh, we had this mail merge and then we pushed the wrong letter.
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:49.200]   I told them to use tabs, not spaces.
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:50.200]   Yeah.
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:56.440]   It started to contact the people who received the erroneous letters, but I think this is
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:57.440]   something fine.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:58.440]   It's coming.
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:49:59.440]   Keep in mind.
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:01.560]   No, no fines.
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:02.560]   You don't.
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:04.480]   Maybe it's nice to be like, you're going to die.
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:05.480]   No, you're not.
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:06.480]   Oh, okay.
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:07.480]   Good news.
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:08.480]   You're wrong.
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:10.840]   The heart attack got me in the meantime.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:13.120]   I think you see the Austria story, Leo.
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:14.600]   No, what's that?
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:21.600]   Oh, Austria, because of a major party in Austria, I put it in the chat, elected the wrong head
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:25.120]   of the party because of an Excel error.
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:32.880]   Oh, this was column C not column B. Oh, read this is around.
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:34.280]   Oh, what a mistake.
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:36.280]   I'm sure Shadi.
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:37.280]   Okay.
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:38.280]   Okay.
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:39.280]   These things happen.
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:40.280]   What can we say?
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:41.280]   Yeah.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:42.280]   This is from the Washington Post.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:44.440]   That's what you say.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.440]   These things happen.
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.280]   These things have been told a thousand people.
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:49.400]   He just told these problems.
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:54.520]   He's just a major Austrian opposition political party corrected the results of a closely contested
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:57.960]   leadership election after it announced the wrong winner.
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:00.480]   Someone had messed up an Excel spreadsheet.
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:04.160]   Hey, speaking of Excel, it's going to be, I don't know.
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:10.280]   This is a good time to do our Google change.
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:13.080]   How does that relate to Google change?
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:14.080]   Bard.
[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:17.360]   Now can export to Google sheets.
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:20.440]   Ah, how's that for a second?
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:21.440]   Hey, boy.
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:22.440]   What transition?
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:28.960]   Yeah, Bard has also added some features that will help you with programming.
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:31.520]   Actually, this was an interesting example.
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:32.600]   So you give it this prompt.
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:36.080]   The present population of a town is 3,888.
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:39.200]   People will be the expected population for the next two years or five years.
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:43.720]   If the growth rate is 20% for two years and 30 for five, not only does it give you the
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:54.160]   answer, it shows you the formula and even can write code if you wish to demonstrate,
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:58.600]   you know, how you would, how you would do this in Python, for example.
[01:51:58.600 --> 01:51:59.600]   So this is interesting.
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:01.760]   I'm a little bit of like chat GPT.
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:03.320]   It can add.
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:04.320]   Yeah.
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:09.360]   Well, I've seen people who've tried to get code written in Bard who've been very, he
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:13.160]   said, you know, chat GPT, I can get the code at least get the code to compile.
[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:14.160]   It's close to accurate.
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:15.960]   Bard won't even compile.
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:16.960]   Really?
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:23.520]   So Bard has, I think, been laggard in this, but this is a new feature that Google's touting.
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:30.840]   Android 14, beta three is out, customizable lock screen clocks and shortcuts, but you've
[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:33.320]   got to have a pixel.
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:36.680]   Android TV 14 beta is out.
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:47.000]   And that means if you've got an Android TV, you will be ditching Android 13.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.240]   So I don't, I guess I don't understand, but okay.
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:52.240]   I don't, you know,
[01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:55.640]   there's a slot in the change log and we just, that's all we care about.
[01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:59.640]   No, I'm confused because there's Google TV and there's Android TV.
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:04.640]   And the latest Chromecast is Google TV, but, but I have Android TV.
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:07.720]   And they killed daydream.
[01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:08.720]   And they killed daydream.
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:12.560]   It's just, yeah, yeah, Google is so fragmented.
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:14.920]   I don't understand.
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:18.080]   And I am the host of this week in Google.
[01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:19.960]   So there.
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:21.280]   So whose fault does that position?
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:23.040]   You take very seriously.
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:24.160]   You can tell, can't you?
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:27.800]   I'm really digging in here.
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:31.200]   Google Assistant has added two new voices.
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:33.120]   Lime and Indigo.
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:36.920]   Oh, I wonder what they sound like.
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:39.360]   Do you have one line around?
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:43.760]   You have to access the assistant voice and speech output page and then make a selection
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:48.200]   or try this and say, Hey, you know who changed your voice.
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:49.200]   Go ahead.
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:50.200]   Just, just try it.
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:52.360]   Change your voice.
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:54.360]   See if it'll do it.
[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:56.920]   Here's an example of one of my other voices.
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:58.520]   Would you like me to use this one?
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:53:59.680]   Yeah, no.
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:03.880]   Here is another voice example.
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:05.560]   Would you like me to use this one?
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:07.200]   Yes, please.
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:09.000]   You prefer a female voice?
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000]   Great.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000]   I'll keep you.
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000]   Yeah.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000]   Pretty neat.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000]   Was that Lime or Indigo?
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.000]   That's a good question.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000]   They didn't say their names.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000]   You want to hear?
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000]   I'll play some.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000]   I'll play some.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.000]   They have all their names.
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.760]   Let me play some names to go for you.
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:24.600]   This is, let me make sure my sound.
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:26.640]   Yeah, that was Indigo with us a lot.
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:28.440]   There are lots of things I can help you with.
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:33.200]   For example, you can say, set a timer or play some music.
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:35.960]   To see more, just swipe the options on your screen.
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:36.960]   It's very robotic.
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:38.640]   It's something weird about it.
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:39.720]   I don't know what it is.
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:40.720]   And this is Lime.
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:42.400]   There are lots of things I can help you with.
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:44.520]   For example, you can say, set a timer.
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:45.520]   Oh, that was awesome.
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:46.520]   Play some music.
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:47.520]   Yeah, so you just heard mine.
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:49.400]   This is why the options on your screen.
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:50.400]   So Lime.
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.400]   I kind of like Lime.
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:52.400]   I love Lime.
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:53.400]   I kind of like that too.
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:54.400]   Let me have Indigo.
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:57.520]   I don't need my phone being too chatty with me like a person.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:01.280]   So good.
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:02.280]   So good.
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:06.880]   Google has started rolling out image generation and slides.
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:09.080]   That's of course an AI feature.
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:10.080]   And more.
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:11.080]   They said they would.
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:14.600]   Yeah, they said they would and more duet AI for Gmail and Docs.
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:19.240]   So if you wanted giraffe staying in front of the Eiffel Tower in watercolor, you can get
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:21.560]   one in your slide.
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:24.000]   That's very inspirational.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.760]   So PowerPoint wasn't bad enough.
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:28.760]   That would be worse.
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:30.760]   Yeah, I mean.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:32.520]   We're going to find something for you to be positive around.
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:33.520]   Hold on.
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:35.640]   Let's give me something to make Jeff feel positive.
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:37.640]   That too will be it.
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:40.800]   Catch a Google now will roll out.
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:44.080]   Catch you a Pepe generation in Google Sheets.
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:50.720]   Do it AI for Google workspace enterprise hits preorder for businesses.
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:52.360]   And that's you.
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:53.360]   That still exists.
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:54.360]   I know.
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:55.360]   The Google change law.
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:56.360]   So confused.
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:57.840]   The web is the name of the AI.
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:00.680]   Now that's all there is now.
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:01.840]   Not duo duet.
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:02.840]   Not duo duet.
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:03.840]   Google AI.
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:04.840]   Oh, right.
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:05.840]   Do it.
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:06.840]   Priceline is announced.
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:13.680]   They're going to use Google AI for their travel agent, their virtual travel agent.
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:20.560]   So you can say, oh, you know, I want a New York hotel near a Christmas market.
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:25.520]   And it will then say, wow, you know, you can easily find out that in Bryant Park, there's
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:30.720]   a Christmas market that runs from early November all the way through the beginning of January.
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:31.720]   Try the.
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:32.720]   And it's got stock.
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:33.720]   It has.
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:35.280]   Show me the house.
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:37.760]   The big cheese house is my favorite.
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:38.760]   What?
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:40.880]   It's the best part at Bryant Park's Christmas.
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:42.680]   It is the best.
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:45.680]   And then you go next door and you get a little donut.
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:46.680]   Oh boy.
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:49.280]   So hot cider hot cider.
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:51.240]   Roll your way home.
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:52.240]   Okay.
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:53.240]   Please and thank you.
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:54.240]   Big cheese house.
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:55.720]   I'm telling you people.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:57:02.400]   Big as the teacher says, put a little cheeses in your life.
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:03.400]   Is it rack clap?
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:04.400]   Is it a rack clap?
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:05.400]   It's rack clap.
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:10.120]   It's a little it's they don't want to call it rack clap because people might, you know,
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:11.920]   think it's not it's foreign.
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:12.920]   Oh my.
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:15.800]   It's a big part of the house.
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:19.520]   It's spelled like H A U S. Well, because it's German.
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:21.520]   House.
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:26.880]   So it's a reckless by the way, I love the Bryant Park Christmas.
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:27.880]   It's great.
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:29.040]   I love hanging out down there.
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:30.040]   Good food.
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:31.040]   Good fun.
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:33.120]   There's a picture of me with big cheese house.
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:34.120]   I'll try to find it.
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:36.760]   Is there somewhere?
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:40.520]   Probably shouldn't be eating big cheese in your at your advanced age.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:44.760]   What should I look for?
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:46.400]   Speaking of a I found it.
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:47.400]   I found it.
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:50.520]   Oh, put it in the chat and I'll play it and discord.
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:51.520]   I'll play it.
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:52.520]   I'll do it.
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:53.520]   Hold on.
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:56.440]   Google actually upload a photo.
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:58.040]   I don't even know how to do that.
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:00.040]   Just do a link to it in Google photo.
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:01.960]   It's not it's it's in my Google photo.
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:02.960]   Oh, I see my Google photos.
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:03.960]   I can do that.
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:04.960]   Okay.
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:05.960]   Yes.
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:06.960]   All right.
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:07.960]   All right.
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:12.440]   The company behind WordPress.com has added and this is going to really improve blogging
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:17.640]   from the company that runs almost half of all the websites in the world.
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:23.480]   An AI assistant that will just write your blog for you.
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:24.480]   Fantastic.
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:31.080]   The company said the assistant easily integrates with WordPress.com and all jetpack powered sites.
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:37.920]   When you're writing a post or a page, you can add an AI assistant block to your content.
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:39.640]   Users can then type in a prompt.
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:41.440]   Oh, oh, you don't do it.
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:45.000]   Your users do type in a prompted a natural language in the AI assistant.
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:48.960]   Why will they go to your blog to generate AI content?
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:52.880]   Oh, my husband would say because I am way too wordy.
[01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:57.160]   He's like, Stacy, just give it to me as a bulleted list.
[01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:59.200]   I'm like, my God, man.
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:00.960]   Wow.
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:03.360]   I think your husband is root.
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:04.360]   You should be nice.
[01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:06.280]   What's the difference between this versus what?
[01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:08.360]   CNET in Red Ventures.
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:11.440]   Well, by the way, that's also in the news.
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:17.760]   CNET has said it's got new guidelines for AI journalism to which the writers union said,
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:18.760]   "No, you don't."
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:23.040]   Was it journalism in quotes?
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:28.920]   As you may remember, CNET got a little bit of trouble because about 70 articles were
[01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:31.160]   written by an AI.
[01:59:31.160 --> 01:59:32.720]   They didn't disclose it.
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:37.960]   And worse, the articles which are mostly written for their personal finance section were often
[01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:38.960]   wrong.
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:40.400]   I think I've got a new law.
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:41.400]   I've got a regulation.
[01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:42.400]   I'm not big on regulation.
[01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:46.000]   I think all AI text must be produced in comic sans.
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.960]   That everything will be okay.
[01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:48.960]   Okay.
[01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:49.960]   Well, know it.
[01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:50.960]   Okay.
[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:54.000]   Then it would be kind of like cheese sandwiches up on the discord.
[01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:00.560]   There is Jeff eating melted cheese in a sa-- this is wrong on so many levels.
[02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:01.560]   That's--
[02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:02.560]   Man, I need that.
[02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:04.360]   Do they have cornish shawls in there?
[02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:05.360]   Is that what you think?
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:06.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:07.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:08.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:09.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:10.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:11.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:12.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:13.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:14.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:15.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:16.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:17.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:18.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:19.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:20.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:22.120]   Radclide is a great tradition for the new humans.
[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:23.120]   Oh, that's wonderful.
[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:27.040]   I think everybody should have more cheese in their life.
[02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:34.400]   There are two broad categories of pursuits where CNET's responsible AI machine partner,
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:36.840]   ramp will be deployed.
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:40.960]   The first, which CNET cause organizing large amounts of information.
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:43.400]   Actually, AI is very good at that, right?
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:44.400]   Yep.
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:49.080]   Presides-- provides an example that seems more authorial though than that umbrella descriptor
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:51.440]   lets on this is in gadget writing.
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:54.400]   Ramp will help us sort things like pricing and availability data and present it in a
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:57.520]   way that tailors information to certain audiences.
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:00.000]   Without AI, this volume of work wouldn't be possible.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.920]   This customization wouldn't be possible.
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:03.920]   That makes sense.
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:06.800]   They're using AI for prep, not necessarily to--
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:07.800]   As it should be.
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:12.160]   And they'll always have a human associated with the article.
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:19.120]   CNET's media workers union said, "The new AI policy at CNET affects workers before the
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:20.120]   tool rolls out.
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:22.000]   Our union looks forward."
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.360]   I look forward, Mr.
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:30.920]   Pruitt, to negotiating in my office, Mr. Pruitt, how and what data is retrieved, a regular
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:36.400]   role in testing and reevaluating tool, right to opt out, and remove bylines of voice to
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:37.400]   ensure--
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:40.000]   How many times a day you may hit me in the arm?
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.000]   All right.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.920]   Well, that reminds me.
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:45.480]   What happened with the writer's guild?
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:46.480]   Still on strike.
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:47.480]   Still going on.
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:48.480]   And now--
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:49.480]   And others are joining actors may not--
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:50.480]   Actors are next.
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:51.480]   Ooh.
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:54.120]   If you don't have any writers, you don't have any actors.
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:55.120]   What do you got?
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:56.120]   Podcasts.
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:57.120]   Ooh.
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:58.120]   Ooh.
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:00.000]   CNET's new guy.
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:01.000]   Let's see.
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:02.000]   Google that--
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.960]   I Heart Media says, "Don't use chat GPT."
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:09.560]   Joining a long list of companies, including Apple, by the way, that won't let their employees
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:12.120]   use chat GPT.
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:18.880]   And then there's the Wall Street Journal article about a chat bot designed to help prevent
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:20.680]   eating disorders.
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:23.960]   The National Eating Disorders Association created a bot.
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:24.960]   Hmm.
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:29.120]   And replaced, of course, their operators on their hotline.
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:30.120]   Thoughts?
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:31.120]   With the bots.
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:33.880]   Well, this story is a mess.
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:35.720]   It is a mess.
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:37.280]   Thank you.
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:40.600]   This story is-- like, the reporting is all over the place.
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:44.160]   It's clear that someone is not telling the whole truth on the timeline.
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:51.680]   But they started out with a traditional chat bot that had a flow chart, like set of predetermined
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:52.680]   answers.
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:53.680]   Yep.
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:54.680]   Right.
[02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:57.960]   It added generative AI.
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:02.720]   But it's unclear if they did that before or after they shut down their hotline.
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:05.920]   And they shut down their hotline because people were waiting too long.
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:06.920]   Seven days.
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:07.920]   And probably.
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:08.920]   You know?
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:09.920]   Yeah.
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:14.000]   They said, "It's not like a--" it's just an informational line.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.640]   It's not a crisis line.
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:16.640]   Okay.
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:17.800]   So it's still seven days.
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:20.960]   If you're looking for help and you're eating disorders, wait too long.
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:21.960]   Wait too long.
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:25.960]   So it feels like this is not as simple.
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:30.840]   They fired all their workers because AI was awesome and then AI is messed up.
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:38.440]   What they had was-- they had a bad chat bot where they had a chat bot.
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:42.280]   And then they had a really slow AI hotline.
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:47.080]   So they fired the hotline people because they were like, "It's no good to anyone."
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:51.160]   Somewhere in that timeline, they also took their chat bot and added generative AI.
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:55.320]   And then the generative AI started promoting things that is not good for people who have
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:59.040]   eating disorders like, "Hey, you should count your calories."
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:00.040]   Which if you have anything--
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:01.520]   No, no, no, no.
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:02.520]   It's not great.
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:03.520]   Yeah.
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:06.120]   It was a very confusing story.
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:13.160]   There is a paragraph way down that says internet or other interests surged on the hotline
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:17.080]   because over Memorial Day they had 600% increase in volume.
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:22.040]   Their news reports said that NEDA was using Tessa to replace the humans who were in the
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:24.760]   process of trying to form a union.
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:28.920]   However, NEDA says, "No, no, that's not what happened.
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:34.480]   We decided to shut down the helpline after a three-year review from our board of directors
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:39.160]   because of increasing risk factors and overwhelming demand causing long waits."
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:41.640]   Well, how well did that work out for you then?
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:44.880]   That didn't work either.
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:50.200]   Clearly, the AI chatbot was a very bad idea.
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:53.200]   Keep AI chats away from facts.
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:54.200]   Yeah.
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:55.200]   It doesn't work.
[02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:56.200]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:58.200]   But again, I agree with you, Stacy.
[02:04:58.200 --> 02:04:59.640]   Well, not very unclear article.
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:01.760]   I couldn't figure out what happened, really.
[02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:06.840]   And you don't want AI around-- I mean, mental health is pretty nuanced.
[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:13.800]   So if you want to do it as a screening mechanism, sure, but you can't actually deliver quality
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:19.640]   mental health through-- and I know that everyone wants that to be scalable because how awesome
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:22.040]   would it be to have mental health be scalable?
[02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:25.080]   But even working with a therapist, it's not scalable.
[02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:28.040]   You're going to go in fits and starts.
[02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:33.840]   So tech solutionism does it again.
[02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:35.640]   Do you want to talk about Jeff or AI below?
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:36.840]   Yeah, you know, I see it.
[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:38.800]   Do you want to talk about archive.org?
[02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:43.120]   AI killing the internet archive with love.
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:49.800]   So just that the poor archive.org has said we got hit with all these requests and they
[02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:50.960]   realize what it is.
[02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:54.240]   It's people putting together training sets for their AI.
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:57.000]   They just say, "Kai, can you just spread it out a little bit?
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:00.080]   We love you, but."
[02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:03.440]   Ten-- this is Brewster Kale writing ended last month.
[02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:08.680]   Tens of thousands of requests per second for our public domain OCR files were launched
[02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:13.040]   from 64 virtual hosts on Amazon's AWS.
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:16.280]   The activity brought us down for everybody for about an hour.
[02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:20.960]   Engineers scrambled on a Sunday afternoon on Memorial Day weekend to work on this.
[02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:24.400]   We got the service back up by blocking those addresses.
[02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:29.320]   But another 64 addresses started the same activity a couple hours later.
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:33.040]   We figured I have a block the new set.
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:39.200]   He says, "Finally, if you're starting a large project, please email info@archive.org because
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:43.000]   while we want to help you, we can't--
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000]   we don't have the bandwidth."
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.440]   Gosh, you know, I love archive.org.
[02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:49.800]   I give them money every month.
[02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:50.960]   I got to give them more.
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:53.000]   That's all I could say.
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.920]   You don't want to talk about the Andreessen essay?
[02:06:56.920 --> 02:06:57.920]   Sure.
[02:06:57.920 --> 02:06:58.920]   Mark Andreessen says AI.
[02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:00.760]   I didn't read it.
[02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:02.680]   Yeah, I don't believe anything Mark says.
[02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:05.520]   But AI will save the world.
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:09.600]   Mark by the way, a venture capitalist with Andreessen Horowitz, who has been promoting
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:16.800]   web 3, among other things, as kind of an axe to grind.
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:20.200]   So I tweeted, I actually read the whole thing, so you don't have to.
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:21.200]   Thank you.
[02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:27.280]   And he starts off with ridiculous bromides like, "Well, AI can make everything we care
[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:28.280]   about better."
[02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:29.280]   Right.
[02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:32.240]   And then he goes on about how we're all going to have these wonderful assistants.
[02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:37.120]   Every child will have an AI tutor, every person will have an AI coach or mentor.
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:39.120]   Every scientist will have one.
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:41.120]   What he does, it's interesting in here.
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:42.120]   Get ready, Ant.
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:43.120]   Get ready.
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:44.120]   Oh, I can't.
[02:07:44.120 --> 02:07:45.120]   I can't.
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:46.120]   Moral panic.
[02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:47.120]   Moral panic.
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:48.120]   There we go.
[02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:49.120]   Man, feeling about this.
[02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:50.120]   I love that.
[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:51.120]   Thank you, Mr. Benito.
[02:07:51.120 --> 02:08:00.320]   That one you have to see in the video.
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:04.800]   That's ahead of Jeff floating through a sign that says "moral panic," saying, "I've got
[02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:06.960]   a bad feeling about this."
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:12.120]   So he says that there are the religious people who were saying that AI has bad force.
[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:16.080]   He calls the AI boys who were saying it's going to kill everybody bootleggers because
[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:17.400]   they're trying to promote themselves.
[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:18.400]   Yes.
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:19.400]   And it goes through the...
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:20.400]   He's right there.
[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:21.400]   He's right there.
[02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:22.400]   Absolutely right.
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:23.400]   And he goes through the risks.
[02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:24.400]   Will AI kill us?
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:25.400]   No.
[02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:26.400]   No.
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:27.400]   Will it ruin society?
[02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:28.400]   No.
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:29.400]   Will it take all the jobs?
[02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:30.400]   No.
[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:31.400]   And he has backup for that, some of that.
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:32.400]   Will it lead to crippling inequality?
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:34.400]   Well, we can debate about that because it's just capitalism.
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:36.800]   Will it lead to bad people doing bad things?
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:37.800]   Yes, it will.
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:38.800]   Okay.
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:42.400]   And then he goes on, then his final shtick is "What's to be done?"
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:48.640]   Well, this is amusing because it's a VC libertarian saying, "Well, don't regulate AI.
[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:50.400]   Don't do regulatory capture.
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:52.000]   Allow open source."
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.800]   I agree with that because we're going to have more competition.
[02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:55.800]   I think we need more competition.
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:56.800]   I think that's true.
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:00.000]   And what we see happening in Europe is they're going to try to regulate the hell out of it
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:05.840]   and stop AI from being open source, which I also agree would be a mistake.
[02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:07.840]   So I said, "This actually is pretty good."
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:09.440]   But he can't see it because he plots me.
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:10.440]   Yeah.
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:11.440]   No, you know what?
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:12.440]   I take back what I said because he's absent.
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:14.680]   I agree with everything he said.
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:16.040]   I do too, actually.
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:17.040]   Yeah.
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:23.440]   There is a little bluster in it about how it's going to change all of our lives and save
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:24.440]   the world.
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:25.440]   It's not going to do that.
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:29.320]   You know, it occurred to me too that it's the mistake of it's the problem of using the
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:31.280]   word of intelligence with this stuff.
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:33.280]   It absolutely mititizes it from the start.
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:34.520]   It's not intelligence.
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:38.280]   It's an augmenting thing to help us do what we want to do.
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:42.840]   And it will be more efficient and it will gain knowledge of all kinds of things.
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:45.280]   The will do needs stuff, but it's not going to change.
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:46.280]   It's not going to save the world.
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:48.880]   Nor is it going to destroy the world.
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:52.320]   I think we should have a new segment on this show called Bromide and Bluster.
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:54.320]   I really like that.
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:55.320]   I really like that.
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:56.320]   It's a show time.
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:57.320]   That's really good.
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:02.320]   If you get past the Bromides and ignore the bluster, what do you say is actually, I think,
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:06.640]   a pretty good prescription for how we should treat AI going forward.
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:07.640]   Yeah.
[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:09.640]   Yeah, I agree.
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:15.080]   The Bromide was, human intelligence makes a very broad range of life outcomes better.
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:16.080]   No.
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:18.720]   The bluster.
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:22.960]   Every person will have an AI assistant coach, mentor, trainer, advisor, therapist that
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:28.400]   is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable and infinitely helpful.
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:34.400]   If you believe that, then you should go to this April Fools sub stack, the state of
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:39.800]   AI written by an AI and read that.
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:45.400]   I dare you for a few weeks and you will go that first go down a little bit, Leo, because
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:47.400]   the paragraph just abused the hell out of me.
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:51.880]   Well, right there, the last sentence there, faster your seat belts for an insightful,
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:54.680]   engaging and potentially worrisome ride.
[02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:58.960]   The thing is, Leo, that paper, natural selection favors AI's over humans.
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:00.760]   That's a real paper.
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:02.160]   I read it and it's ridiculous.
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:05.520]   Like, I don't have this long term as a thing.
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:08.920]   The AI's are going to become their own bodies and then they're going to compete with each
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:15.600]   other and the Starwind time is daffy, digital Darwin.
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:19.000]   The most powerful AI will survive over all the others.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000]   Yeah.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.000]   I do like this.
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:25.160]   In short, anything that people do with their natural intelligence today can be done much
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:30.840]   better with AI and we will be able to take on new challenges that have been possible
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:33.160]   to tackle without AI.
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:34.160]   Yeah.
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:35.160]   Open AI.
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:37.920]   Some things people could have, but not all.
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:38.920]   Not all.
[02:11:38.920 --> 02:11:39.920]   No, not all.
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:40.920]   But yeah.
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:41.920]   This will be an interesting lawsuit.
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:47.600]   Open AI is being sued because chat GBT accused a guy of embezzlement.
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:48.600]   Whoops.
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:55.640]   When a journalist is very on-line, chat GBT can be made to say anything.
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:56.640]   Yeah.
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:11:58.600]   People are going to think they can sue open AI.
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:11:59.600]   It's just ludicrous.
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:00.600]   Yeah.
[02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:01.600]   But it'll be happening.
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:02.600]   That's life is ludicrous.
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:03.600]   Yeah.
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:05.000]   Well, yeah.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.400]   I mean, yeah.
[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:11.480]   Don't believe everything you read when chat GBG says it.
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:14.240]   We now have a new CEO at Twitter.
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:21.440]   Linda Yacareno has taken over.
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:26.640]   She took over on Monday and everything's so much better now.
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:27.640]   Thank you, Linda.
[02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:28.640]   Bye-bye, Elon.
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:29.640]   Okay.
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:30.640]   She's really not the CEO.
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:32.040]   Can I just say she's probably just really in normal times would be her title would be
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:34.640]   Head of Sales, ad sales, right?
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:36.440]   Well, that's what they need.
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:37.440]   Yeah.
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:38.440]   Yeah.
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:40.680]   Ad sales plunge 59% according to the New York Times.
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:42.840]   So she's not a Cheryl Sandberg to his suck?
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:44.440]   I don't think so.
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:46.120]   No, they just handed over.
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:49.640]   Well, as you can see in your feed the last two weeks, there was a story.
[02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:54.560]   We had a story in the runout last week that they've handed over most of their inventory
[02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:55.560]   to programmatic.
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:56.560]   All right.
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:00.440]   So there's crap about toilet cleaning and that kind of stuff.
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:01.440]   The ads are awful.
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:05.800]   I bet if Leo writes about toilet, he's selling him mushrooms.
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:06.800]   Let me see.
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:08.600]   And let's see.
[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:13.000]   The problem is, and I really bugs me about Twitter, is they really need to put the promoted
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:14.200]   at the top of the tweet.
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:18.600]   Oh, it's because you don't know until you get to the bottom of there's a nice amp-prout.com/beer.
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:23.600]   I thought that was an ad because it's so well produced.
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:24.600]   Yeah.
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:25.600]   Yes.
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:26.600]   I'm looking for ads.
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:28.000]   I've got cohere AI.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.360]   I've got Wall Street Journal subscription.
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:32.360]   I have got.
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:33.360]   Don't have any ads.
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:34.360]   Maybe it'll be only in following.
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:35.360]   Oh, I have Outlander.
[02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:36.360]   Outlander the show.
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:39.360]   They know I'm a woman.
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:40.360]   Yes.
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:41.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:42.360]   Women love Outlander.
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:51.120]   Actually, I read the whole Diana Gabaldin novel is this thick and I love that.
[02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:53.640]   The TV show is OK, but I really like the novel.
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:54.640]   I like Time Train.
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:56.320]   Oh, I have a dog pool.
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:13:58.440]   This is fun, a sprinkler pool for my dog.
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:00.880]   I'm down, but that does feel a little skymall.
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:03.280]   Why am I getting no more retractable fountain pen?
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:05.320]   They somehow know.
[02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:09.880]   They somehow know that I am showing this on the air and I know suddenly because all I
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:11.360]   got was ads before.
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:13.280]   Mine's all right.
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:15.560]   Oh, Messi is signing with Miami.
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:16.560]   OK.
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:19.200]   That's a big story.
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:23.040]   Messi was going back and forth between.
[02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:28.360]   I think it was a Premier League team and an MLS team and he's going with MLS.
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:34.400]   There was rumors that Apple would actually have to show say as a share of revenue to
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:39.440]   Messi just because they're, of course, a broadcasting MLS, but getting Messi is huge.
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:40.440]   That's big.
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:42.240]   Getting Messi is huge.
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:50.600]   One of my four students now, one of our teachers covers soccer for ESPN and there was a faculty
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:52.440]   being this morning and said, "Sorry, I got to go.
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:54.720]   Messi owns my life now."
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:56.720]   Right.
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:00.720]   You know, I have no ads in my Twitter feed at all, which makes me think they really are
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:01.720]   suffering.
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:03.440]   I have a thing that's going to correct my posture.
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:04.440]   Maybe I have a blocker running.
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:06.440]   Oh, I got that earlier today.
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:08.160]   Let me turn it on.
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:09.160]   You know what?
[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:10.160]   I'm champion.
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:11.160]   You're should think Stacy.
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:12.680]   What did you say?
[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:14.520]   Your posture is lovely, Jeff.
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:18.600]   Mine on the other hand right now is terrible because my migraine is killing my muscles.
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:20.680]   Oh, let's get this over with then.
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:22.080]   We're going to take a break.
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:23.920]   Oh, no, no.
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:26.600]   I'll stay another hour.
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:28.120]   Oh, new camera for me.
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:29.120]   Sorry.
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:32.720]   Today, I didn't want to be the person complaining because I had a reason to complain.
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:33.720]   Yeah, we're trying.
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:34.720]   When I don't have a reason.
[02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:40.040]   We're trying to rehabilitate Stacy's point of view.
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:41.040]   Oh, we are.
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:42.760]   A rep, right?
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:43.760]   We're trying to...
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:44.880]   That's because you guys, you said it.
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:46.040]   I think this is true.
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:53.760]   You have now become pigeonholed as that waffle eating, complaining, own it.
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:55.200]   Always ready to go home.
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:56.200]   Own it.
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:57.200]   Host.
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:15:58.200]   And you're not.
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:15:59.200]   I know you're not.
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:00.200]   You're just playing it up.
[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:02.520]   And so we're going to rehabilitate Stacy's image.
[02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:05.320]   She's going to become the Dela Street of this show.
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:06.320]   Dela Street.
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:09.840]   If we start talking media again, she's going to become that person.
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:12.720]   And by the way, he's Paul Drake.
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:13.920]   Jeff's Paul Drake.
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:15.520]   We're talking Perry Mason.
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:16.520]   And I'm Perry Mason.
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:17.520]   Oh, okay.
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:19.520]   You're making me a secretary?
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:20.520]   No, no, no, no.
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:21.520]   She's not a secretary.
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:29.040]   She sits next to Perry at the table of the attorneys.
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:35.360]   She comes up with some of the best stuff, actually in the new Amazon Prime Perry Mason.
[02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:36.360]   She's even more important.
[02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:37.960]   I would be running that table.
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:39.360]   Yeah, she is.
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:40.400]   Here's the virtual camera.
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:42.200]   This is just, I think...
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:43.200]   Stupid.
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:44.720]   Oh, this is so fun.
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:46.960]   I think it's a conceptual though.
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:48.360]   I don't think they plan to sell it.
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:49.360]   The paragraph...
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:50.360]   Yeah.
[02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:51.840]   The idea is it's a camera.
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:53.000]   It doesn't have a lens.
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.760]   It's really just a little computer.
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:58.840]   You enter in a prompt while pointing it as a GPS, I guess.
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:05.640]   So while pointing it, and then it will generate a artificial reality picture of what you're
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:08.160]   actually taking a picture of.
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:09.840]   So you see he's trying different things.
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:10.840]   He wants to sit.
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:12.680]   He can get rid of all of his cameras.
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:13.680]   Look at this.
[02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:17.040]   And it does an AI graphic of where you are.
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:20.120]   The thing is though, you don't even have to go outside.
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:24.680]   Just go right to your prompt in whatever generative AI that you're using now.
[02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:25.680]   Yeah.
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:26.680]   That's true.
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:28.640]   I could do that right now, couldn't I?
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:32.520]   Yeah, but this is one of those fun little hardware projects that you all love.
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:33.520]   Oh, fun.
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:38.040]   It's also a comment on AI photography real life.
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:40.080]   I mean, it's kind of a commentary, right?
[02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:41.080]   Sure.
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:42.080]   Yeah.
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:43.080]   It's kind of...
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:44.080]   It's hard.
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:45.080]   It is.
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:46.080]   It's really what is...
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:47.080]   Sure.
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:48.080]   Paragraphica.
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:49.080]   It's a...
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:50.160]   I'm not going to give out the URL because I can't even...
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:51.600]   This is some Danish guy.
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:53.280]   Yeah, it was in my feeds.
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:54.280]   Yeah.
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:55.280]   It was like, no, no thanks.
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:56.280]   Yeah.
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:17:57.280]   Well, I don't even know if you could buy it.
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:17:58.280]   Put it in there to...
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:02.280]   You know, next week I'll look for some musicals for you instead of answers.
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:03.280]   Oh, we even like that.
[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:06.400]   It's supposed to find your special pick of the week.
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:07.400]   Dang it.
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:09.480]   We'll get to that.
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:12.800]   So actually, you can try it.
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:14.560]   Press the trigger to take a photo of your location.
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:16.280]   It has to know where we...
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:19.320]   Oh, no location services are blocked right now, I guess.
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:23.400]   But if it knows where you are, you can actually, you know, do it on the web, which is cool.
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:24.400]   That's neat.
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:26.400]   It's just, you know, it's an art project.
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:27.400]   Yeah.
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:28.400]   Shh.
[02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:35.440]   Our show today, we'll be right back with our picks of the week.
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:40.600]   Our show today brought to you by the great folks at Cisco.
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:46.080]   Maraki, there are the experts in cloud-based networking from hybrid work.
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:51.000]   Whether your employees are working at home, at a cabin in the mountains, or an lounge chair
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:58.640]   at the beach, a cloud-managed network is designed to provide the same exceptional work experience.
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:02.120]   Doesn't matter where they are, whether they're in the office or not.
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:05.680]   And by the way, you might as well roll out the welcome map because hybrid work is here
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:07.480]   to stay.
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:10.280]   Hybrid work, though, works best in the cloud.
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:13.600]   And it literally does have perks for both employees and leaders.
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:14.600]   Workers love it, right?
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:15.600]   They can move faster.
[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:17.480]   They can give you better results.
[02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:21.640]   As long as they've got that cloud-managed network, so everybody's on the same page.
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:25.280]   Leaders like it because they can automate distributed operations, build more sustainable
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:28.320]   work spaces, proactively protect the network.
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:29.840]   Actually, that's really important.
[02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:35.640]   Maraki, commission, an IDG market pulse report, research report, highlighting the top tier
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:38.320]   opportunities in supporting hybrid work.
[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:43.880]   First of all, good to know, hybrid work a priority for 78% of C-suite executives.
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:48.120]   Players want to drive collaboration forward, but they also need to stay on top of or even
[02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:50.640]   boost productivity and security.
[02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:52.480]   And that's one of the big challenges.
[02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:54.760]   The IDG report raises the red flag about security.
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:57.680]   You know, they have 48% of leaders report.
[02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:03.200]   Cyber security threats are the number one obstacle to improving workforce experiences.
[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:07.640]   So that's where you turn to Cisco, Maraki, for always on security monitoring.
[02:20:07.640 --> 02:20:09.840]   Part of what makes the cloud-managed network so awesome.
[02:20:09.840 --> 02:20:13.840]   IT can use apps for Maraki's vast ecosystem partners.
[02:20:13.840 --> 02:20:17.280]   More in key solutions built to work seamlessly with the Maraki Cloud platform.
[02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:21.160]   They can do things like asset tracking and location analytics.
[02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:24.720]   You can gather insights on how people are using the workspace, right?
[02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:30.440]   In fact, in a smart workspace, environmental sensors can track activity and occupancy levels,
[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:32.200]   stay on top of cleanliness.
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:36.520]   You can reserve workspaces based on vacancy and employee profiles.
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:39.760]   So you can efficiently hot desk.
[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:41.440]   Employees can quickly scatter the place to work.
[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:46.520]   If by the way, you have restricted environments, get the employees to book in advance and then
[02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:51.600]   include time-based door access so they can only get in during that period of time.
[02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:56.360]   You also get mobile device management too as well, integrating devices and systems, which
[02:20:56.360 --> 02:21:01.160]   means IT can manage update and troubleshoot company-owned devices, even if the device
[02:21:01.160 --> 02:21:05.800]   and the employee are elsewhere at the coffee shop on the beach.
[02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:09.360]   You could turn any space into a place of productivity.
[02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:11.920]   In these days, you've got to look at this.
[02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:17.320]   Empower your organization with the same exceptional experience no matter where your workers are
[02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:20.720]   with Maraki and the Cisco suite of technology.
[02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:24.600]   Learn how your organization can make hybrid work work.
[02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:28.160]   Visit maraki.cisco.com/twit.
[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:33.480]   That's maraki.cisco.com/twit.
[02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:37.520]   I was a little guilty when I was talking about that because we made you all come back to work.
[02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:40.720]   You started talking about hot desk.
[02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:41.920]   I'm not going to hot desk.
[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:44.120]   You got your own desk.
[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:50.720]   I really am making feelings about this, but I decided I missed having everybody here.
[02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:54.200]   I think we as a group didn't quite work as well.
[02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:57.440]   I wasn't worried about productivity, but I think there is something that happens when
[02:21:57.440 --> 02:21:59.800]   everybody's in the same space.
[02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:03.840]   I know that it's been a little hard for people to get used to it.
[02:22:03.840 --> 02:22:06.840]   I think it's really interesting to see you again.
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:10.200]   For instance, we had editorial meetings there.
[02:22:10.200 --> 02:22:11.400]   You still be all on Zoom now.
[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:12.400]   We were all in the same room.
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:15.040]   I think they're much more effective.
[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:18.920]   Are you doing fall every day back or is there a question?
[02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:19.920]   Yeah.
[02:22:19.920 --> 02:22:25.240]   One thing that we did do, Lisa and her infinite wisdom, made everybody do four-day work week.
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:31.240]   Everybody's got a three-day weekend or whatever that day those would be.
[02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:36.800]   I think that four days a week you come in.
[02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:37.800]   I don't know.
[02:22:37.800 --> 02:22:41.760]   I just think it's the right way to go.
[02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:43.680]   I apologize if you hate it, Aunt.
[02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:44.680]   I get it done.
[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:49.360]   You're the one who wanted to get away from the family.
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:52.080]   That's what my home studio is for.
[02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:53.080]   Sorry.
[02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:55.560]   Where's his man Kate here?
[02:22:55.560 --> 02:23:00.960]   I still have a well to my arm from having him work here, so maybe you should go home.
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:02.920]   You're going to regret this.
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:06.760]   At least there's a perk right there.
[02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:07.760]   Oh, it is.
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:12.040]   Now, Stacy, what's your thing this week?
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:13.360]   You know what?
[02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:15.400]   I'm going to help you all out if you'll care.
[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:16.400]   I care.
[02:23:16.400 --> 02:23:24.360]   If you're worried about your indoor air quality, I am aware element for $209. measures.
[02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:30.440]   All five of the things I told you it would measure, which if you care about carbon dioxide,
[02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:38.280]   BOCs, particulate matter at 2.5 humidity and temperature, this particular one is one of
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:41.640]   the only ones on the market that measures all of those things.
[02:23:41.640 --> 02:23:45.560]   It's $209, which feels like a lot.
[02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:51.080]   Amazon does have one that's about $70, but it does not measure VOCs.
[02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:52.880]   I don't think it measures carbon dioxide.
[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:56.920]   I think it measures carbon monoxide.
[02:23:56.920 --> 02:24:01.920]   I have carbon monoxide.
[02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:02.920]   Yeah.
[02:24:02.920 --> 02:24:05.440]   Yeah, you definitely want that.
[02:24:05.440 --> 02:24:08.160]   Actually, we had a furnace guys come in, check the furnace.
[02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:10.320]   He said, "You know, I have a big hole in your flu."
[02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:11.880]   And you're what?
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:14.680]   You know, with it exhaust for the furnace.
[02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:16.480]   And I said, "We have carbon monoxide detectors.
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:19.160]   How come they didn't go off?"
[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:20.560]   So now I'm worried that we got to...
[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:21.560]   I'm sorry.
[02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:23.360]   You saw what you said, "New carbon monoxide detectors?"
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:24.360]   No, he saw us in the flu.
[02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:26.200]   I said, "I'm not having people come to your house, man."
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:28.200]   He said, "I'm going to tape it up with duct tape."
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:29.200]   I said, "You know what?
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:30.360]   Can you give me a new flu?"
[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:34.320]   It was in the garage, but that's where the carbon monoxide detector is.
[02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:35.320]   I was...
[02:24:35.320 --> 02:24:36.320]   Oh boy.
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:37.320]   Anyway, what's the brand name?
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:38.320]   What do you recommend?
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:39.320]   Okay.
[02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:41.800]   So this is the aware is the brand name.
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:44.280]   And their software is some of my favorite software for this.
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:46.520]   I used to have the aware glow, which was fun.
[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:49.520]   Now, if you're like Stacey, that's way too much money.
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:51.400]   And it doesn't actually clean my air.
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:53.760]   I have another $200 option for you.
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:55.280]   That's really good.
[02:24:55.280 --> 02:25:01.760]   And this is the 3M fill treat, smart air purifier and air quality monitor.
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:02.760]   Now, this...
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:08.040]   The 199.99 one is going to get your rooms up to 310 square feet.
[02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:10.680]   So that's going to clean larger rooms.
[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:15.200]   You will have to replace the filter with the 3M HEPA filters, but those are actually
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:16.920]   really good filters.
[02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:23.760]   And this is not going to tell you things like VOCs or carbon dioxide or monoxide really,
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:25.640]   but it will tell you particulate matter.
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:28.560]   And I think it tells you humidity.
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:32.400]   Most air purifiers, if they're running on the higher settings, they're pretty loud.
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:35.200]   So this one is kind of loud on the higher settings.
[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:38.720]   So if your air is really dirty, you're going to hear this.
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:40.840]   But that's the same thing for my Airmega.
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:43.200]   I think the CoAway is probably the quietest one I own.
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:47.680]   Yeah, we have the CoAway's running right next to our microphones and you don't hear them.
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:48.680]   Unless it gets...
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:51.080]   It suddenly says, "Oh" and it goes up to high.
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:52.080]   And then you're...
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:55.320]   And the 3M's quiet when it's not.
[02:25:55.320 --> 02:26:02.720]   But the nice thing about this one is it has a display on the top that tells you the index.
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:05.240]   And then it also gives you a green, a red...
[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:06.240]   Oh, that's cool.
[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:07.240]   Or a horrible light.
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:10.240]   And it ties to your smartphone as well so you can see it on your smartphone.
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:16.880]   Yeah, and it'll tell you it'll give you the battery information, the filter change information
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:17.880]   and that sort of thing.
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:20.560]   So I've been running, I've run those and they're good.
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:22.000]   They do clean the air.
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:27.760]   And they have screen filters that help if you keep those washed, that helps trap more
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:30.000]   particulates before it gets to your filter.
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:33.000]   That was that thing we showed you on the CoA as well.
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:34.000]   Yeah.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000]   So that's that.
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.000]   Fill treats.
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:38.400]   Those are my things.
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:43.320]   The AWARE is AWAIR, the AWARE glow and the fill treat smart.
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:45.120]   Not the AWARE glow.
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:46.840]   It's the AWARE element that does all five.
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:48.960]   Oh, you like the AWARE element.
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:52.400]   Yeah, I had the, they don't make the AWARE glow anymore.
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:54.040]   They don't support it anymore.
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:55.840]   But I did love that thing.
[02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:57.800]   Oh, this one looks cool.
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:00.040]   It kind of looks like a little speaker.
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:02.000]   Yeah, it's not.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:03.000]   It's not.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:04.000]   Yeah.
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.480]   That's a little thing to, yeah, a little design element there.
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:09.480]   Good stuff.
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:12.320]   Jeff Jarvis, how about a number of the week?
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:16.280]   Well, I think, I think given you've made all of your people come back to the office,
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:18.480]   I want to make you feel bad and weird.
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:20.480]   Because, uh, castle.
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:22.800]   So what's new, buddy?
[02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:23.800]   What's new?
[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:24.800]   Yeah.
[02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:29.840]   Castle, which is, I think does, does work in, in, in office stuff and all those things.
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:34.120]   They have a regular, um, back to work barometer.
[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:41.600]   The 10 city average of office occupancy is 47.6% if you scroll up.
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:43.800]   You will definitely see that in San Francisco.
[02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:45.960]   It's like a, it's just like a.
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:48.000]   There was this goes down to 42%.
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:49.000]   Yeah.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:54.760]   Um, did you see that the, the Hilton, which is the biggest hotel in San Francisco, they
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:56.400]   just walked away.
[02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:57.400]   Yeah.
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:27:58.400]   They cleared bankruptcy.
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:00.400]   They kept sorry.
[02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:01.400]   I scary.
[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:03.640]   Uh, that's really scary.
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:05.400]   That's 3000 rooms.
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:06.400]   Um, hotels.
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:10.000]   Yeah, actually did with another hotel as well.
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:16.200]   Um, so San Francisco occupancy is down to 42.7 San Jose occupancy is down to 37.
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:19.000]   That's probably because Google, everybody out to rebuild it.
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:23.560]   Santa's always felt like, uh, like kind of the city that everybody left.
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:24.560]   Sort of forgotten.
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:25.560]   Yeah.
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:26.560]   It's always felt that way.
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:28.680]   It's really, well, it's so much better than what I used to live there.
[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:33.240]   It's way better a place than what I was there, but still, yeah, it's a sort of feel Austin
[02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:36.120]   and Houston are relatively high.
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:37.880]   Austin is 56%.
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:40.880]   Uh, Houston 57% 58%.
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:41.880]   Wow.
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:50.480]   But, um, but yeah, average is 47 point, 47.6% 10 city occupancy, less than a half, which
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:57.320]   makes me worry a little bit about the, um, coming real estate crash.
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:01.760]   Cause a lot of those releases that are still on and the buildings are still getting paid.
[02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:05.760]   When those leases come up and then nobody going to want them.
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:11.840]   Unfortunately, a lot of those people are, are complaining about the crime.
[02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:15.440]   And homelessness that's happening in those areas too.
[02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:16.440]   Yep.
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:17.440]   Yeah.
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:21.760]   Certainly downtown San Francisco is hard to work there because you got to wade through,
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:28.760]   you know, a fentanyl market and, uh, an outdoor, uh, privy and it's just not pleasant.
[02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:34.560]   Um, but now it, there's Hilton and park 55, both.
[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:35.720]   Or 55, right.
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:41.320]   Closing, uh, in San Francisco, just walking away, ceasing payments and hotel properties.
[02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:46.320]   But they're going bankrupt, uh, and say, you know, what the creditors have them.
[02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:47.320]   Mm.
[02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:51.680]   I had a friend who was in San Francisco last week going to a conference and he came out
[02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:55.480]   of the hotels across the Moscone, that big one.
[02:29:55.480 --> 02:29:58.720]   And instead of turning right on 5th street, he turned left on 5th street.
[02:29:58.720 --> 02:29:59.720]   Oh yeah.
[02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:02.560]   Oh, this is really bad and went way down.
[02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:06.320]   And at some point the cops came up to him and said, what are you, what are you doing here?
[02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:08.320]   They get in the back.
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:09.320]   Really?
[02:30:09.320 --> 02:30:10.320]   Yes.
[02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:11.320]   Wow.
[02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:13.480]   So there's a Michelin two star restaurant.
[02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:14.960]   Yeah, there used to be.
[02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:18.840]   Maybe it's not there anymore, but there was a Michelin two star restaurant on 5th.
[02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:22.680]   Uh, Lisa and I went down there and it was like, we're never going back here again.
[02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:30.120]   Um, the restaurant was amazing, but she walked to a block away.
[02:30:30.120 --> 02:30:35.720]   You know, we, we parked a part blocks away, uh, literally 50 feet from the front door.
[02:30:35.720 --> 02:30:37.160]   Some guys defecating in the street.
[02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:41.160]   It really kind of puts you off your food and this is where I used to work.
[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:44.960]   The, the, yeah, it's across the street from the old Chronicle building.
[02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:45.960]   It's terrible.
[02:30:45.960 --> 02:30:46.960]   Yeah.
[02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:48.160]   It's very sad.
[02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:54.360]   Um, you know, but I was mad when I saw the CNN Anderson Cooper, San Francisco is dying
[02:30:54.360 --> 02:30:59.000]   thing, but at the same time it's hard to deny that there's trouble.
[02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:00.000]   Yeah.
[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:03.320]   Uh, what's interesting in New York is if you, if you midtown New York, you know, seven
[02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:06.960]   thousand new every restaurant and every business is closing down, you go to Brooklyn because
[02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:08.560]   it's a residential area, right?
[02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:09.560]   Right.
[02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:10.560]   Pop us up.
[02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:11.560]   Brooklyn is awesome.
[02:31:11.560 --> 02:31:12.560]   Well, then that's true of San Francisco too.
[02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:15.800]   There are certain, you know, the fifth, fifth emission don't go there.
[02:31:15.800 --> 02:31:16.800]   All right.
[02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:22.200]   But, but there are, you know, there's lots of districts, twin peaks and so forth that
[02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:25.400]   are fun, but you know, going great, safe.
[02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:27.200]   Um, Tiberon era.
[02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:31.840]   Well, Tiberon's not San Francisco, but yeah, Tiberon, that's where the rich people.
[02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:32.840]   Yeah.
[02:31:32.840 --> 02:31:33.840]   Tiberon.
[02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:34.840]   That's for the rich folk.
[02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:36.840]   And it's quite, uh, that's, that's where you have the, that's where you have the, that's
[02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:38.760]   where the Brooklyn is in your yacht.
[02:31:38.760 --> 02:31:39.760]   Yeah.
[02:31:39.760 --> 02:31:43.880]   I was like, I used to spend a lot of time in Tiberon and it was lovely.
[02:31:43.880 --> 02:31:44.880]   Yes.
[02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:46.960]   It's, it's Stacy Bougie approved.
[02:31:46.960 --> 02:31:52.400]   So I think part of it is these vacancies, Stacy Bougie, there's also, I mean, San Francisco's
[02:31:52.400 --> 02:31:55.520]   problem is also because of a fentanyl crisis.
[02:31:55.520 --> 02:31:57.880]   There's a really big problem with fentanyl.
[02:31:57.880 --> 02:31:58.880]   Uh, massive.
[02:31:58.880 --> 02:32:02.720]   Well, there's a problem with income inequality and the ability to afford housing.
[02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:04.640]   And once you're homeless, that sucks so bad.
[02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:05.840]   Why wouldn't you do fentanyl?
[02:32:05.840 --> 02:32:06.840]   You might as well.
[02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:07.840]   Yeah.
[02:32:07.840 --> 02:32:09.840]   Like, yeah, what else are you going to do?
[02:32:09.840 --> 02:32:10.840]   Oh, sad.
[02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:12.480]   It really makes me sad.
[02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:18.880]   Um, for the people as much as anything, you know, um, we got to figure this out.
[02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:21.320]   It was a little, it's still, it's dead.
[02:32:21.320 --> 02:32:22.320]   It's a great city.
[02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:26.720]   Anthony Nelson says mission district still vibrant and happening.
[02:32:26.720 --> 02:32:28.000]   And yeah, I love the mission.
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:29.000]   Yeah.
[02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:33.560]   But you don't have to go far from the mission less than a mile and, you know, it's bad news.
[02:32:33.560 --> 02:32:38.720]   Like the saddest irony of it is all is the civic center where the, where city hall is,
[02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:40.880]   is among the worst areas.
[02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:43.560]   You know, the mayor walks out the door.
[02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:48.440]   I guess she runs out the door into her limousine, but it's not good.
[02:32:48.440 --> 02:32:49.440]   Says a lot.
[02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:50.440]   Because there's no problem.
[02:32:50.440 --> 02:32:51.440]   That's an issue in Seattle too.
[02:32:51.440 --> 02:32:54.440]   It's always been on the dead space.
[02:32:54.440 --> 02:32:55.440]   Yeah.
[02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:56.440]   Yeah.
[02:32:56.440 --> 02:33:00.160]   Well, and if you are a shop there, you're going to be moving because you have the opera
[02:33:00.160 --> 02:33:02.560]   across the street and have the ballet and all that stuff.
[02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:07.320]   Yeah, we would go, we would go to the opera or the, the, the golden gate theaters down
[02:33:07.320 --> 02:33:08.320]   there.
[02:33:08.320 --> 02:33:11.920]   We'd go to the theater and you felt like you were taking your life in your hands.
[02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:13.560]   I'll pass.
[02:33:13.560 --> 02:33:14.560]   Yeah.
[02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:16.960]   It's terrible.
[02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:19.120]   And I imagine it's happening in urban areas all over the country.
[02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:21.560]   I don't, I just know he's taking a hit too.
[02:33:21.560 --> 02:33:22.560]   Yeah.
[02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:29.200]   Well, now that you've really cheered us up, Jeff Jarvis, Leo is doing his bit by getting
[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:31.200]   everybody to come back to the office.
[02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:35.200]   So, you know, Eastside Petaloma is hopping and happening.
[02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:39.440]   It's a lot of sushi at the gas station.
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:42.560]   Oh man, that gas station sushi is better than ever.
[02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:44.560]   Guys, don't do it.
[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:46.080]   And give us a thing.
[02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:50.080]   My thing here is a floating road and I saw this.
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:52.840]   You just doing this to make Jeff crazy.
[02:33:52.840 --> 02:33:55.600]   Oh, geez, cause she's done a war.
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:57.240]   I have been on this road.
[02:33:57.240 --> 02:33:58.240]   It is crazy.
[02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:02.520]   We have pictures of Lisa at the, is this the one in Norway or no?
[02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:03.520]   Where's this?
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:04.520]   No, that's in China.
[02:34:04.520 --> 02:34:05.520]   We'll give you a second.
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:06.520]   Oh, no, this is China.
[02:34:06.520 --> 02:34:07.520]   Yeah.
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:08.520]   The one I was seeing before that was Norway.
[02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:09.520]   Well, I'm okay with that.
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:12.160]   If it's floating, if it's down that low, that's okay.
[02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:14.640]   So this is a bunch of high up a bunch of different places.
[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:16.000]   Well, that many people on a bridge.
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:17.120]   No, I'm not that happy.
[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:18.840]   It I was, I was blown away.
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:20.560]   Oh, there's cars in.
[02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:21.560]   Yeah.
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:24.560]   Cars go down the same bridge that the people are walking on.
[02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:25.760]   This is the one I want to go to.
[02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:31.760]   The glass bridge because you look through the floor and you see 100 feet below you.
[02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:32.760]   Oh, yeah.
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:33.760]   Yeah.
[02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:34.760]   I was home.
[02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:37.760]   This is a couple of weekends ago because of, is that a walking bridge?
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:38.760]   Yeah.
[02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:39.760]   Yeah.
[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:41.200]   Look, he's wearing special booties.
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:42.760]   Oh, you have to put booties on.
[02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:43.760]   Yeah.
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:44.760]   Isn't that cool?
[02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:46.400]   Not going to make our glass dirty.
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:50.400]   Oh, so mean.
[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:51.640]   Here's the floating road.
[02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:53.600]   The number of the immortal bridges of float.
[02:34:53.600 --> 02:34:54.600]   Oh, yes.
[02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:55.600]   I've been there.
[02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:56.600]   Oh, great wall.
[02:34:56.600 --> 02:34:57.600]   Yeah.
[02:34:57.600 --> 02:34:58.600]   Tell me when it's over.
[02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:01.280]   What else you have, man?
[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:02.280]   He is turning right.
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:04.080]   It's over now, Mr. Jones.
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:05.080]   It's over.
[02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:06.080]   It's over.
[02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:07.080]   I promise you, sir.
[02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:08.080]   I promise you, man.
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:09.080]   You can now.
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:10.080]   I can't trust you.
[02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:13.840]   I've owed you that for a little while.
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:16.360]   I've owed you that for a little while and I was out of my sister.
[02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:18.200]   You're not a Bridgerton fan.
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:20.040]   I am not a Bridgerton fan.
[02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:21.040]   Okay.
[02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:23.120]   But this show, Queen Charlotte, you came out.
[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:24.120]   But you like this, man.
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:25.120]   Yeah.
[02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:26.520]   I thought it was watching it.
[02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:30.720]   And I kept asking her, do I need to know anything about Bridgerton to watch that show?
[02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:31.720]   Yeah.
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:33.080]   And she could never really answer it.
[02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:34.280]   She eventually binged it.
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:36.480]   I finally started watching it and I'm digging it.
[02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:37.480]   He loved it.
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:43.360]   And I told her the other day, I said, don't get mad at me, but watching this, this reminds
[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:50.960]   me of her, the main character in there, to me, looks like Queen Pruitt from a, you know,
[02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:52.200]   I've known her for 20 years.
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:55.680]   I've known her for the hairdo about, that's a wig.
[02:35:55.680 --> 02:35:56.680]   No, no, no, not that one.
[02:35:56.680 --> 02:35:57.680]   Scroll down.
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:35:59.280]   Actually, look at the other link.
[02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:02.280]   The queen to be looks a lot like Queen Pruitt.
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:06.560]   The young version, the lines me of Queen Pruitt version of Queen Pruitt.
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:13.720]   Good job, and every time I see her, I keep looking at it and she didn't take offense
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:14.720]   to it.
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:17.720]   But I was like, she looks just like, she looks just like Queen Pruitt.
[02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:18.720]   That's her right there.
[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:19.720]   Right there.
[02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:20.720]   Oh my God.
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:25.720]   Look at, I have a picture from about 10 years ago here in the rundown.
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:27.800]   You could see it.
[02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:30.400]   I've seen that picture of her.
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:32.840]   That looks so much like her.
[02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:34.640]   So maybe she's a reincarnated queen.
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:38.000]   And I'm like, I can't stop watching this, but it's good.
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.000]   Royalty.
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:40.000]   Wow.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:41.000]   It's a good show.
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:42.000]   I am amazed.
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:43.480]   She is Queen Pruitt.
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:44.480]   Yeah.
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:45.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:46.480]   You named her aptly.
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:49.040]   Oh, the link doesn't work.
[02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:50.040]   Oh, my bad.
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:52.920]   But I have to tell you, it looks just like that.
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:57.360]   That could be Queen Pruitt.
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:36:58.860]   That's amazing.
[02:36:58.860 --> 02:37:01.200]   And I just got a prover from Mr. Burke in the IRC.
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:02.200]   Yep, it does.
[02:37:02.200 --> 02:37:03.200]   Yeah.
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:04.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:08.640]   But I'm never going to watch a Bridgerton show, but that one's pretty good, isn't it?
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:09.640]   It's pretty good.
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:11.080]   You liked Outlander, dude.
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:12.080]   That's true.
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:13.080]   Come on.
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:14.080]   That's a good point.
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:17.800]   I couldn't fool with Bridgerton neither season, but this one.
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:18.800]   Yeah.
[02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:19.800]   So far.
[02:37:19.800 --> 02:37:25.040]   Ladies and gentlemen, the last thing I'd ever have thought we'd have a recommendation.
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:28.280]   Yeah, that kind of blew me out of the water.
[02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:32.080]   By the way, do you know, Anne, that there is Bridgerton in the musical?
[02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:33.080]   No, thank you.
[02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:34.080]   It was on TikTok.
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:35.720]   How about you said to yourself?
[02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:36.720]   I got sued.
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:38.920]   But yeah, you're Stacy, you're right.
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:40.320]   It's the perfect story.
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:43.520]   It's a musical and it's TikTok and it's "ant."
[02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:44.520]   No.
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:45.520]   It's everything Anne loves.
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:47.120]   Why can't I just show you more bridges?
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:48.120]   No.
[02:37:48.120 --> 02:37:49.120]   Yeah, next.
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:50.120]   I got you.
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:53.040]   I'm trying to get you.
[02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:55.040]   Wow, I didn't even think of this.
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:38:00.600]   This is Bridgerton and it's a bridge.
[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:02.600]   Here's a link IRC.
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:04.400]   All right.
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:07.000]   Here's one for Discord.
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:14.840]   Yeah, put the link in so I can show the picture of the queen in her court and you can see.
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:15.840]   Yeah.
[02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:16.840]   That's a cute photo.
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:17.840]   Yeah, she's really cute.
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:21.480]   I saw a picture of you and her with somebody famous.
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:22.960]   I didn't know who that was.
[02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:24.720]   Oh, fortune, fortune themester.
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:28.520]   I don't know why she popped in my head but a couple of years ago, actually, it was right
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:29.680]   before we moved out here.
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:35.480]   We went to our favorite coffee house and the comedian fortune themester just walks in,
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:39.360]   was having a coffee and telling funny stories.
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:40.360]   It was delightful.
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:41.360]   Why did he recognize?
[02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:43.040]   Yeah, there's a great picture.
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:44.040]   Is it on instant?
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:45.400]   Maybe it's Twitter.
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:46.400]   Twitter.
[02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:48.240]   Great picture of you, the three.
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:52.920]   She was just as cool as they come as they come, man.
[02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:57.160]   She also lives there in North Carolina, a part up in the mountains, I believe.
[02:38:57.160 --> 02:38:59.760]   I am not familiar with her work.
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:02.360]   She's a funny, funny, funny comedian.
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:03.360]   Did I tweet it?
[02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:04.360]   I thought I tweeted it.
[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:05.360]   I'm sorry.
[02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:08.840]   Was she the Southern blonde lady?
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:09.840]   Yes.
[02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:10.840]   Yes.
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:11.840]   Yes.
[02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:12.840]   She's hilarious.
[02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:13.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:14.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:19.080]   There, copy, copy, paste.
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:20.080]   There.
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:21.080]   There you go.
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:26.680]   I felt very out of the loop because I never, look at that.
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:29.360]   That's a better picture of Queen Pruitt, frankly.
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:30.480]   It is too, yeah.
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:32.800]   She looks just like the Bridgerton woman there.
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:34.040]   Yeah, she does.
[02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:42.200]   So it's fortune themester, Queen Charlotte and the Ant Man and some bald, black guy.
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:44.080]   Yeah, that's me.
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:48.480]   We do this fabulous show every Wednesday.
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:52.440]   It's kind of just fun to get together with your friends and talking about stuff.
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:53.800]   It's round about media.
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:55.640]   We love talking about media here.
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:39:56.640]   Excuse me.
[02:39:56.640 --> 02:39:58.440]   You've been eating waffles.
[02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:00.440]   Talking about media.
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:01.440]   And I'm all.
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:07.560]   I came here to eat waffles and kick ass and I'm all out of waffles.
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:13.880]   The show every Tuesday or Wednesday, I should say 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern.
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:16.400]   You can watch us do it at live.twit.tv.
[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:17.480]   There's audio and video there.
[02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:19.720]   So watch or listen while you're doing that.
[02:40:19.720 --> 02:40:22.440]   Chat with us at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:23.640]   That's open all.
[02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:28.600]   Of course, we also have the, what do they call it in a racetrack?
[02:40:28.600 --> 02:40:32.880]   The, with the elite people hang out the country club area.
[02:40:32.880 --> 02:40:33.880]   Winner's circle.
[02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:34.880]   It's the box.
[02:40:34.880 --> 02:40:35.880]   The box.
[02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:36.880]   The club.
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:37.880]   The club.
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:38.880]   The club.
[02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:39.880]   The club level.
[02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:40.880]   Yeah.
[02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:41.880]   A club.
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:42.880]   Twit.
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:43.880]   The racetrack.
[02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:45.200]   This is only seven bucks a month.
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:46.200]   It's cheap.
[02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:47.200]   Yes.
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:48.200]   And what do you get?
[02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:50.800]   You get ad free versions of every single show plus shows we don't put out in public
[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:55.800]   like hands on Macintosh, hands on Windows, the Antitel Linux show, Stacey's book club.
[02:40:55.800 --> 02:41:00.000]   You also get, that's the Twit plus feed with stuff that happens before and after every
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.840]   show and you also get access to the box seats.
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:06.720]   That's the discord.
[02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:08.120]   Wonderful group of people.
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:09.280]   Always fun.
[02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:10.960]   Chatting.
[02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:12.920]   Sometimes we talk about tech.
[02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:16.680]   Sometimes we talk about other nerd pursuits like cooking.
[02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:19.360]   Sometimes Joe Esposito shares interesting memes with us.
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:20.360]   I love Joe.
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:21.360]   He's great.
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:22.360]   We got two Joe's in there.
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:29.900]   A lot of fun gaming, hacking, ham radio science, sports, travel, all the topics you
[02:41:29.900 --> 02:41:31.400]   might be interested in.
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:36.160]   This is the future I think of a social is as a.
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:37.920]   Could you do virtual trivia?
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:39.280]   Like, can we do like?
[02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:40.280]   We have a trip.
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:41.480]   Go to Let's Play.
[02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:44.000]   There is a trivia game.
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:45.000]   You could play it.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.320]   Yes, against other people even.
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:48.320]   It's in the Let's Play set.
[02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:49.520]   There's a lot of stuff in there.
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:52.080]   Right there under fun and games.
[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:56.400]   So what was the name of singer Frank Ocean's second studio album?
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:41:57.400]   Do you know?
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:41:58.400]   Nobody got.
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:41:59.400]   Right.
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:00.600]   So we can all play this together.
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:01.600]   Off white.
[02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:05.040]   No, that's a brand.
[02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:06.360]   So this is, yeah, this is fun.
[02:42:06.360 --> 02:42:07.640]   It's like better than Jeopardy.
[02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:08.640]   You can all play a trivia.
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:11.240]   You are allowed to sell your soul on eBay.
[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:12.240]   False.
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:13.240]   True.
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:14.240]   False.
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:15.240]   False.
[02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:16.240]   You cannot sell your soul.
[02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:18.680]   There is also a chess game.
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:19.680]   There's a mid journey.
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:21.960]   We have our own little mid journey channel.
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:27.280]   So you can share your wordle scores to keep them out of Jeff Jarvis's feed.
[02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:28.280]   Oh.
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:29.280]   And then if you do.
[02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:30.640]   I still play wordle.
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:33.880]   If you do want to play on the Minecraft server, go on to the Let's Play server and I
[02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:36.800]   will add all these people are asking to be added.
[02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:37.800]   I apologize.
[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:40.560]   I will go home and add them.
[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:41.560]   Get the work.
[02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:42.560]   Get the work.
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:44.160]   Get the work.
[02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:48.360]   And I will update to the latest Minecraft to 1.20.
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:52.640]   I didn't see that came out.
[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:53.640]   Seven bucks a month.
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:54.880]   Look at what you get.
[02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:56.520]   You get a whole life.
[02:42:56.520 --> 02:42:57.520]   Get content.
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:42:59.160]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:42:59.160 --> 02:43:05.120]   And you also get this kind of satisfying feeling that you're helping us basically stick around.
[02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:06.120]   Yep.
[02:43:06.120 --> 02:43:09.120]   Keeps the lights on even the ones that flicker in the background.
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:10.120]   Yep.
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:11.120]   Keeps perk up in the rafters.
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:14.360]   Honestly, we really need the support.
[02:43:14.360 --> 02:43:17.480]   So thank you for those of you who have already joined it.
[02:43:17.480 --> 02:43:21.320]   Those of you who are not yet members, Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:43:21.320 --> 02:43:28.960]   After the show is done, we hastily edit it and put it out on the website, Twit.tv/twig.
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:30.080]   We put it up on YouTube.
[02:43:30.080 --> 02:43:32.920]   There's a This Week in Google channel on YouTube.
[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:37.560]   Next way to get it though, subscribe to This Week in Google and your favorite podcast player.
[02:43:37.560 --> 02:43:40.480]   We have a few links at the website, but you can also just go to your, you know, go to
[02:43:40.480 --> 02:43:45.680]   Overcast or PocketCasts or Google, whatever it is that you use for podcasts and search
[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:46.680]   for Twig.
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:47.680]   You'll find it right away.
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:50.640]   Even though this is This Week in Google, I do not recommend Google Podcasts.
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:51.640]   Sorry.
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:53.360]   It's not the best.
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:54.960]   Apple has updated their podcast.
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:57.320]   They're talking a little bit about that at the event.
[02:43:57.320 --> 02:44:00.120]   Anyway, whatever you use, I like, what do you use?
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:01.120]   I use PocketCasts.
[02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:05.000]   So I use my friend's passion project called PlayaPod.
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:06.400]   Oh, yeah, PlayaPod.
[02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:07.400]   Yeah.
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:08.400]   That's a good one.
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:09.400]   It doesn't matter.
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:10.400]   You just look for us.
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:11.400]   We'll be there.
[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:12.400]   Yep, we're there.
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:13.400]   And then you get it and you don't have to think about it.
[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:15.080]   There's audio and video of every episode.
[02:44:15.080 --> 02:44:16.080]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:17.080]   Higginbotham.
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:20.560]   Stacey on IOT.com is her website.
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:24.080]   The podcast with Kevin Toefel is there every week.
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:26.440]   Great stuff.
[02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:29.160]   Anything else you want to plug, Stacey?
[02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:31.080]   That's so much.
[02:44:31.080 --> 02:44:32.320]   That's all we have to say.
[02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:34.200]   Thank you for being here.
[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:41.200]   Aunt Pruitt is at auntpruit.com and his prints are at pruit.com/prince.
[02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:42.920]   He's on the Twitter @_pruit.
[02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:44.720]   And you do tweet quite a bit.
[02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:45.720]   Yeah.
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:47.440]   Some of you are trying to automate it.
[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:49.320]   But yeah, I tweet.
[02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:50.320]   Yeah.
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:51.320]   He's a tweeter.
[02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:52.320]   Look at that.
[02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:53.320]   It's all about the hard hit.
[02:44:53.320 --> 02:44:54.320]   Just showcases, baby.
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:55.320]   Look at this.
[02:44:55.320 --> 02:44:56.320]   Man, I would...
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:44:57.320]   Shh.
[02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:59.400]   I'd sign that boy so quick.
[02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:00.400]   Come on.
[02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:02.720]   I'm going to college freshman class next year.
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:03.720]   Come on, hardhead.
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:04.720]   Come on.
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:05.720]   Come on, Jacob.
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:06.720]   Come on.
[02:45:06.720 --> 02:45:07.720]   Look at that.
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:08.720]   Nice.
[02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:09.720]   Beautiful pass.
[02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:10.720]   Good footwork.
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:16.480]   Because Aunt Pruitt doesn't have the cash to pay for college.
[02:45:16.480 --> 02:45:18.160]   Now they're going to think, "I don't pay you."
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:20.040]   No, it ain't that.
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:22.520]   Most people don't have the cash to pay for college.
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:24.240]   Oh, it's really tragic.
[02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:25.240]   Yeah.
[02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:27.840]   Thank you, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[02:45:27.840 --> 02:45:30.360]   Let's not forget Jeff as the director of the town.
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:34.240]   Tonight's Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark.
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:40.680]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:42.040]   And coming out later this month.
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:45.320]   The Gutenberg parenthesis at goonbergprenthesis.com.
[02:45:45.320 --> 02:45:46.320]   Get your copy.
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:47.320]   You're 29.
[02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:48.840]   Pre-order it soon.
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:50.320]   Jeff, stay inside.
[02:45:50.320 --> 02:45:52.240]   I worry about you with that smoke.
[02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:53.240]   Yeah, it goes like...
[02:45:53.240 --> 02:45:55.240]   It's why the inside is orange now.
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:57.040]   It is a little orangey.
[02:45:57.040 --> 02:45:58.040]   Is the eargy?
[02:45:58.040 --> 02:45:59.040]   Oh, it's just the...
[02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:00.040]   Yeah.
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:01.040]   Let's just change that.
[02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:02.040]   Okay.
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:03.040]   Yeah.
[02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:04.040]   Yeah.
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:05.040]   Stay safe.
[02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:06.040]   There, that's better.
[02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:07.040]   Yeah.
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:08.040]   Ooh.
[02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:09.040]   He fixed it.
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:10.040]   You said nasal wash.
[02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:12.040]   That won't help your lungs, but it'll help your sinuses.
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:13.040]   Tell me about that.
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:14.040]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:15.040]   I do...
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:18.040]   We have the thing where you squeeze an nitty pie.
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:19.040]   The nitty...
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:21.040]   It's like a nitty pie goes up one way and comes down the other.
[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:22.040]   Yeah.
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:23.040]   And you go, "Ow!"
[02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:24.040]   That was a great magical.
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:25.040]   But it cleans you.
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:26.040]   Yeah, the saline spray.
[02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:27.040]   Yeah.
[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:28.040]   I don't spray.
[02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:29.040]   Why do you go for a full nitty?
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:30.040]   Yeah.
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:31.040]   I hose it out.
[02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:33.040]   They're just me...
[02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:37.040]   That's a visual.
[02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:38.040]   Okay.
[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:41.040]   A little too much information.
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:43.040]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:46.040]   We'll have a fun time next week.
[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:50.040]   I won't be here because I will have drowned myself with my nitty pie.
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:51.040]   Thanks for watching.
[02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:53.040]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:54.040]   Bye-bye.
[02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:57.040]   Hose it out.
