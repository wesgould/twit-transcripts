[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   You know, we use the word Google very loosely in this title.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Anything we want to talk about, right?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Right.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Hey, look who's here, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   He's not pink.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   My camera's usually making me very pink, but I'm not seeing him alive.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Jeff is in town.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   It's nice to have him Jeff Jarvis, Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York, the author of Public Parts and what would Gutenberg do?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   No, no, that's another book you haven't written yet.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   No, it's good to have you.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I've got a good smith to see you.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   It's wonderful to be here.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I love being here with my guy.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And you have brought your boss.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Sarah Bartlett is also here currently the Dean of the School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   But I was just, first of all, somebody in the chat room said, "Oh, Sarah's book is great.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You've got to read the money machine."
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   That's nice.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   So you have fans.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I've had at least one fan out there.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   This is the story of the guys who invented the leverage buyout practically, Colberg, Kravis and Roberts.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And really the beginning of the end of the financial markets.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   But it also says here that you were a reporter at Fortune Business Week in the New York Times,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Assistant Managing Editor Business Week for six years and after in Chief of Oxygen Media.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   That's all true.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   They didn't lie.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   No, it's actually accurate.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   When did you go into academia?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I started at Baruch College, which is part of the City University Network in 2002.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   You decided that journalism was over or I guess not six years.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   No, I needed an income that was steady and stable.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   You needed a job.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   You chose academia.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Well anyway, that's great.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Was it your inspiration to bring Jeff?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I can take no credit for it.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   He was the first professor hired at the school and I was the second.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Oh, perfect.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I could thank him maybe for not shutting the door on me.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   That's great to have you.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Now the tables have turned and I can inflict whatever pain I like.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So it's nice to have you both in studio and we're going to ask what you're doing out here.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Besides fleeing the snow.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Which is not fled.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   She's bundled up in mom's basement.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I am.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Hello.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Hi, Gina.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I'm doing a podcast from my mother's basement.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Yes.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   I'm owning it.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   You're leaving my mom's chashis up here.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   With the jets, the jets, like it again, please.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Oh, yeah, the jets flow.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   It's all the way across the room.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I'm surrounded here by all my mom's pictures and my mom loves me and I'm here in her house.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I'm in the property of all this is mom is in Florida.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Yeah, mom is in Florida.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   She's like, are you watering the plants honey?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Okay.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   There's extra snow boots in the in the closet.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Make sure you lock the door at night.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So when we left you last week, you were running off to buy your house in Park Slope.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Is that done?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Yes, I was.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   It is done.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   The closing is done.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I am officially very much in debt, happily in debt and responsible for shoveling the snow tomorrow,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   which would be fun.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   You forgot about that part.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Brand new homeowner, really, really excited.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   We're not quite moved in yet because our stuff is still in a truck or getting loaded into
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   a truck on its way from San Diego, but we'll be moved in soon.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And yeah, it's going to be there's a lot of home improvements in my future.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   So I'm very excited.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Well, here we are gathered together.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I think we're going to spend a little more time than we usually do talking about journalism
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   the future.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Oh, oh, watch out.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Watch out.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Get the coffee now.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   No, I love this stuff.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.640]   And as I watch NBC botch the Olympics yet one more time, spending more time on Bob Costas's
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.000]   pink eye than on some of the stories in the Olympics.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   That's what that is.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   It's so disgusting.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.500]   It really is.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.760]   This morning on the Today Show, they actually interviewed him about his pink eye.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.000]   And I thought this is not news.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   No.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.800]   Anyway, I guess when it's the Olympics, it's not news either.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.200]   And they edited the opening ceremony again in two ways.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.560]   I didn't know the CAP called me.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.280]   They took out the human rights statement from the opening.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.280]   Interesting.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.280]   Which is a problem.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.320]   They did the same thing in the London Olympics where they bollocks it up.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.320]   Why do they do that?
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.320]   Oh, because it's too boring for Americans.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.320]   That's what I thought.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.320]   I guess.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.000]   They also took out the police choir.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.480]   So this made me mad because Lisa said, hey, did you see the Russian police choir singing
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.480]   Daff Punk?
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.080]   I said, I saw them singing the Russian national anthem.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.520]   What do you mean Daff Punk?
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.520]   She said, no, they did.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.680]   I said, no, that's a match up.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.000]   She said, no, they did.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.800]   And yes, online, you can see it, but it was not on TV.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.040]   OK, so I wasn't crazy.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.040]   You weren't crazy.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.040]   I thought, what the hell?
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.040]   The Associated Press called me to talk about this and said, and they were trying to think
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.040]   that out.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.320]   I think it was just a dumb mistake because they said it got millions of views on YouTube.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.880]   And so they said, they don't understand their audience.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.880]   They don't.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.880]   They don't.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.880]   How could you miss that?
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.360]   Plus, the great thing about all these things, it's these, and I say this with no disparagement,
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.080]   but it's these gay moments in the Olympics that you want to celebrate.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.040]   You want to say, come on, guys.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.360]   I just thought it was really funny because this is the Russian police choir.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.080]   I presume these are all policemen.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.560]   They certainly have the greatest hats of the world.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.320]   The big, big, big Russian police hats.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.680]   Chad, look at the floor now.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.120]   They're wonderful.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.200]   And then what you see is you see the younger guys are really getting into Daff Punk.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   Right.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.440]   I don't know if they understand the lyrics.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.440]   I'm here to get lucky.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.600]   I'm going to stay all night to get lucky.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.520]   What's hard to understand about that?
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.800]   Maybe it didn't translate.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.360]   I mean, this is a song about getting laid.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.320]   Anyway, there's singing that.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.480]   And then the older guys who are clearly, you know, Gorbachev, or maybe even Khrushchev,
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:11.640]   or knows what they've done, are kind of like standing there like puzzled and maybe a little
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.640]   put out.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.640]   It's fascinating.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.960]   It's fun to watch and why NBC cut that out.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.640]   Well, they have this chance to edit the whole thing.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.640]   Pardon me?
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.640]   Wasn't there also a technical glitch where one of the rings that the lit rings didn't open?
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.640]   Yes.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.640]   And did they edit in the version from the rest of the show?
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.640]   The Russians did.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.160]   Putin asked NBC to Photoshop the ring, and NBC, at least in this respect, said no.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.160]   Yes.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.760]   At least chose some integrity and said no.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.840]   However, the official Russian version included the rings opening up from the rehearsal instead
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.840]   of the failed ring.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.840]   Right.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.840]   Where it worked.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.840]   Okay.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.840]   So we saw the t-shirts.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.840]   Yes.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.040]   And the jokes about the jokes about the fifth ring came out.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.440]   There we have.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.540]   Okay.
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.720]   This is the Russian police choir.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.500]   You can turn it up a little bit because I think we should enjoy it.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.980]   We should all enjoy it.
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.320]   Daff Punk is performed by a hundred straight Russian policemen.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.320]   So for that one...
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.840]   Well, this is the only clip that I have.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   Everything else has been taken down by...
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.840]   Oh, really?
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.840]   By Daff Punk?
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   So like, you know, this version...
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   That's why NBC didn't show it.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.840]   This looks like the full version.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.840]   It was a rights issue.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.840]   It was a rights issue.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.840]   Okay.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.840]   It was a rights issue.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.840]   Of course.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   So my...
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.500]   Okay, this isn't really this week in Google at this point, but what the hell?
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:34.060]   Am I wrong in seeing a little bit of bias on the part of American media, anti-Russian
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.060]   bias?
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:40.220]   I'm thinking of before the Olympics began the Sochi problems, Twitter feed and all of
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.220]   these...
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.220]   Canadian did that.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.220]   Let's be clear.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.220]   But many of these pictures turned out to be spurious.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.580]   Many of these stories turned out to be spurious.
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.100]   And then it seems like even as we've gone through the Olympics, there's kind of this...
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.420]   Maybe it's hereditary because they were our enemies for so long during the Cold War.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.600]   Maybe it has...
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.320]   I think nominally it has to do with the anti-gay propaganda.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.320]   I think not.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.360]   I don't think Putin is beloved.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.360]   I think...
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.800]   It seems like a strong bias.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   It seems like a strong bias.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.440]   It's really in PR timing to be in the US.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.440]   And on Colbert, did you see...
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.440]   Was he right on Colbert?
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.440]   Oh, I didn't.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.440]   Oh, that was amazing.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.440]   Amazing.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.440]   Amazing.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.440]   Do they sing?
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.440]   What do they do?
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.440]   How you can be funny in simultaneous translation.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.440]   That's awesome.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.840]   And they both sides of it did it.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.840]   It's amazing.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.840]   It's just amazing.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   Wow.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.840]   So...
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.100]   I'm a little bit more than a real surprise that we would have somewhat of a negative slant
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.100]   on that.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.100]   I've got to admit emotionally I'm rooting against Putin.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.100]   Yeah.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.100]   You know?
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.060]   And that's the only story about it.
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.060]   It's so warm there.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.580]   Everything's terrible.
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.580]   The hotel handles felt...
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.940]   By the way, we didn't hear anything more after the Olympics started about Hotel Door
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.940]   Handy falling off.
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.940]   It just stopped.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.940]   Maybe they're not working.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.940]   Maybe they fixed it.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.940]   Yeah.
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.940]   So I don't...
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.420]   Well, the greatest story is that it was the lose guy who had a break through the door.
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.420]   Yeah.
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.420]   Punch the door.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.420]   Punch the door right.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.420]   I think that reflects worse on us than it is.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.420]   I think it does.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.420]   I think you're right.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.420]   The door won't happen.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.420]   Pow!
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:07.580]   Anyway, there's not a whole lot of stories there except there is one tech story there
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.180]   which was that Richard Engel, who normally I think is a very good correspondent at NBC,
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.860]   did a story which seemed to me to fail one of the critical tenets of good journalism.
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.940]   You tell me, Sarah Bartlett, you're a...
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.740]   The Dean of Journalism.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.660]   It sounded like he went into the story knowing what it was going to be about, knowing what
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.620]   story he wanted to tell in the face of all facts.
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.580]   He told it and they did it with editing.
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:36.380]   So this is the story he did about hacking hackers in Russia.
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.620]   The premise of the story going in was if you bring a...
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.860]   Don't bring any electronics to Russia because it will be hacked immediately.
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.460]   Now he did mention that we're not in Sochi.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.120]   We're in Moscow a thousand plus miles away.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.620]   They brought in a guy from an antivirus company which right there is probably a mistake but
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.180]   he's a technical expert.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.240]   He set up a Windows machine and a Mac machine, no updates.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.500]   They also got an Android phone.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.580]   What happened, although you didn't see it on camera was, he had Richard Engel go to malicious
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:17.020]   sites on the Windows and the Mac machine download and run software.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.060]   What they showed on screen was...
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.060]   He didn't do anything.
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.840]   It just turned on the computer and now it's hacked.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.440]   Now maybe our Android fans will understand even better on this.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.840]   He had him in the Android phone go to the setting, you know that setting, Gina, where
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.440]   you check the box that says allow third party downloads.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.440]   He unchecked that box or not checked by default.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   He checked it.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.480]   And it gets a big warning.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.920]   This could be dangerous.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.760]   And then he went and downloaded known malicious app.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.760]   Okay.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.580]   And then all of this is edited out.
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.020]   Then he shows that he's been hacked.
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:59.400]   So in other words, he did stupid things on all three systems, known stupid things and
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.440]   edited out the doing of them.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.120]   And by the way, you could do this sitting right here, every one of those.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.740]   It has nothing to do with Russia or Russia hackers.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.540]   So it felt like a hit piece.
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.340]   I think Engel is a better journalist than that.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.940]   A little lack of transparency to what he was doing.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.940]   Yeah.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:26.180]   One of the reasons we know what he did is because the trend micro guy expert, I think
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.460]   felt guilty about it and blogged at all.
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.460]   Oh, is that?
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:34.900]   Oh, by the way, here's what really happened.
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.140]   That's a bad precedent to set where I'm going to prove a story true and I'm going to edit
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.300]   my piece to make it.
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.300]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.300]   And then I'm going to hide my tracks.
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.940]   They have to this day, as far as I know, not in any way apologize despite a lot of criticism,
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.940]   not only from us, but from security experts, the trend micro expert and others.
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:56.420]   So although a lot of people felt like the worst part was, go ahead and show this chat,
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.340]   him ripping the box up.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.460]   Richard Engel apparently doesn't understand.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.500]   Open a MacBook Air box.
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.900]   He tore into it like a Zafet ex package.
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.900]   Oh, that's just wrong.
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:11.900]   That's wrong.
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.900]   That's aesthetically violating.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.900]   Oh.
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.940]   That's where the big cringe factor was.
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:18.940]   I don't know.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.940]   I guess we can't.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:20.940]   That's fine.
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.180]   We can't find that.
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:28.580]   I just, I feel like to me, this is part of a larger pattern of let's figure out how to
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.220]   make Russia look as bad as possible.
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.780]   Well, is it also a way to make technology look bad too?
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.780]   Is it?
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.420]   Oh, it's a chance to scare people about our dangerous technology.
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.420]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.420]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.420]   I don't know.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.420]   I think it's sort of broader than that.
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.860]   I think there's sort of failures of journalism that we see every day.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.340]   And we just happen to notice them more because everybody's focusing on the Olympics.
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.780]   But these are problems that we see across the board.
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.780]   This is a bad journalism.
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.020]   That's a standard operating procedure for networks.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.780]   Oh, is that hurt?
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.860]   Oh, he just tore it open the box.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.140]   No, no, no, these are carefully made.
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:08.260]   There's 20 designers who designed that back box flap.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.260]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.260]   All right.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.740]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.300]   There's not much more to say about that.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.300]   It's not really.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.780]   It's TV news socks.
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:17.780]   Yeah, it's pretty bad.
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:18.780]   That's pretty much what it is.
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.820]   It also is kind of a truism that if you are an expert in a field and you watch television's
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.260]   version of it, it will always be wrong and confused.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.940]   Well, that's also the news magazine problem, I think.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.780]   Whenever I bought a Time magazine thing, and oh, I'll be interested in that cover story
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.100]   because this is what I know.
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.180]   Of course, it was always just the stones given water.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.180]   Yeah.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.620]   Well, there's a good example time.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.540]   I just published an article about quantum computing in which they, you know, kind of
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.140]   say, this is going to change the world as soon as they can make it work.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.140]   It's just like cold fusion.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.140]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.140]   As soon as I'm going to invent it, will you let me know?
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.380]   And then we'll talk about what it can do.
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.380]   All right.
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.780]   Let's continue on.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.780]   It's interesting.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:01.500]   Actually, Google had a little bit of a response to the anti-gay propaganda law in Russia.
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.740]   They changed their homepage.
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:03.740]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.740]   As big as they rarely do.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.740]   No way, Bob.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:06.740]   No way, Bob.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.740]   You think that's what it was?
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.740]   It was about that.
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.980]   Well, it's presumed, you know what, though, I looked at it again and it's not, is it really
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.980]   the rainbow colors?
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:14.980]   It is the rainbow.
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:15.980]   I actually figured it out.
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:16.980]   Yes.
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:17.980]   Red, orange, yellow, blue, green, indigo, violet.
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.980]   What?
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.980]   Right.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.980]   But it's a little subtle.
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:21.980]   A little subtle.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:22.980]   I thought that might be the Google colors.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:23.980]   Is that the Google colors?
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.980]   No.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:25.980]   No.
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.620]   I wonder whether it was the colors of sport tabs or something, but no, that would be the
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.620]   case.
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.620]   So yeah, it's the rainbow.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.620]   It's the rainbow.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.740]   And what country was it war rainbow uniforms?
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.620]   Germany, although they said that that was...
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.620]   We just liked the rainbow.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.620]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.620]   It's not a...
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.620]   It's not a...
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.620]   It would be ugly.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.620]   We just feel that it...
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.140]   Yeah, if we had to compete with Ralph Orleans, ugly sweater.
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.580]   So we had to do something ugly.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.980]   There it is.
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.220]   They are really ugly.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.740]   There's a great Twitter handle nine.
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.900]   And he went crazy on this.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.220]   What has happened to Germany?
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.220]   The nine...
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:05.580]   I thought the German skaters had lovely little shifts.
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.580]   That's my thought.
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.580]   Hey, good news.
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.580]   Here it is.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.580]   A Nexus 7.
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.420]   Jeff Jarvis can finally use his on the Verizon network.
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.660]   Well, we'll see.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.660]   Because they're now going to sell...
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.660]   What?
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.660]   I'm not saying no.
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.660]   They've announced...
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.660]   Finally, they're going to sell them.
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.660]   Or I think it's been leaked that they're going to sell them.
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.140]   What I don't know is when I walk in with my Nexus 7 that I didn't buy there...
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.140]   Oh, they won't.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.140]   I don't know.
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.140]   That's my last test.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.580]   What are they going to do?
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.580]   Six months.
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.820]   Six friggin' months.
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.580]   They took these bozos to say that this works on their network.
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.500]   When it takes two seconds to put a friggin' sim in and it works fine.
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.500]   You...
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.460]   Okay, my request, Jeff, is that you wear Google Glass.
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.460]   And you mean this interaction live.
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.220]   Hey, this is what you're talking about in your Medium series.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.260]   I want you to stream this interaction with the Verizon salesperson live on Google+.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.420]   Okay, please.
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.780]   And let us know beforehand what time it's going to be so we can all take it.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.380]   Sometimes I just see what happens.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:08.380]   Do you approach the FCC?
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:13.260]   I have a plane on file with the FCC, which I still think is valid because Verizon did
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.260]   not.
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:21.860]   It took six months to maybe follow the dictates of the auction for LTE Spectrum.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:27.700]   So this was part of their agreement that if they were to buy the 700 MHz Spectrum, the
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.620]   C-band, that they would be an open network on that band.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.500]   And Google, don't forget, forced that.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:39.380]   When Google entered into the auction for that Spectrum, Google put in the requirements
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.700]   for openness and then pulled out.
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.340]   That's why Verizon got it.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.980]   So they didn't follow the dictates.
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.300]   And I think they should still be punished.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.900]   The FCC's response to you was, "We'll look into it."
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.900]   Silence.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.900]   Nothing.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.900]   Nothing.
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.900]   Not done.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:54.900]   They didn't respond at all.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.900]   Nothing.
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:56.900]   Oh.
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.900]   They get so many letters from Jeff, it's probably a Jeff.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.900]   Put it in the job as basket.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.380]   You know what that is, right?
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.380]   Yeah.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.380]   It's a fun file.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.380]   That's not in priority inbox.
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.380]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:10.020]   I'm not going to say where it was in our trip here.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:17.460]   I've heard of a startup in a technology company in this area that tries to ban garbage cans.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.460]   Okay, why?
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.580]   I guess because there's too much garbage.
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.060]   Too much garbage.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.060]   Okay.
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.780]   But that doesn't eliminate the garbage.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.140]   It's just the place to put it.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.100]   Well, the person who told me said it kind of motivates you.
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.940]   You get that Mac.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.100]   Maybe you think about tearing the box off before you take it in the office.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.820]   You don't have to throw it away because you can't find somebody to throw it away.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.420]   So you throw it away at home.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.420]   I know.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.420]   It doesn't alleviate the garbage.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.420]   No, it doesn't.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.420]   Or you throw it on the floor.
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.140]   I mean, garbage, maybe it's not a horrible addition on every email.
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.140]   Think before you print.
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.140]   Then.
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.140]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.140]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.140]   Oh.
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.140]   I hate that.
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.140]   I hate that.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.140]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.140]   First of all, who the hell prints email?
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.140]   Somebody, apparently.
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.780]   That's a single person who's sending you the email is not very savvy.
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.780]   Yes.
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:57.780]   Yes.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.740]   William Randolph first the third.
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.140]   He used to send him an email.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.340]   His secretary would print it.
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.340]   Bring it to him.
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.340]   He's very technically.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.340]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.340]   But this was just like service.
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.340]   I know people like that.
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:09.340]   Yeah.
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.700]   And then he read it and he's write a response and then she'd go type it.
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.780]   I think he's gone behind beyond that by the way now.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.740]   I think he actually uses email now.
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.300]   Well, it's a good friend.
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.300]   So I'll report back.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:25.020]   I will go into a Verizon store and I will report back.
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.100]   Someone should tap it.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.100]   Someone should tape it.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.100]   You're absolutely right.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.780]   Gina Google Glass.
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.100]   I think I mentioned last week that I talked to somebody from the team after my rant about
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.100]   that.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.100]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.020]   And I'm seeing the team in Mountain View on Friday.
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.180]   Oh, excellent.
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.180]   So I'll see about that.
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.180]   That could be a little uncomfortable.
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.180]   They're more responsive than the FCC.
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.180]   That's darn true.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.180]   Oh, darn true.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:51.260]   I got priced my lenses for the Google Glass $435.
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.260]   Yikes.
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.420]   So it's $250 for the frame.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.420]   $250 for the frame.
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.820]   $1500 for the glass.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:57.980]   And $435.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.980]   You add it up.
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.300]   It's like $2300, something like that.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.300]   For a pair of glasses.
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.300]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.540]   Last night we had Jacob Applebaum on all about Android.
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.980]   And he just got his custom frames.
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.300]   And he got his lens fitted.
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.900]   And he has his V2 glass.
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:13.900]   And he loves it.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.900]   He does.
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.900]   So yeah.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.620]   So I've heard our viewers to back to the last week's show to hear your rant.
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.900]   Jacob, Jacob, somebody I got to listen to.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.140]   Yeah, to your credit, Gina said, hey, well, Jeff hates them.
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.900]   You should watch Twig and see.
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.780]   But Jeff said all the things that you did.
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.540]   I mean, Jacob said all the things that you did like Jason.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.260]   Sorry, Jason Applebaum.
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.260]   Jason Applebaum.
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.500]   Like he said, they shouldn't bend because one side wouldn't bend and the other side
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.980]   would and that would be crazy.
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.980]   You know, the.
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.380]   He liked the gigantic five gallon case.
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.820]   We didn't talk about the case.
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.420]   You know, he's a pretty, he's been a talk to the developers and he's kind of, he's an
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.700]   engineer really himself.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.500]   So I think that he has and he has empathy for the developers and how difficult a problem
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:01.020]   it is to install a hinge, for example, in the electronics, which is obviously not something
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.900]   that a user or consumer should worry about.
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.700]   And he did say that, you know, when it's at the point that it's a consumer product, it
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.700]   absolutely, you know, the arms should bend.
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.740]   There has to be a better solution than what they have right now.
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:15.900]   But he was sort of marveling at the fact that they were able to get it as far as they have
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.900]   for now.
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.460]   So this is just one hell of a Newton.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.460]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.460]   Still hold up.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.580]   What happens when when Jeff wears glass into the office?
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.580]   Do you throw him out?
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.780]   Not at all, but people want to borrow them all the time.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.780]   Really?
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.780]   Yeah.
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.060]   My students are cr- in fact, my son told me don't come home if I don't have a good
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.060]   about.
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.460]   It's all just swag store.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.460]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.340]   I keep telling him, I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.340]   Yeah.
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:43.780]   I'm of the opinion Google will never make a consumer product of this.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.620]   I think this is more like Google 411 where they're collecting data, but it's a, it's
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.700]   a such a prototype.
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.860]   I think there's so many problems associated with it.
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.420]   I can't imagine Google trying to sell this as a consumer product.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.420]   Social experiment.
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.500]   Yeah, not even that.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.820]   I mean, you know, Google wants data.
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.980]   And I think they get from this.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.740]   Well, they're going to, how people use wearables, what the reaction is to various form factors.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:07.740]   You saw now Google.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.980]   They would only do that if they wanted to sell something into the consumer market that
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:11.980]   was a wearable.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.460]   Well, remember that data to Google is valuable in many ways besides an actual product.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.420]   If somebody else makes the wearable, are they happy with that?
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.420]   Are they pushed?
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.420]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:24.660]   But, and Google, we just learned this week does have a patent on a watch.
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.780]   And apparently it's fairly close to market according to some rumors.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.500]   So I don't think Google necessarily, what's going to be special about the Google one?
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.500]   I think, here's what I think.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.740]   I think Google believes wearables will happen.
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:40.500]   Google, the special will be apparently the Google now cards on the watch.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.100]   So Google now on a watch, it'd be actually much more valuable than anything Apple could
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.100]   do, I think.
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.100]   Absolutely.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:50.420]   Google now and rich notifications, the way that they appear in your pull down shade on
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.420]   your phone.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.340]   I bet that those are going to be integrated into the watch seamlessly that developers
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.340]   wouldn't even have to make a change the way their apps work.
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.940]   So, you need to know excited she's ordering right now.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.940]   Exactly.
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.460]   So I don't think Google necessarily wants to make a commitment in the wearable space.
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.060]   They just acknowledge that there is going to be a wearable space and they want to know
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.900]   how do we, this is the smart thing to do.
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.060]   Remember a lot of companies got bit by mobile.
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.060]   They understood how to do a search on the desktop.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.380]   They understood Facebook and I understood how to do Facebook and the desktop and then
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:22.540]   mobile happened and much faster than anybody predicted all of the traffic went mobile.
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.340]   And these companies were caught with their pants down, oh my God, how do we make it work
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.620]   on mobile?
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:31.820]   So assuming that wearable might be the next thing, what do we need to do at Google?
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.140]   We need to know everything we can know about how people use it, about what people want,
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.260]   about what works for people.
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.260]   And push the market.
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.260]   And push the market.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.260]   That's the one with that.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.140]   Which is the argument being made about Motorola now.
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.300]   They used it for the time necessary to push Samsung and company.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.300]   They did and it worked.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.300]   And it worked.
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.300]   They got what they wanted.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.300]   They always do.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.220]   I, for one, welcome by new masters in Mountain View.
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.020]   The Nest acquisition has gone through now.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:59.380]   They're officially the makers of the Nest thermostat and the Nest smoke detectors.
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.700]   So they are in the hardware business.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.100]   And that's a consumer product.
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.100]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.620]   But I mean, this is kind of new to Google.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.900]   I know, I mean, I guess Nexus was a consumer product.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.860]   These are consumer products, these tablets, the Nexus phones.
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.860]   Do you think Matt cuts was saying last week that he would hope that Nexus doesn't go
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.860]   away?
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:18.860]   Right.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:19.860]   What do you think?
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:20.860]   What's your prediction about this?
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:26.300]   I guess this is the same conversation, which is does Google want to be a product manufacturer,
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.260]   which has its downsides?
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.260]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:34.300]   Or does Google just want to understand these products to better do what they do best?
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.300]   Which is more important.
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.340]   This is my question for Matt and my question, and I've said this before, which is more
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.020]   important to Google, Android or Nexus.
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.380]   And they're not going to, and Matt said, well, they need Nexus because that's how they
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.380]   try stuff out.
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.900]   That's how they show other handset manufacturers what the best in class can be.
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.860]   And that may be a good argument for doing it, but I don't think it's a business for
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:53.860]   them.
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.540]   Even as it is, it's not a business for them.
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.540]   Right.
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.540]   It's a reference device.
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.540]   It's not a business.
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.740]   And it has a strong following of power users and developers.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.220]   We all love the Nexus line.
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:10.020]   Regular consumers aren't going to the play store and buying Nexus, but you know.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.540]   I think that's the point is that we're in a bubble.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.700]   And so we think the glass and Nexus is the thing, right?
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.860]   But real people, they want to say, oh, look at that guy.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.660]   With a glass, can I try it?
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.020]   But they're not going out and it's been $1,500 bucks on it.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.460]   Your students wouldn't spend money on it.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.940]   No, they just want to borrow it.
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.940]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.900]   Well, but you know, Samsung, how well is the Samsung watch sold?
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.980]   Is it the same thing?
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.540]   We don't know, but I doubt very well.
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.540]   Terribly, terribly right.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.540]   Because it's all so far.
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.420]   You know, the one I was, it's early days though.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.380]   I mean, this is a market that's going to grow.
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.820]   So I don't think we can write it off yet.
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.820]   Right.
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:43.820]   And it was so limited.
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.780]   You had to work with a Samsung device.
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:50.260]   Look, if Google comes out with a watch that works with every single app you can get in
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:55.700]   the Play Store as it is with any device running Android, I mean, just the compatibility wise,
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.980]   you know, the market is so much so much broader there.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.980]   And they can do that.
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.940]   Well, and that's interesting because that's the argument we were having yesterday, or
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.820]   day before Macbreak weekly, you know, yesterday, was if Apple does a watch, Apple's not going
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.100]   to make an open device.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.660]   You will have to have an iPhone.
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.740]   You will have to live in the Apple ecosystem.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.180]   That's how Apple works.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:17.140]   That is not a very compelling device to people like us who want something open.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:21.140]   Pebble, I can use with my Apple, but I can also use my Android, right?
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.140]   Right.
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.340]   It's got to be open, I think.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.540]   Yeah, and you have to have partnerships with everybody possible.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.540]   All the, you know, run keepers of the world.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.900]   And you've got to be forward compatible with all kinds of new phones and new Android operating
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.940]   systems and all kinds of other pains of the bot.
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:44.940]   So do we think Google considers these business or more a way of learning about its customers,
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.860]   learning what services to provide?
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.860]   You're right.
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:48.860]   It's a way of learning.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.460]   The question is, do they want to keep learning for a while?
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:51.460]   Yeah, they may.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.900]   I'm not saying I probably should have meant my thought that I did think they'd stop making
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.500]   Nexus and just use Google Play editions.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.500]   But you know what?
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:04.260]   They probably will start continuing to do Nexus because Mac cuts is no fool, but it won't
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.260]   be a business.
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.260]   It'll just be experiments.
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.660]   Does it need to be either or?
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.980]   I mean, can't they be doing both?
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:10.980]   Of course they could be doing both.
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.060]   I guess what I'm saying is they can't, they aren't making money, enough money to make
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.580]   it an interesting business for them.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.340]   It's not a billion dollar business.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.340]   You.
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.420]   Microsoft needs billion dollar businesses.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.420]   What does Google need?
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.420]   You know, in other words, Microsoft doesn't enter a business unless they think it's a
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.380]   billion dollar business.
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.180]   Does Google have a metric like that?
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:33.620]   No, Google says we want to fail early and try stuff.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.060]   Right.
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.140]   And so the question is it's not when they go into business.
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.900]   They'll go into robotics and cars.
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.260]   The question is, do they stay in the business?
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.820]   Do they make it a business?
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.820]   That's different.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:48.980]   Cars is a good example because when Google started doing cars, it was like, whoa, circuit
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.540]   whoa.
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:55.500]   And in fact, now they own that space and anybody for a Ford or General Motors, anybody wants
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.180]   to do a Thomas vehicles, first place they're going to go is it's a mountain view and say,
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.180]   hey, explain.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.180]   How does this work?
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.180]   Right.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.500]   See, that was a smart move from a product point of view.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.500]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.540]   What's about the lead strategically?
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.540]   How about this?
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:15.220]   Google has released a Chrome teleconferencing system.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.180]   Watch out, Cisco.
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.180]   I don't know.
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.620]   Again, this is like, well, what is Google's intent here?
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:26.060]   So the idea is the Chrome box for meetings, it comes with a Logitech HD webcam, not made
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:30.540]   my Google Google, a Jabra speaker phone, not made by Google, a remote control with a
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:36.060]   keyboard in the back and uses Google plus Hangouts for video chat.
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.580]   And it's all in a Chrome box.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.580]   And $9,000.
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.140]   $1,000 total.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:44.260]   The works with with I think a first year free, but then a service fee like a $200 a year
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:49.540]   service fee to $250 a year Google cloud services.
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.860]   Yeah, which I don't think you'd have to have, but I guess having that central.
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:57.220]   So people saw this last week and said, Oh, Leo, why aren't you using that for?
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.220]   We could.
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:03.460]   But then again, what do you get out of that that you don't get out of my wonderful pixel
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.460]   with its wonderful camera?
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.460]   Interesting question.
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:10.180]   If we spent $1,000, Chad, what we do now right now is we Skype, Skype, automatic, we
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:16.140]   call it, which is four stock PCs, we're each running in a Windows seven with Skype on
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.140]   them.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.140]   Right.
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.420]   And when you call in and when, right, Gina's using it right now, she calls one of those
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:21.780]   four boxes.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.260]   Each of them has their own input on the board and we can bring it up.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.180]   Why couldn't those be instead this thousand?
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.780]   Well, the camera we don't care about.
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.380]   We have to have video in, right?
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:35.780]   Yeah, that's the problem is we use our own special camera in what's interesting is in
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.220]   the article, they show two different manufacturers.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:41.900]   They show HP and then there's an Asus.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:46.180]   So and these little boxes look a lot like the Intel.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.180]   The NUC.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.180]   NUC.
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:52.020]   The next unit of computing or whatever.
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:56.660]   So it may be that there is one of these, you know, NUC style things that would fit our
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:03.660]   needs, but this $250 a year thing, it doesn't seem like this is a separate like, basically
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:08.580]   what we would want it to it is a separate layer of internet, you know, or server service.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.020]   We want to be the Google server.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.020]   Exactly.
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.020]   In our basement.
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.220]   In fact, we're looking at doing it with a Microsoft technology called link, right, that
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.140]   has a server in our basement.
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.860]   Sorry, dude.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.540]   I don't think it'll work on your pixel.
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.540]   Yeah.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.540]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.380]   But it looks, I mean, from the article and I could easily be wrong, it doesn't seem like
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:36.420]   the, they bill it as the $250 Google cloud service to make up, to make paint set up as
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.900]   painless as possible.
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.540]   That doesn't seem like we actually get an actual server that we could go in there and
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.540]   change config files.
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.540]   And what's the difference between just going out and buying a Chrome box?
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.540]   Right.
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.540]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.540]   $199.00.
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.020]   I'm not understanding what makes this different.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.580]   It may be that the server drill, does the camera move?
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:31:01.500]   No, what I bet is, is you can, you can give your client a link and then they will call
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.820]   the set up that, that like, well, that's what the services are.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:05.820]   That's what the service is.
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:11.740]   Is that $250 is call, call Google to, they'll set it up for you.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:12.740]   This is something that Amazon has.
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.900]   But look at Uber conference, which is just software.
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.780]   It's a website that provides a centralized web RTC hub.
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.180]   Now, that's only for audio.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.180]   That's not for video.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.180]   Right.
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.300]   But I've seen this before.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.300]   Who is it?
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:30.660]   I believe that it's Adobe does a connect, Adobe connect and they, you can call them
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.860]   on the phone and get technical help if you're not, if you're not connecting.
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:41.140]   And that's what I think that the $250 services is if your CEO needs to call a technical line,
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.340]   they have some place to do that.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.180]   To be honest, that's what the thousand bucks is also because it's just a kit.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.100]   Companies feel better like, oh, we bought the kit.
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.100]   Brian.
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.340]   And it looks like there's some enterprisey features here.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.060]   The service syncs with Google Calendar and in the future Microsoft Exchange display the
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.980]   schedule of upcoming meetings.
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:57.980]   That's nice.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.860]   You can start a new meeting by typing a meeting name to the terminal and it like tells you
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.700]   when the next meeting is scheduled to begin.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:08.020]   So it warns you if someone's muted and they start speaking, they get a warning.
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.500]   So it sounds like it got, it's got a couple of like little bells and whistles that you'd
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:16.660]   want in a corporate teleconferencing environment that that vanilla hangouts doesn't have.
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:17.660]   Interesting product.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:22.020]   Again, I think that this is for Google, not a product per se in the sense that they think
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:26.020]   this is a line of business as much as an experiment.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.180]   And which we learn stuff.
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.180]   Their business is data.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.820]   Yeah, they want people using hangouts.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:31.820]   Right.
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:35.940]   And if it means getting them getting into conference rooms for super cheap, right?
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.940]   I mean, this is cheap compared to most.
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.740]   So what does Cisco say to this?
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.700]   You're sitting there and you're like 20,000.
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.700]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.940]   So what's the difference between this and what Cisco offers you?
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.860]   I think Cisco probably has a lock on enterprise because they're Cisco and because you, you
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.780]   know, they have the Cisco guy comes and sets it up.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.620]   It's some geek in the company at some point and says, well, it's too geeky.
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.060]   It's a geeky solution.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.060]   It's a geeky solution.
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.060]   Okay.
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.180]   You don't want to, you don't want to, you don't want geeks to run your business because
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.260]   then they, they, you know, they're, they're, they'll save you too much money.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.260]   They save you much.
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.260]   They're strange.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.260]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:13.540]   So you're sponsoring Citrix probably says, huh, this makes us look nice and cheap and
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.700]   one of the things that's actually tough for Citrix, of course.
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.300]   Well, I wouldn't think it would make it, it's competitively good for them in the sense
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.300]   that they say if you're already using, it produces the idea.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.620]   If you're already using Citrix, then why?
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.500]   Citrix does it all software, right?
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.500]   Right.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.740]   It's all software solution and it is much less expensive than Cisco.
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:33.900]   So in it, but go to meeting, which is their conferencing product is, is considerably cheaper
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:34.900]   than Cisco.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:35.900]   So that's always been their problem.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.460]   And it's one of their, I think it's their best selling product.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:43.460]   I think that, I don't know, I don't think businesses are as price sensitive as you might
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.460]   think.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:48.500]   I don't think that they go, whoa, there's a thousand dollar box built on a, a three
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.140]   different manufacturer's boxes.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.140]   They don't want that.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:54.100]   They say, I want to call Cisco and say, put it in.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.100]   Yeah.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.260]   Or, you know, it's just easier for them.
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:01.260]   Now, let me ask Sarah this, how important is market capitalization as a way to judge
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.260]   a company?
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.700]   It seems like a number that press might like.
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:06.700]   I think it's very important.
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:07.700]   Is it?
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:08.700]   It is to me.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:09.700]   Okay.
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:10.700]   Well, I'll tell you why.
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:15.980]   Google is now the number two most valuable US company right after Exxon, Apple briefly
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.620]   passed Exxon, but now it's back down.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:27.300]   Google number two, its market capitalization is $395.42 billion.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.300]   So that's important.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.620]   Actually, you know, what it's a reflection of is increased Google stock press, right?
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:32.620]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.020]   I mean, you know, there's lots of ways to value a company.
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.820]   You can look at the site or rank them.
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:37.820]   You can look at revenues.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.340]   You can look at profits.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.700]   You can look at the stock price.
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.060]   You can look at ratios.
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:46.740]   But I like market cap because it's actually what the market values you add.
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:48.260]   So you think that's valuable.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.460]   I always feel like the stock market is just kind of like a game.
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:52.460]   A game.
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.660]   And it's to some degree, but I think at the end of the day, you know, of all the different
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.660]   measures.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.660]   So are revenues.
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:01.300]   I mean, so, you know, look at the manipulation that goes on with earnings.
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.820]   You know, I mean, if you decide you want to pick some measure.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.300]   I would argue that market cap is the best.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:11.140]   James Sir O'Wicki in the wisdom of crowd says that because it's the crowd, it is more
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.140]   reliable.
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.220]   He even pointed out something very, I thought that was weird that right before the challenger
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:19.420]   disaster, the company that made the O rings tumbled in the stock market, or no, right
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:24.420]   after it, before we figured out why the challenger blew up, somehow the stock market, the wisdom
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:29.700]   of the crowds knew that it was the O rings and that company tumbled in the stock market.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:33.740]   And I mean, that could just be weird or it could be that maybe there is some kind of
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.420]   collective wisdom that the stock market chose.
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.620]   But it's over the long term, not over the short term, right?
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:39.620]   Yeah.
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:43.300]   I mean, you know, the day to day fluctuations of market cap are meaningless.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.300]   Right.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:49.820]   But I think to say that Google is the number, you know, second most valued company in the
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:53.100]   in this world that we live in is reasonable.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.460]   Actually, that's a good way to put it.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:59.020]   Not the second most valuable company, the second most valued valued by the market.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.020]   Right.
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.420]   What about the cash, the cash hordes at Google and it's number two.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:06.220]   They're already and Apple are already included in that price.
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.220]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:09.500]   I mean, if you're an investor, one of the things you're looking at is how much cash are they
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.900]   sitting on and how have they.
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:11.900]   Right.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.700]   How do I get that and how have they deployed it previously?
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.700]   How good are they at?
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.700]   Carl icon.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.260]   How do I get that?
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.260]   Yeah.
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:24.860]   Actually, he's given up because as Apple did a big buyback, $12 billion buyback and I
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:28.220]   can't say, I SS said, never mind.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.220]   They need this cash.
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.860]   Don't don't don't deplete their cash reserve.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.780]   So I kind of said, well, all right, I'll take that.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.140]   They're going towards $19 billion buyback.
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:41.460]   Actually somebody said the other day, the Apple continues at the rate that they're going.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.740]   They'll be a they'll go private in like by 2020.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:49.900]   I don't know if that's going to happen.
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:54.500]   Google strikes a big ad measurement deal with ComScore.
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:37:01.580]   ComScore traditionally has been the kind of platinum ratings company right in the web.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:05.220]   Yeah, and they're smart people there.
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:11.020]   Abraham's chairman, now chairman, just gave up the CEO title.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:15.500]   The issue with some of these companies though is that they are still based on more mass
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.580]   media measurements and they're still based on sampling.
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.420]   It's as if they took the Nielsen model and applied it to the.
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.540]   Because you can't measure everybody, but Google can measure most of them.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.540]   You can measure everybody.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:29.780]   That's what fascinates me is that Google says there's a measurement we don't have.
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:30.780]   Right.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.740]   And I wanted to go to ComScore to get it.
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:37.300]   Part of this is also I guess because advertisers buy relative BS.
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.300]   Advertisers demand it.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.860]   That's why.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:47.060]   So ComScore's validated campaign essentials is the measurement technique that they use
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:50.100]   and that's going to be part of the double click ad networking of course Google owns double
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.340]   click.
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.300]   The combination says USA Today and I trust them.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.300]   All the best analysis.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:02.700]   You know they have a flappy bird icon as their as their as their as their as their mass
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.700]   head yesterday.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.780]   They have a sense of humor.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.940]   You got to give them credit for that.
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:13.660]   No, the combination will let advertisers and publishers track online ads in near real time.
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:16.420]   That's something you can't do if you're getting the total number.
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.420]   Right.
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.700]   Samples will let you do that right now allowing them to change things on the fly if campaigns
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.620]   are not performing as expected.
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:29.060]   Just because advertisers pay a dollar amount per impression right or for thousand and thousands
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.060]   of questions.
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.060]   Yes.
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.340]   So they want to know okay I'm buying an ad but the impression suddenly went up or down.
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:35.860]   How's that going to affect my buy?
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:42.300]   And once we've been out here seeing a lot of companies including medium and Twitter and
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:47.540]   Facebook and next link and Google more on that later but but one of the things that's
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.660]   come up again and again and again what Sarah and I've been talking with them is metrics
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.540]   and the proper metrics.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:57.980]   And this is part of the old I've gone about this before in the show the old mass media
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:58.980]   view.
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:03.260]   We want volume and we're going to throw ads at them just like TV and what that yields
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:09.220]   what that what that brings into the world then is up where these and buzz feeds and slide
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:14.540]   shows and all that crap is just volume for the sake of volume and this is still a measurement
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.540]   akin to that along that line.
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:22.260]   Whereas we need to figure out how to measure at some level some would say engagement everywhere
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.860]   a great piece a while ago about how they measure total time read.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:29.580]   That's one way to go another another measurement we need is relationships another measure what
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:33.980]   we need is relevance what's the value of this brand to you does it really give you any value.
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:39.340]   I think that the key final metric we got to figure out is outcomes.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.900]   Did I did I get something from this that that improved my life but we're still stuck in
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:48.860]   this idea of we'll show an ad at you and some small percentage of the time that will enter
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.220]   your brain by osmosis and you'll end up buying this thing we want to sell you.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:56.820]   This reminds me a lot of the early days of tech TV when you're a new cable channel you're
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:01.660]   never going to get brand advertisers because you're unproven so you get direct marketing
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:06.540]   you get stuff that's measurable and that's the state that the web is currently in in
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:11.740]   fact podcasts are too frankly most of our advertisers to direct responsive some form
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:16.380]   because an advertiser can say well I got 50 leads from that ad so it's worth it.
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:22.620]   The return on investment is a clear calculation the problem is Ford, Coke, Pepsi, Procter and
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:28.100]   Gamble they it's hard for them to say well we sold 58 million more leaders of Coke today
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:31.380]   because of the Google ad they don't know but but hold on it's at least it happens to
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.900]   be over here in charge of the business she runs this.
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.780]   So you had Ford for a good amount of time they had a branding mission which was to make
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:46.100]   them a tech savvy company that worked for them right they weren't going for volume true
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.300]   but you know the way they validated that with a lot of research so then they go in and they
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:55.540]   talk to the audience and say what was the recall what but but they they and by the way
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:41:01.820]   they have since left because they told us to accomplish exactly experiments over it worked
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:05.140]   we got people understand that Ford sync is high tech well I wasn't there wasn't this
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:08.140]   bearman was better than that wasn't experiment you helped them change the perception of the
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:12.500]   brand and they knew it worked that's why they spent they were with us two years almost
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:16.660]   three years spent several million dollars with us so it wasn't although for Ford that's
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:22.420]   less than a Super Bowl ad but it was for us a fairly significant investment.
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:28.940]   According to this article you know traditional brand advertising is worth three hundred billion
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:34.140]   dollars a year and Google wants a chunk of that right digital brand spending is only
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:41.060]   eighteen billion dollars in 2013 and so they liked more of that three hundred billion to
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:45.540]   move over to the digital side so would we yeah and frankly it's a reason I kind of understand
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.940]   this is because it's the same issue for us is how do you get a metric to an advertiser
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.740]   that they understand and will buy.
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:59.460]   I agree with you really the real metric that they care about is is harder to measure like
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:04.460]   engagement and being as like that but it ultimately comes down to results they can measure
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:08.060]   result most of them can measure results the direct ones can but Google wants more brand
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:09.780]   advertising.
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:17.380]   The end game is to end according to a comscars president is to integrate this with TV measurement
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:21.900]   most of the ad dollars are on TV and over time that will shift the digital and you want
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:28.980]   to measure this in real time across all platforms it's interesting.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:32.020]   But probably a little too inside baseball so I'm going to take a break.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:36.860]   Change log is coming up next Gina Trappani put your change log hat on.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.860]   We'll do.
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.860]   Change your umber.
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:41.860]   Would you call it with the lips the unburshir no the.
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:42.860]   Umbercher?
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.740]   No what do you want to do with Trump?
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:47.740]   What's that called chat room?
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:48.740]   What's that called?
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:49.740]   What?
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:50.740]   Umbercher.
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.220]   Umbercher is that what it is get your umberchers ready people.
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:56.300]   Well that's your that's your yeah because it's trumpets.
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.860]   Sorry.
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:10.740]   You know really I'm sorry but when I hear a tuba I just see a guy going into a big tube
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:15.580]   but at least that catches the spin.
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:21.700]   This week in Google brought to you by 99designs.com when I see an app that's poorly designed
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:25.980]   I see a programmer who is a good programmer perhaps but didn't understand that he wasn't
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.980]   also a designer.
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:32.060]   I saw something on secret this morning that said the pro somebody who thinks he's a program
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.540]   designer is good at neither.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:40.300]   You could be great as you could be a great chef you could have a great business but frankly
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:45.380]   you need a great designer to show it off for that landing page that email template the
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:52.180]   billboard the t-shirt the app and the place place to go is is that place where 270,000
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.460]   actually what is that now 290.
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:44:00.540]   480,458 designers have gathered waiting to help you look better.
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.020]   I'm talking 99 designs.
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:07.860]   If you're worried about budgets don't worry 99 designs very affordable we just did a 99
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:11.020]   designs contest that's what they call them where you go there and you say I want a twit
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:12.020]   hoodie design.
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:17.500]   We've got how many I don't I can't remember 20 or 30 designs we're going to 60 we got
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:22.860]   a ton of them it was fun going through them great cool stuff we bought more than you'd
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.060]   say okay and you'd work with a designer say okay I'm going to use this one we like so
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.900]   many of them we bought five of them because we thought we'll use these later these are
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:36.340]   great 99 designs a great way to find great designs logos car wraps there is there's one
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:40.420]   of them I really like that one I don't think that what we're having a vote right now but
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:44.060]   I don't think that's going to be the hoodie but I think we'll do a t-shirt sometime with
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:49.820]   that I like that a lot yeah yeah you can go to inside that twit TV and vote we know it's
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:54.340]   not done yet we think that one's not one that one's leading is that great well for
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:58.060]   a hoodie it needs to be bold like it needs to make a statement right yes these are all
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:03.500]   from 99 designs a drag store here either should be we do you know we do we we we used to have
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:09.780]   a shwag store and we realized I'll tell you in a second we figured something out that
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:16.060]   I think really was true project started at just $199 and happiness is always a hundred
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:21.980]   percent guaranteed I want you to boost your brand's visibility get something great something
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:25.460]   that looks good if you're doing an app please don't do it without help from somebody who's
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:31.700]   really knows design go to 99 designs dot com slash twig 99 designs dot com slash twig
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:37.740]   and get a $99 power pack of services absolutely free the power pack gives you more designer
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:42.300]   time and attention they'll bold highlight and feature your design project the 99 designs
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:47.820]   marketplace that way you get literally about twice as many designs 99 designs dot com
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:54.740]   slash twig get that $99 value we love 99 designs what we discovered was if you just
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:59.940]   have a store stuff stuff sells very slowly but if you say we're gonna sell this for 30
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:05.460]   days and after that it's gone forever it works much better is it a significant revenue stream
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:11.020]   no no it's like Google class more about about relationship with the audience well we went
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:15.060]   to the new Facebook headquarters I would last I saw them they were in the one building Palo
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:20.300]   Alto and we drive up that wasn't so long ago he wasn't at all yeah so we drive up and
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:24.300]   I'm thinking we're both thinking sir is making fun of California but I guess it's a tell
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:29.380]   people you know there's an 18 inches of snow coming out I'm saying here you should stay
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:32.860]   here so the building looks really dull is the old son hit a quarter is I think oh really
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:38.780]   dull yeah outside you get inside though and this is great courtyard that's like Disneyland
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:44.740]   that's where their hacker exactly so so they also they have a swag store now it's very
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:49.100]   happy to go in and buy hoodies I cannot tell you how many a lot of people we're part of
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:54.820]   the you know the geek trail or whatever it is they go to the Hewlett Packer garage they
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:58.020]   go to the apples company but when they go to Apple they go to the company store when
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.860]   they go to Google they go to the company store that's a big that's why I want to know where
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:04.620]   is your company sir we don't have one but you can't get in either unless there's an employee
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:11.700]   with you you know why we don't have one what tax I think right we don't want to collect
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:16.820]   sales tax and just a pain in the butt oh just you know just too complicated for setting

[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:05.780]   there's there's a lot of good settings in the magic wand yeah whoops I say I have been
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:09.860]   Google now has become the first thing that I look at in the morning now particularly here
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:13.380]   because of the you know just like the weather and I want to know what the temperature is
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:18.180]   and whatever but I it's getting really good at just showing me news stories that I'm interested
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:23.460]   in and showing me stuff that I didn't realize that I wanted really love Google now Google
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:27.700]   now so always getting better and then you can choose your own demand providers so I
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:35.860]   can check Amazon Prime HBO go I didn't get that I just got just that's really right and
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:40.620]   then I'll recommend times and I love that you better leave work now if you want to see
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:50.220]   Game of Thrones I like that my shows over that's a good one yeah let's see what else
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:55.300]   we got oh we've got a Google search experiment is now showing restaurant menus inside search
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:50:00.660]   results yay yeah so it's an experiment that hasn't gone out to everyone because I tried
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:03.780]   it here I tried a couple local joints and then I tried a couple of really famous joints
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:08.260]   I tried Peter Luger and Juniors cheesecake and I just couldn't see this now turns out
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.820]   Google said that this is just an experiment and it's just going out to a few use you know
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:16.100]   a certain segment of users is seeing it and it looks like an extension of the knowledge
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:21.580]   graph so it looks like they're pulling menu information from all menus dot com and we'll
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:26.100]   show it in line in the in the search result again I didn't see this I don't know if you
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:29.140]   guys see this I don't know if you want to try something near Petaluma search Chad just
[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:33.540]   to see if we're you're getting it now so you search for a restaurant search for the
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:38.500]   social club our neighbor it'd have to be somebody who has submitted their menus to all menus
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:47.460]   I guess right hmm nothing what's the what's the big restaurant what would be the most
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:50.780]   I mean you can also just search restaurants and I'll give you all these yeah but we've
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:55.380]   already seen that what we want to see is also a menu right right right but it's the restaurant
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:59.620]   graffiti doesn't have anything okay so you got reviews in line there and just says menu
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:05.300]   at all menu yeah this this experiment actually in lines the menu in in that's great which
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:10.260]   is which is an example of what you're saying Leo about data right Google has the data to
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:14.660]   know that what we always click on is the damn menu right so we'll give you the damn menu
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:22.260]   yeah yeah yeah another change to search is that Google is showing with great prominence
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:27.180]   the first playable music video for your search term in the official channel so if you search
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:33.540]   for dafpunk get lucky the top result is a giant what looks to be playable video it
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:36.780]   actually isn't a playable video it's just a giant image you click on it and it takes
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:43.420]   you to YouTube to play the video is it always YouTube or can it be other sources that's
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:50.060]   it can be other well vivos the company it can be other sources but it shows up differently
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:56.940]   so for something that's on daily motion it will not have the full screen image it'll
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:01.820]   just be a card and it appears that these are usually the official videos like the vivo
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:08.620]   video and not like user uploaded video that's what you want yeah right right exactly and
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:15.500]   finally a little YouTube update you can basically play most embedded YouTube videos on your Chromecast
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:21.220]   now Google quietly rolled out support for setting most web clips web clips to the Chromecast
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:25.820]   media stick you just need to choose a little button bottom right yeah you just click on
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:30.340]   that and if there's a Chromecast on your Wi-Fi network you'll be able to choose choose the
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:38.100]   target and go for it on your gigantic curbscreen yep yes the only clips that won't work are
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:42.820]   live streams private footage and desktop only videos which I guess is a YouTube YouTube
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:47.380]   video setting you know it's so funny because I was playing a YouTube video last night and
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:52.180]   normally that lower right hand corner is full screen right and I hit it and it showed my
[00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:57.380]   Chromecast I said what the yep yep it's interesting it's an interesting choice of placement for
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:01.840]   that button because I hit that full screen button a lot right so now I'm gonna see the
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:05.940]   Chromecast button actually you know funny not on the change a lot but sort of related I was I
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:10.220]   was digging through my display setting just down Android and if you go into Android settings
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:16.700]   and you go into display there is a setting that says cast screen which I got me really
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:20.260]   excited I was like oh did I you know did I miss this can you can you send your your
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:24.660]   Android screen to the Chromecast you can't yet but it looks like that's gonna get rolled
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:30.940]   out I guess there's support from Mira cast which is a Wi-Fi yeah yeah so that's what that's
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:35.900]   what it but they changed it from wireless display to cast screen so it seems imminent that you're
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:40.900]   gonna be able to cast your entire Android screen whatever you're doing to your TV soon
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:45.340]   mine just says no nearby devices found do we have a Chromecast on our network I don't
[00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:50.940]   believe we do can I take your phone all right thank you it just doesn't work I try I've
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:57.460]   got a Chromecast here only if you take my pixel to go together like I want I watch it
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:01.380]   picks it this apparently rolled out at the end of 2013 and it doesn't do anything right
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:06.140]   now so but I got really excited and then it didn't work so but it looks like that's that's
[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:08.820]   something that's gonna be happening soon so it's really cool to see the Chromecast kind
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:14.220]   of opening up and just you know cast cast all the things I say cast screen it's in my it's
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:22.300]   in my Nexus 7 as well yeah yeah that's all I got I love it Gina you so last night I had
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:26.740]   nothing to do with our for entertainment I went into my Android settings that's Gina
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:31.780]   you know what I was doing actually is I was taking the subway home from work and catching
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:36.700]   up on the all about Android episode that I had missed the week before because I was
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:39.940]   I had a work thing I'd miss the show so I was trying to figure out how to lock my screen
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:45.180]   orientation so it was actually a twit related discovery so there you go I was watching a
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:50.300]   twit show on my phone and I found that screen that's my my new my new phrase I'm gonna use
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:55.540]   all the time it was a twit related discovery a lot of my tech discoveries are twit related
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:55:02.340]   discovery well that's funny because you Gina Trapani are a twit related discovery and that
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:10.300]   is your Google change law a couple of sad notes of course you probably all know that
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:15.180]   Shirley Temple passed away at the age of 85 yesterday and that took cause me to binge
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:21.580]   watch the 15 Shirley Temple movies last night you really no no okay did you did you have
[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:28.180]   a Shirley Temple in her honor ah the drink the drink yes cherry juice and ginger ale love
[00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:33.380]   that the Lexer Mariskino on the side I also saw some video of her as a as a diplomat and
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:42.180]   she walked like she did when she was in the movies bad near Putin you're a bad man the
[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:49.060]   other that's that's my Shirley Temple the other sad note since Caesar passed away today
[00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:54.740]   the great television comedian his show of shows really broke so much ground and TV comedy
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:59.020]   and one of the funniest men alive just loved him not only that but the writers room for
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:05.100]   your show shows gave us woody and no Brooks yes I guess I'm this ice one shouldn't do
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:10.060]   this because in the moment of obituary one should do nothing but respect but come on
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:16.540]   Sid Caesar he would he would allow he this is a guy who had so much fun doing television
[00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:20.220]   well word has it he wasn't a very nice guy but that's that's why he's a show bus but
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:24.460]   you know what you know what it wasn't the golden age of TV he's always always show shows
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:29.500]   is always playing out as being the golden age of TV was hysterical no it wasn't let's
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:34.620]   watch some right now oh this is Jeff Jarvis TV critic coming yeah now I know future news
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:38.820]   that TV news you know what there was a movie called I think it was 12 from your show of
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:42.140]   shows they actually put them together in a movie is one of the funniest movies ever so
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:47.740]   I beg to differ I beg to differ the from here to eternity where they throw a bucket of water
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:55.580]   and imaging coca's face that's comedy gold my friend comedy gold all right I can agree
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:57:00.660]   with this agree all right all right anyways and remember my favorite year which was the
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:05.180]   kind of fictionalized story of being in a writer's room of a show similar to yes which
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:10.020]   is which is one of the great movies of all time right I want that made about about John
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:15.020]   Stewart and the Daily Show we're in the new golden age yes we are you know I interviewed
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:18.620]   somebody last night of triangulation which was a guy named Brett Martin who is a feature
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:22.980]   writer for GQ Vanity Fair in the New Yorker really great guy he wrote a book called difficult
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:27.820]   men which is about what he calls the third gold nature TV which we began with the Sopranos
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:31.260]   but the but the thing that changed it was you could suddenly make television that didn't
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:37.060]   care about ratings because of subscription TV you could actually say we don't care if
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:40.660]   the Sopranos generates ratings we care for generate subscriptions here's another way to
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:45.380]   put that I think that's true but I also think it goes back to our earlier discussion about
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:50.460]   metrics that's a way to get a feedback loop about quality that's right right ratings don't
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:55.420]   give you a feedback loop about quality any more than page views do so so you need and
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:58:00.300]   we're talking about this with have Williams today you want a feedback loop to lead to quality
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:03.980]   you want that to be the outcome and so some of us say that's just ah Jarvis that proves
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:09.460]   paywalls are good for the world okay but it's one kind of sick one kind of only kind of
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:12.860]   exactly we get a feedback loop I mean the number of people in chat the number of people
[00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:17.980]   will download our shows you know the engagement of our audience I mean that I'm email we get
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:22.380]   what's the proportion of I don't ask this before but I always forget people who watch
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:29.260]   live people less than 10% of people who watch video then or versus listen that is varies
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:33.500]   by show some shows are more I mean this is a talking head show so it's still more audio
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:37.380]   but iPad today which is a show about the iPad is more video so that really does vary on
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:41.740]   the content what surprises me is how many people do watch video of talking heads programs
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:47.820]   like this the way they're just so pretty the video adds nothing to the content I I've had
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:52.740]   friends and my brother is an avid twig watcher and he said that he will mount his his phone
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:56.540]   to his dashboard and bring up the video he said I do not want to watch I want to only
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:59.660]   watch the show I was like please while you're driving through Manhattan please don't get
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:04.100]   no one actually watching our show he said no I want to see your faces I want to see where
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:07.900]   you're talking about it's way better with video so I get that I get that a lot I didn't
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:13.820]   want to do video video audio so cheap compared to video so much easier but I also realized
[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:17.060]   that audio doesn't get the attention effect it was just a great article on dig dig is
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:24.060]   now doing original content about why audio does not go viral but video does go viral right
[00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:28.940]   next very incredible piece wasn't it really and it was a gist of it I don't see it the
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:34.460]   truth is there has been viral video you know Orson wells and a lot of you know viral audio
[00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:42.060]   orson wells berating the producing advertising agency a gunk what sir is a gunk that's
[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:48.140]   very fine a gunk but there are very few viral audio just a pair of viral videos I don't
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:53.140]   know if he said why I have an opinion why I think to go viral something has to engage
[00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:59.020]   actually got this from Tim street has to engage your emotions the more emotions that anything
[00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:04.460]   engages the more viral it will be so if it if it makes you laugh and makes you cry that's
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:09.340]   better than just laughing and I think video is better at engaging the emotions audio tends
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:15.820]   to be more abstract and intellectual this is another twit discovery because I think that
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:19.940]   that the presumption is this is we have this in our journalism school the presumption is
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:25.300]   that audio and video are different worlds right for that matter broadcast video and web video
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:28.220]   or different world right that aside the audio of it are different things entirely different
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:32.780]   skills and so on and so forth and so talking about this show the fact that a good proportion
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:37.860]   of people listen to it rather than watch it you miss some jokes you miss you don't see
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:41.860]   my pink face when I'm on my camera you don't see other things but but the jokes become
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:46.500]   apparent right they become known so I one of my students has a new business idea and
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:52.460]   he presumed audio so I then show him twit and say you know I'm not so sure folks maybe
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:57.580]   you want to do video presuming the option of audio and he got all he loved that it was
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:02.100]   inspired by you that's kind of what we've done yeah and again a great expense by the
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:06.620]   way in order for instance this studio we don't need it for audio no god no and it's a million
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:11.740]   and a half dollars extra actually folks it's just a giant chroma key it's a green screen
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:18.260]   there's nothing really here right actually in jina's basement yes I wish for that looks
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:24.580]   like such a cozy fun to help her shovel it isn't it that audio is just video is inherently
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:28.060]   more shareable I mean when you're listening to audio you're out and about and doing things
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:33.100]   when you're watching video you're doing it on your computer right and it's also short
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:37.420]   video is goes viral right I mean Leo I've seen you know that your shows do great right
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:41.820]   but I've seen I've seen people take clips or do you know jump cuts of nothing moments
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:45.620]   in your shows and those go viral because they're short and people just have you know short
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:51.300]   attention spans and they're seeing them on Facebook or wherever but audio just it doesn't
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:55.060]   isn't quite as inherently shareable and usually people are downloading it and listening to
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:58.980]   all their washing the dishes or walking the dog and there isn't a share button anywhere
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:02.900]   for them to press is a challenge for us because video is not all that shareable either and
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:07.540]   we want to we we don't really go viral is very well I think the other thing that people
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:13.260]   don't use enough especially for your shows is so long is share at start moment X right
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:17.740]   and you can do that you can do it and surprise doesn't there's not a lot more I think it
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:22.540]   would you know you get to see the rant or you get to see the funny moment and and then
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:26.820]   you might watch the rest it's the same thing I wanted to see with articles where repost
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:30.380]   on us which I've talked on the show before right you can post an entire article the next
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:35.820]   level I'd like to see if that is that David Carr wrote a wonderful piece on medium about
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:39.500]   the death of films he wore Hoffman and he had one paragraph in there about addiction
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:44.020]   that was just brilliant so what I wanted to do was to share a paragraph right so what
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:47.220]   I did this there was of course I cut and pasted on to Google plus right I wanted to embed
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:50.860]   the article with that paragraph yeah I like it right and then people would probably stay
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:55.900]   and read the rest same for your show I think if somebody can go into it because they're
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:03:01.060]   now our shows in are in you know hour four minute twenty two and say well that's a really
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:07.340]   funny moment when Gina really sought it to Jeff and then people would watch both ways
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:11.460]   right so what you want the audience to do hello chat room this is your job now is you
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:16.740]   want to basically annotate the shows to the good bits and you want I think a schedule
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:22.780]   of good bits in the show right and then share those I mean I you know viral is as somebody
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:28.660]   is couple of people in the shower pointing out isn't the goal no as viral is very short
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:34.180]   term it's discovery what virus is the goal yes and so I would love share I don't care
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:37.980]   if we get a million views of anything or even a hundred thousand but but what I want is
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:41.780]   people discover what we're doing and say wow that Jeff guy is great I want to see more
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:45.820]   of him yes and then watch the show so I agree with you we'd like but there is mechanically
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:48.820]   it's very difficult right now this is one of the great metrics for he post on us which
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:52.300]   I don't know if I mentioned the show before poor Sarah's heard it ten times already this
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:04:00.660]   week is is that they find that the the click through rate from an entire embedded post
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.740]   or article which you think it'd be zero because somebody's read the whole article is actually
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:07.980]   high it's five to seven percent Wow highly obviously highly qualified clicks because somebody
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:13.380]   says oh I like that I want to I want to reread it or more I like that article they're more
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:18.460]   like you at home and and and so you go that's true I'll click through even if I've read the
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:22.220]   gist of an article I'll click through if I want to see more yeah or I'm interested in
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:28.980]   belly fat ads because I'm not good enough of those yes whereas now what's really happening
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:34.460]   is we have the cynical act I'm I'm smiling them again but up worthy and chart beat where
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:39.780]   you just are sharing the headline BuzzFeed BuzzFeed chart these different than BuzzFeed
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:43.460]   because chart beat however we know what he meant chart beat has some great stats what
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:47.100]   I think I mentioned this before where people share before they read so what they're really
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:50.260]   sharing is just the headline yeah they're not sure in the article yeah I mentioned that
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:54.380]   on Twitter this this weekend I thought that was a very interesting piece of information
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:05:00.660]   we also saw this week that up worthy has taken a great dive in the number of hits almost
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:05.540]   fifty percent you know because of a change in algorithm at Facebook that's all it took
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:12.620]   to downgrade up worthy which is apparently not so worthy live by the sword yeah that's
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:17.020]   right the up worthy CEO's response was well that's it's we're just going back to normal
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:23.380]   we had a very unusually big December and that's all you were seeing we're gonna take a break
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:27.740]   come back with more I want to hear about your travels you you and Sarah's travels around
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:34.420]   the Bay Area to meet with CEOs like have Williams of media and and Twitter Sarah Barton is here

[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:53.380]   Dean's a good title I always am scared because I always got brought up in front of the dean
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:06:00.780]   so I don't you're not that kind of disciplinary fear you do yes the dean would like to see
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:08.220]   you now report oh god again although the deans list is a good thing I was on that other list

[01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:14.780]   in Boston I think and his wife was back in Singapore you mean over the internet and so she can help to
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:24.620]   he can help her achieve an orgasm with the with the with the remote vibing it was it was a riveting
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:29.980]   demonstration it was just a meaning of the word you like to see I gotta tell you that I have to say
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:35.420]   the demo like the the the guy who demoed came off like he was so earnest he was and like really
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:40.220]   was like I was a devoted husband trying to help his long distance wife what are you gonna not like

[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:59.100]   wait a minute so there's no don't show that my favorite moment of the demo was a was a point
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:06.220]   at which he said and we even talked to women about all it's a bad time and I thought oh I was
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:11.100]   it was a little you know there was sort of a bit of an anticlimactic moment if I may use that term
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:16.620]   because they announced at the beginning at the beginning they said okay anyone with young people
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:20.940]   you know children under the age of you know x you really need to leave the room now because
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:26.540]   we're gonna have this special sex you know imagine listening to 50 shades of gray with a hens free
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:31.900]   vibrator that vibrates in perfect sync with the audio fantasy so there's an audio fantasy yes yes
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:36.300]   so you don't need the husband no that's what I'm saying you can be 3000 miles away but you don't
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:40.940]   need the husband at all well he's talking he's talking over his iphone no but there's a video
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:45.340]   there's there's a fantasy there's an audio fantasy that's the fantasy that you don't need the husband
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:50.380]   yeah there were a few different options yeah you could you've been replaced by a podcast honey
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:56.060]   you could choose different paths aren't you the one who's interested in paths there's more there's
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:11:03.740]   more than one way to do it not to in any way overshadowed think up well you see what she met
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:08.220]   when she even was this you did well yeah this is a great competition this is what i meant by being
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:16.700]   up again it's some tough it wasn't it wasn't really i did ammo honestly well that's important
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:30.540]   no no no that's too much so it's wearable it's 100% hands-free experience it is it is indeed wearable
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:34.140]   it's wearable tech i think i'm just gonna about to get fired for having been in a uh
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:39.020]   it wasn't work work environment the dean is here it's yeah it's okay jesus
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:46.140]   i didn't mean for this to go so it was the topic of my ex-faculty meeting now you've blown it for me
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:52.220]   yeah there's an app for it that's what i think kind of interesting is has an app
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:58.940]   android or ios i'm surprised apple approved that to be honest seems like that's something apple
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:02.380]   wouldn't approve they don't believe in people having sex i think they had some problems with it
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:07.260]   actually and then yeah yeah well it was part of the discussion was like how to legitimate consumer
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:11.900]   products that are related to sex deal with you know things like app store policies and even just
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:16.940]   getting getting you know uh payment processors and different web services you know a lot of the
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:20.380]   companies just won't won't work with i bet they only have problems in the u.s though i think
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:26.540]   it'll be no no she said globally globally really not not germany not germany i think she was saying
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:30.780]   i mean the there was a woman who i forget her name who came up afterwards and was quite passionately
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:35.980]   you know annoyed about how how the uh financial world which is sort of shutting down we're anti-sex
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:42.300]   correct yeah that's right a lot of negativity about sex especially by bankers so it's all the
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:57.740]   more impressive that you did so well jina yeah that's that's a tough act to be on c
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:03.900]   thank you thank you and damn you Jarvis you couldn't let you couldn't let it slide could you well
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:09.260]   this is not only does it slide well no i don't um this episode we'll be back with more in just a

[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:02.940]   track of it or even see it as a whole personal capital collates all that information into a
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:08.140]   single page where you could see exactly how you stand all your accounts all your assets

[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:27.180]   anyone else should fork android it's unforeable his point being there's two parts to android there's
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:36.220]   the android open source part and there's the google services part and yes this aosp part of android
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:41.420]   is free and open can be put on any device amazon did it and for it but you don't get if you do that
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:45.580]   you don't get any of the google services which means not just the play store and all the google
[01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:50.940]   apps but it also means things like location services there's an open now jina you probably know better
[01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:55.900]   than i so so jump in here there's an open source versions of let's say location services but it's
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:17:03.100]   old and not been kept up to date and probably not very good is that right it's not as up to date as
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:09.820]   google's proprietary layer uh it works and but you know people who have been writing this article
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:13.260]   that seem this this is sort of thing that's been coming out over and over that google is not
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:17.740]   really open that that aosp is abandoned where you know we'll say that it hasn't been updated
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:23.260]   in a really long time that google is putting all most of its development efforts into gms that
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:27.820]   gms is the google um google mobile services which is that proprietary layer that that works on top
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:36.780]   of aosp well even the point where the launcher now is a gms app right the next is five launcher is
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:44.540]   the google now launcher that is a proprietary that is a closed source google um uh app right so
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:48.220]   like so the aosp is open source version but then you can layer all these things on top of it right
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:52.380]   and so the argument is and i think that this is like developers who feel very passionate
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:56.540]   religious really about what open source is what does open mean what does google mean when they
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:18:00.380]   say is open and this is what i think where i think bright is coming from in this ours technical
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:05.100]   article is saying you know android's not really open you can't really fork it because the real
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:12.940]   value in android is gms is google's proprietary layer uh so so if microsoft you know shouldn't fork
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:17.420]   android and try to build on top of it no kia shouldn't fork android and build on top of it it's a lose
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:22.780]   lose situation because you either have to write your own proprietary layer to catch up to what google's
[01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:27.020]   done and google has a tremendous head start and not only would you have to meet match feature for
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:30.780]   feature but you'd have to match all the quirks as well because there are some bugs in the open
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:35.500]   source layer that the proprietary layer fixes uh you know you're you're not going to be able to do
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:39.500]   that or you have to release a phone without any of the google goodness which is just a crappy
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:45.420]   experience this is bright arguing or you have to seed control of your phone to google and apply
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:51.740]   for certification and get all the google goodies but but sort of you know give all the control of the
[01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:56.380]   platform or get you know give all the good stuff of the platform uh to google right so that you can
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:19:01.660]   have you know you can have control uh or or you can have that you know the good experience but you
[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:05.900]   can't have both that's his that's his thesis of the start of peter of course we've had him on
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:11.660]   many times he covers windows uh and his point really is aimed at microsoft and this rumor that
[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:16.060]   microsoft and no kia might be doing an android based phone in fact we believe that rumor is true
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:21.580]   uh both the paul thorat and america fully said this is true they will announce it soon and what it
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:26.540]   is is the asha low-end no kia phones the phones they sell for as little as thirty five dollars
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:31.420]   in develop in the developing world and it's just not possible to put windows phone on such a cheap
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:36.380]   device but it is possible to do android wait wait wait is that like is that a pr move to say well
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:41.340]   windows isn't cheap but android is could be or it could well i mean it is true that you can
[01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:46.620]   the what they've been using is simbian they've been using since s s 60 um so that i mean it's
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:51.900]   time to update it i think it's not a reasonable say windows phone couldn't operate on these
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:55.500]   but you're right it could just be pure marketing say we're not going to put our premium operating
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:20:00.700]   system on a thirty five dollar phone although it is on a hundred dollar phone uh the the five
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:07.500]   twenty so um the other side of that story is that no kia will be providing all of the services that
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:11.820]   google currently provides in other words just as there's a google services layer there might be a
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:17.820]   no kia services layer including location a no kia store and all of that there's a rebuttal to
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:22.860]   peters article by uh... diane hackborn do you know her she's an android developer it says
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:26.460]   she is i don't know if a person or she's a googler she's been working on android for a very long
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:30.540]   time she won the earliest and read developers she's you know probably one of the you know
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:36.380]   biggest and read experts that you know it exists on the planet uh and she wrote a point by point
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:42.140]   rebuttal inside the arse uh... comments which which is an amazing read because it
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:48.220]   it really gives you a sense of how googles thinking about android kind of internally
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:54.620]   and her argument is essentially that a s b is a fully functioning smartphone operating system
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:21:00.220]   that anyone can install any device and everything works and there's no other operating system that
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:05.500]   is that is that is that is that open and that google's proprietary layer is proprietary because
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:09.660]   it interacts with googles cloud services at the cloud services that google builds
[01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:15.020]   or provides that's that's really where the business value is and that's where that's why
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:19.180]   it's proprietary because that code lives in the cloud it does not it does not run on the phone
[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:21.980]   that's why google isn't including it into the open source project
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:27.660]   and uh... it's a it's a really it's a great great read i i i absolutely
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:32.940]   uh... recommend seeing kind of her perspective on it i mean you know she she went as far as to say
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:36.780]   she she said you know look there's lots of good reasons why microsoft and no kia shouldn't
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:42.060]   uh... fork android and build on top of android but it's not this android is absolutely
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:47.100]   for a couple and she's she's really right i mean amazon forked android successfully
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:52.620]   yeah it's certainly for a couple amazon a year before they did that built the amazon
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:57.820]   uh... android store really beefed it up uh... and because that's their business model and
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:01.260]   what we're part of what i think we're hearing is that is that this is a way to get the web
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:05.420]   on phones at a cheap price and i think it's pretty clear that after all the
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:11.020]   scrugled ads no microsoft company would ever include gurgles google services as a layer on
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:15.740]   their phone so that was a non-starter um the real question is and i think that
[01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:18.700]   nokia has answered it because i think it's pretty clear they're going to do it
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:23.660]   that can you make a good phone based on a osp and um i bet you they did
[01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:29.100]   i mean can't you the big question is can you make a great mobile phone experience
[01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:34.300]   that doesn't involve rich cloud services right you know can
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:37.500]   but microsoft has all those services right
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:42.460]   microsoft has cloud services so you tie in instead of you tying into google you tie in exchange
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:49.340]   you tie in a microsoft azure and i don't know what services google provides that microsoft
[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:52.940]   doesn't instead of google apps you've got office 365 i think that
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:58.380]   right right there's one to one well i don't know if it's exactly one to one i'd have to look down
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:02.780]   the list right and there certainly is a layer of app code that you have to write on the android
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:07.420]   side in order to interact with the cloud services um but you know a long time ago and i forget who
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:11.260]   right because one of the founders of github wrote this great post about what you should open source
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:15.420]   and what you shouldn't and he basically said that you you know you open source everything except
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:21.100]   what's core to your business value and you know android the aosp isn't that's just a platform to
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:25.500]   google to offer their services to users on top of that's not their business but their business value
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:32.060]   is the cloud services it's the data right it's the users it's it's it's it's that um that's what gms
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:36.060]   is the bridge to on smartphones i think where this comes from is the
[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:42.460]   sensible feeling that why would google want to allow forks of android isn't that bad for google
[01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:47.260]   to allow that at all so that's why i was when i was rushing is they're doing things to prevent it
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:53.340]   even if they're not that seems to be what people are arguing that google is making android on
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:57.980]   four bullet they're trying to take it as closed you know that it's really it's closed but it's
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:01.420]   wearing the open you know it's flying the open banner right there's just a whole fight
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:05.980]   developers hearts yeah but but but the really truthfully they're evil and try and take over
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:09.660]   the world and this is you know we've kind of heard this argument about android a whole bunch
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:14.380]   right yeah we heard of forgina right when when they weren't fast enough in opening up the the
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:20.860]   various versions yes all right they're they're they're knee capping open source yep yep yep yep
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:27.660]   exactly um and uh i just i don't i don't i don't think that that's true yeah um let's
[01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:32.940]   compel an argument yeah i just uh if people can't believe it i think you're right but i think people
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:38.060]   go no that can't be true google's not allowing this google must be trying to open his open his
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:42.620]   open because by the way that's what microsoft would do i mean the question is does google get some
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:48.540]   yucky ox out of this and start advertising that microsoft is using android uh
[01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:55.100]   no because it's not google android it has no googling is to it it's all over yeah that's true that's
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:25:00.620]   true they get no benefit that's true i mean the truth is though like that the the best android
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:09.100]   experience is aosp plus gms right i mean that's minus minus cross from other manufacturers right
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:15.180]   exactly right which is good job of getting rid of yes yeah right just plus only gms right you don't
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:21.020]   even want to the other crap amen and this is this is true because google shepherded aosp along they
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:25.820]   they this was they put they went all in on android and they said we're gonna build this is the platform
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:29.020]   we're gonna put out we're gonna build our great experiences on top of it much like they did with
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:35.180]   chrome um and no other company has had this sort of head start and you know no other company has
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:39.180]   kind of had this vision i mean i would love to see i would love to see two companies and maybe it's
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:46.940]   google and amazon working on the on the aosp actively uh you know in open in the public you know in
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:51.500]   public i want to see nightly commits i want to see why has a location services been updated is
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:57.100]   at google's responsibility it's an open source application it's everybody's responsibility anybody
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:01.500]   can update location services so when though when when people for accusations at google saying
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:06.940]   well they haven't updated the mail client on aosp for two years um and why should they because they
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:10.700]   want you to use the gmail and that means that they're evil i kind of feel like well you know
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:15.180]   theoretically if it's open source anybody can hack the email client and make it better submit
[01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:19.820]   patches back and get those you know brought into the open source project and so everyone can benefit
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:24.540]   i mean that's what open source is so that's the question has amazon for instance contributed back
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:30.540]   to the aosp so i asked i asked jason uh apple bound last night this because he follows uh aosp
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:35.420]   development more closely than i do and he says that yes they're having committers back to aosp from
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:40.220]   you know from from other companies plenty of them um more more i think the low level low level
[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:46.220]   pieces of the operating system but yeah that's including amazon uh yeah i believe so i believe
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:51.260]   i would i mean this is the proof in the pudding if nokia contributes back to aosp everybody wins
[01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:57.020]   right then then that's great yeah his his argument was though you know he knows he's like you know
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:02.140]   there's there's at least one bug major bug that i know of that has been fixed multiple times
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:06.140]   right by different people and is and the fix has never been pulled back right because what is what
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:11.340]   is in your interest right to have the fix in your software versus everybody having the fix in their
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:15.180]   software now that totally goes against the whole spirit of open source right is that you're contributing
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:18.860]   back and that you know stone soup that everyone is contributing and making easier and better for
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:23.020]   everyone but you know there's not there's not a whole lot of easy ways to enforce that and you
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:28.940]   know you need you need someone you need a leader who's who is encouraging that and and people who
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:35.100]   are helping out with that so um that's sad to hear i mean i i'd like to see more of there's a major
[01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:39.340]   bug location services that doesn't make it as good as gms let's just make location services as good
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:46.140]   as gms yeah i really i think what happens this is another case of the truth maybe not matching the
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:52.060]   narrative that people want to or expect where the i mean you would expect google to be uh
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:56.060]   churlish the dog and the manger and say well you know we don't want anybody to fork but in fact
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:28:01.100]   maybe they have been generous and maybe it is possible to fork a it's this default position of
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:06.860]   what's cool to do in badly right and and you know i know i'm going to come off as the fanboy once
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:11.980]   again but but so often when that question is asked the answer is oh nothing well
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:17.260]   we'll watch with a great interest this will be a good litmus test for that for all of that and
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:22.380]   how good how good a neighbor uh no kia slash microsoft is currently no kia has good so many
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:27.420]   chamois at nokia has been a huge contributor to linnox uh open source repository their neighbors
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:32.780]   uh but remember that's nokia now they're nokia microsoft or soon they will be nokia microsoft
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:39.500]   we'll see what happens uh there um i don't know if microsoft contributes much back to open source i
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:45.020]   don't know i mean i you know i bm we talked about last week how microsoft becomes the new i bm in some
[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:49.420]   ways right you know i bm certainly there's certainly your developers at microsoft who
[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:54.700]   work in their spare time and open source and i would think would love microsoft to contribute back
[01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:59.740]   um that's i mean i think at this point i think i think at this point any big software company
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:04.380]   just just for the purpose of winning developer hearts yes has to have some money and some resources
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:10.860]   dedicated to toward contributing back to beloved projects that we all use like the right thing to do
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:18.140]   it is yeah uh and uh web oh wait for force pointing out that nokia had mimo and migo which were
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:24.620]   linux based phone operating systems unfortunately orphaned um but that's where a lot of that development
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:29.020]   contributed back so really nokia's done this before they've taken the linux kernel and put a phone
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:37.180]   on top of it so it may not be such a stretch for them to do that um nest is final ftc approval
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:45.420]   google owns them um interesting that google also owns a fairly big stake alone novo now
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:52.540]   not merely thanks to the uh fact that they uh sold mo to roll into the novo partly for cash but partly
[01:29:52.540 --> 01:30:00.060]   for stock but uh after the deal closes they'll own 750 million linovo dollars worth of linovo
[01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:04.380]   so does that still put them in the same conflict that they were in before in terms of the other
[01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:07.980]   hardware mix of 5.94 percent stake so it's i don't know
[01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:14.380]   sarah's the finance person is is that a big enough stake to say for for people like htc and
[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:19.820]   sam's saying say oh google's still in the phone business it's 5.94 yeah it's not a majority it's not a
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:24.620]   significant it means big yeah i'm guessing every company has its own standard on that i mean it's
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:28.860]   on a regulatory issue right no well and it's on the hong kong exchange because that's where
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:38.060]   a linovo's traded um twitter guys did you go to twitter too we did we got to sit down with the
[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:44.220]   costalo ceo of twitter and former ceo of twitter adf williams about medium yep
[01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:47.660]   tell us about i'll tell you tell us about your trip then we'll take a break then we'll wrap it up
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:54.220]   because we're almost out of time well i'm new on my job i'm like five weeks old as a dean and i
[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:59.740]   figured uh why not grab jeff javis and come out to the west coast and be a reporter what's fun
[01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:06.060]   basically go around talking to the big uh executives who are leading technology companies here and
[01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:10.780]   find out how we can work better with them as a journalism school what their thoughts are about
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:16.220]   journalism education what our students need to to learn how to do in order to be successful as
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:22.060]   as our industries kind of converge so you focused on journalism i mean intersection of
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:26.540]   journalism and techno medium is a journalistic enterprise twitter is not but has some impact
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:31.500]   significant impact actually i mean there's some discussion about whether medium is indeed a
[01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:35.180]   journalistic enterprise i think some of the conversation this morning with them was really
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:42.780]   about the technology company primarily that loves stories ideas and ideas and they're not out to
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:48.540]   save journalism that's but they see themselves as a back end for some form of journalism a platform
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:53.420]   a platform what i think what i would say is not breaking news ever is that what he he does he said
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:56.780]   we read too much news he said this out loud he doesn't want to do that he doesn't want to do that he's
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:02.460]   done that twitter did that uh he's he's basically balancing he's his own invention of twitter i think
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:09.660]   it feels like a return to blogger in some ways but more to it i think you know they want to have
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:14.060]   the finest content creation tool they can have and they're there are a long way on that it's a it's
[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:18.700]   a beautiful elegant you submitted a lot of stuff i'm using a lot i'm writing a new uh white paper on
[01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:24.060]   you know the future of news why would you submit anything to medium instead of onto your own blog
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:30.860]   um well he writes about it on the blog too it's not mutually exclusive distribution right distribution
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:34.540]   yes you know the thing about medium from the very beginning i said this to have when he first showed
[01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:39.020]   it to me is that i find that when i start writing something on medium it raises the bar immediately
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:46.460]   on what i would write there and so i'm writing something that's more more thoughtful cared for
[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:55.180]   polished yeah uh then you know certainly twitter or my blog now ev kind of said that he wants me to go
[01:32:55.180 --> 01:33:00.860]   ahead wants us to explore ideas there and do things there um but i see there's there's the kind of little
[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:06.940]   um for the record post oh i think this or that and it's over i don't want to put that on medium
[01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:10.300]   medium you put a put a thought that you're working on and he wants it to be collaborative so you
[01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:15.820]   work with people i think that's a key difference ah so instead of just on my blog all by myself
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:21.180]   how is it collaborative comments at the end comments on the side but i take my own idea log i mean
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:25.260]   if there's comments by every idea and you can get into a conversation by every i can
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:30.140]   annotate your yes yes yes yes that's interesting and so you could ask a question you could leave
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:35.100]   a tk as we want that no some people wouldn't well in fact medium the first time i put something
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:40.940]   up there they offered to top to edit it for me and i said no thanks so they have editors they do
[01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:45.900]   have editors yeah just a technology company um well we asked them what they are you know everybody's
[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:51.020]   choking on this word that was on recode this week uh of of a plattisher a platform plattisher
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:56.220]   which is just gone awful yeah when i saw that i i said not to i couldn't finish reading it just
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:34:00.540]   because i every time i hit that word i was just if i was going over bridge is in tight yeah
[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:08.860]   but um no i think i think medium sees itself clearly as sarah said a technology company in a platform
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:16.220]   uh twitter is still a platform now part of the reason that i'm here just my own hidden agenda
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:22.220]   all this is that i think we've got to convince the titans of technology industry that when they
[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:28.700]   start to want to save news they don't make it a contribution they bring their best thoughts to it
[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:33.260]   they bring their technology and business experience to it and not give up on it and so that's what i
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:38.140]   want to do with the technology folks i've seen this week is to say no the things that you know how to do
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:45.580]   in in big technology we need that in news and journalism yes as opposed to just going straight
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:50.860]   to a sort of non-profit solution right in a charity well because it's not sustainable here
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:56.220]   amadar launched the intercepts he did uh very much commercialization of the news he's put a
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:35:00.300]   quarter of a billion dollars apparently into it and brought glenn greenwald and laura fitting
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:05.740]   over in fact they that they also brought that big stash of stoden documents along with them
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:09.340]   some of the complaint that that is the monetization of the snow so in documents
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:16.140]   um others have vociferously denied greenwald has and meantime he has shared some documents with
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:21.820]   nbc this week did something so i think he's trying to spread the loan uh yeah uh so i don't i don't
[01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:25.500]   yet know i tried to talk to amadar and i mean you're gonna talk to him about what his business
[01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:29.660]   model is i'm not sure that he knows yet what it is we've talked about bezos on the show before
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:33.820]   that the washington post i really hope he doesn't view it as a as a philanthropy but instead sees
[01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:38.220]   it as an opportunity to change the business models yeah um you there was an incredible
[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:44.060]   exchange this week absolutely amazing old p marka uh mark ederson on twitter has been going
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:49.180]   berserk all week in a wonderful way about the journalism business since it was wondering why
[01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:57.580]   everybody i know suddenly followed p marka now i understand yeah save us save us mark what did he
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:03.420]   say um mark ederson for those who don't know is a guy who wrote net scape or helped write net scape
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:09.100]   made a lot of money and is now a venture capitalist of interest of a major major note and and he's
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:14.860]   true to my heart he's saying that journalism can be a business now he's he's excited about
[01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:20.060]   crowdfunding which i think is one revenue stream and it's by no means a salvation but but he's
[01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:26.220]   he's yelling at the people in this part i love who say no journalism is give up on it it's not
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:32.060]   profitable um uh it's it's it's meant to be a charity and he's saying no it was badly run
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:36.220]   business i hear people saying that yeah a lot of my journals and friends are coming to us we love
[01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:41.580]   stories and the people who can tell stories all journalism is is telling a story about something
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:45.340]   that happens so that people understand it better right well that's one form of it i think the other
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:50.460]   forms i should say that to the professors here they probably will spank me they're saying that
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:55.100]   but it strikes me that that's the that's what we need is we need the story we need we understand
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:37:00.380]   things in terms of story humans do many of my professors would say the same thing i argue that
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:04.300]   stories are only one tool we have and we're not primarily storytellers what's the other story
[01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:10.140]   what's the other way to do it data data is not as is not as valuable as in fact that's why we're
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:15.500]   looking for if you give me the raw data that's one thing if you explain the raw data i.e. tell a story
[01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:20.060]   about it i'll give you an example after hurricane sandy or tomorrow after whatever weather channel
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:25.740]   is calling the next storm to hit jina um uh we'll get stories you know what the stories will say i
[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:31.020]   can write them right now gosh lana snow fell city digging out um on tv they're gonna put
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:35.820]   rulers in the snow and say gosh what it adds up over time they're gonna tell us all this you know
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:40.140]   so what would you like i want a tool that says what streets are open what streets are closed and
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:45.260]   i want that data to come from yes you bet it is it enables a community to share what it knows
[01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:49.180]   that's journalism okay you agree boss yeah i mean that's the sort of some of the thinking that we're
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:54.620]   doing right now is is should we be teaching our students how to be community organizers basically
[01:37:54.620 --> 01:38:00.300]   to engage individual communities and help provide information that helps them organize themselves
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:05.340]   and that's very that's sort of a new that's a broader definition than the truth yes nothing
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:09.980]   wrong with that nothing wrong i don't i mean i i i've been writing this this that's librarian
[01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:16.460]   no it's a platform maker that stopped us in our tracks who you call and like
[01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:25.420]   okay well we want to destroy some things i i part of the reason that i wanted to bring especially
[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:32.460]   sera here was to look at the wonders that are uh twit and and reinventing tv news which i think is
[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:36.620]   is vital well i'm never doing another stand up i can tell you that after you're vlog that's
[01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:43.180]   there's there's a very funny uh fox five uh video on there of a guy who i think it's uh it's the top
[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:49.420]   one because you got interviewed by fox fox five new york about about the stupid things they do
[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:54.220]   and whether uh story i'm surprised that they wanted to do that story to be honest with you
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:59.580]   but um that seems self that seems self-defeating yeah chat will have to play i don't have the
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:04.220]   capability of playing videos back in what happened to your laptop uh my daughter has it
[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:09.740]   ah she's using it for work during the christmas president this is an ad unfortunately but
[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:14.460]   i'm sorry about that i should have worn your chin it's all right i like Dwight David Eisenhower
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:18.460]   i particularly like robin william's rendition of Dwight David Eisenhower and the butler did you
[01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:26.460]   see that no very weird it's not the first person i'd have robin william's play no here we go voice
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:32.700]   is sometimes local news really can be a bit much we we know that this is a local news guy you know
[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:39.340]   what we are talking about obviously there are silly stories pointless live shots endless cliches
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:45.180]   and then there's joe walman joining us outside our building perfect i couldn't resist you're putting
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:50.700]   the putting the hand of the earpiece so we can hear the air let the lower third inside that's all right
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:55.420]   i let's see that in case you were in steven area i love putting my hand up to uh my earpiece here
[01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:59.820]   otherwise known as an ifb for all of you at home who didn't know this look behind me over here
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:06.220]   over here fox five news there's absolutely nothing going on right now so we decided to turn it all
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:13.340]   around for ghosts no me get in and tell all you concerned citizens at home exactly what annoys
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:23.420]   you and us most about this job time we never have enough a shocking revelations thanks local news
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:29.660]   think again time is valuable honestly who is time to waste maybe you do if you're watching
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:34.700]   this right now for the first time ever in this exclusive local news story we ask the tough
[01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:41.420]   questions does news ever annoy you we put cuny professor jeff jarvis on the hot seat to give this story
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:46.780]   at least an ounce of legitimacy doing a story about local tv news is a bit navel gazing but it's a
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:51.900]   good start because it shows me that you're willing to ask the tough questions about what's annoying
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:41:00.540]   about tv news like sticking rulers not an inch and a half and please no more wicked winter weather
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:06.540]   gimmicks thanks for that cliche reporter man and please stop reporter woman i've got uh this wind
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:12.540]   meter right here the winds are literally ripping across if you think this station had enough
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:19.260]   reporters covering its city severe weather its first night this was the second at times news we come
[01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:26.380]   across another chilling reality reporters stretching the truth these holy men walking on top of water
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:33.740]   holy smokes a canoe in just a few inches of water i've never wanted to need anchors as badly as
[01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:38.700]   during these recent blasts of cold arctic air all right we get the idea we don't have to keep going
[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:42.940]   give me a little fair let's that's good i like that yeah that's funny um i don't think you're
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:49.340]   going to stop doing stand-ups i would defend the stand-up but oh well okay i try try well again this
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:53.820]   comes but i see i understand now why you guys don't want to accept the fact that really what we are
[01:41:53.820 --> 01:42:00.460]   storytellers because that it allows some subjectivity to creep into no activities right you want
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:06.380]   some activities but the fact is the human brain wants people they want faces they want pictures
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:12.380]   that this is one of the reasons why i was reluctant to do video video is it's very clear to me the
[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:19.420]   audio is intellectual it's it's abstract it's ideas videos all about emotions video wants pictures and
[01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:24.940]   wants and so for television news to abandon the stand-up would be you know what do you get you get
[01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:31.500]   um you know the the mcmel lere or news report news hour you get more information you get more
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:36.860]   value well but people don't well people don't for you people don't want that the example what is
[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:44.860]   what is the job of the journalist to to are we the brussel sprouts of media or are we here to to help
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:50.380]   people understand stuff in a way that is palatable i would rather be a uh egg mcmuffin
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:57.500]   with some with some broccoli in there then to be just the broccoli on the plate i can't think of
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:04.540]   any food analogy here but i mean it's not again it's sort of not one thing or the other you know i
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:09.260]   mean i know i you're going ahead and be deep data i don't care no i mean it's a mix of things
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:13.260]   there's sometimes when i want to analyze data there's sometimes when i want to have a story that
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:17.180]   moves me there's sometimes when i want some deep complex analysis there's sometimes when i want
[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:20.940]   breaking news i mean those are all forms of journalism they're all critical i'm just saying
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:25.820]   you understand why local news has a ruler in the snow that's real yeah yeah it tells people what's
[01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:29.340]   going on here's the wind me here's the example here's here's here's the example i don't think
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:34.060]   they shouldn't lie about a rowboat in three inches of water that's stupid that is bad but there's
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:38.380]   also stupid i have pictures on the blog of people standing up in front of the George Washington bridge
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:42.700]   and the christy scandal we have a new jersey right there's no journalism to be had there
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:48.940]   no of course there's no visuals there there's no pictures if you do tv i'm sorry you have to have
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:55.340]   pretty picture i don't think chris christy's pretty yeah he's pretty i would have a picture of christy
[01:43:55.340 --> 01:44:00.780]   in fact i'd have him on there of course you want tv you know you're you're you have a respect as soon
[01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:04.460]   as you go to video you have a responsible to fill the screen responsibility fill the screen with
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:10.220]   something and you might as well make it pretty well okay so so so there's a jury on the trial doesn't
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:14.460]   mean you can't have solid information so what i think is very important and i know you guys
[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:19.740]   teach this is that there be this very solid foundation of journalistic ethics where you don't
[01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:26.540]   make up stories you don't fudge things you don't attempt to prove a point by editing you you care
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:32.540]   most and most deeply about communicating to your audience the truth about a story to give them the
[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:37.180]   information they need to make the judgment that they need to make as good citizens and you do the
[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:42.620]   things that are in the service of that yes all of that we agree that is the foundation of what you
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:46.940]   teach right so all we're disagreeing about is how you present it and i would say that sometimes you
[01:44:46.940 --> 01:44:51.020]   want to present it with a little bit of but here here's the give you another example so so the jury
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:56.540]   is out in the trial i use this example of the blog and um what do they do the anchor says the
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:45:00.140]   trial is going on this is what happened in the trial now we're going to go to the you know gina
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:04.780]   chapanese in the uh panel courtroom gina chapanese is going to say in that closed door behind me
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:08.540]   there's a jury we don't know what the f they're doing i actually have nothing to say to you
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:12.460]   but uh yeah the crowd's going on it's about this and that and that now back to you the anchor coming
[01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:16.700]   back and says we don't will tell you as soon as we hear anything all of which can be summarized in
[01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:21.100]   jury's still out for more go to the web and then they could get another story and they get more
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:26.620]   value in it's a it's a waste of precious journalistic resource the reporters don't report they are
[01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:32.860]   well ops a i would i would question whether how precious there's a lot of a lot of people that you
[01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:38.300]   could put out there with the camera operator um that stuff's not precious that's what tv news does
[01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:44.380]   and and i would just say that if you did this imaginary tv news station that you would like to do
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:49.100]   no one would freaking watch it and part of your mandate is not merely to tell the truth and get
[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:53.900]   the story up but to get somebody to watch it nobody's watching it now i mean the the numbers if you
[01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:57.500]   well that's only because there's other places you can have people staying but i mean i i don't know
[01:45:57.500 --> 01:46:01.660]   you have kids i have kids they don't want you to they watch you know any news that they're getting
[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:05.260]   they're getting on the laptop there's stuff on youtube that is any less
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:10.060]   it's youtube's full of stuff is oh yeah i was not trying to be news
[01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:15.260]   on but it's presentational if you look at the presentation on youtube a lot of attention to
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:21.980]   presentation otherwise nobody watches it i watch uh epic mealtime which has no content yeah has no
[01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:28.540]   content my son loves it because it's because of what they're seeing and doing he loves they're
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:34.300]   mushing the i don't just do it here's here's where i think the conflation of informing and
[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:39.020]   entertaining is the issue that's usually set in terms of oh it's it's crappy tv what i was trying
[01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:43.820]   to say is something different is that if i want to read a long if i want to read a novel that's
[01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:47.900]   entertainment if i want to read a long new yorker story that's often entertainment snowfall the
[01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:51.820]   times did that everybody loved was really to me entertainment because i don't i'm i was awake
[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:57.020]   at the time as much as everybody loved it that was a waste of time and money and a lot of money
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:47:02.540]   and i would i would and this is very not politically correct i would complain far more about that
[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:08.220]   than some idiot anchor with nice hair standing out in the rain i to me that is a bigger waste of
[01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:12.220]   money and resources that added nothing in both conversation and i think there's ways that we
[01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:17.580]   could probably inform you when i had my coffee with katie koreg did you mention this to katie
[01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:21.180]   uh well yeah i'd be curious what she thought i wanted to know how long it was going to take you
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:26.060]   to i know it's a little bit longer than i thought here this shows almost over too long this week
[01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:33.340]   uh and and and so one thing i said was you you the one difference i see in going to yahoo is you
[01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:37.900]   don't have to fill a clock anymore right we we over fill the clock here at twin but you don't ever
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:41.500]   have any problem filling the clock no you don't have to fill the clock anymore and if you want to
[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:45.820]   say what's new in a story you can do that in a minute 30 and then not have to say anything more
[01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:50.220]   until something actually happens so part of what tb does is think we have to have video video video
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:54.540]   video because we have to fill an hour well if you instead your job is to inform people maybe you
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:57.980]   can do that in a minute 30 you're not experiencing television is very different from that in fact my
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:02.780]   experience of television was that we never had enough time that there was always the urgency to get
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:07.900]   stuff done in less time and that hurt tb more than anything else that's where you edit out the pieces
[01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:11.580]   of him downloading the malware because it not because you don't want that information because it
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:17.260]   takes too much time there is never enough time in in mainstream media why did they waste so much
[01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:21.340]   of it on on idiot standing upward nothing happened i don't think they consider that wasted i think
[01:48:21.340 --> 01:48:26.620]   they consider that the way that they make a palatable product that's my problem is that's the
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:30.700]   orthodoxy of old tb this is the way we make tb's it's got to be the only way because it's the way
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:34.700]   we've always done it and i'm saying i want you know what you're gonna do what i'm bringing you to
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:40.380]   new york we're having an event at cuny and reinventing we should have a debate now i'm gonna have you
[01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:47.260]   in a hat and a hacking tb event i would just i i feel like i want to argue the case for the average
[01:48:47.260 --> 01:48:52.300]   joe who sits down in front of the tv and i understand what you need to do in television you need to make
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:55.980]   it which we don't do here but you need but you need to make pretty pictures i think you're the
[01:48:55.980 --> 01:48:59.820]   proof that you don't need to you need to make a new physically are the proof that you don't need
[01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:03.580]   pretty pictures that's why we have jina ladies and gentlemen she's a trip nay
[01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:08.380]   you know i jeff i really like i thought that you're bringing up circa was really at circa's that that
[01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:13.660]   that news app um i love it i love it i barely look at it but it notifies me when i need like so you
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:18.860]   can follow a story and it notifies me when there's something new right and when there's an update
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:24.060]   to the story and i i really i really like that and i like that you're pointing that you know the way
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:29.180]   the tv news works now is that it's just people explaining the same you know thing the same story
[01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:32.380]   if you have all the background you're just hearing the same thing repeated over and over and over
[01:49:32.380 --> 01:49:37.260]   again but what you really want is just to know has did the jury come back what was the verdict
[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:41.580]   well you raise that don't tell me whether or not only don't tell me if they have right i don't
[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:46.620]   want to hear anything else we went to visit circa this week as well and and they make a big
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:50.940]   point of that saying that once you already know enough in the story then all you want is the
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:54.780]   update you want to follow the story that's a new opportunity we didn't have in big old news you
[01:49:54.780 --> 01:50:00.220]   know if circa came out of benha of icon has cheeseburger actually saying i think we need to rethink
[01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:04.620]   how we deliver journalism in fact i remember uh going to food camp he was there were you at that
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:08.300]   food camp jina i was and we went back to the cottage and did the show with an afterwards
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:13.100]   uh i remember he had done with it yeah before he did circa he said let's i want to talk with you
[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:17.980]   about what's wrong with journalism what's wrong with news and how we can do a better job and then
[01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:21.580]   and circa i think is quite successful but it's a different thing i mean yeah
[01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:26.460]   and connected devices are a little different you they are more goal-oriented
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:32.220]   than sitting down in front of a television or you question the orthodoxy of television you blew
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:36.140]   up the orthodoxy of television yet here you are defending it to me i am defending it because it
[01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:42.460]   works really well i hate to tell you that here's the bad news it's working the audience is dying
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:50.460]   by what measure by what measure is it working um well okay okay you would say tv news is that
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:55.900]   thing that's on the box that comes with the air i would merely say video news and i would say
[01:50:55.900 --> 01:51:01.260]   youtube counts in other words oh well we're consuming consuming well no the turkey
[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:07.260]   circa is very different so there so there are ways of getting uh information of via web browser
[01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:12.220]   and so forth but i think what succeeds is people like to this is why we spent a million and a half
[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:17.900]   dollars to do this people like to watch video they like to the lean back experience is not a
[01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:23.100]   dead experience by any means in effect i will give you the measure people watch more television
[01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:28.540]   now than they did ten years ago that's the bad news the number of hours at look it up look at the tv
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:33.260]   news portion well maybe any age there are in the age of the people who are watching tv news and the
[01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:38.860]   portion of the tv news segments that is actually news as opposed to weather sports yeah it's really
[01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:43.980]   that i agree with that i agree with but that's that is the failure of local news that is the failure
[01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:47.980]   of local news local news is always been horrific well that's really what we're focusing on i would
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:52.220]   agree with you but i don't think the stand-up is the problem there i think first i think the biggest
[01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:57.340]   problem with with that is underestimating the intelligence of your audience and this comes
[01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:01.580]   again from many years in the snow i have worked for all the networks and i know
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:07.020]   they don't want you to think of the audience is intelligent and that's kind of a mistake if you
[01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:13.420]   ask me because guess what you get stupid people but that's well anyway this has nothing to do with
[01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:18.780]   google hi jina how are you how's things up going can i just say that there was someone in the chat
[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:23.980]   room who said he he wanted or she wanted to go for wood paneling based on this i think this is
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:28.060]   fat you're changing you're changing that's the leader of the twig what do you think what do you
[01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:33.980]   think of yahoo's effort at news this is a very and to me this is a very good example of yahoo
[01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:39.180]   assuming people are not too bright so um this every morning i get this is the newest thing from
[01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:46.140]   yahoo it is a total of nine stories okay in in nine different categories i can interact with it
[01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:52.860]   presumably it will update it and at the bottom it's gamified you've read zero
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:53.580]   you schmuck you
[01:52:53.580 --> 01:53:01.340]   and i said you kittens the more you click yeah but they but there is real news here uh katrina's
[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:05.500]   mayor uh new Orleans mayor uh katuna here convicted on corruption charges
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:10.220]   senate approves debt limit now when i go to this this is the product they bought from that kid
[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:15.260]   who was doing some eyes yes he was summarizing new so when i go to it i don't get the actual
[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:21.820]   canonical article here i get a a computer generated summary of the stuff you need to know although
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:29.820]   i have to say it's not so bad and then i can get additional stuff tweets and so forth down here
[01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:35.100]   i think this is an interesting look i'm surprised you guys haven't seen this uh
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:40.380]   darak jeter will retire after now this is a sports section right so this is a summary not from any
[01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:45.500]   one source but summarized by yahoo summarized uh programmatically
[01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:52.220]   i don't it didn't take long for calicones to copy this too oh Jason has no new ideas that's obvious
[01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:59.020]   um wow big picture oh he has it it just copies everything right it is actually i had a conversation
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:04.940]   this week with the the club of people who've been copied by Jason it's a big club i made you
[01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:06.700]   remember a fairly large club yes it is
[01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:14.060]   you know i actually like Jason calicones but that that's a fact there's no way around that
[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:18.620]   so that's another way to do news i just think that when we use these devices it's more goal
[01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:23.020]   oriented than when we watch tv my goal when i watch tv is sit back relax and enjoy which is part of
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:27.500]   what's heresy and that's why and the young people don't do that yes they do they just do it on you
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:32.940]   so you know how my son's not a different model you know how my son consumes youtube on the big
[01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:37.020]   screen tv he's got it hooked up to the apple tv and they just go through clips and they watch it
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:41.580]   that all that is is they're programming their own tv you know but they're still leaning back
[01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:43.980]   but it's not with local news you know produced by local
[01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:49.500]   no the only time they watch local news is when there's gaffs yes yes they quite enjoy that which
[01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:51.020]   there are many which there are many
[01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:57.020]   yeah that was the uh yahoo news app that i was showing there for those of you who want to
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:01.900]   try that themselves i like circle a lot i like the yahoo news app a lot but i do feel like how we
[01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:06.540]   use news on these devices is very yeah that's it's very goal oriented i love this discussion and
[01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:10.140]   we're gonna we're gonna have it again warn you our show today brought to you by coming up our
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:15.340]   tips and tools and numbers of the week our show today brought to you by square space a better
[01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:20.780]   web awaits i loved their super bowl commercial filled with all the junky memes of the inner
[01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:26.220]   yeah click here you know lose 50 pounds and 50 minutes all that stuff uh and and square space is
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:33.100]   saying essentially this that the the web has become this spam cluttered space but but square
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:39.580]   space lets you change that with an elegant simple design that lets you make your website stand out
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:44.620]   website look good i just saw that matt cuts has said that they're going to downgrade on google search
[01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:49.500]   sites that have too many ads on the page two big ads at the front uh they're going to get
[01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:54.300]   let fewer search results he's saying effectively google saying we want more content a square
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:56:00.220]   space site is going to give you great seo in fact they do support all the all the things google asks

[01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:41.900]   i have two of those so that didn't work uh but it will work if you just don't want to say the name
[01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:48.060]   of your i have i used to work for a a nefarious mobile named robert maxwell who bought the new

[02:05:56.540 --> 02:06:02.940]   barcode reader very similar to and you can use it the same way um but uh it's unfortunately it's a
[02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:08.060]   buck ninety-nine but it is on sale right now so that's okay particularly for qr codes but uh
[02:06:08.060 --> 02:06:11.900]   anyway but i'll also do paper well actually you know what now i'm thinking it doesn't oh
