[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.800]   Gina Tripani is here from smarterware.org.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.800]   And to think of that.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.800]   Hello!
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.800]   And all about Android.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.800]   All about Android.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.800]   All about Android.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.800]   Did a good show last night.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.800]   Oh.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.800]   I was expecting to download it.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.800]   Oh.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.800]   What is it?
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.800]   What it would give us one wonderful thing that happened.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.800]   Well, my favorite part of the show is the arena.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.800]   It's the App Arena.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.800]   We each pick an app and then we present it.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   We do.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.800]   We demo it.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.800]   People vote.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   We just do some really great apps.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.800]   I download apps like Crazy because of that show.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   Yep.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   Yep.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   All about Android.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   Go to a.tv/triplea and you'll find it.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   Also here from the Netherlands.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.800]   Jeff Jarvis who's been all over the place.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.800]   He was in India like three minutes ago.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   Hey Jeff.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   Another, hi there.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800]   Yeah, another ridiculously short trip.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.800]   I'm here basically for a day and a half.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.800]   Oh my gosh.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   Oh.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   Jeff.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800]   Oh, tell her.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   No.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   Yeah, it looks pretty.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   I'm a professor of journalism at SUNY CUNY, the City University of New York.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.800]   CUNY CUNY.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   CUNY CUNY.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   CUNY CUNY.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.800]   He's also the author of Public Parts and he comes to us via a Chromebook Pixel.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   Very nice Chromebook Pixel.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   But we had to modify it running Linux via a Google project called crouton that lets us run Skype on it.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   Not Google's fault.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   Microsoft's fault for not doing a web app of Skype.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   Well, or you could say our fault for not running web RTC.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   Or Twigs fault for not running web RTC or Google Hangout, which we should be doing on this show of all shows.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   I don't think we could use a hangout because we'd have all these little people under you.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   Hmm.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   Jeff gets to beat his chest though when he says that he's installed.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   Linux on the Pixel.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   I didn't even put crouton on this Pixel.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   I have a loner Pixel I'm reviewing.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   Very similar to yours, Jeff.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   It's the LTE version.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   I don't know.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   There's a sense of this ascension among the ranks.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   I don't know.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   Well, first of all, it's hot in hell right here.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   But I, it's beautifully made.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   I mean, it's a nice piece of aluminum.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   But I canceled my order after playing with this for one day.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.800]   I just can't, can't, I can't justify 1600 bucks for this.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   I, however, being the true twigger.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   You are living in the cloud.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   You drink your own champagne, my friend.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   Although in this case, it's more like you're in than champagne, but okay, drink it.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.800]   Oh, I spelled my own for it.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   So Leo doesn't like to pixel and Jeff loves it.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.800]   I really love it.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   I still don't think the 3-2 aspect ratio really makes a lot of sense.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   I guess it does for a browser-only experience maybe.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.800]   But it just feels constrained.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   Maybe my problem is I use other computers, right?
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   If you didn't use other computers, it'd be fine.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   But it feels like a little bit like a toy computer.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.800]   And we were showing you some sluggishness, particularly on, it's not all pages.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   But on the verge.com, there's a hesitation when you try to scroll.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.800]   Now they're trying to tell me it's this machine.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   I don't think so.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.800]   But maybe I'll go find another one and try it.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   Jeff says he never sees any hesitation at all.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.800]   It wouldn't surprise me though.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   I mean, I know what's in here and it's not the fastest stuff in the world.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.800]   And there's not a huge amount of RAM either.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   Here's the one time it got weird on me when I was in Delhi in the hotel room
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   where you couldn't open the windows and the air conditioning was weird.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.800]   And so it got muggy.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   And the capacitive, the scroll on both ends on the screen and the trackpad got wonky.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.800]   Oh, maybe it's muggy here.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   Because it feels sticky.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   That's what happened.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   And it was really weird.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.800]   It hasn't happened since.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   It was a problem.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.800]   If you live in India, you know, but the humidity caused it to go really wonky.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.800]   It feels a little sticky.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   You know, it's not as slippery as it would be.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.800]   I mean, it is a beautiful screen.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   It's not more beautiful than other screens on the market.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.800]   In fact, you know, the retina display and the MacBooks are roughly the same.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   And I have a, you know, this Windows machine I have in front of me is a, you know,
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   1920 by 1080 screen.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   And it's probably similar resolution.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   Very close.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.800]   I'd rather have nothing than Windows, which is what I got.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   Well, I kind of agree with you on that.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   I'm figuring should I wait for Windows blue?
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   The updates out in a few months or should I just put Linux?
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.800]   Say the hell with it and put Linux on this box.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.800]   I don't know.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   I don't know.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.800]   So yeah, April Fool's was two days ago.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.800]   And thank God it's over.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   Thank you.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.800]   Thank God it's over.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   Nobody likes this.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.800]   Yeah, I hate it, especially if you're a tech journalist or a journalist of any kind.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   Yes.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   Because people were making up crap.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   And it's difficult for Google.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   I mean, Google's always been sort of dedicated to elaborate April Fool's jokes and many years.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   Like they've been pretty good, right?
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   But now that they're on the spring cleaning thing where they're shutting down products,
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.800]   I think that the reaction to some of the more elaborate April Fool's presentations are,
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.800]   well, why did you just keep reader open?
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   You know, if you dedicated the energy that you put toward.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   Exactly.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.800]   You know, why toward keeping reader open, I wouldn't be scrambling to find another RSS reader.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.080]   Not like this year there was kind of a little, little tension, a backlash more so than in
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   other years.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   I don't know.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.080]   Did you guys get that?
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.080]   Yes.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.280]   It's like you think, well, golly, they must have been working on this all year.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.720]   For instance, the YouTube shutting down video.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.560]   Very nice.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.280]   Somebody put a lot of work into that.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.280]   What was the best?
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.280]   Was it Gmail Blue?
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.280]   Did you like that one?
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.520]   They're not that funny.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.200]   Google Google knows.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.600]   I liked Bing's.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   Good joke.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.960]   I don't know if they're still doing it at Bing.com.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.840]   If you search for Google, and yeah, it doesn't do it anymore.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.560]   You got a googly version of Bing, which is pretty funny.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.240]   They use it as an opportunity to slam Google once again.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.640]   Oh, it just looked like Google.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.800]   They switched the design.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.800]   I was saying I'm feeling lucky, what did it say?
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.600]   I can't remember now, but it was pretty funny.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.320]   It's pretty funny.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.520]   I just put up a new clip in the rundown, the bottom of the Google section.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.720]   The Atlantic says that we should be worried about the Google.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.520]   About the Google what?
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.920]   Your jokes.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.040]   Worried because it's such a...
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:18.760]   I think what is happening, I would guess, is the engineers love them, right?
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:24.320]   Google being an engineering driven company is not going to get in the way of the engineers,
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:31.000]   should they wish to have some fun.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.040]   But it's not there 20%, right?
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.040]   I hope not.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.040]   I hope not.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.040]   Hope not.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:43.760]   Yeah, it just feels like this started back when Google was small and had that.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.640]   I mean, pranks are part of the hacker ethic, right?
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:53.360]   So back when Google was just kind of small and filled with a bunch of mischievous engineers,
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.000]   coming from that place, it made a lot of sense.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.160]   But Google's huge now, and they've got so many resources.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.800]   And again, against the backdrop of shutting down all these other products and focusing,
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.520]   it's just hard to...
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.960]   The more elaborate the video or the more you're like, "Ah, this is weird."
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.280]   Yeah, and this YouTube thing, what were they doing?
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.160]   They're reading every description of every YouTube video ever uploaded.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.000]   YouTube is nominated, and we will be counting those down, and they will be reviewed by our
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.480]   panel of judges over the next 10 years.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.680]   We'll be here today for the next 12 hours, and for the better part of the next two years,
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.320]   or however long it takes to read all of the nominees.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.320]   It's very exciting.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.320]   Mm-hmm.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.320]   On behalf of...
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.320]   This is not very funny.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.320]   I would like to thank you all for your hard work for every...
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   This goes...
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.000]   The dedication award goes to this, because literally...
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   It's a 12-hour video.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Look at it.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   The first four hours...
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   They live streamed...
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Well, something.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Subscribe.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   No.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And...
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Every single title and description of...
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.240]   You gotta think that these presenters, about four hours in are thinking, "Oh boy, this
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.240]   wasn't a good idea."
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.240]   What's the...
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.240]   Actors be judged.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.240]   Actors be judged.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.680]   The first time you've ever seen a block long Hong Kong terror.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.080]   Pitbull, I know you want me.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.520]   Girls shoot behind the scenes.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.520]   Who wants to make 23 hours a day uploading files.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.520]   And they didn't...
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.520]   They...
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.520]   Never.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.520]   I also give you forums.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.520]   It's the same people all the way through.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.520]   The whole...
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.920]   Look, we're eight and a half hours in.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.920]   Same people.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.920]   Oh, God.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.920]   Now, at 10...
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.720]   They've gotta be thinking, "I am in hell."
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.720]   I've gone to hell.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.240]   This is hell.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.720]   I realize now this was...
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.720]   I'm gonna kill my agent.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.360]   But I mean, and then just watching this...
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.920]   I mean, this is definitely a livestream event.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.520]   You know, there were around 30,000 people live.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.520]   Horrible.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.520]   I mean, it's just 30,000 people watched this.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.520]   No, I got it.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.520]   They started their browser.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.520]   They went to bed.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.520]   There's over a million views on this video.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.520]   What?
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.520]   Well, and there you go right there.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.520]   That tells you something about YouTube view counts.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.520]   Because that's a 12 hour video.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.520]   A million people didn't watch a 12 hour video.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.520]   A million people watched the first 10 seconds as we have.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.520]   But you can see like...
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.520]   He's taking a break over there.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.520]   A lot of them did what we just did which is say, "Well, come on.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.520]   Are they still there at the end?"
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.520]   Yes.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.520]   So at the very, very end, they all take a nap.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.520]   They get in bed.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.520]   And that's the end of the day.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.520]   Oh, and then they went home to their children and said, "That was...
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.520]   That was what I do for you."
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.520]   So a YouTube counts of view is if you push the play button but don't finish a video, that's counted as a view.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.520]   They count starts, yeah.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.520]   So it's not...
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.520]   It doesn't have to be a complete view.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.520]   Oh gosh, no.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.520]   Well, nobody knows.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.520]   But I think that's pretty obvious that nobody...
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.520]   One point, too many people didn't watch 12 hours.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.520]   So I think we know at least that much.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.520]   Well, I was going to say, if we have proof, that video is proof.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   We don't know how much...
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.520]   How far you have to go before they count it.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.520]   But for instance, when we count views, we actually count...
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.520]   We're very careful not to count partial downloads or partial views.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.520]   We count the full thing.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.520]   It does not have to be a complete view.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.520]   And I don't think anybody's ever said that.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.520]   This was a good one.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.520]   Google Treasure Map.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.520]   Can you see my screen?
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.520]   Google Treasure Map?
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.520]   I guess they probably could write a program that did this, right?
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.520]   I don't know.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.520]   Yeah, that's cute.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.520]   Yeah, that's cute.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.520]   Yeah, I can.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.520]   Maps hack.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.520]   They've always got to map.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.520]   They did an 8-bit one last year, remember?
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.520]   Yeah, they've done like...
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.520]   Well, actually, it was probably not a joke, but they've done the moon and they've done the
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.520]   sea.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.520]   That's real.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.520]   They ain't no joke.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.520]   That's not a joke.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.520]   I apparently live in a forest.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.520]   That's cool.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.520]   There was a better video, a funnier video, the guy who was in the forest.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.520]   A funnier video that Google did of like, why we're wrapping it up and stuff like that.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.520]   I thought the nose video was funny.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.520]   Google nose?
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.520]   Google nose?
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.520]   I hate April Fools, but I had the say I charted, I don't know.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.520]   It is Google nose beta.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.520]   John Woody.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.520]   I'm tracking across the internet.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.520]   Most of the knowledge.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.520]   It's books, videos.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.520]   Look at his nose.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520]   Is there something odd about his nose?
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.520]   There's a search experience that we'd overlooked.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.840]   The task as designers is to get our users the information they're looking for as quickly
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.520]   and as beautifully as possible.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.520]   Yes.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.520]   But until now, we couldn't always give users what they're looking for because sometimes
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.520]   they're not looking at all.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.520]   My wife and I have a puppy with so much energy that we walk her five times.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.520]   This is mostly, this isn't funny.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.520]   That's the problem.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.520]   This is how she gets information about her world.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.520]   Photo, auditory, olfactory, sensory convergence is a phenomenon that's been down to science
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.520]   and it's a lot of people.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.520]   This is, yeah, this is actually -- You like this?
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.520]   All right.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.520]   I think it's true to all their other -- you know, someone has watched a lot of Google
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.520]   videos.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.520]   It's the style.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.520]   It's definitely a style and it's dead pan.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.520]   They're straight-faced.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.520]   They're straight-faced.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.520]   They're just being grumpy about Google layout.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.520]   No.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.520]   And I'll defend them.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.520]   I don't think if you aggregate all the energy put into these, what is it?
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.520]   Of April Fool's jokes, even if you are generous, it's not going to be enough to keep Google
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.520]   Reader alive.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.520]   Or is it?
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.520]   Stop and smell the roses.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.520]   Now with Google knows beta, the roses are just -- You know what?
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.520]   Here's what it is.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.520]   I've said this before.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.520]   It's just tone deaf after you kill something that's very popular like Google Reader and
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.520]   you get all these people complaining about it to release all of these April Fool's things
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.520]   just says, yeah, not only do we kill Give a Reader, but we're just screwing around basically.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.520]   Popular amongst the geeks, right?
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.520]   We need to the ones who watch these videos.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.520]   Right.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.520]   But it was too late.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.520]   I mean, what are they going to do?
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.520]   We've decided to cancel April Fool's in honor of Google Reader.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.520]   They're stuck.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.520]   Right.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.920]   But you could see why it's not the best communication to put out.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.420]   But honestly, I don't think that the amount of time put into this is enough to keep a
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.280]   product alive from very long.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.520]   I mean, this is the thing.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.960]   Everyone who's saying, well, why didn't they just open source Reader or how much could
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.120]   it have really cost to maintain Reader?
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.120]   I don't know.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.520]   It seems strange to me.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.720]   I mean, I think the reason, part of the main reason why Reader works so well is because
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.480]   it used Google's crawler and search technology, right?
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.720]   To detect, to get those feeds and detect whether or not they changed.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.480]   And you know, it's basically that engine, the Google Reader engine, from what I understand
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.240]   was tied very closely to Google's general search engine.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.200]   That's not something they could open source very, very easily.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   And you know, I guess they could have kept a couple of people hanging around to maintain
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.960]   it seems like the worst, the worst job ever, right?
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   And right.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.600]   But again, the question is what impact does that have on other applications?
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.600]   Right.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.600]   Exactly.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.600]   Right.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.600]   Exactly.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.600]   There's the cost of maintenance, right?
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.600]   You can't just let the product just stay stable.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.080]   The fact is that Google is constantly changing things that affect all their products across
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.440]   the board, especially with the privacy policy and the consolidation that they've been doing.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.040]   And you know, you'd have to have there have to be active development going on there.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.160]   So it just seems like a strange thing for people to say.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.720]   And I agree, Leo, I don't think that the energy they put into these, these April Fool's
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.920]   dose could really kept Google, Google Reader alive longer.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:59.240]   But you can understand why people would say like, yeah, you're taking away a tool, especially
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.320]   for the people who use it every day.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.960]   You're taking away the tool that I use every day, but you're trying to make these stupid
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.720]   videos kind of even worse than that.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.480]   You created a tool that put all the other RSS readers out of business and then killed
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.480]   it.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.480]   And I don't think Google did it on purpose, but it's more people watch these jokes than
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.800]   ever used reader.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.880]   But are they happier because of it?
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.560]   Well, I like that in that same Atlantic article.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:28.200]   In that same Atlantic article, Rebecca Greenfield points out that Netflix had some fun on April
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   Fool's Day.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.720]   I didn't notice this, but some of the recommended categories Netflix had a fun like reality
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:39.880]   TV about people with no concept of reality or TV shows where defiantly crossed arms mean
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.880]   business.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.680]   Now that's funny and took about five minutes.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.760]   You know, that's fantastic.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.080]   That's a good April Fool's joke.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.080]   It doesn't intrude.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.760]   It doesn't change the experience.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.240]   It's obviously a joke, but it's not a prank.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.720]   I don't like pranks.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.720]   Now Google blue.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.520]   That's actually a thing.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.480]   That's actually a theme that's available for Gmail.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:09.640]   And it is a jab at Microsoft's updates for all of its products, which are all codenamed
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.480]   blue.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.760]   And they say Gmail blue because Brown was a disaster.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:24.240]   We decided that we were going to do something that is exactly the same as before, but blue.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.040]   And that's kind of what they're saying is Microsoft's doing blue.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:33.760]   Gmail blue was part of the initial conception for Gmail when it was launched at the time
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.000]   the technology was simply not there.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.560]   The culture of Google really is to incorporate moonshot thinking to every project.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.560]   It's taken us six years to develop the technology.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:48.000]   Now, you might not know this, but if you follow Microsoft closely, this is as echoes of what
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.640]   Microsoft was saying about Windows 8.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.080]   This is their response to screw-able.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:18:00.760]   I've made your challenge was how do we make this intimate, intuitive, realistic, and organic?
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:05.120]   In trying to bring email into the 21st century, we were faced with a challenge.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.200]   How do we completely redesign and recreate something while keeping it exactly the same?
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   Now that you say that, Leo, I haven't caught that.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.600]   You are absolutely right.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.600]   It is right there.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:22.680]   Yeah, it's a shot at Microsoft, especially because Microsoft's next edition of Windows
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.840]   Windows 8.1, I guess we'll call it, is called blue.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.840]   But that's all right.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.840]   Screwables do you know?
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.640]   I think they had to respond to that.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.640]   Gmail blue.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.640]   You click on compose.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.720]   The button compose blue.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.560]   The word compose itself blue.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.560]   Old faces blue.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.560]   Underlines blue.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.560]   This is pretty funny.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.040]   You write in the body.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.040]   And this didn't take long.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.040]   The font comes up blue.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.040]   You don't have to make it blue.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.040]   It is blue.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.040]   It just is blue.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.040]   Blue lines.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.040]   You're in blue.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.040]   When you want to know.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.040]   Okay, all right.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.040]   It's blue.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.600]   It's Gmail, only a bluer.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.040]   They did have to spend some money on the blue man group.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.440]   We explore at least blue paint for some Googlers.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.440]   I don't know.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.680]   Is that a lot of different color?
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.680]   Trademark.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.680]   Orange Brown.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   Brown is a disaster.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.680]   We tried yellow.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:13.920]   By the way, Brown was a disaster for the zoom brown as well.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.400]   I don't know if that's intentional.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.760]   Came from nature.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.760]   Ocean.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.760]   Sky.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.760]   Blue whales.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.720]   A blue that was reminiscent of nature but better than what nature created.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.200]   Gmail blue is.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.200]   It just is.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.240]   Are they also making butter, bris, and mire and all the fight over fight.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.240]   The right blue.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.240]   Ooh.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.240]   Interesting.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.240]   That's right.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:41.480]   That's a fabled story that she tested 20 blues or whatever.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.480]   Ooh.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.680]   When that designer left Google, right?
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   Yes.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.240]   That's the posting post that said I had to defend.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.280]   My designers in tuition had nothing to do with how colors were chosen, right?
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.160]   Colors were chosen by AB tests.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.160]   Mm-hmm.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:04.000]   Now, the moon shot thinking comes from Andy Rubin.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.480]   And Larry Page is farewell to him.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.600]   And everyone where he says he's off to do more moon shots.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.400]   So that's making fun of themselves.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.880]   So I guess that's OK.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   That we like.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   April Fool's is.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.880]   It's.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.880]   It's.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.880]   It's.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.880]   It's.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.880]   It's.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.880]   It's.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.320]   I think I want to combine April the two worst holidays April Fool's and St. Patrick's Day.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.320]   And just get them over with.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.480]   Oh, that's good.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.960]   And why don't you like St. Patrick's Day?
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.960]   Broken amateurs.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.960]   Amateur.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   It's.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.960]   St. Patrick's Day in New York is the worst.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.960]   Amateur hours.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.720]   All particularly in Manhattan.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.360]   Yeah, it's terrible.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.360]   OK.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:44.760]   It's so bad now that Howard Stern has made it a regular annual feature to send guys out
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.680]   to interview drunken teenagers dressed in green.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.680]   Google Glass.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   Do we we talked about the disqualification last week, right?
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.000]   No, we didn't.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.520]   The winners hadn't been announced.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.480]   Oh, our show last week.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.640]   Some of them had Leo read about three or four of them last week.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.640]   Sorry.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.640]   And Jeff, congratulations.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.880]   Jeff got it.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.240]   I can now spend another $1,500 on a Google product that Leo is going to make fun of.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.840]   No, well, I've made fun of it already, but I'll have one too.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.880]   At least we'll be making fun of them wearing dorky glasses together.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.200]   Nikki Graziano, you know, the whole idea of this contest was a Twitter contest.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.080]   Hashtag if I had glass, what you would do.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.760]   Nikki Graziano won glass her her a tweet.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.720]   If I had glass, I'd cut a bitch.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.760]   But first they gave it to her and then they withdrew it saying, uh, sorry, we've disqualified
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.760]   you.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.760]   Sorry for the confusion.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.560]   Gee, that was confusing.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.400]   Bad out badly designed algorithm.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.720]   I won't take a picture.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.040]   I won't take a picture of my poop.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.680]   Said another winner.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.080]   Um, some of these were just mistakes.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.080]   I don't know.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.040]   They had a third party do this.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.040]   Um, but it so.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.240]   And then it's over now.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.920]   If you haven't gotten the invite, you're not going over.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:07.680]   And by the way, the invites, not like you won glass invite qualified you to pay $1,500
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:13.320]   for glass and to travel to New York, LA or San Francisco to pick them up.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.520]   All expenses paid?
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.960]   No, no, no, no.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.280]   You got to show up in person and pick them up.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.280]   They won't ship them.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.480]   They are not shipping them.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.280]   That's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's,
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.600]   the, you know, maybe they should have done the same thing with the croat with the pixel.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.880]   They didn't hypnotize me briefly.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:34.960]   It's just, I'm just glad I, they sent us one to review in time for me to cancel my order.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.080]   I'm, no, you like it.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.120]   I'm not going to knock it.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.120]   You like it.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.120]   It's a wonderful thing.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.120]   Wow.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.120]   Is that hot?
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.120]   No fans though.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.120]   Right.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.560]   Oh, it has a fan.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.560]   It has a fan.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.560]   Okay.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.520]   It's got a special, uh, unique vent that goes all the way across.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.240]   It irritates me when the van comes on.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.240]   You know, I think a lot of, you know, Linus Torvalds was saying, I love the screen.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.200]   Some people mistook that before I love the pixel.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.200]   A lot of people love the screen.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.200]   It's a beautiful screen.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.400]   And anytime you can get a retina screen, I was singing the praises of the MacBook retina.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.600]   It's, it's, it's, these all displays at some point should be 300 DPI or better.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.600]   Just they should.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   This is the way to go.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.600]   It's gorgeous.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.520]   And there was one rumor and of course rumors don't matter with Jack that the Google was
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.080]   going to bring out another pixel at IO.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.080]   And we'll be there.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:32.120]   Now we've been, we've been debating how we're going to cover this, but Jeff, are you going
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.120]   yet?
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.120]   Have you decided as of now?
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.760]   Yes, I'm planning to come as of now he is going to be another fast trip, but I'm going
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.480]   to come out for we're going to bring the gang together.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.720]   Gina, Jeff and I will all be a Google IO, but Google has informed us there is no space
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:49.960]   for us to broadcast from Google IO, nor will they give us bandwidth or any additional passes
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.960]   for crew.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:56.640]   We can't do any kind of broadcast from Google IO.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.320]   So I'm trying to think, I know, I'm trying to think what we should do.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.840]   I think we should just come back here afterwards.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.160]   I don't know.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.720]   There was a space nearby that I broadcast from.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.640]   Yeah, we go to the Sam of RT lounge or somewhere, but then Chad raised the point.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.840]   Well, so you're down the block from it.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.840]   And what weight is that?
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.840]   You're right.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.640]   You know, we could be here too.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.640]   Right.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.640]   Could be there and have a good day.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.640]   We'd have better quality.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.040]   We wouldn't spend a lot of money.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.840]   Well, that means I got to drive over a bridge.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.760]   Oh, Jeff, that's right.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.200]   We can drive you around a bridge.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.760]   No, there's no way to get here.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.360]   How would you get over a bridge?
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.440]   You'd have to drive to like.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.080]   Fresno, there's that one landmass that we.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.800]   Oh, yeah, it's a landmass.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   Not a bridge.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.880]   By the way, Jeff, how do you like wearing blindfold while we drive?
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.360]   We'd have to drive Jeff to Gilroy.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.960]   We'd have to go all the way down to the South Bay, go around and all the way back up.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.960]   I guess, you know what?
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.800]   It wouldn't be much farther from out of you.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   We just go around.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.000]   That was a story at the examiner when I was there.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.920]   They questioned the guys told to the Marine and he covered the Marine.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.400]   And he said, you're right.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.400]   You're right.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   You got me.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.640]   I actually drove all the way down to Gilroy back up around.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.640]   Holy, holy.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.240]   All the way up to Sacramento, back down.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.240]   Just so I would avoid.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.200]   You're Golden Gate Bridge and you now owe me 300 miles of mileage.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.880]   Oh, I love it.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.880]   Would you have to go to Sacramento?
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.600]   You might have to because you got to get around the bay.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.600]   Holy moly.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.280]   But you could pick up some garlic.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.280]   Gina drives.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.280]   I'll be OK.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.880]   Well, yeah, Gina said, good driver.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.880]   Excellent.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.880]   She's an excellent driver.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.480]   We'll get you an Uber.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.480]   We'll get you an Uber.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.640]   We'll get you some nice car.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   We'll have tinted windows.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.640]   You won't be able to see what you're going.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.640]   It'll be great.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.040]   But our palms are sweating.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:52.920]   The only thing is, will we miss a lot if we have to leave?
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.920]   I know.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.000]   There's no good answer.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.600]   I haven't decided because they sat me down yesterday.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.040]   They pinned me down and said, you've got to decide.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.040]   And I can't.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.040]   Yeah, literally.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.520]   I mean, after the keynote, they do do some press sessions that we will probably get
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.680]   invited to directly after the keynote.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.160]   They said today they'll do pressers.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.760]   But honestly, last year, right after the keynote, I went straight to the rental car
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.960]   place, ran to the car, drove out of the head of Luma, made it.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.600]   I think we started a little late.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.600]   But I made it.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.600]   We were able to do it.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.200]   And you know, it's the developer sessions after the keynotes are really--
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.480]   They throw me out because I'm not a developer.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.800]   So press is only there during the keynotes.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.640]   Right, for the press section and for the keynotes.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.640]   You're not allowed to go to any sessions?
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.640]   Oh, actually, I don't know.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.600]   I was thinking of WWDC Apple does that.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.080]   They let you go to the keynote and then they throw you.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.080]   I don't know what Google does.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.840]   Yeah, I think Google would let me go to the sessions.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.480]   Last year, the reason I'm thinking of going ahead and coming besides seeing you guys
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:49.120]   and scaring my pants off on a bridge is--
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.240]   How do you feel about fairies?
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.920]   There's nothing wrong with that Leo.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.800]   There's-- you can see a thinking.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.240]   Should I make the joke?
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.400]   It wasn't thinking of the joke.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.400]   He was thinking, I've got the joke.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.400]   Should I make the joke?
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.400]   I'm not sure if they're wrong.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.040]   Because you could take a ferry from Sausoleto to Larkspur.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.120]   And then I've done that if no bridges involved.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.120]   Nice.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.880]   Jeff, do you only take this subway to Brooklyn?
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.360]   It has.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:18.720]   It happens.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:23.360]   I've driven-- I've driven in the old days to Brooklyn when I lived there.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.120]   I used to live there.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.600]   You'll go over a bridge.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.760]   He just doesn't like it.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.800]   But you know what, Gina?
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.400]   This is heresy for a New York writer to say.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.440]   I have never-- nor will I ever walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.280]   Oh, it's fun.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:36.880]   I love that.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.400]   I've done that.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.200]   Wow.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:38.720]   That's my thing.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.720]   Beautiful.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.320]   I actually like to walk across the Manhattan Bridge
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.360]   and you get to kind of see the Brooklyn Bridge across.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.360]   Ooh.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.040]   But yeah.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.880]   They've been fixing that one for years.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.520]   How do you know they didn't write?
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.800]   Is there a lot of bridge collapses or something?
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.200]   Is there--
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.800]   but here's the-- no.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.520]   You were scarred as a youth.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.480]   Hey, one big one right around you.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.760]   Wow, that was a section.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.800]   It just fell in.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.920]   And it was an earthquake.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.080]   It was not--
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.000]   Well, exactly.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.880]   You have them.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.680]   Yeah, we do have them.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.800]   I know it's a ridiculous-- it's an anxiety attack.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.640]   It's ridiculous.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.280]   Oh, no, no.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.280]   Any phobia is not ridiculous.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.360]   I-- no, no, it is.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:18.560]   It is--
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:18.960]   To understand them.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.800]   --latchily, it is.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.280]   Logically.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:20.720]   But--
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.960]   And it's actually grown in me.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.200]   The funny thing is when I confess this to people--
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   Chad was like this.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.600]   Chad runs across bridge every day.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.040]   And you don't get to drive it across bridges, right, Chad?
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.080]   No, I'm fine with bridges.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.960]   Oh, Chad, you don't like it.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.880]   Do you, Chad?
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:35.880]   No.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.720]   Oh, gosh.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.640]   Good, bye.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.840]   It rose under the bridge-- under the bridge with--
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:41.340]   Puss.
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:41.840]   Under the bus.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.840]   It was a bus.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.840]   I'm throwing you under a bus.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.680]   I didn't throw you under a bus on a bridge.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.040]   I've never-- yeah, I've never been worried about bridges.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.040]   I swear when I was out there, you said you didn't like driving
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:51.360]   to the bridge?
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.160]   I don't like Jeff Bridges.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.400]   No, actually, I do.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.720]   OK, this is getting better.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.400]   He's got-- Jeff Bridges--
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.440]   Dan is performing up here at the Wells Fargo Center.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.080]   Oh, cool.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.200]   Yeah, I used to be afraid of heights.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.120]   But then I did rock climbing.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.400]   And you have to do repelling.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.400]   And you trust your life with a single rope.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.120]   That's kooky.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.600]   And that's when I got over that.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.400]   And just went, I guess engineers know what they're doing.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.200]   I won't do that.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.600]   Anyway, coming back to the studio after the keynote
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.840]   sounds totally fine.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.400]   Well, we'll talk off air and figure out.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.360]   So we'll definitely do our usual keynote coverage.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.120]   Because last year, that was when Sergey Brin jumped out
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.080]   of a plane or whatever.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.800]   So that was cool.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.640]   Blimp.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.400]   Will you be in the keynote, Leo?
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.520]   I think I want to go.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.360]   I don't want to miss it this year.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.080]   How do we broadcast from inside the keynote?
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.240]   We can't.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:44.840]   That's the thing.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:51.400]   So other people will be here doing the keynote play by play.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.800]   We'll be at the keynote.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.360]   And then when I was thinking maybe we could interview some people
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.720]   afterwards, I could do that.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.920]   You guys can go to events.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.720]   I'll get my pixel and interview people.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:07.680]   And then we'll come back, head up, and do the show.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.000]   I don't know where they give out the swag.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.440]   Oh, yeah, there's a swag, like booth, and they'll say, OK,
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.640]   at four o'clock on this day.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.120]   Yeah, get in line.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.040]   It's a get in line.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:19.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.400]   It's not like a mad rush right after the keynote
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.880]   or anything, usually.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.160]   [SIGHS]
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.200]   You're going to leave Friday, Gina.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.160]   Yeah, I am leaving Friday.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.680]   On Easter Sunday, Google did not feature the passion of the Christ,
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.560]   but instead, Sejeshavaz, labor activist.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.080]   And--
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.640]   My first question, which I didn't see answered was--
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.720]   Did they do Easter in years past?
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.680]   They've done Christmas.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.040]   I had the same question.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.680]   I thought maybe they don't do religious holidays,
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.320]   but they've done Christmas.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.960]   Yeah, they're definitely do religious holidays.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.400]   But Easter properly really isn't about bunnies.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.880]   It's a bigger deal.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.360]   It's not.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.200]   It's more religious.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.920]   It is kind of the holiest of Christian days, I think.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.800]   I don't know.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.880]   Somebody check in 2008, Easter.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.560]   Somebody check the Google Doodles page.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.160]   They've done $1.00 a day.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.080]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.400]   In fact, I would think it would be smart for Google not
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.120]   to stay secular just because you don't want
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.760]   to look like you're favoring a religion.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.600]   I'm going to bet.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.200]   I don't know.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.840]   I'm going to bet that's the instinct.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.920]   The problem was then whoever chose it just said,
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.080]   oh, it's another Sunday and looked up the calendar
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.680]   and put Caesar Chavez on, which only pissed off
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.200]   the Fox News crowd.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.240]   Yeah, Glenn Beck was unhappy.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.840]   So 2000, here's Easter eggs in the o's.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:47.800]   And then there's Caesar Chavez.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:52.680]   So that's a search for Easter on the Google Doodles page.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.680]   It looks like they haven't done it since 2000.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:58.080]   So maybe they have--
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.360]   Maybe they--
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.240]   Have they done Eid?
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.920]   How do you spell Eid?
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.080]   EID, right?
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.560]   I don't even know what it is.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:05.880]   Nope.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.280]   That's the Muslim.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:07.480]   Nope.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.960]   Only that.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.480]   Ramadan.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.480]   That's over.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:16.120]   No, no Passover.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.680]   So I think that 2000, they can be given a pass
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.480]   because that was the earliest days of Google
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.360]   and nobody really-- yeah, no Passover.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.200]   So it sounds like they are avoiding religious holidays
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:31.440]   and more likely doing things like commemorating people.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.800]   Persian New Year, St. Patrick's Day they did this year.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.120]   Remember the Irish dancers?
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:45.640]   Douglas Adams birthday, Women's Day 2013, Mother's Day 2013.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.320]   What?
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:47.680]   What?
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.640]   Is this a pre-doodle?
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.440]   Oh, March 10th.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.200]   It's Mother's Day in Ireland.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.680]   OK.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.320]   They don't.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.480]   Tonnes St. Patrick's.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.480]   It seems like they just try to mix it up.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.240]   Well, they also have a big Irish division.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.440]   That's where all the tax money goes.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.440]   All right.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.960]   So they've got-- they've really got to sell--
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.000]   Bulgaria National Day, St. David's Day.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.840]   The lot of national independence days,
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.840]   in those individual nations.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.280]   But yeah, they seem like they stay away
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.120]   from religious days in general.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.720]   Which makes sense.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.480]   So then given that--
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.960]   however, if you stay away, maybe you
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.040]   should have nothing on those days.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.440]   Because anything else you put on it,
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.240]   didn't they learn this time?
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.240]   You're going to get--
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.400]   And it looks like you're ignore-- yeah, yeah.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.200]   You're going for a comedy labor guy.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.120]   Right.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.160]   It's a slight.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.200]   But I thought that was Friday.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:47.840]   I guess it was.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.760]   They celebrated New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Day,
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.880]   the invention of the Zamboni.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.600]   Copernicus's birthday, Valentine's Day.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.920]   And I think they kind of avoid that.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.920]   Yesterday, it was Maria Sibilla Marion's birthday.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.480]   That was quite a beautiful illustration yesterday.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.640]   She was a 18th century nature illustrator.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.920]   And that's what the Gecko and the leaves were all about.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.120]   I got to go to the home page more often.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:18.440]   I know.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.480]   Who uses the home page?
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.000]   I know.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.280]   Not I.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.720]   I mean, I think a lot of people do.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:27.840]   So it seems like most of the people are upset
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.400]   were Fox News people.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.520]   Yeah, sure.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.360]   Hey, first there was a war on Christmas.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.680]   Now there's a war on Easter.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.280]   Right.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.080]   A war on Easter.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.080]   And the only response these people can make
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.680]   is now I'm going to use Bing.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:45.360]   In which case, it's like, go for it.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.880]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.480]   No, nothing wrong with it.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.080]   Why don't they use duck duck go?
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.480]   The pope should have tweeted, now I'm using Bing.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.160]   Now that would be serious.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.280]   The pope doesn't use any--
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:01.280]   Well, yeah.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.720]   I don't know how you say Bing and Latin.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.880]   Bingium, Bingium.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.000]   Bingium.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.080]   Because nothing-- because Dr. Mom says nothing says he
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:14.800]   is risen like Bing.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   OK.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.680]   Bing is smart.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.080]   See, they don't do doodles.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.440]   They just have a beautiful backdrop every day.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.360]   That's nothing to do with anything.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.240]   Yeah, and a couple of folks in the chat room, thanks to our
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.960]   pointing out that you do see the Google in your search results.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.040]   Oh, that's right.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.040]   You do know.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.720]   The doodle shows up in the search results.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.960]   I actually am using duck duck go, so I'm not even really
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.480]   seeing that.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.600]   I use duck duck go from many of my searches, not all of them
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.960]   any.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.960]   There was a good article about the founder of duck duck go
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.680]   today somewhere.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.440]   Yeah, it was a profile.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.600]   Let me see if I can dig that up.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.960]   I--
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.360]   I favorite it on my flip board magazine, which means it's
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.080]   totally inaccessible to anybody anywhere.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.320]   I dropped it in an insta paper, which means I'll never be here.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.440]   That's what I got to do.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.360]   I got to-- normally I tweet it when
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:04.360]   then it goes from Twitter to my pin board.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.560]   But it doesn't-- it takes its time.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.560]   I'm just looking through it to see if I can find it.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.840]   Neowind.net.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.640]   Neowind did it.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.400]   He gave you the wine bird the man taking on Google and Bing.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:18.440]   He may-- he's-- he's finding it self-funded.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.120]   Go for him.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.080]   Yeah, he made all his money on what?
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.040]   Another startup.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.880]   Made-- so-- which he sold.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.200]   The names database.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:26.560]   That's right.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.520]   He sold at the classmates.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.880]   He sold at the classmates.com for $10 million.
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.000]   Good man.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.440]   I like that.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.560]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.760]   Come back with more Jeff Jarvis.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.640]   Gina Trappani, we're talking Twig, Google, the cloud,
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.520]   pixels, and more.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.640]   Angry Twitters.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.040]   Our show today brought--
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.920]   when our Twitter is not angry.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.280]   With Jeff on the show, we always have an angry Twitter.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.360]   As always, he is the angry Twitter.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:55.880]   He's the angry Twitter.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:56.240]   Go ahead.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.680]   You can-- you can be mad at me, Jeff.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.560]   You can yell at me for not liking the pixel.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.360]   It's-- I apologize.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.960]   I'm just disappointed in you, Leo.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.160]   Oh, that's-- that's a lie my mom would pull.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:06.960]   You know.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.400]   I mean, you have just disappointed--
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.400]   I just thought it was worse.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.440]   You were worse more than that.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.840]   I just thought you were a better person than that.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.080]   Yeah, I just-- I expected more of you, Leo.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.080]   Yes.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.040]   Oh, God.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.400]   Hulu-- you know about Hulu Plus 7.99 a month?
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.400]   And as many shows as you want anytime, anywhere,
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.520]   on almost every device streamed instantly to you.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.480]   And we can try it.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.560]   We could try it free for two weeks.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:42.360]   Double the normal trial if you go to huluplus.com/twit.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:50.200]   So it's current season shows from hits like the Daily Show
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.800]   called "Bear Report Law and Order,"
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.920]   networks like Comedy Central Fox, NBC, ABC, Community,
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.840]   Modern Family, Family Guy.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.720]   But even classics like "Firefly and Twilight Zone,"
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.680]   this is the Metro app.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.320]   They did it.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.440]   The new Apple TV app and the Metro app are just gorgeous.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.680]   Look at this.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.360]   So cool.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.240]   Trending now, "Best of Ellen," "Best in Show," 2013.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.040]   The new Hulu featured a great way
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.040]   to get your television--
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.720]   unlimited amounts.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.960]   Glee, of course, is on here.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.360]   Old-- goodly and nugly.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.200]   You can go-- you can go back.
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.640]   That's how I watch "Saturday Night Live," right?
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.760]   Because not all of it's great.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.160]   So I just watched the little clips.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.240]   They have movies too.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:41.640]   Recently aired episodes, popular movies, fully loaded.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.920]   Look at this downside.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.080]   So here's the deal.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.040]   I just watched Madonna's "Truth or Dare" again.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:46.680]   I love that.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.840]   That was on this.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.920]   Popular episodes.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.960]   I'm a big family guy fan, so you just tap it.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:56.040]   It starts huluplus.com/twit, two weeks free,
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:00.800]   so you can try it and see what you think.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.000]   It's great for cord cutters.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.360]   Hulu-- don't tell him I said that.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.120]   huluplus.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:09.840]   .com/twit.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.120]   See, I shouldn't have started the family guy.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.440]   Now I want to watch it.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:20.040]   Is this to-- Jeff Jarvis was a TV critic for many years.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:20.880]   You hate the family guy.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.160]   Go ahead.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:25.040]   Tell me that, because that'll make up for me hating the pixel.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.360]   No, I haven't watched enough.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.960]   You know, here's the big confession.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.880]   You don't watch TV anymore.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.480]   I've never watched a full episode of "The Simpsons."
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:39.240]   Well, you know, I have to say, this is our 24th season now.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:43.160]   It's hard to keep a show fresh for 24 years.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:44.160]   So--
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   That's crazy.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.160]   I tried to watch it.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.600]   "The Simpsons" is a crazy cultural thing.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.160]   Like, I had co-workers who would make all these crazy Simpsons
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.880]   references, and I may have watched one or two episodes
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.680]   here or there, Jeff, but I'm kind of in the same boat as you.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.240]   I would just feel like I have no idea what this means.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.240]   Really?
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.720]   And they would just sort of look at me
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.440]   sadly, at some point.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.960]   Well, I think everybody to be part of this world
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.520]   has to watch the first, say, five or six years
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.040]   of "The Simpsons."
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.240]   To be part of this world.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.840]   Otherwise, you're just going to really--
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.600]   you're going to feel very left out.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.040]   I'm catching up on "Breaking Bad" and "Walking Dead."
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:16.760]   There's a good one.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.880]   "Walking Dead" also great.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.880]   Let me see what "The Simpsons" episodes--
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.440]   I've got, of course, all the current season episodes,
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.520]   "A Tree Grows in Springfield."
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.760]   Awesome.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.800]   HuluPlus.com.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.640]   You should, Jeff.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.440]   You know what he should watch?
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.440]   You should all watch the "Monorail" episode, which
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.720]   is like season three.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.400]   The classic.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.840]   That'll get you into it.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.120]   Yeah, I would do the first couple of seasons, maybe.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.040]   First couple of seasons.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:47.480]   Good idea.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.720]   Brilliant.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.200]   Brilliant.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.760]   Hey, a story just ran on TechCrunch
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.320]   thanks to Gardener in the chat room, which I just
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.480]   added to the rundown in the Google section.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.520]   Google Forks WebKit.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.600]   Oh, crap.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.120]   That just came out.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.560]   And "Launch's Blink," a new rendering engine
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.000]   that will soon power Chrome and Chrome OS.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.080]   That's not good.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:14.360]   So we're calling it Blink.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.480]   As Google describes it, Blink is an inclusive open source
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.760]   community and a new rendering engine based on WebKit.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.600]   You know, I wondered if they would do this now
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:27.120]   that everybody, including Opera, is running WebKit.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.160]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:32.280]   That Google has no secret sauce anymore.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.540]   Although it was Apple that really put WebKit on the map.
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.440]   When Apple is deciding for Safari, it's new browser,
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.220]   what engine to use, it was then that they
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.720]   decided to use the K-Browser from Linux.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.720]   And that became WebKit.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:49.040]   So maybe it's because it's so strongly associated with Apple.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.880]   But a fork on something that's so critical like WebKit
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.280]   is not good news.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.280]   What a fork is--
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.200]   Gene, explain a fork.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.320]   You're a developer.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.920]   No, fork is when you take a project and you say,
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.280]   I'm going to make a copy of this,
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.720]   and I'm going to work on a parallel.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.280]   And I'm going to work on it, but I'm not.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.540]   But the changes I'm going to make are going to be merged back
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:07.420]   into the original.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.820]   I'm forking it into its own new separate branch.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:16.060]   So I mean, in the model of Git, forking is really a good thing.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:19.060]   In order to use to work on a repository and Git, you fork it.
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.100]   But the idea is that you then send a pull request
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.820]   and the changes get merged back to the original.
[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:26.060]   The idea being that if you have one master central project,
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.580]   everybody works on that one project.
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.580]   Everyone benefits from it.
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:31.940]   And it's better if it's a singular project.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.280]   But in the old days, the idea of a fork,
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:36.200]   it was kind of a hostile thing.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.600]   If there were disagreement about where a project was going,
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.260]   the way that you would resolve it would be a fork, which is--
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:42.800]   Screw you.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.120]   I'm going to do it my own way.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:44.620]   Yes.
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:45.120]   Screw you.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:45.680]   You're going to do it my own way.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.320]   And I'm going to split the community of people
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:47.840]   who work on this thing.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.440]   And my values are different than yours.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.360]   And now suddenly, you're sort of duplicating effort.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.680]   Then you have users going, well, or in this case,
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.180]   developers.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.760]   I mean, our users using WebKit.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.520]   But you have developers saying, which one should I use?
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.760]   Which what's better?
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.260]   And it gets kind of political and weird.
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.260]   So yeah, my first reaction to this is Ugg.
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:10.420]   But Google VP of Engineering, Linus Upson, and Alex Komorowski
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.540]   said that the decision of fork WebKit
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:15.660]   was entirely driven by the engineering teams
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.580]   and solely based on the fact that the engineers felt
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:20.180]   constrained by the technical complexity of working
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.940]   within the WebKit ecosystem.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.740]   Komorowski noted that when it comes to working
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.060]   with other companies involved in the WebKit project,
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:28.860]   the collaboration has been fantastic.
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.560]   So I mean, Google's trying to kind of pave this over
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.360]   and say, hey, this was not a hostile act.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.860]   We're just--
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.600]   we're feeling a little constrained.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.920]   We want to make things a little simpler, a little faster.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.520]   Because you know that that's Google's obsession when
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.780]   it comes to anything Chrome related.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.200]   And I'm sure that they will.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.920]   And that's called Blink.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.160]   So Google--
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.920]   And this is a good article, by the way, Frederick
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.320]   Lardinois on TechCrunch with a history of WebKit
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.960]   going back to Apple, starting WebKit in 2005,
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.320]   open sourcing it.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:02.000]   He says-- and I didn't know this--
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.220]   initially Google forked WebKit to create Chromium,
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:06.520]   but later reconciled.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:10.200]   I'll allow that Git model so that they brought it back
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:11.240]   into the fold.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:15.520]   Most of the commits, the vast majority of commits
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.320]   to WebKit come from Google.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:25.160]   95 WebKit reviewers, Google A59 WebKit reviewers are Apple,
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.240]   followed by smaller numbers from Blackberry, Intel, Nokia,
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.920]   Samsung, Adobe, and Netflix.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.960]   I didn't know Netflix used it.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.240]   Google is currently responsible for the vast majority
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.360]   of commits.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:40.240]   So that's, I think, a big deal to the WebKit team.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.160]   Yeah, this is a big deal with the WebKit team.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:45.280]   This is not so good for WebKit.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.640]   And all the products that use it.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.120]   Question, Gina.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:54.760]   So are both going to be compatible--
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.560]   if both are compatible with HTML5,
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.200]   if you're a plain old web designer,
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.120]   does this cause you new compatibility problems in terms
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.840]   of how you design pages?
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.400]   Well, I mean, this is the engine that
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.520]   is going to power certain browsers, right?
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:13.080]   So it looks like Blink is going to be behind Chrome and Chrome OS.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.320]   So it'll be interesting to see.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.760]   I mean, Google's pretty good about sticking to standards.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:23.440]   I can't imagine that they would deal with HTML5 differently
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.280]   than someone else, right?
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.440]   HTML5 is just a standard.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:30.000]   But yeah, if you have different engines powering the browser,
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.280]   there's a potential for compatibility issues.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.960]   Well, you have to say, oh, how does this look in Safari?
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.240]   How does this look in Chrome?
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.360]   There are two different engines.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.480]   And any developer is going to have to test in every version.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.520]   So it was kind of getting to be good news,
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.880]   because you had WebKit, you had Firefox,
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.880]   and the Gecko engine, and you had Internet Explorer,
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.960]   and you could test in all three.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.280]   Now you're going to have to test in Blink, WebKit.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.720]   I mean, it just adds another layer.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.800]   And yeah, you're going to stay standard compliant,
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.240]   but it always ends up adding some differences, right?
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.320]   Where the standards aren't clear, for instance.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.040]   It can.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.480]   Potentially, yeah, it can.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.160]   I mean, it sounds like the difference
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.840]   is going to be a performance thing, right?
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.280]   I mean, Google's going to optimize for the things
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.040]   that they want to do in Chrome.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.760]   All right, I mean, this is a self-interested thing.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.600]   If they want to make Chrome, they want
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:16.960]   Chrome to be the vision that they wanted to be,
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.600]   and WebKit is cutting it, right?
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.800]   And they said they did make this decision likely.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:24.680]   Lightly, they must really have fundamental issues with WebKit
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.560]   in order to make this decision and fork it.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.880]   So there might be a case where you could build an app in Chrome
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.960]   that would be super speedy and great
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.240]   and work really well with Blink, which
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.240]   is optimized for certain things you can do in Chrome,
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.160]   which would be kind of crappy and safari or Firefox.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.520]   I'm just kind of projecting it.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:45.840]   I mean, we'll see, but it sounds like speed
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.000]   is going to be Blink's focus.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.400]   So and I wonder if maybe Blink will become the standard,
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.600]   or maybe WebKit will merge Blink's commits back into it
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.160]   if it really does become superior?
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.120]   I mean, we all know that when Google puts its eyes
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.440]   on a browser technology, I mean, look at what they did with Chrome,
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:02.720]   right?
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.680]   I mean, I go on Firefox.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.880]   I was like, we don't need another open source browser.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:07.440]   We have Firefox.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.280]   And look at how amazing Chrome is.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.680]   This is from the Chromium blog where they write about it.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.560]   They say Chromium uses a different multiprocess
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:19.040]   architecture than other WebKit-based browsers.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.200]   And supporting multiple architectures over the years
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.280]   has led to increasing complexity for both WebKit
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.800]   and Chromium slowing down the pace of innovation.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.960]   So what they're saying is in order
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:33.000]   to support our architecture better,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.200]   we're going to create a new open source rendering engine
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.720]   based on WebKit called Blink.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:42.880]   So we believe that having multiple rendering engines,
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.040]   similar to having multiple browsers,
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.360]   where spur innovation and over time
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.480]   improve the health of the entire open Web ecosystem,
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.560]   there's something to be said for that.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.160]   Microsoft has complained about the monoculture
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.320]   of having everything on WebKit.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.920]   Of course, they're not using WebKit.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.280]   It isn't--
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.280]   Right.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.240]   Because it's effective.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.600]   From a security point of view, it does make sense.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.880]   If you have one target, the same way
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.320]   it's hard to develop a website because you have multiple targets,
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.680]   it's hard to develop malware because you have multiple targets.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.760]   Yep.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:11.440]   That's true.
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.040]   So not bad from a security point of view.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.680]   In the short term Blink-- this is the Chromium blog again.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.840]   Blink will bring little change for Web developers.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.520]   The bulk of the initial work will
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.080]   focus on internal architectural improvements
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.640]   and the simplification of the code base.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.760]   We'll be able to remove seven build systems
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.000]   and delete more than 7,000 files,
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.840]   comprising more than 4 and 1/2 million lines right off the bat.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.080]   Well, that's amazing.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.160]   That sounds amazing.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:44.720]   That's probably for what stuff that Chrome doesn't run on.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.220]   Yeah.
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.240]   It's like Blackberry.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.640]   It's a different multi-process architecture
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.320]   than other WebKit-based browsers.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.640]   So yeah, so it just sounds like there's just code in WebKit
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:54.640]   that Chrome doesn't need.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.120]   It simply doesn't need it.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.480]   It doesn't use it, right?
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.360]   But when you have code in a system that your system is
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.040]   that you don't need, you still-- any new code you add to it,
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.960]   you have to be compatible with that other code
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.280]   that you don't need.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.880]   And that's why they're saying slows down--
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.380]   Right.
[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.040]   That makes sense.
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:11.960]   --their ability to innovate.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.120]   Seven build systems they don't use.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.360]   That's a lot.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:16.640]   They do say-- and this will be the test.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.160]   They say throughout this transition
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.800]   we'll collaborate closely with other browser vendors
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.360]   to move the web forward and preserve the compatibility that
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.320]   made it a successful ecosystem.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.440]   In that spirit, we've set strong guidelines
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:31.800]   for new features that emphasize standards, interoperability,
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.200]   conformance testing, and transparency.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.880]   And if they do that effectively, then there's no problem.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.080]   That's what they have to do.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.240]   That's-- they have to do that.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:42.600]   And then you can see the benefit and without any negative--
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.360]   or fewer negatives anyway.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.640]   Compatibility risk is one of the most important decision criteria
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:50.920]   for enabling new web platform features by default.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   So yeah, they're obviously aware of the potential pitfalls
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.720]   of forking.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:58.680]   I just hope that other companies besides Google
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.120]   are major committers to blank.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.920]   Because it's always better to have people
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:07.640]   from different companies all sort of in the pot contributing.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.280]   And Blink is open, right?
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.360]   Anybody can contribute.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:14.080]   It's an open source project, just like WebKit is.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:20.520]   Open source rendering engine based on WebKit.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.320]   Blink's mission to improve the open web
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:26.880]   through technical innovation and good citizenship.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:31.040]   Well, their hearts are in the right place.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.080]   Will Opera use Blink?
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.520]   No, Opera is going to use WebKit.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.120]   Or maybe they would.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:35.880]   That's interesting.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.040]   I mean, they could, right?
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.040]   That's a good question.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.760]   What other browsers will switch to Blink?
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.880]   I mean, Firefox does switch to WebKit.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.880]   Ah.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.880]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:47.880]   I doubt that.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.960]   It would be something.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:52.680]   But Opera is probably the most likely candidate.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.240]   Yeah, because they're just beginning.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.720]   Apparently on Hacker News, an Opera dev said,
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.680]   yes, we'll be using Blink.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.120]   That's Amazon's browser.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:03.720]   A fork or is it its own beast?
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:05.240]   I think it's WebKit.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.520]   The Silk browser?
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.520]   That's a good question.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.840]   Now that is a good question.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:14.680]   Google's privacy director, Alma Whitten, stepping down.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.840]   She was their first director of privacy,
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.080]   took the job in 2010.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.960]   CNET said the hardest job at Google.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.880]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.040]   She announced that she's stepping down from her post
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.120]   with plans to retire.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:32.200]   This is a big problem for companies like Google and Apple
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:37.960]   when their employees vest and their suddenly millionaires--
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.520]   I don't need the money.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.240]   This is the worst job at Google.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:43.000]   I'm out of here.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:45.680]   I'm out of here.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.960]   She's been there for--
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.640]   actually, she's going to be replaced by Lawrence Yu,
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.560]   an engineer who's been with the company for eight years
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.840]   and is not based in London as Alma Whitten was,
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:57.000]   but based in Mountain View, which is probably good.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   It's only good.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   It's a plus.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   She did a-- I would say an amazing job.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.240]   She had to suffer all kinds of crises and difficulties
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.440]   and missteps and so on.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.480]   But she also-- and they brought me out
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.720]   to speak to the group once.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:18.680]   They really did do a good job of getting privacy
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.800]   into the discussion in the culture of Google more and more
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:25.440]   and more, having events there bringing people to speak,
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.640]   setting guidelines for privacy, all the--
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.520]   can get sheened about them aside.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.720]   She did a good job.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.600]   It was she who oversaw the unification of the privacy
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:35.600]   policies.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.120]   Because-- well, that's a highly controversial thing
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.440]   and some quarters still.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:40.440]   Right.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:41.760]   But I think she did a good job with it.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:45.680]   I think if you have, as they did, more than 70 privacy
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:49.840]   policies, it's too much for a consumer to adjust to absorb.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:53.040]   So having one, unified privacy policy is a good thing,
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.080]   whether you agree with it or not.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.720]   At least you know what it is.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.240]   And you don't have to read 70 different privacy policies
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.600]   to know what you're given Google.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:04.120]   Well, the argument against it is that it enabled Google
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.080]   to use data for one application and another one, of course.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.920]   But they were probably going to do that.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.760]   And my contention has always been if Google had invented
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.880]   the whole thing that it is today from scratch,
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.640]   it would have been one magazine.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.080]   The only reason it was 70 is because they acquired things
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.440]   or different things happened.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.320]   It never made me sense.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.720]   But I was at a dinner night here at Amsterdam,
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:28.240]   a wonderful dinner thrown by one of the heads of one
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:32.440]   of the TV networks here, and called Cairo.
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.960]   A guy with a great name, Taco.
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:38.240]   They have great names in the Netherlands.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:42.840]   And so people went after me about Google, not trusting Google
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:43.360]   and this and that.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.560]   And the anti-Googleism in Europe just always
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.360]   amazes me when I'm over here.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:51.760]   But that was part of it, is there using the stuff
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:54.280]   across the applications?
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.320]   They are.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.480]   You don't have to do it with them, but they are.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.000]   There's always DuckDuckGo and Blink.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.360]   I mean, Bing.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.360]   Bing, yeah.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.480]   Bing Blink.
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:05.760]   Now we're going to get confused.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:14.880]   Google has started very strangely.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.880]   Google's Shopping Express in San Francisco.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.840]   We're too far north, I think, to take advantage of this.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.760]   With free delivery when you buy from Target, Walgreens,
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.520]   Staples, and more.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:34.280]   So the idea is kind of like Amazon Prime, right?
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.200]   OK.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.400]   So it's same delivery, so you order on Google
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.920]   and then it shows up at your door today.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.600]   Remember Walmart said that they were going to have Walmart
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.280]   shoppers do the deliveries?
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.960]   Hey, are you going that way?
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.640]   Because I got a case of toilet paper,
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.280]   you could drop off on your way.
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:53.360]   So you selected delivery window, OK?
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:53.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:54.040]   It's like--
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.040]   What time you want it?
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:55:00.440]   --anytime today or 10 or 2 or 6, which says to me that--
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.160]   I've said this, I think, last week's show.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:05.320]   I said it before, the real war isn't Google versus Apple.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.920]   The real war is Google versus Amazon.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.640]   Yeah, Google versus Amazon.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.520]   Will they bring blue bottle, ice coffee, two light-toe
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.400]   here in San Diego?
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.160]   This is what I want to know.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.800]   You know, I can see-- I mean, the same day.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:18.200]   So this is instead of you getting in the car
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.760]   and going shopping, by the end of the day,
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.440]   you'll have what you need.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.240]   I would love to see this come north.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.520]   I don't know who's doing delivery.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:31.960]   I see in the article a Google Shopping Express little van
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:38.200]   with a nicely groomed young man in a polo shirt.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.640]   Oh, yeah, it'll stay that way for a long time.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.560]   Mr. Google is coming to my door.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:45.440]   It's the same van that Eric Schmidt was driving before
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:48.040]   with ice cream cones in it.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:51.760]   Google has-- this is very interesting from Google's point
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:52.960]   of view.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.000]   Better than Amazon Prime, although Amazon's also looking
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:55.960]   at the same battle delivery.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:59.120]   The other thing about this is it's a few things.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.640]   One, it's the true future of advertising, which
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:05.880]   is actually transactions at ROI, and Google goes toward ROI,
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.840]   return on investment in mere marketing.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:12.680]   And two, I suspect that Google is going
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:16.440]   to use existing retailers who are advertisers.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:20.040]   Amazon is competing with all those retailers.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:23.560]   Target, Walgreens, Staples, American Eagle, Toys R Us, Babies
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:28.080]   R Us, Office Depot, Blue Bottle, Coffee, Knob Hill Foods,
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.040]   and Palo Alto Toy and Sport.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:30.960]   You're right.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:34.160]   These are brick and mortars that want to stay alive.
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:35.360]   Isn't there interest?
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:35.360]   It's an air interest.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:40.360]   eBay/Paypal and Google will be saying, we're not going to kill you.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.800]   We're going to serve you and help you and help
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.480]   you find new customers and do all kinds of good things.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:44.160]   Awesome.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:47.000]   Amazon is saying, screw you, we're going to kill you.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.880]   Early testers get six months of free same day delivery,
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.240]   but at some point, they're going to start charging you.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.600]   Google says, we're still working on the pricing.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:58.000]   And we'll see, depending on how the data comes in what we do.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.160]   They need to target new parents.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.520]   New parents is great.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:02.200]   Oh my gosh.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.840]   Diapers.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.440]   Diapers, the whole thing.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.640]   I didn't realize--
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.400]   I didn't appreciate--
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.080]   Blue bottle.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.960]   I didn't appreciate delivery until we
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.840]   had a newborn and you're just exhausted and feeding every two
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:14.640]   hours.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:18.120]   So it's smart that they've got baby's toys or us in here.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.880]   And they're not only signing up beta testers.
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:21.920]   They're signing up retailers.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.320]   Are you a retailer with locations in the San Francisco Bay
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:24.820]   area?
[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:27.400]   Who wouldn't want to do this?
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.120]   Now you have to charge the same amount as if somebody came
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.360]   to the store, and then there's an additional delivery fee,
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:34.040]   presumably at some point.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.760]   And the delivery fee goes to Google.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.640]   Google.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.640]   Yeah, not to.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.560]   But why wouldn't you want to do this as a retailer?
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.400]   This is great.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.880]   This is exactly the same.
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.480]   Well, at some point, I'm going to bet there's a chance
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:48.480]   for Google to arbitrage too, because Google could well
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:52.320]   negotiate a bulk buying deal from Staples.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:55.040]   And still deliver at retail.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.440]   Right.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:58.000]   Right.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.720]   And Staples would probably insist on delivering at retail
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.120]   price.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:07.440]   And yet happily give Google a discount of commercial promotes.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:08.800]   That's why I'm not surprised to see.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:13.360]   It's the big retailers that are the early participants.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:17.200]   You know, people made fun of the Walmart speculation.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:21.640]   But I think there's something brilliant about it,
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.800]   because it uses--
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.120]   the businesses that are built on spare cycles.
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:30.040]   And it's just doing it that's hard, right?
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:34.600]   Yeah, but it's an infrastructural problem.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:38.360]   Who wants to deliver to this area?
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:39.840]   Are you trustworthy?
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:41.240]   And what's the deal?
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.640]   And you get a couple of bucks.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:46.640]   You're going that way anyway.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:47.840]   You'd have to pre-register.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:49.320]   You'd have to be vetted.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:51.400]   They'd have to keep track of you.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:55.040]   I mean, if you set for entrances and exits at the store,
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.760]   what neighborhood you're going to,
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.200]   there'd be a desk at that entrance.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.840]   Pick it up with some stuff, take it out.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.640]   I mean, it's a logistics thing.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.000]   I almost imagined that people could make a part-time job out
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:05.520]   of it.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.520]   Right.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.160]   So if you're a product manufacturer, if it's a platform,
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.080]   then you hang out at Walmart all day.
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:12.720]   Oh, we like those kinds of people.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:16.280]   And they pick up things to carry.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:19.420]   Yeah.
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:21.560]   I mean, it's kind of like what we talked about with cars,
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.000]   that cars that most of their time parks somewhere, not being
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:24.480]   used, right?
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:28.840]   The idea of sharing cars, keep them on the road,
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:32.520]   that pulling resources, which the internet enables.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:36.800]   We're talking about Google, the cloud, Jeff and Gina,
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:40.960]   our show today brought to you by our good friends at LegalZoom.com.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:41.560]   Not a law firm.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:44.000]   Oh, no, no, much better than a law firm.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.160]   A self-help service that lets you create your own legal documents,
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:53.240]   affordable businesses, business forms like LLCs and
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.480]   corporations.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:57.280]   You can get an LLC or incorporate your business
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:01.040]   at LegalZoom, starting at $99.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.320]   That's what I did.
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:06.600]   We're still the same LLC.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:10.240]   The same cheap LLC, I did, well, 2005.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:13.680]   Forming your businesses the right way really is important.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.320]   It saves you money on taxes, limits your liability,
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.440]   make sure your personal assets are protected.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:20.560]   They can also do trademarks.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:25.320]   If you're a blogger, you should trademark your handle,
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.520]   your name, copyrights, patents, NDAs.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.960]   It's affordable personalized protection.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.200]   It's not just for business, too.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.080]   If you have a family, you obviously
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.480]   need a last will and testament to protect your family and assets,
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.640]   just $69 for a will.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.960]   You can also do living trusts at LegalZoom.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.080]   You don't want to leave it up to the government and courts
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.960]   to decide what happens to your assets or to your children.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.520]   You want to simply go there.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.960]   Before the end of the day today, just a few minutes,
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.160]   you'll have a will.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.800]   You'll be protected.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.440]   $69.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.640]   In the past 12 years, over 2 million Americans
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:03.080]   have used LegalZoom.com for LLCs, wills, trusts, trademarks,
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.520]   and more.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:08.400]   And I should really go through this step by step.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.320]   We should actually--
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:09.880]   So I'm done.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.360]   You did it.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.120]   You did it for your--
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.120]   You did it for your--
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.120]   You trademarked your OMG chat, right?
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.960]   And it's amazing the details that I would have never known
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:17.400]   about.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.720]   Well, the process is valuable in that respect as well.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:23.360]   Because I need to send in now a specimen that says,
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.960]   I've been using OMG chat constantly.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.760]   I would have never known to do that.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.880]   LegalZoom makes it easy to send you an email.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.640]   They're even like, hey, it looks like you didn't get the email
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.840]   because I'm slow.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.600]   They sent me a phone call.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.920]   Just like, hey, you sure everything's going fine?
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.240]   It's like, yeah, I just haven't gotten to it yet.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.920]   Did you run up against anything where you thought,
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.480]   I wouldn't mind asking a lawyer about this.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.320]   Not yet.
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.320]   Trademark's pretty straightforward.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.440]   Trademark's pretty straightforward.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.960]   There were some times that I was confused,
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.880]   but on the website, I had explained it.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:54.120]   It was just like, hey, this is what you're looking for.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.680]   These are what--
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.480]   They now have this.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.120]   They didn't have this when I did it.
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.600]   They have the LegalZoom Legal Plan,
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.040]   where they have vetted lawyers at almost every state.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.200]   They've got reviews online so you know everything
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.600]   about the profiles and a pre-negotiated low prices.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.240]   So you can say, I'm doing this trademark thing.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.520]   What do you recommend?
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.600]   Is this a service marker?
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.120]   Is this a trademark, that kind of thing?
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.760]   And to have legal advice for an attorney as well,
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:19.840]   also very affordable.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.600]   So this is really a nice--
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.520]   kind of gotten to be more full service.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.840]   I really think it's great.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.400]   Step-by-step questionnaire, it's easy to do.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.560]   It's very affordable, high quality,
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.360]   and 100% guaranteed, of course.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.760]   I want you to visit LegalZoom.com.
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:37.480]   Again, LegalZoom's not a law for himself help services
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.400]   at your specific direction, or you
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.040]   can speak to a Legal Plan attorney
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.560]   and get your questions answered and get ongoing advice.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.320]   To get a special thank you, just a little token
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.680]   of our appreciation for mentioning
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.480]   that you heard LegalZoom on Twig, use the offer code TWIG
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.680]   on checkout and you'll get $10 back, just like that.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.560]   Offer code TWIG $10 back, just a way of saying thank you
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.040]   for telling LegalZoom-- you heard about it on this week
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.000]   in Google--
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.760]   LegalZoom.com.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.560]   Don't put it off.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:14.440]   Seriously, it's not worth the risk.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.200]   Google engineers-- I guess we've
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.200]   got to thank Matt Cutz for this, or maybe not.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.280]   Google engineers find a way to filter robo calls the same way
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.120]   G-mail filters spam.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.120]   I guess it's not Matt Cutz.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.320]   This is spam filtering.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.720]   It was the FTC doing a crowd sourced challenge.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.840]   And they announced the three winners of its robo call
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.760]   challenge, a contest meant--
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:40.560]   FTC's rising up-- crowd sources solution
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:44.080]   to the robo call scourge that prompts more than--
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:44.520]   get this.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.760]   This is why they did it--
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.880]   200,000 customer complaints a month.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.680]   FTC gets 200,000--
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.960]   stupid robo call.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.960]   First place award was split between Aaron Fos and Cerda
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:58.240]   Donis.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.360]   The Technology Achievement Award, which
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.600]   was reserved for a submission from a large company,
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.640]   went to the Googlers--
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.160]   Daniel Klein and Dean Jackson.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.480]   Here's their little sketch.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.520]   This looks like-- is this the back of an app?
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.440]   Can know it's a whiteboard.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:17.960]   I love it.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:22.520]   People ask the FTC every--
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:25.120]   all the time, why can't you screen robo calls just
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.200]   like Gmail screens spam?
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.960]   And so what the Google solution does
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.760]   is it's crowdsourcing a little bit.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:40.240]   Just like Gmail reports from users about spam messages,
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:44.440]   bogus messages are reported back to the system, instantly
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.920]   report originating phone numbers to an online database.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.680]   And the other side, phones or external hardware
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.240]   automatically check the database when a call comes in
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.280]   and rejects--
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:58.040]   rejects the calls from spammers.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.160]   Now, let's see if they do it.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.200]   They call it no more robo.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:01.720]   No more robo.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.920]   What could be wrong with this?
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:03.840]   No more robo.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.680]   No more robo.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.880]   An entry to the FTC robo--
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.720]   This is an overview of no more robo.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.680]   An entry in the FTC robo call challenge
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.120]   to prevent illegal robo calls.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.480]   This is a great idea.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.320]   I wish more government stuff would do this.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:16.820]   Yep.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.040]   There have been more hackfasts and hackdays
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.720]   in government agencies recently.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.440]   This is cool.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.280]   What's sad face-- my sad face about this
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.960]   is that Google has no plans to integrate no more robo
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.040]   into the Google voice.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.040]   Oh.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.920]   Robo calls are unpleasant, Google said.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:32.400]   And our engineers have some ideas
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.440]   for combating the problem.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.720]   At this point, this is simply a proposal for the FTC
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.080]   to consider.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:39.640]   I get robo calls in Google voice.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.280]   I mean, luckily, you can make a block list,
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.040]   but you still kind of have to maintain that block list.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.200]   You get robo calls?
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.560]   I don't think I've ever gotten a robo call.
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.280]   Oh, actually, I might get them in Google voice.
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.560]   You know, in a way, Google voice does kind of discourage it,
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.120]   because if you turn screening on, which I do,
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.960]   they have to press one--
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.520]   or no, they have to say their name.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:01.080]   And then I press one and then say, go ahead.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.400]   And that stops them every time, because a robot can't--
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:03.880]   Oh, that's good.
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:04.640]   Can't do that.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.160]   Yep.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:05.360]   Yep.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:05.960]   That's smart.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.640]   I should turn that on.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.160]   So just turn it on.
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.120]   It just says, if they're not-- all I have on my Google
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.920]   voice is, if you're not in my address book,
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.920]   announce-- pre-announce yourself.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:15.800]   And that just stops them.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.400]   That's why I don't get any.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:17.720]   Easy.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:18.200]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.200]   I should do that.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.640]   People don't mind doing that.
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.400]   So you can turn on call screen just for people who
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.000]   are not in your address book.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.480]   Because I feel like my friends and family
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.800]   would be annoyed if they had to do that.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:27.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:28.320]   No.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.480]   In fact, it's one of the reasons I use Google voice is,
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.640]   you could have different categories
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.440]   and different kinds of responses.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:36.400]   If somebody's in my family, I say, I love you.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.160]   If they're not in my family, I hate you.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.000]   It's Jeff Jarvis, the Pixel Socks.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.440]   I could actually do that.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.200]   I, Jeff, it's Leo, the Pixel Socks.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:50.880]   I could actually do that.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:51.440]   Shmuck.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.640]   Shmuck.
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:58.560]   You spent $1,500, neen, neen, neen, neen, or--
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:01.360]   no, that's one of the great things about Google voice.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.120]   It's awesome.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.560]   I just hope they don't kill Google voice.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.360]   That would be so sad.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.480]   That would be really sad.
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.000]   Wouldn't that be bad?
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.200]   Really, really sad.
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.120]   They can't be made-- they're not making any money on it.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.240]   It's pure cost to them.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:14.680]   It's funny, though.
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.560]   In the left-hand side bar, though, there's a balance.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.440]   Your balance is $1, something like that.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.960]   Mine's $11.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.640]   Yeah, I have no idea how to add money, why I would add money.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.200]   Bye.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.440]   You don't make international calls.
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.720]   If you make international calls, they charge you
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:32.040]   a nominal amount, and you have to charge it up, I think,
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.520]   10 bucks at a time.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:33.520]   OK.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:36.040]   And it's too wallet.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:36.720]   Oh, OK.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.880]   But I don't think that's a profit center.
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:44.520]   They still-- that was one of the things they said,
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:49.120]   for one year only, free calling within the US, right?
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.480]   And US and Canada.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.760]   And they extended that last year.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:52.760]   No, I don't know.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:54.400]   Did they extend it into 2013?
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.520]   I guess so, because I'm in or anything.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.200]   It's not-- I'm confused as to how it does it,
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.080]   because I know you can do that via Gmail.
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.520]   But you can't really do it via Google.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.480]   Like if you go to the Gmail page--
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.800]   No, that's the Gmail page.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.840]   But I think that's a good voice.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.760]   It doesn't.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.880]   And then if you hit call on Google Voice,
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.560]   it actually calls your device, or it will call your Google
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.360]   Talk member.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:15.640]   Right.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.560]   It's not VoIP.
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:19.040]   It's an interesting workaround.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:22.400]   But see, the Google Talk is how you're doing it in Gmail.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.480]   Right.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:24.240]   Right.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.080]   And that's free.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.800]   But whenever you click call on the Google Voice page,
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.160]   it doesn't give you an option to do it from the browser.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.240]   It says, do you want me to call you on Google Talk?
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.600]   Do you want me to call you on your phone?
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.200]   Here it is from Captain Kipper in our chat room.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.040]   Google extended free Gmail voice calls
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.160]   in the US and Canada through 2013.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.320]   So they've done that twice now.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:43.320]   So that's through Gmail.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:44.680]   That's not through Gmail.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.600]   I always think of it as Google Voice, but you're right.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.200]   It's not.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.120]   Right.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.040]   So never mind.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.680]   Forget I said that.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.480]   But if you make a Google Voice call,
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.160]   you're using your carrier minutes
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.720]   to call that other number, which they--
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.240]   so that's what it is.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.680]   So it's just carrier minutes.
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:01.960]   Yeah.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.240]   You know, we have a Dudley, oh.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.440]   Oh my god.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.800]   Play the trumpets, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.840]   It's the changelog.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:15.840]   The Google changelog.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:23.920]   A nice big Google changelog from Gina Trapani.
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:24.640]   There it is.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.960]   We got quite a few items today.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:30.320]   So Google launched a new product called Google Maps Engine
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.080]   Lite.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.800]   So if you're an enterprise user, you already
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.920]   know that there's a Google Maps Engine, which
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:38.040]   gives businesses tools, pro tools
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:41.960]   to organize big data sets and give customers information
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.600]   about their location.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.360]   So for regular people, regular consumers,
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:49.560]   they've launched basically a beta Lite version of this.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.360]   You can find it at mapsengine.google.com/map.
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:55.440]   And using this tool, this beta tool,
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.560]   you can import a spreadsheet of locations onto a map
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.000]   and visualize those places using different styling
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   and icons.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.160]   They have a few examples on the Google Maps blog.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.360]   One is the map of project, which shows
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.240]   shark spotting locations off of the African coast.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:18.120]   Another one is in the San Francisco Bay Area Hiker site.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.480]   It shows best places to do a hike.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:24.000]   So yeah, if you want to make your own map,
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.360]   you can go to mapsengine.google.com/map
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:31.000]   and upload a series of points and map them how you want.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.320]   Google's Gmail's new compose window,
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.200]   which I think I talked about here on the change log,
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.880]   or at least we talked about it here on Twig.
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.080]   It launched in October 2012, and it's that popover experience.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.600]   So it's in the Gmail web app.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.520]   When you click on compose or reply,
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.880]   it's got this pop-up window that overlays on top of your inbox.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.760]   And it has a couple other cool features.
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:54.080]   It was this try it out, little beta feature.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.640]   It's not no longer optional.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.280]   It's becoming the default for everyone,
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.840]   and you're not going to have the option to opt out.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.560]   I actually have been opting out because I
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.200]   was so used to the old behavior.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.040]   But now that the new compose experience
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.320]   is going to be the default compose experience,
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.560]   I finally gave into it this week.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:12.720]   And it's actually really quite nice.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.920]   Over the time that it's been testing since October 2012,
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.040]   they've upgraded quite a bit.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.160]   You can see user icons when you type in addresses.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:20.800]   You can minimize.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.160]   If you're in the middle of composing an email,
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.560]   you can minimize it and do more work in your inbox
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.960]   without losing it or saving as a draft.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.120]   And it supports files from Google Drive.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.680]   So if you use the web-based Gmail,
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.280]   you'll see that you have to switch over that new compose
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.360]   experience soon.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.440]   Google Analytics got some upgrades this week as well.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:44.520]   The real-time reports got a bunch of little new dials
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:45.040]   and levers.
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.120]   You can filter reports on types of events that happen as they
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.240]   happen.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.840]   You can break down access, real-time access
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:56.800]   to your site by desktops or tablet or mobile screen
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:57.840]   in real-time.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.080]   You can create shortcuts to see particular segments quickly,
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.920]   compare real-time data to overall data.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.240]   So if you're an analytics junkie in your site,
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.840]   you start to get hammered with a lot of traffic.
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.280]   You can go into Google Analytics
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:12.040]   and see that stuff real-time quickly now
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.600]   with these new updates.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.760]   Auto-complete predictions in Gmail
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.680]   will now include past Gmail searches.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.040]   So if I had gone into Gmail last week
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.320]   and typed Google I/O, Jeff, and Leo,
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.000]   if I go back into Gmail now, as this rolls out,
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.880]   this is rolling out of the next couple of weeks
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.200]   and started to type that.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.640]   It will show up as a suggestion.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:34.720]   So kind of like auto-complete but smarter,
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.080]   Gmail now kind of knows what your past searches are
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:38.720]   and it will suggest them as you type.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:41.840]   And that is rolling out, I think, over the next few weeks.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:45.320]   And finally, the Chrome for Android Stable channel
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.800]   got a big update this week.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.480]   We talked about this last couple of change logs.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.120]   This is the update.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.080]   This is Chrome 26 for Android.
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:52.920]   And this is the update that you get
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.980]   password sync, autofill sync, and a couple other performance
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:58.280]   and stability improvements.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.080]   But if you wanted to sync your passwords and your autofill,
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.600]   your form autofills, you'll now get that in the stable version
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.720]   of Android on Chrome.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.000]   And that is in the Play Store.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.240]   I believe this afternoon, so you can get that update
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.960]   on your Android devices.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.600]   That's all I got.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.760]   That's the change log.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:18.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.880]   You know, Gina has her change log theme.
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.440]   I now have my Rance theme.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:22.940]   Yeah.
[01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:23.720]   Leo needs one.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.480]   I don't use it.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.360]   I'm thinking it's an EOR whining.
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:29.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:30.340]   Burn.
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.460]   Who burns?
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.380]   Oh, no, you dang.
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:34.380]   Oh, you dang.
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:35.380]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:38.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.380]   Oh.
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:42.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:43.020]   Oh, boy.
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:46.420]   I don't see how you can justify 1600 bucks almost
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:48.340]   for this thing.
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.140]   Oh, it's going up.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.380]   It's 16.
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:52.340]   Well, because I got the LTE version.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:53.140]   You got the LTE version.
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:54.780]   With tax, it was--
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:57.440]   I don't remember what it was, 1600 bucks.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.340]   Let's just say that I'm going to wait until I owe
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:00.300]   to try out the Pixel.
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:03.700]   I think maybe they'll give you one.
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:04.860]   You think they're going to give away?
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:05.780]   No, it's too expensive.
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:06.780]   It's too expensive.
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:07.780]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:08.780]   Yeah.
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:10.540]   How are they going to give away?
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:13.500]   Nexus 5s, maybe?
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:14.660]   I've got a--
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:17.100]   There is a-- we're going to-- sources say there'll
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:20.740]   be a second generation Nexus 7 tablet that,
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:23.820]   with a better screen, this might actually be--
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:26.300]   it's from Asus again.
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:30.620]   The Nexus 7 generation 2 or something like that.
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:33.300]   But they say it won't be out till July.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.740]   This is Reuters reporting.
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:38.820]   Two sources told us it will be powered by a Snapdragon
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:39.820]   from Qualcomm.
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:41.100]   I presume Quadcore.
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:46.100]   According to this story, says they
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:49.020]   want to ship as many as 8 million in the second half
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:50.740]   of this year.
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:52.580]   The 7 was quite a success.
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:54.780]   Did we ever get numbers?
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:57.420]   It was running on a Tigra 3, which
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:00.380]   it was fast at the time, not so fast anymore.
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:03.260]   I think pretty clear the Nexus 7 is one of Google's most,
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:05.740]   if not the most successful harbor profit--
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:08.580]   That was 200 bucks.
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:11.340]   And that really makes it easy to sell, right?
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:11.820]   Yeah.
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.500]   I mean, I feel like every Google I/O,
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.540]   you either will probably get the newest phones,
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.980]   the new Nexus 7, or the new Nexus phone.
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:18.740]   So the Nexus 5--
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:20.860]   If there's a Nexus 5, yeah.
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:22.900]   There's often some Chrome OS product,
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.500]   so I don't know if that'll be--
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:26.340]   I think Google Glass is too expensive.
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:28.260]   I don't think that they will give up Google Glass
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:29.140]   to everybody at I/O.
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:29.460]   I don't know.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:30.300]   They made surprises.
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:31.060]   That seems too expensive.
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.740]   The Pixel seems too expensive to me too.
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:36.580]   Maybe at 5 and a 7, and the new 7.
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:38.540]   Do you think-- I guess they do.
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:39.380]   They've done it in the past.
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:42.100]   They'll have a new product to show the queue.
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:42.620]   The queue?
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:44.900]   Yeah, there's always that left field product, right?
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:45.700]   Like the queue.
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:52.140]   There was a wonder I would think you'd be able to do it.
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:53.740]   It's not Schwag.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:54.540]   These are developers.
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:56.180]   They want developers right for their thing.
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:57.820]   So you give out things that you want people
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:58.940]   to write software for.
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:03.340]   Which I think still includes Chrome OS.
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:04.300]   Oh, God, yes.
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:05.180]   Absolutely.
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:05.660]   Absolutely.
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:07.180]   No matter what you say about a Leo.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:08.060]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:11.180]   I mean, there's no question Google is, for reasons
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:13.260]   I don't understand, totally in on this.
[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:19.300]   And now you just-- now you know I'm just going to go for it.
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.300]   Yeah.
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:22.780]   I'm just going to get worse and worse.
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:23.780]   You're egging me on.
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:29.660]   I stood toe to toe with Sundar Pichai
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:31.700]   at some Google events a couple of years ago saying,
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:32.860]   I don't get Chrome OS.
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:35.100]   What the hell are you doing here?
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.380]   Well, can you just-- can you say that Chrome OS is a success?
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:41.300]   No.
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:47.740]   When I said-- when I wrote my pay on to LaVita Google
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:51.620]   on my blog, what's his name?
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:56.580]   Who's the nice guy who's on the Chrome book team who
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:57.820]   was in our chat the first week?
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:00.980]   Oh, yeah, G-something.
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:01.660]   I apologize to you.
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:02.580]   I know you're listening right now.
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:03.220]   And I apologize.
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:04.580]   But it's very late to them.
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:05.100]   We like you.
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:05.940]   And I'm having a--
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:06.420]   Lucy.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:07.940]   His name was Lucy.
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:08.220]   No.
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:09.220]   So nice.
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:11.180]   Yeah.
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:14.740]   I had said that I thought that the reason the Chromebook
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:17.860]   existed was to try to show that Chrome OS was ready for prime
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:18.980]   time as an OS.
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:21.660]   Yeah, that was the response I got to Google.
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:26.180]   Oh, thank you.
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:26.700]   That's it.
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:29.180]   OK.
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:32.140]   Me, you can argue that Chrome OS is so--
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:32.860]   It's Chrome.
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.060]   It's part of like it's Chrome, right?
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.700]   And Chrome is an incredible success.
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:37.620]   Right.
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:38.620]   You know?
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.380]   So it's hard to say--
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:41.220]   You know, it was just thinking with Leo's goating,
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:43.580]   do I-- you know, if I want a Windows machine,
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:44.580]   you know, put Chrome--
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:46.660]   No, you want to-- look, you want a MacBook.
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:48.300]   You want a retina MacBook is what you want.
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:50.300]   But even so, the advantage now is
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:56.420]   when I download stuff on Chrome, it goes straight into Drive.
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:18:01.820]   It's yet another layer of integration into Googleville.
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:04.260]   Yeah, which you're more than willing to do.
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:04.860]   But I don't know.
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:06.860]   I think you--
[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:08.660]   I don't know.
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:09.180]   Go ahead.
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:10.540]   Sam, go ahead.
[01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:12.580]   I don't know if that's a mainstream attitude.
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:14.620]   Maybe it is.
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:18.340]   Well, I think going-- this is what the show is about.
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:19.500]   Living more and more and more on Google--
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:20.420]   Love to eat at Google.
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:21.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:23.020]   --is definitely mainstream.
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:25.620]   It's just a question of what, when?
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:28.940]   So a 13-inch MacBook Pro with retina
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:31.700]   is the same price as a Pixel.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:36.900]   For that, you get roughly the same core i5 processor.
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:39.660]   You get more storage, 128 gigs of flash storage.
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:41.020]   But of course, you need more storage,
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:43.580]   because it's not a cloud device.
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:47.460]   Same graphics, HD 4000 graphics.
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:49.060]   Seven hours of battery life.
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:55.460]   It's probably a little heavier, but not much.
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:58.900]   And you get that beautiful display.
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.980]   And you get a full operating system.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:03.460]   Just seems to me more desirable.
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:06.300]   If I were going to buy a Mac, though, I'd buy an error.
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:06.980]   Yeah, I like the error.
[01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:08.460]   And I think it's probably a good idea
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:10.220]   to wait and see what Apple's doing with the error.
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:13.460]   I wouldn't be surprised to see a retina error.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:17.060]   And then that's something.
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:20.100]   Now you're cooking with gas.
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:20.820]   I don't know.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:25.540]   I mean, I can't say you should buy this just for the screen.
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:29.580]   And this connect for me is that the Pixel is high-end hardware
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:32.740]   aimed at a low-end audience.
[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:34.300]   But that's what I was trying to say
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:38.220]   that they're trying to show, is that Chrome, living in the cloud,
[01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:39.740]   is high-end.
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.460]   Two.
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:44.540]   That's what Google's trying to prove here.
[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:47.460]   No, I think you're right.
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:51.540]   Baidu, the Chinese search engine, is working on Baidu glass.
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:52.700]   It's called Baidu Eye.
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:56.660]   Everybody's working on everything.
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:57.580]   I think that's safe to say.
[01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:59.140]   Instead of you seeing the pictures that
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.180]   could take a big secret number.
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:01.180]   They see you.
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:06.340]   Feedly says in that the two weeks since Google readers
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:09.940]   shut down now 3 million new users.
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:11.380]   3 millions of number.
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:13.060]   3 million is bigger than half a million.
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:13.820]   That was the first number.
[01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:16.620]   3 million is a big number.
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:18.820]   Here's my question about Feedly.
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:19.820]   I'm using it.
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:20.580]   It's OK.
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:21.580]   I'm going to get used to it.
[01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:22.940]   It's OK.
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:25.780]   But every time it forgets me, it has
[01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:31.340]   to be re-authenticated through Google Reader.
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:32.500]   So it doesn't seem as if it's actually--
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:33.340]   Well, no, they have to.
[01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:34.340]   That's just temporary.
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:36.140]   Obviously, that won't work after July
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:37.140]   when readers shut down.
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:38.740]   They have to provide their own backwind.
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:40.540]   And that's what they're working on, obviously.
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:41.540]   OK.
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:42.540]   Yeah.
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:43.540]   Yeah.
[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:45.940]   So tomorrow, Facebook-- and we will cover it
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:50.060]   during the Tech News Today show at 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern.
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:52.660]   Facebook will be making an announcement.
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:53.180]   The--
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:54.220]   It's a tomorrow, yeah.
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:55.220]   Yeah.
[01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:58.620]   The invitation said, come see our new home on Android.
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:02.060]   And we-- on Mac Break Weekly yesterday,
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:05.180]   had Renee Richie, who has some sources, who says,
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:06.180]   this is what he believes.
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:08.940]   It's going to be a--
[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:11.580]   kind of a new launcher on an HTC phone.
[01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:13.860]   He says, it's not fully a new launcher.
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:15.940]   It's a modified launcher.
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:17.500]   And as you know, if you're an Android user,
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:20.500]   the launcher is the app that's running most of the time
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:23.620]   that gives you the desktop and the icons and all of that stuff.
[01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:25.900]   I thought, man, I posited-- it could be something
[01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:29.660]   as little as a new homepage widget with Facebook functionality.
[01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:31.620]   But he says, more than that-- it's something more than that,
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:35.100]   but something less than a launcher.
[01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:37.900]   Now, this is coming from Brian Chen and Nick
[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:38.980]   Bilton at the New York Times.
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:41.700]   They have very good sources.
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:44.940]   They say, the phone made by HTC uses a version of Android
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:48.020]   according to two people briefed on the announcement.
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:49.860]   A special version of Android.
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:52.020]   Some of the core features of the phone, like the camera,
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:54.780]   will be built around Facebook's services,
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:58.180]   maybe an Instagram camera.
[01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:01.620]   These are two people from--
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:03.580]   according, one is a Facebook employee,
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:05.700]   and I guess other people who have been briefed on Facebook's
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:07.820]   plans agreed.
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:10.940]   Facebook, of course, isn't saying officially.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:15.740]   That's a kind of a fork of Android kind of akin to the Kindle.
[01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:18.780]   Exactly what I was thinking.
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:20.780]   And if they put it out there, if HTC
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:27.260]   makes it a legal route, basically, right?
[01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:29.580]   Presumably it's a version that you could put on your own rooted
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:32.900]   phone, maybe, too.
[01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:34.780]   It would be in Facebook, et cetera, to allow that.
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:36.580]   Facebook employee familiar with an announcement
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:38.300]   said that when the Facebook phone is turned on,
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:42.140]   it immediately displays a Facebook user's home screen.
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:43.860]   God, I don't want that.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:46.980]   No, I don't need to--
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:48.620]   I think there are a lot of people that do want this, though.
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:49.300]   Are there?
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:49.660]   Yeah.
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:52.660]   I think there are people who, yes, getting on the internet
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:54.540]   means going on to Facebook.
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:55.060]   Yeah.
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:57.380]   Yeah, the same people who are getting on the internet
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:59.180]   getting on AOL some years ago.
[01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:00.620]   Yeah, but I think there are a lot of people who
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:02.460]   want to support phone setting check face.
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.900]   I talked to my Indian students.
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:07.980]   And they said that's the case for all their family
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:09.500]   back in India.
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:12.380]   I don't deny that everybody's family, all my family,
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:13.860]   everybody-- that's how you stay in touch with friends
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:14.660]   and family.
[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:17.100]   But it's something you use because you have to, not
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.260]   because you want to, I think.
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.460]   I think that's just us.
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:22.060]   Yeah.
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.900]   And think about everything Facebook has.
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:26.060]   Facebook has your entire address book.
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:27.100]   Messaging.
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.660]   Instead of text messaging, you can call the dialer,
[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:30.580]   the messaging music.
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:31.380]   We were talking about this last night
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:33.580]   on all about Android, photos, the things
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:34.620]   that you do on your phone.
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:36.700]   Facebook has some sort of software that can do that.
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:40.140]   So you can imagine a phone that's basically the Facebook phone.
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:42.140]   I have family members, I think, who would love a Facebook
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:43.060]   phone.
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:46.260]   The Times point out that HTC once made a phone called
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:50.260]   the cha-cha that had a button for posting photos directly
[01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:50.900]   to Facebook.
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:51.900]   It sold poorly.
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:58.620]   In 2008, INQ, a phone-maker-based in London
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:23:59.660]   released a phone called the Inc.
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:02.260]   One that integrated Facebook services
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:05.700]   into crucial areas of the device.
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:07.540]   It was going to do an Inc.
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:11.380]   Cloud touch, which had Facebook services right on the home
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:11.700]   screen.
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:13.900]   It pulled the plug on that, said, now we're
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:14.940]   going in another direction.
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:22.620]   Well, if I'm Facebook, of course, I make that.
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:24.500]   I think you should have a dedicated poke button.
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:29.460]   Can you still poke on Facebook?
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:30.500]   Oh, no, right?
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:31.860]   You can't.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:32.860]   I don't think so.
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:34.100]   I think you can.
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.260]   Deepercated that.
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:36.660]   They don't poke anymore.
[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:39.780]   I thought that was that whole extra app that went after Snapchat.
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:40.460]   Oh, right.
[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:41.620]   The Snapchat app is--
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:44.060]   They got an app called Poke.
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:47.700]   But let's see if I'm on Matthew Ingram's page.
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:50.260]   Can I poke him?
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:51.060]   Guess not.
[01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:51.860]   Don't wake him up.
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:53.660]   I can't poke him anymore.
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:55.220]   Ope the bear.
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:56.220]   Oh, well, he's not a friend.
[01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:57.500]   Wait a minute.
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:02.340]   I'm sorry I went to somebody who doesn't like me, apparently.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:06.020]   Even though he's been on the show many times, let's see.
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:07.540]   Who else?
[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:09.260]   They've mixed all these people I don't know here.
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:11.900]   Veronica Belmont, surely she's friended me.
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:12.820]   Yeah.
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:15.020]   OK, message.
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:15.780]   Yeah, there's a poke.
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:16.900]   It's buried.
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:17.380]   Oh, OK.
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:17.540]   It's--
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:18.740]   Under message.
[01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:19.260]   OK.
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:20.660]   I better not poke her, though.
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:22.220]   That sends a bad message.
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:27.780]   You could poke people if they allow you to poke them,
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:29.700]   says Space Guy in our chatroom.
[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:31.260]   Apparently he's been inquiring.
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:32.300]   Central poking.
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:33.300]   Yeah.
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:42.380]   So we'll see you tomorrow.
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:47.500]   I mean, look, if Nick Bilton and Brian X Chen on New York
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:53.260]   Times say that this is the fact Jack, then this must be it.
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:56.340]   This will be a phone, an HTC phone running a customized
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:01.340]   version of Android that puts Facebook front and center.
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:03.740]   And we'll see how well it does.
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:05.740]   It just shows-- I mean, that's one of the strengths of Android.
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:06.940]   You can totally do that, right?
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:07.940]   Mm-hmm.
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:12.540]   And HTC's got nothing to lose.
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:16.300]   They have like 1% of the market, so why not?
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.900]   Isn't Facebook doing-- what's it called?
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:20.620]   Facebook Zero that in developing markets,
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:22.580]   they're paying the access if you go to Facebook?
[01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:25.340]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:27.620]   And I think I said this on the show last week.
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:30.380]   What wowed me was the-- did I talk about this?
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:32.340]   The really inexpensive smartphones
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:35.700]   I saw on the airport on the way back from India?
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:36.460]   No.
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:36.900]   No.
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:37.260]   OK.
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:40.580]   So there's no news to you, I don't think.
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:47.580]   But a Samsung brand three-inch low-res screen
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:49.340]   smartphone for $100.
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:49.860]   Right.
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:50.940]   Unlock.
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:53.340]   Yeah, you get those here, too.
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:54.380]   All right, I didn't realize it.
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:56.100]   I didn't realize it because they don't really market them here.
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:57.100]   No, they don't push them.
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:02.940]   There's a non-Android smartphone Samsung, again, for about $68.
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:05.940]   And then that just amazes me for the next three billion
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:06.460]   to come on.
[01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:08.340]   It's an internet access device.
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:08.820]   That's right.
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:10.820]   Not great, but as good as we had not long ago.
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:12.180]   That's right.
[01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:17.020]   And the stall around a lot of that
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:21.300]   is data charges with telcos.
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:26.340]   Well, if Facebook came along and said, we are the internet,
[01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:31.340]   AOL, and if you come to us on this phone,
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:35.940]   we will pay the freight.
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:36.980]   That could be pretty powerful.
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:37.940]   That would be interesting.
[01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:40.260]   I don't think they'd do that in the US, would they?
[01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:40.780]   No.
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:41.100]   No.
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:41.860]   Fully developing more.
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:42.900]   It's the third world.
[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:43.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:46.780]   Now, somebody in the chatroom said, and this is true,
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:49.620]   that HTC, because they're a big part of the open handset
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:54.540]   alliance, would not behoose them to release an Android phone that
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:55.940]   didn't have the Google products on it.
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:59.860]   So for sure, this will have Google Maps and G+,
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:03.420]   and if it's jellybean, it'll have Google Now and all of that.
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:05.100]   There's no question about that.
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:06.140]   It just may not be the front.
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:07.900]   Man, if it's in here, they actually said they're
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:09.700]   saying they're going to be on Android,
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:14.060]   as opposed to Amazon, which prior to mask all evidence
[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:14.540]   of Android.
[01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:15.780]   Yeah, you're exactly right.
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:16.740]   Yeah.
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:17.740]   Yeah.
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:18.740]   Yeah.
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:22.620]   And by the way, it's not their bosom buddies Microsoft.
[01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:24.660]   It ain't a Microsoft product.
[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:26.660]   That's a good point too.
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:28.780]   It's not running Windows phone.
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:29.780]   Right.
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:32.980]   RDO is doing video.
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:36.700]   They're going to, RDO is a social music site like Spotify.
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:42.460]   They're going to do a new service, a streaming video site, VDIO.
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:43.860]   It's been enclosed beta.
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:46.140]   It's a rental and purchasing platform, not a subscription
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:47.140]   service.
[01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:52.660]   It says more like Voodoo than it is like Netflix, but it does have social, which was what RDO
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:55.660]   did so well with music.
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:58.380]   Gina's watching, this is 40.
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:00.380]   I am?
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:06.500]   Leo's watching, this is 60.
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.900]   You sign in with your Facebook account.
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:15.060]   You have to be a RDO unlimited subscriber in the US or the UK if you want to use it.
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:20.180]   This is going to get a, this is going to get crazy soon.
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:24.140]   This whole, this whole cord cut in space.
[01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:25.140]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:28.340]   It's fascinating.
[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:31.700]   You saw that area when it's cord case, which I thought was.
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:32.700]   Yeah.
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:36.220]   I'm sure the networks aren't happy and the channels, locals aren't happy.
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:38.260]   We have mentioned area before many times.
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:42.140]   It's the very dealer company that started in Manhattan is now spreading to the rest of
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:43.140]   the country.
[01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:47.060]   The local channels have been suing them saying you're reselling our content and we're not
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:48.700]   getting any money.
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:49.700]   Area says, no, we're not.
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:54.580]   What we're selling is little tiny antennas in New York City that are connected to the
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:55.580]   internet.
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:59.060]   You log into your account and you can see New York City local television and real time
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:01.660]   live without a cable account.
[01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:05.300]   But what you're leasing is an antenna and the courts agreed.
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:07.100]   It's not copyright violation.
[01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:08.340]   They're not selling the content.
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.940]   They're leasing an antenna.
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:16.080]   That was the, if you care about this, the good news, the bad news of the week was the
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:19.540]   resale decision, digital resale.
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:20.540]   Tell us about that.
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:23.540]   Oh, you didn't see that.
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:32.360]   So I forget which level of court said that digital properties are not like real properties
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:39.220]   and there is no first sale doctrine, no right of reselling digital properties.
[01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:43.300]   And what would that, how would that change things?
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:45.460]   It has to do with music, for instance.
[01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:52.260]   So if I buy, if I buy, it's in other words, illegal to sell used digital music.
[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:53.260]   Used.
[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:56.220]   Or books or anything.
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:31:00.980]   So you have no, you have no rights.
[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:03.460]   Does that apply to domain names?
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:05.500]   I think it's content we're talking about.
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:06.500]   Content.
[01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:08.460]   Content is a copyright issue.
[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:15.100]   Now, this judge is a federal judge in New York.
[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:16.020]   Think it's trial judge.
[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:23.100]   So now this could go on to appeal, of course.
[01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:28.860]   This week's ruling judge, Richard J Sullivan, talking about a service called Redigie, which
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:34.260]   is an online marketplace letting you sell your legally acquired digital music files and
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:36.420]   buy digital music from others at a fraction of the price.
[01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:42.980]   So I bought the Jay Z album, the black album for $10.
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:45.500]   I'm going to sell it on this site for $5.
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.580]   You could buy it.
[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:51.860]   I get some money and you get a half price Jay Z album.
[01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:56.860]   Judge Sullivan says, "Redigie infringes capital's exclusive right of reproduction as well as
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:58.980]   its exclusive right of distribution.
[01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:02.780]   The court cannot of its own accord condone the wholesale application of the first sale
[01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:05.060]   defense to the digital sphere."
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:08.900]   Well, is that bad news?
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:11.300]   It actually kind of makes sense.
[01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:12.980]   Here's where it goes.
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:16.900]   I don't understand the implications of this and nobody fought out.
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:21.180]   What does it mean in terms of somebody said afterwards, "Well, Apple really does own my
[01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:22.180]   music."
[01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:23.780]   Yeah, you're licensing it.
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:25.180]   You're licensing it, that's it.
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:31.260]   But you pay the price to supposedly buy it and you're not.
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:33.660]   The hope was always that, "Yes, I did buy it.
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:35.340]   I could move it across my platforms.
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:36.340]   I could do this with it.
[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:37.620]   I could do that with it because I bought it.
[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:39.500]   I could give it to somebody."
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.500]   No.
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:45.140]   So apparently this ruling doesn't really address that licensing versus selling distinction.
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:52.660]   It's merely saying that you're making a copy for somebody and that is an unauthorized reproduction.
[01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:53.660]   But you are.
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:56.460]   This is going to be fought out and the implications will come out.
[01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:59.740]   I was surprised somebody hasn't said it's easier to give a gun in this country than it is
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:00.740]   a song.
[01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:06.540]   In 2001, the US Copyright Office argued strongly against allowing consumers the right to resell
[01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:08.540]   digital works.
[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:14.300]   I don't think, this is also that issue of, "Well, if I die, what happens to my music collection
[01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:16.900]   or my e-book collection?"
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:17.900]   It goes away.
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:18.900]   It's a way.
[01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:20.380]   I can't handle it.
[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:24.180]   And I think this is not unreasonable to say, "Well, if you want to hand down books, buy books.
[01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:27.180]   If you want to hand down records, buy CDs."
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:28.180]   No, no.
[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:32.580]   No, because what if books just aren't, "Let's make up this world."
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:35.420]   There's still being though something we'll think it is.
[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:36.420]   Can't afford to print books anymore.
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:37.420]   There's not printed.
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:38.420]   Right.
[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:40.060]   They're just digital.
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:43.060]   So now it's not an alternative to the analog product.
[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:44.060]   It is the product.
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:45.060]   It is the thing.
[01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:49.260]   Well, in return for the convenience and the reduced cost of that, you don't get to hand
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:52.180]   it down.
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:58.020]   But the reduced cost is BS because the manufacturing cost was actually got down to a nub.
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:06.340]   If your smart uncle, Jed, had a library of 12,000 books that you inherited, that would
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.340]   be a fine thing.
[01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:09.020]   Now they would go up and smoke.
[01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:10.020]   Right.
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:11.420]   Because they are smoke.
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:12.420]   They're bits.
[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:16.220]   I don't think a digital native generation sees this as a problem.
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:20.740]   I think a generation like us that's transitional between the physical goods and the digital
[01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:23.260]   goods might.
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:27.500]   But do digital natives, Gina, you're the youngest person here by a mile.
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:30.060]   Yeah, I'm still pretty old though.
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:33.940]   I mean, you know, I burn mixed CDs in college.
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:34.940]   I'm still pretty old.
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:35.940]   Okay.
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:36.940]   You're too old for this.
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:37.940]   All right.
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:38.940]   Yeah.
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:39.940]   Yeah.
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:44.220]   I don't think my 18 year old thinks he owns any records.
[01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:49.020]   And it's reinforced for him because if he loses the iPod, it's gone.
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:51.380]   And it doesn't care.
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:52.780]   Anyways, like fine.
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:55.220]   In fact, increasingly people aren't even buying records.
[01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:56.740]   They're just listening to Spotify.
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:57.740]   Yeah.
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:58.740]   I mean, I think that that's the thing, right?
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:00.740]   I think that the concept of ownership is just changing.
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:01.740]   Right.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:02.900]   I think there is this.
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:07.060]   There is, you don't have the collectors, you know, my dad, he used to like tape TV shows
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:08.580]   on desk tapes.
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:10.060]   And then he would like label them.
[01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:12.900]   We had this entire shelf full of like stuff that data tape off.
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:13.900]   That what do you do?
[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:14.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:16.460]   And you don't want that.
[01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:17.460]   You don't want it.
[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:21.420]   I mean, I mean, I know a lot of people who have big hard drives full of media that they've
[01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:23.020]   been collecting over the years.
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:25.660]   But I think increasingly that's just.
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:29.620]   But the truth is, even though the lot is a supporter, you can give that hard drive to
[01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:30.620]   your heirs.
[01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:31.620]   I mean, they've got it.
[01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:33.060]   It's not like it does really go away.
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.060]   It may not.
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:37.140]   They don't have legal right to it, but it's not.
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:38.900]   I mean, it's not really disappearing.
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:42.340]   It's not like it goes up and smoke with as soon as you die.
[01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:43.340]   Right.
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:48.780]   So, you know, and I don't know if your heirs want that hard drive.
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:52.140]   They certainly don't want the VHS tapes with every episode of Cheers on them.
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:53.140]   Yeah.
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:57.620]   But now I have, now I got to confess this, but for my days, I have boxes and boxes of video
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:59.500]   tapes with me on them.
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.020]   Right.
[01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:04.220]   Every appearance I made, I thought it was a special thing that I was on TV.
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:05.220]   Right.
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:07.020]   And I'd save that and I can't throw them out.
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:08.020]   What are you going to do with those?
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:09.020]   You don't want those.
[01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:12.460]   You got to, you got to, you got to transconvert them to be digital.
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:16.580]   People ask me, didn't you save any of the shows that you didn't know?
[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:23.860]   The one thing that I wanted to finally came out was my appearance on moonlighting.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:26.540]   That you should save and thank God for YouTube.
[01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:29.860]   Too bad they closed down last week.
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:31.020]   Yeah.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:34.540]   It's not, but it's a very bad copy on YouTube.
[01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:36.940]   Isn't it?
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:37.940]   We played it once.
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:38.940]   Yeah, we did play it.
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:39.940]   We played it.
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:40.940]   Okay.
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:41.940]   I don't play again.
[01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:42.940]   Oh, I want to play it.
[01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:43.940]   Now I'm going to look.
[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:53.020]   And like in between like explaining something 1987 posted by crab walk illegally, of course,
[01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:56.540]   and Internet Explorer has stopped working.
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:01.060]   I think that your video crashed on Windows eight.
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:03.820]   This happens a lot on Windows eight, by the way.
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:07.460]   I think when you get to the place where you're like, if I really want a song, if I want to
[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:12.180]   hear a song or watch a show, I feel reasonably confident that I will be able to find it online.
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:13.740]   I don't need to keep it on our hard drive.
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:14.740]   That's exactly right.
[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:16.300]   I think then it completely changes, right?
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:19.180]   The need to like hoard the things that you love goes away.
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:23.220]   Hi, I'm Jeff Jarvis, TV critic for People Magazine.
[01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:25.620]   I love that.
[01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:27.380]   Actually, this quality is excellent.
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:29.060]   Thank you crab walk.
[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:31.300]   Let's play it one more time.
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:32.540]   I love this.
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:36.340]   Hi, I'm Jeff Jarvis, TV critic for People Magazine.
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:37.940]   Like many of you, I was disappointed.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:39.780]   No, make that fed up.
[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:43.260]   No one third thought make that enraged with moonlighting reruns reruns reruns, reruns
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:44.260]   reruns.
[01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:46.060]   You haven't changed a bit.
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:47.060]   So great.
[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:49.700]   Something here is a hell of a lot of prayer.
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:51.820]   It's a lot darker.
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:52.820]   You look good though.
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:53.820]   I like this.
[01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:54.820]   How's moonlighting?
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:55.820]   What was there to do on Tuesday nights?
[01:37:55.820 --> 01:37:58.140]   Watch the home shopping network, start a family, read.
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:00.140]   Well, the crisis is over.
[01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:01.380]   Moonlighting's back.
[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:04.740]   Last week at long last, they gave us a fresh episode.
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:07.300]   And tonight they're giving us one that's even fresher.
[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:09.540]   But there's a catch, a hitch, a cruel trick.
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:12.820]   If you didn't watch last week's show, you probably didn't bother because you figured
[01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:16.620]   it's just another rerun, then you won't know what the hell's happening tonight's show.
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:17.740]   But fear not, don't sweat.
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:21.740]   I have right here a tape of last week's episode, and I'll show you all the good parts.
[01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:24.300]   It won't take long.
[01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:25.300]   It all started when David--
[01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:27.300]   Yeah, we don't have to go through this.
[01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:28.300]   That was a great show.
[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:29.300]   I love moonlighting.
[01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:33.540]   Bruce Willis, Sibyl Shepherd.
[01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.300]   And I talked too fast even then.
[01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:38.340]   By the way, Leo, I went to a live show.
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:41.420]   Do you know what a Gian Gomeshi from CBC?
[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:42.420]   I do.
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:44.940]   Cue is just a great show.
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:46.420]   I love this.
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.700]   He's one of the best interviewers there is.
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:49.700]   It is, yeah.
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:52.620]   And they did a show in New York, which is just great.
[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:56.900]   And I saw Vampire Weekend, which others was kind of wasted on me because I didn't know
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:59.540]   how cool they were, but fun.
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:04.500]   So at the after party, three executives for Vampire Weekend, their representatives in
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:06.700]   Canada were standing there, and we started doing the Interruptions.
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:12.180]   And as my voice came on, the guy before I said my name said, I know that voice.
[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:13.180]   I know your voice.
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:14.180]   Where do I know you?
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:16.180]   And I said, twig?
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:17.980]   Yes, you're kidding.
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:19.180]   That was Gian Gomeshi?
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:21.180]   No, not Gian.
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:22.900]   But this rep.
[01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:23.900]   Oh.
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:25.900]   It's the power of Leo, I always say.
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:26.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:27.900]   So cool.
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:28.900]   Now, Vampire Weekend knew who we were.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:29.900]   Now I'd be happy.
[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:30.900]   That would be--
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:31.900]   Yeah, that would be.
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:32.900]   Yeah.
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:35.900]   Leo, I hate to say this, but I have a babysitter for nine more minutes.
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:36.900]   Let's go.
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:37.900]   We got to go.
[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:41.700]   Ladies and gentlemen, time for Gina Trapetti's tip of the week.
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:43.900]   Oh, I didn't mean to wrap in that.
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:45.140]   No, we're done.
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:46.140]   We're done.
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:47.140]   All right.
[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:48.140]   Leo, don't--
[01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:49.140]   No, no, no, no.
[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:50.140]   Argue me if you want Gina.
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:53.420]   Yeah, well, after you leave, Jeff and I are going to go to Fisticuffs.
[01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:54.940]   I'm ready to go to sleep.
[01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:55.940]   Step outside.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:58.060]   Yeah, well, Jeff, what time is it for you there?
[01:39:58.060 --> 01:39:59.060]   It's late, right?
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:02.420]   It is 21 minutes after midnight.
[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:03.420]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:04.420]   We're keeping Jeff up.
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:05.420]   We're keeping your babysitter.
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:06.420]   Let's get going here.
[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:07.420]   Move along.
[01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:08.420]   Move along.
[01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:09.420]   All right, so tip this week.
[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:10.420]   We're going to fall asleep faster.
[01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:11.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:12.900]   Really cool shortcut.
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:18.100]   I had no idea about in Google Maps on Android and iOS.
[01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:21.860]   So if you've got your phone in your hand and you've got only one finger available and
[01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:26.540]   you're in Google Maps, you know you can pinch with two fingers to zoom on a map, but you
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:28.460]   can also zoom with one finger.
[01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:32.300]   So the way that you do it-- and it's kind of hidden, it's not very intuitive-- you double
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:37.780]   tap on the map and then you pull down with one finger and it'll zoom you in and out on
[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:38.780]   maps.
[01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:41.940]   It's pretty super, super handy, especially if you're navigating around town and you've
[01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:43.340]   only got one hand to do so.
[01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:44.340]   Awesome.
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:48.620]   Yes, little video there showing this working.
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:52.300]   So double tap and then pull down, pull up.
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:54.660]   Very cool.
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:57.940]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week?
[01:40:57.940 --> 01:41:02.740]   When I was going through my communications problems before, did you play the Stewie Chrome
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:03.860]   promo video?
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:04.860]   We did not.
[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:07.500]   Okay, then I'll use that as number one.
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:09.060]   How old is Stewie age one?
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:10.380]   I'll use that as a number.
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:12.140]   I thought you'd like it since it's Family Guy.
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:13.140]   I love Stewie.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:15.340]   We did a Chrome promo video.
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:16.900]   Stewie is Seth MacFarlane.
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:18.660]   Do you have it there, Chad?
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:21.420]   It's on the-- there you go.
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:23.740]   Is this paid for by Google?
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:24.740]   Mom.
[01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:25.740]   Mom.
[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:26.740]   Mom.
[01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:27.740]   Mommy.
[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:28.740]   Mommy.
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:29.740]   Mommy.
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:30.740]   Mommy.
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:31.740]   Mommy.
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:33.580]   He does this a lot.
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:34.580]   Mom.
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:35.580]   Mom.
[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:36.580]   Mom.
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:37.580]   Mom.
[01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:44.020]   For those who are you listening only, obviously that was Stewie yelling at his mother who was--
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:46.220]   looked like she was on a pixel actually.
[01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:49.220]   This is my very near future.
[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:50.460]   Yes.
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:52.300]   They kids do that by the way.
[01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:53.300]   Yes.
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:56.700]   What he doesn't end up doing is like-- so she'll go, "Mom.
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:57.700]   Mom.
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:41:58.700]   Mom.
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:41:59.700]   Mom.
[01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:00.700]   Gina.
[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:01.700]   Gina Trapani.
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:03.660]   Google host Gina Trapani.
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:05.660]   It gets more, you know.
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:07.940]   When Edna calls me by my full name, I'm-- that's--
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:08.940]   She will.
[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:10.100]   She'll call you-- oh, Gina.
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:12.580]   I'm going to be slightly less love struck than I am right now.
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:13.580]   Yeah.
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:16.100]   No, you got a long time before that happens.
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:17.620]   Where did she call you, bitch, for the first time?
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:18.620]   Then.
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:19.620]   Oh.
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:23.700]   Did you ever-- did you ever get to that point with your mom as a teenager?
[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:26.660]   I don't know that I ever-- I raised-- I'm pretty strict casted.
[01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:27.660]   She would have smacked you.
[01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:28.660]   I thought it.
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:30.220]   I don't know that I ever said it.
[01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:31.220]   Yeah.
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:32.220]   She would have smacked you.
[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:33.220]   Yes.
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:34.220]   Yeah.
[01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:38.420]   She once said, "It's amazing how much I hate you both."
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:39.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:40.420]   I-- I-- there was a hate.
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.420]   There were hate stuff for you.
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:43.420]   Hate you.
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:44.420]   Hate you.
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:49.020]   You're not letting me go to the rap concert with my 38-year-old boyfriend.
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:50.820]   I hate you.
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:55.380]   It is Camaro.
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:56.380]   So is that a number?
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:57.380]   The number is one.
[01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:58.380]   Stewie's age.
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:42:59.380]   That was it.
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:00.380]   I just cheated.
[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:01.380]   No, that's not cheating.
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:02.380]   I'm going to cheat too.
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:08.140]   I don't use this tool, but Google has released for the iPad and now for Android and iOS as
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:14.020]   well a way to-- if you're-- but you have to be-- so I'm not a Google apps user.
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:16.500]   I mean, I am technically, I think.
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:19.380]   But they have released-- did you even mention this in the change log?
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:20.380]   Did you?
[01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:21.380]   No.
[01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:22.380]   What-- were they released?
[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:28.620]   A new tool, a new app that lets you open these-- let me see if I can find it here.
[01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:30.620]   I'm well-prepared.
[01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:33.300]   It's in the notes.
[01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:35.660]   Here it is.
[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:36.660]   Quick office for apps.
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:37.660]   Nope.
[01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:38.660]   I didn't mention this.
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:39.660]   All right.
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:41.860]   See, I found something.
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:44.260]   Free iPad, Android, and iPhone.
[01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:46.980]   You have to be an apps customer.
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:49.940]   Quick office is meant for business users that have to share files and collaborate with
[01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:52.620]   users who don't yet use Google Docs.
[01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:57.060]   I think they acquired this about a year ago and a quick office.
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:58.820]   And it was always a great little app.
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:01.700]   So now that you can get it for free, because it used to be quite expensive.
[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:04.660]   It will open Microsoft Office.
[01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:09.180]   Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel documents.
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:11.740]   Should save them back into Google Drive.
[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:13.380]   You can do round tripping.
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:18.460]   So you can edit office files and save them back out so that those poor people who don't
[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:24.900]   use Google apps for business but do use Microsoft Office can see your changes.
[01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:26.300]   So this is nice.
[01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:28.700]   Quick office was acquired.
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:32.220]   Yeah, in June 2012, they had native apps at the time for iPhone.
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.500]   iPad, Android, and Symbian.
[01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:37.300]   I don't think they'll do Symbian anymore, but quick office for iPhone.
[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:41.100]   Now free for Android as well.
[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:45.860]   And that's good actually, because you can round trip Microsoft Office Docs.
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:47.220]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:48.220]   Thank you for staying up late.
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:52.860]   Jeff, thank you for doing all you do, Gina, and taking some time off from Edda, because
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:55.140]   I know that's got to be painful.
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:56.540]   I love doing the show.
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:57.540]   We love having you.
[01:44:57.540 --> 01:45:00.740]   And we love you on all about Android every Tuesday.
[01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:02.740]   This week in Google on Wednesday.
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:04.660]   We're doing as others, other babies.
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:05.660]   Yeah, we are.
[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:08.300]   We are babies too, because I'm going to tell you that picture.
[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:09.300]   Docs!
[01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:10.300]   I know, I'm going to have this separate YouTube.
[01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:11.300]   You suck!
[01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:12.300]   You suck!
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:14.780]   And you're a nag you!
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:22.020]   Somebody in the chat room said, "What did the hungry monster do to the pixel?"
[01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:23.020]   He pixelated.
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:28.180]   Hey, I got to do the up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right, though.
[01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:30.540]   So then I can see that, then I'll send it back.
[01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:31.540]   Thank you.

[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:41.620]   when he's not traveling around the world, lecturing.
[01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:42.620]   Thanks for joining us, Jeff.

[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:52.220]   Oh yeah.
[01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:53.220]   We're working hard on it.
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:54.220]   Minutes away.
[01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:55.220]   Minutes away.
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:56.220]   Well, soon.
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:57.220]   Soon.

[01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:02.580]   Oh yeah, it's very manual.
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:05.020]   It's going to be a little signed up for the notification.
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:09.300]   Soon and right now.
