[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.800]   We're going to talk about Google I/O. It's coming up next week.

[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.760]   What exactly is Mark Zuckerberg up to?
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.360]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.520]   On Twig.

[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.560]   Knee deep and shnit.

[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.400]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.320]   Show where we cover the Google verse and its adjacencies with Miss Stacey Higginbotham
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.280]   of StaceyOnIOT.com and the IoT podcast.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.560]   Hello Stacey.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.600]   Hello. Hello.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.920]   Ah, Sunfilled Bay Window.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.480]   Lovely.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.800]   I was like, is that a problem?
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.280]   No, it's good.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.520]   It's perfect because the blinds, no, it looks great.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.280]   Stacey is in her temporary home.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.800]   Where, how long are you going to be there?
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.040]   I will get to Seattle the 27th of May.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.040]   Oh, Sunfilled Bay.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.320]   But I may not have my stuff until later.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.800]   So it's a little up in the air.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.640]   I don't know if that Twig, would that Twig be like the 29th?
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.960]   Well this is May 1st.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.720]   So yeah, it'd be 27th, 29th.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.240]   So that Twig may not, I may still be in a weird place.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240]   A weird place.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.240]   A little weird place.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.240]   A little weird place.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.440]   A North Western limbo.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.040]   Anyway, it's great to have you and I think it's going to be really fun.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.520]   When do you drive with your daughter because you're going across country?
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.480]   We canceled the trip because my dog is crazy.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.960]   So it is sad.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.240]   We're going to fly and the dog will have one terrible day rather than six really terrible
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.320]   days.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.120]   That would be like travels with Charlie.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.080]   Are you going to be in a temporary place in Seattle at first as well?
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.680]   I am here renting a house and we'll move in as soon as our stuff gets there.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.760]   So we actually took the house already.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.560]   My family is in Seattle right now.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.560]   Getting the keys.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.960]   Visiting the schools.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.080]   Oh, have fun.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.640]   So you shall remain undisturbed during this program.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.640]   Maybe.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.600]   Jeff Jarvis is also here.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.880]   He is Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York's Graduate School,
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.800]   Greg Gunal, Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.720]   He is also a blogger, buzz machine.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.040]   And this is the official crew.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.000]   Next week, Jeff will be coming to the Bay Area for Google I/O on Tuesday.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yes.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I can't wait.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Are you excited?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.960]   This year, yes, except this.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.720]   So I think I've decided not to rent a car this time and to go full lift.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   I see.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.720]   Even up to you.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.720]   It's a very good idea.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.440]   And when you lift up up here, we'll cover your your feet.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.440]   Well, whatever.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.160]   But the thing is at I/O, they're virtue signaling.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.040]   And so now they're trying to make it car free.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.720]   This is California people.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.680]   It's impossible.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.560]   You can't get to shoreline amphitheater by walking.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.560]   And there's not a reason.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.560]   It's not a reason.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.360]   If they can, if you insist on driving, you're supposed to literally go to San Jose and take
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.360]   a bus.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.280]   That's ironic because sure, if you're at Google, you're right next door to shoreline amphitheater.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.280]   You can walk over.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.280]   But anybody else, it's incredibly convenient.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.640]   So I'm going to have to take a lift and it's going to take God knows the traffic will
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.360]   be worse because everybody will be the lift.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.360]   And there's plenty of parking.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.360]   You can take carpool.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360]   Tons of parking.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.360]   Tons.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.360]   I don't know anybody.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.360]   Don't take lifts.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.840]   You save the environment if you take a bus.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.640]   That's better than taking an individual car.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.640]   Where do I get a bus?
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.560]   It's not like you have the subway.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.480]   And there's really no good way.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.480]   There's a light rail.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.320]   Can I take the A amphitheater or the D?
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.520]   I take, yeah, I was like, I take Caltrain when I come up from the city to San Jose or
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.520]   Mountain View.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.160]   And then I usually take an Uber or a Lyft from the Caltrain.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.200]   That's actually not a bad way to do it.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   Which is nice.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.360]   I like Caltrain.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.360]   I have a fairly yikki.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.360]   Not yikki.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.360]   That's not fair.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.360]   I have a nothing.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.720]   Because the hotels on the peninsula and the city are just so impossible.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.360]   First warm problem.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.360]   But I have one near the airport.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.040]   So I think I'm going to stay there, go down, ride Monday, go to the hotel, go down Tuesday,
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.960]   Wednesday go up to you and back Thursday, I have flat L.A.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   So that's my week.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.520]   Well, here's the year.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.240]   If you're at BJ's restaurant in Brewhouse, you take the 55 bus to the 32 bus.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.840]   That's where I usually go up there.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.040]   And then from the 32 bus, you take the 185 bus and then you can walk the rest away.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.040]   It's about 95 minutes.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.160]   I think you're going to enjoy that there.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.600]   It's a little circuitous.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.480]   But you can do it.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.200]   The first bus leaves at three minutes from Deans and Mariani.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.680]   The BJ's is right next to Apple.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.240]   So I guess that's why they're there.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.680]   And also the other one is right across near the airport.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.960]   I'm going to the BJ's.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.320]   So I'm hoping they're going to give you a nice new phone.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.640]   The Pixel 3A and 3A XL, we are now sure will be launched there.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.320]   Google has done some semi-cryptic invitations and things like that.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.240]   In fact, they are implying that night's sight will be a big part of this new phone.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.640]   It will be about $500 to $600.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.880]   Although the Pixel 3 has been such a poor seller that it's actually possible to get
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.640]   close to that price as well.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.520]   What's the difference in specs?
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.240]   What are you giving up in this phone versus the full XL?
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.040]   Oh, good question.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.040]   I don't know.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.240]   I mean, I can tell you what the...
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.240]   Yeah, they haven't announced it.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.040]   I can tell you what the kind of the rumors are.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.800]   There'll be plastic.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.040]   Bezels will be bigger.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.040]   There's no notch in any of the previews.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.800]   That's the best selling point I've heard, no notch.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   But that means a big bezel.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.440]   Oh, gosh, you're not a people.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.440]   I hate the notch.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.440]   You know what?
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.440]   I hate the notch.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.640]   Microsoft, they've uninvited notch from the Minecraft 10th anniversary celebration.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.640]   Ah-ha.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.640]   That's a different notch.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.640]   That's the creative Minecraft.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.440]   That was a cute segue right there.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.840]   By the way, is that a dad joke or a geek joke?
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.840]   No, it was a geek joke.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.480]   But the notch has turned into kind of a not such a nice person.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.480]   He's transphobic.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.600]   And he is apparently a believer in QAnon.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.320]   So this shouldn't surprise a lot of us.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:20.280]   I have lots of engineering deep programming people who are very nerdy, fascinated by weirded
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.520]   minute topics, much like I am.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.720]   And then a lot of them are QAnon people.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.320]   It's weird because...
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:35.080]   If you were able to sell Stacey and IOT for $3 billion, you too might end up kind of
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.080]   strange.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.080]   I would take a billion really.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.520]   Half a billion even.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.320]   Anyway, you're right.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.640]   That was a bit of a digression.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.640]   Let's see here.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.840]   Yeah, I don't see a lot of information about the 3A and 3A XL.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.400]   You do give up the lack of a headphone jack.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.000]   There's a headphone jack in it?
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   No.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.360]   This is not even way crazy.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.000]   No notch in a headphone jack?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.160]   Yeah, that's it, man.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.160]   That's your phone.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.320]   It's Jeff's phone right there.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.320]   And it's your phone.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.320]   Amen.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.680]   So, Qualcomm Snapdragon 670 or 710, those are the lower and less expensive phones.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.560]   Four gigs of RAM more than adequate.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.560]   A choice between 32 and 64 gigs.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.120]   By the way, this is Android Central speculating.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:30.080]   3,000 milliamp hour on the milliamp hour battery on the 3A, unknown on the 3A XL.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.880]   Same camera as on the Pixel 3.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.440]   So, what's the battery?
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.440]   I'm sorry, I remember this.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.840]   Well, it's tiny on the Pixel 3A and we don't know what it'll be on the inside.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   That's a problem.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.840]   My battery's great on this one.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.160]   On the two.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.360]   It may be a Verizon exclusive, but as I remember, you're Verizon, right?
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.840]   No, I may be in T.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   Oh, okay.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.840]   Well, we'll see.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.840]   We'll see.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.840]   We don't know what the price really will be.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.840]   Well, they were not exclusive in terms of the...
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.880]   They wouldn't do a... you can only get it at Verizon.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.120]   They'd still do an unlocked version.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.400]   It would probably be the exclusive sales.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.400]   They'll carry your exclusive.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.400]   Right.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.400]   But they'll...
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   I'm sure they'll do an unlocked version.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.400]   Maybe not sometimes they defer that.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.400]   Yeah, sometimes there's like a two...
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.400]   Yeah, they did a two week window.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.400]   Yeah, it was not...
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.400]   I don't know, guys.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   I don't know.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.400]   Because I've always gotten the phone right.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.400]   I always got every phone and I'll leave it unlocked.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   Okay.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.400]   I don't remember cursing about that.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   I've cursed about much as some of your viewers tell me.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.400]   I don't know what to call that.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.400]   I don't agree, Siren.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.400]   That's what that was.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   Oh!
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   Oh!
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   It's happening.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   Oh, that's Jeff's.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.400]   I don't agree, Siren.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.400]   Can you give us your Stacey excited whoop?
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.400]   I have to be genuinely excited to give you a real...
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.400]   Oh, no.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.400]   She can only do...
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.400]   Of course.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   I think we have to isolate these things.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   You can be the Fred Norris of Twig.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.400]   Is there anything else that we think Google I/O will bring us any other...
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   Any out of the way surprises?
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   You know, none of the stuff I care about is up for grabs.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   No I/O T stuff.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.400]   No, I mean, nothing that I've really heard about there.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   Maybe...
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.400]   I'm trying to...
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.400]   Nope, that's a different thermostat.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   I was like, "That's Ecobee who's making a new thermostat."
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   So, yeah, I mean...
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.400]   There'll be Android Q, of course, the next generation of Android.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.400]   That's been in beta for some time.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.400]   Stadia, which they announced to great fanfare, but little like...
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.400]   A little excitement.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   We should probably see something about Stadia.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.400]   Maybe not though.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   I don't know.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   They announced it at GDC in March and then Ted's silence ever since.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   Of course, we got the Pixel phone.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   That's about it.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.400]   You know, this might be a very kind of uninteresting Google I/O.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   Will they demonstrate duplex?
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   Which was the...
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.400]   Probably.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   The very human voice that they showed last year and got in.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.400]   It got a little trouble over.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   Maybe duplex will give the keynote.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.400]   Oh, wouldn't that be cool?
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:01.400]   You know who will not be on the board by then is Eric Schmidt, who is not running for re-election.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.400]   It's a long history.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   Yeah, he's going to stick around as a technical advisor, but he will not be on the board.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   Yeah, that is kind of interesting.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.400]   So long.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.400]   Maybe they'll do a little farewell to Eric.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   Because he was the CEO as many...
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   Remember, of Google for years.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   He's been on the board for 18 years.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.400]   Oh, that's right.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   There is supposed to be a Google Smart Display.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.400]   I forgot about that.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   Oh.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   Yes.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.400]   A new one.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.920]   I don't remember the features that it's supposed to have, but I actually love my Lenovo Smart
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.920]   Display.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.400]   And Kevin loves his actual Google branded tinier display.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   So...
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   I wish I'd gotten the Google one because this is a bit big.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.400]   Don't you think Stacey?
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.400]   Oh.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.400]   No, I've got...
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.400]   I mean, I keep mine in my kitchen/living room area.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.400]   So it's perfect for a big open space.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   I wouldn't put it like by my bedside table.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.400]   Kitchen/living room.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   It sounds like you have a hibachi next to the couch.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.400]   I have an open floor plan, Jeff.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.400]   No, I like that.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   I like that actually open floor plan.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.400]   Eric Schmidt tweets yesterday.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:15.640]   After 18 years of board meetings and following coach Bill Campbell's legacy, coach was a
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:21.040]   legendary at Apple, early board members, and helping the next generation of talent to
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.040]   serve.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:29.160]   So Larry Sergi and all my BOD board of director colleagues onward for me as a technical advisor
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:36.760]   to coach Alphabet and Google Business's tech plus DIB and SCAI Schmidt Futures Teaching
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.520]   and more.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.280]   So that's kind of retirement, I would guess.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.120]   Yeah, but don't forget he was a coach to Larry and Sergi.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.880]   So he's got a lot of coaching experience.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.880]   He was adult supervision.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.680]   I like Eric.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.920]   And as Robert Elle Washington has been appointed to the board of directors.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.640]   I'm old enough to remember when Eric Schmidt putting his foot in his mouth was worse than
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.240]   Mark Zuckerberg putting his foot in his mouth.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.040]   Oh, it was legendary.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:09.320]   But now it seems so tame.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.520]   Diane Green also leaving the board.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.960]   She was CEO of Google Cloud.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.000]   She's still there, yes.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.680]   Even though Thomas Corian is there.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.680]   She left Google Cloud January 2019.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.280]   Oh, so she's still not at.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.280]   Okay.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.280]   I thought she had stayed there.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.280]   She is now a CFO at Julia at Sciences of Bioform.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.520]   Did they say he was joining the board?
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:40.920]   Yeah, Robin L. Washington recognized business leader.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:46.200]   I recognize you with extensive experience across finance and operations.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.280]   She'll serve on Alphabet's leadership development and compensation committee.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.280]   Okay.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.680]   So independent compensation committee.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.680]   That's good.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.680]   And it's a woman.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.240]   So, Silences maybe, well, it mitigates the loss of Diane.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.240]   So.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.660]   Of course, today's the day that the Google walkout number two is ongoing right now.
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:15.940]   As we speak, this is all about the retaliation we talked about last week.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:23.900]   We will employees more than 200 participated in the New York office earlier today.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.460]   Hundreds of Google employees expected to be involved throughout the day sit-ins at offices
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:33.940]   at 11 a.m. local time.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.940]   There you go.
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:35.940]   So.
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.300]   And basically, this was a sit-in saying don't retaliate against people when they bring up
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.300]   legitimate complaints.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.300]   Right.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.300]   Right.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.300]   Right.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:49.060]   And to Meredith Walker, who organized the first sit-in, said there were tears and talks
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.060]   of unions.
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:15:00.340]   Oh, that should send a shiver down the collective spines of the Google executive offices.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.660]   And their investors.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.460]   And their investors.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.460]   Okay.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:14.340]   Google says we reprohibit retaliation in the workplace and publicly share a very clear
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:19.420]   policy to make sure that no complaint raised goes unheard at Google.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:24.740]   We give employees multiple channels for a put concerns, including anonymously and investigate
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.220]   all allegations of retaliation.
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.220]   So.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.460]   There you have it.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.460]   Yeah.
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:36.260]   I'm sure they have a written policy and maybe people just don't abide by that.
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.260]   It's hard.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.700]   The company managers have little fiefdoms.
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.260]   And there's all sorts of ways to retaliate that aren't immediately obvious.
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.860]   And I mean, it is.
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.100]   People do get defensive when someone says, hey, the way you're doing things sucks.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.100]   Right.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.580]   Even if you say it in the nicest possible way.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.140]   And honestly, when you say things nicely, nobody pays attention.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.380]   So there's a real fine line and you're going to.
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.380]   That's my rule of life, Stacy.
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.380]   No.
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.380]   It'd be nice.
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.380]   What?
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.220]   No.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.220]   I'm just a little pay attention.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.180]   I'm just making the show.
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.820]   Oh, I was like, yeah.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.820]   Okay.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.820]   Somebody came out.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.260]   Somebody came out to me for being liberal complaining today.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.100]   So I'm just deciding to play true to form.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.940]   Well, Jeff, we cannot say that you're not liberal.
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.500]   I think you own that, right?
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.500]   Yeah.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.500]   I don't think that's a bad thing.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.500]   I'm like, but.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.500]   And snitty.
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.500]   Yes.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.500]   What was bar called?
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.500]   What did bar call?
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.620]   Um, I think he called he called Mueller's letter snitty.
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.620]   I think it was.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.620]   Oh, Lord.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.620]   It's a bit snitty.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.620]   A bit snitty.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.620]   So I'm quite a bit snitty.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.900]   I don't make people call me snitty.
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.620]   That makes me snitty.
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.540]   You're an assnit, my friend.
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.260]   I've never heard the adjective snitty.
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.140]   Well, I think I'm being in a.
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.460]   Brian Williams.
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.620]   Sorry.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.060]   Brian Williams said it was related to snooty or snotty.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.060]   No.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.060]   It's related to snit.
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.460]   Oh, here we go.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.900]   It's a Germanic noun coming from the apple.
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:05.900]   K-nitty.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.900]   Okay.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.460]   Jeff, you'd know this.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:12.420]   It comes from an apple slice, the word for apple slice in German.
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.420]   It's a cotch.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.420]   The schnit.
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.420]   The schnit.
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.420]   Uh, but it didn't help edivologists much.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:24.260]   According to Merriam-Webster, in fact, it just gets them into a snit or state of agitation.
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.380]   No matter how they slice and dice the word snitty, they can't get to its core.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.540]   All we know is that snit was being used as early as 1939.
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.660]   And snitty appeared some 40 years later.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.980]   Both words are mainly used in the United States.
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.860]   It was brought back to you by our.
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.860]   Yeah.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.860]   It's a schnit.
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.580]   You got a little schnit.
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.580]   Disagreeably ill-tempered.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.940]   I'm a schnit.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.260]   I can see that.
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:58.100]   You schnitty liberal, yo.
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.140]   I wish I could read this story in the Financial Times, but it's behind a paywall.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.620]   The cost of being woke.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.620]   Google edition.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.180]   Yeah, I did want to read that.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.180]   Is that a tea?
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.180]   Well, I put it up there.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.020]   Clearly it's a Jeff because Jeff gets everything.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.460]   You have to synopsis for us.
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.420]   What is the cost to remember?
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.580]   Now I got to remember a bunch of fitty.
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.660]   Oh, I know what it was.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.460]   Now I remember, now I remember, now I remember.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:28.740]   So, um, part of the finances for Google this time, apparently came off of YouTube and part
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:34.260]   of what's happening in YouTube is they're trying to get rid of a lot of bad content.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.220]   And that's having a business impact.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.220]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.780]   It's basically the same thing that happened to Facebook when they deoptimized advertising.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.420]   So, yeah.
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:50.660]   Again, I really feel like we're entering an era and we have the ability now with, you
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:57.380]   know, the ability to gather data, analyze it quickly to optimize intensely for the wrong
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.380]   things.
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.900]   So, we have to optimize for profits, which means we're going to, you know, boost engagement.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.900]   We're going to do whatever for profits.
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.700]   And then we're going to do that really well.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.500]   And then we're going to have all these unintentional side effects.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:12.660]   So it's really time for us to sit there and say, "Hey, Wall Street wants us to optimize
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:17.220]   for profits, but that has unintended costs that we can actually see.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.620]   And it's time we start taking account of those.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.420]   And we have that ability with technology.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.180]   We just have to start writing the algorithms for it.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.060]   And I don't know why this is such a controversial position.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.980]   We've always talked about externalities, right?
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.780]   So pollution, that sort of thing.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.620]   And we're realizing that those are important.
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:40.420]   I don't know why we don't talk about social externalities and like the costs of having
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:44.060]   a bunch of contract workers who have no health care, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:48.220]   There does seem to be this point of view in Silicon Valley that nothing should impede
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:53.820]   profits and gross, you know, 100% gross every year that it's just un-American to slow that
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.820]   down.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:20:00.620]   The venture world and model is very much predicated on growth, not necessarily revenues until
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.820]   you become public.
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.620]   And then Wall Street then Wall Street demands for profits to take over.
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.420]   So it's very short-sighted.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.980]   It's very frustrating.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:16.100]   And I just want to just smack people.
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.740]   Sorry.
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.740]   There's another headwind.
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.900]   See, I'm not the snitty one, folks.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.900]   That was not snitty.
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.900]   She was the smack people.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.900]   I'm deep in -- I'm knee deep in shnit.
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.900]   The --
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:29.900]   Show title.
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:30.900]   The --
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.900]   She's going around slapping people.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.900]   For God's sakes.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.620]   She's not slapping people.
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.620]   She's slapping ideas.
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.700]   Don't you wish I could slap you?
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.100]   The other -- yes, I know.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.140]   Wait, I never said that.
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.020]   The other headwind that these companies are going to start facing -- remember Facebook
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:56.500]   took a $3 billion -- put aside $3 billion for upcoming -- they felt EU fine of $3 to
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.500]   $5 billion.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.500]   Facebook is not alone.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.500]   FTC.
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.500]   That's right.
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.500]   FTC.
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.140]   Google's putting aside $1.7 billion for the EU.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.140]   I was --
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.140]   Well, here you go.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.060]   Yeah, well, but they're not done with the EU.
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:18.540]   So this was part of Alphabet's quarterly earnings report a couple of days ago.
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.700]   I guess we could call that an externality right there.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.700]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.700]   The lack of privacy.
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.700]   Now you're -- that's the cost right there.
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.700]   Price your pay.
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.700]   Should it be higher?
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.700]   I don't think it's the end of it.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.980]   I think that these companies are going to continue to face these kinds of funds.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.660]   But maybe they hope it's the end.
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.460]   Tough quarter for Google, actually.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.460]   Alphabet --
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.060]   We're nearly 15 percent increase in the amount of dollars.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.060]   Shosh.
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.700]   Geez, how dare they?
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:50.780]   There's a $36.3 billion earnings of per share of $9.50.
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:56.100]   Company stock went down almost immediately by 7 percent.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.860]   Here's Google's canned statement.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:03.660]   We delivered robust growth led by mobile search YouTube and cloud with Alphabet revenues of
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.660]   36.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:05.660]   blah blah blah.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:06.660]   I mentioned this.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:11.420]   That's up 17 percent versus last year or 19 percent on a constant currency basis.
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.420]   That's pretty good.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.100]   This is Ruth Porat, CFO speaking.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:19.900]   We remain focused on and excited by significant growth opportunities across our business.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.860]   The real problem was Google's facing more competition and advertisement.
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:31.380]   It's other bets, which are funded through ads, are also draining the gas tank a little
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.380]   bit.
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.380]   So here's the question.
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.380]   Go ahead, Sissy.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.380]   You first.
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.500]   Oh, I was going to say yes.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:42.540]   With Amazon, the advertising, if you looked in the context of what's happening up in Seattle
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:47.420]   with Amazon, Google does look like an also ran.
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.820]   God, that's sad.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.820]   That's really sad.
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.540]   I keep wondering.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.620]   I say this to somebody in the media business and I have Google stock, because I've mentioned
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.620]   before.
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.140]   I like their benefit.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:07.020]   I wonder whether even though Google and Facebook took advertising away from media, in media's
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.420]   view, those are as you took it away.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.500]   How long for the world is there kind of advertising?
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.060]   I just think- Oh, I talk about this forever.
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:22.860]   Yeah, because if you talk about things like Search via Voice, right, and Microsoft actually
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:27.460]   put out a report last week all about voice search and what that means for how to advertise
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.060]   on that.
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:36.860]   You look at IOT and moving less to a screen-based world, their business model changes significantly
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.980]   and they have to figure out how to change with it.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:49.420]   The challenges with voice, advertising, voice is such an immediate interaction mode.
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:53.340]   Advertising feels jarring, which is why you're going to see them focus on products that do
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.500]   require screens.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:03.020]   So things like recipes, things like maps, again, email, docs, et cetera, those kind of things.
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.300]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:12.020]   I feel like, and I imagine Google's thinking about this and being very careful about this.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.780]   It's very easy to cross the creepy line in the home.
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:21.340]   So I think that's one of the latter places we'll see like true advertising, if that makes
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:22.340]   sense.
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.980]   Right, so that's one factor.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.780]   I think you're right, Stacey, and I want to explore that as voice.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.260]   I think there's other factors as well.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:36.220]   I think that, for example, privacy is going to be an issue.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.180]   The advertising has to become more targeted.
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.460]   The more targeted it becomes, the more it bugs people.
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.020]   The more it's going to cause problems.
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.540]   That's one factor.
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.580]   Another factor is the Amazon experience that you can start making your own products and
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:51.540]   don't have to advertise them if you have that kind of platform.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:57.340]   So I think there's various factors that affect just simply abundance and an ever-decreasing
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:01.020]   price and an ever-increasing desperation and irritation.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.500]   So those are other factors as well.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.380]   Let's go back to the voice.
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:13.780]   If you were to say that now voice interactions versus textual interactions are, forget video,
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.020]   because that's passive.
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.500]   So let's just say things you're interacting with, which is your point of voice.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:25.060]   If today that represented 0.01% of interactions, where does it go in two, three years?
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.740]   How much is this going to grow this voice thing?
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:33.060]   Let me pull up the Bing voice report because literally this is part of what they talk about.
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:37.180]   I'd be very impressed if you pulled it up with your voice.
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.180]   That would be awesome.
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.380]   But you wouldn't be using Bing if you did.
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.020]   I have not using Cortana.
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:47.340]   Actually who was using someone used to use Bing?
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:51.140]   Anyway, Amazon used to use Bing.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.220]   Actually it's it's searches.
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:59.820]   So it's very telling that Microsoft announced to, yes, on its quarterly results a week ago,
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:04.660]   they're renaming Bing to Microsoft ads.
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.420]   Not the search Bing, but the Bing ads.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:14.620]   So in terms of how people are interacting with voice, they're using it mostly with the
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:20.780]   digital assistant about, and this is a survey.
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.100]   So it talks about 72%.
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.340]   If you scroll down to page nine of this report, you're going to see the thing I'm looking
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.340]   at right now.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.340]   Wow.
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.180]   The showing a Facebook portal.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.220]   Yeah, that's weird.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.940]   Oh, we just took ours apart.
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.820]   I guess we couldn't think of what else to do with it.
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.660]   That's probably the most benign.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.020]   Such a new Microsoft.
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.900]   The very first image is Facebook portal, then such an Adela.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:46.900]   All right.
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.900]   Here's page six.
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:48.900]   Oh, you want to go to nine.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.900]   Okay.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.780]   How are people engaging with voice?
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.780]   Go ahead.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:59.820]   So that's how people are using of the point on one.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:00.820]   Yeah.
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:06.820]   Well, I think it's 68% of people have used a digital assistant.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:13.820]   So and that's the vast majority of people using voice are doing it with voice search
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.420]   with a personal assistant.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:22.020]   35% through a speaker, 36% to a TV or smart home device that's not a speaker.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.820]   Oh, I'm surprised at that.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:24.820]   Yeah.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.460]   Almost a third to a vehicle.
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.460]   And I would think to be more up.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.460]   Yeah.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:38.740]   And 52% of their interactions are voice skills or actions through a smart home speaker like,
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:43.500]   for instance, hey, Cortana, play morning edition, which I can, by the way, say out loud because
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:51.460]   I don't think anybody in our audience is going to is actually going to be affected by that.
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.860]   The most popular digital system may be different than you think.
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.260]   There's Microsoft plug right here.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:01.740]   Well, they're not going to say, although the Amazon is widely known and advertised in
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:07.260]   the US, it is perhaps surprisingly the not most the most popular one.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:11.060]   Siri and Google assistant are tied for 36%.
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.500]   Because they're on the phones.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.500]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.100]   And echo 25% because you have to buy an echo thing.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.100]   Yes.
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.860]   And look, Cortana is on there with 19%.
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.620]   I'm like, let's the one in five people who are using.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.620]   That's bizarre.
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.340]   Maybe they're talking to their windows.
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.340]   Yeah.
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.340]   It's on windows.
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.500]   Oh, we always forget that.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.380]   It's like people like my forgetting the fathers were still on AOL.
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.380]   I know.
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.700]   In fact, I actively remove it for Windows installations.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.140]   So I do too.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:47.140]   But you know, I actually was playing with someone who are playing with someone's computer and
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.140]   they had it.
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:53.380]   And it was actually really cool because I said, I was like, hey, I asked Cortana to open a
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.020]   spreadsheet and she did.
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.020]   Yeah.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.660]   So it was kind of it was a little weird because that's not what I'm used to doing and I wouldn't
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:00.660]   have been.
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.140]   But once you get into the habit, I could see it becoming really compelling.
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.140]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.140]   I mean, I do that already.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.420]   You hit Windows key type, the name of the spreadsheet, return it, it'll open it.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.380]   So to me, since my hands are on the keyboard and it's a more direct way of doing it, but
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.500]   I could see the value of that, you know.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.500]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.500]   I imagine if you're.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.500]   Sorry.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.500]   Yes, Beck.
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.500]   How much?
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:24.460]   So, so, so how much does this become a part of everybody's everyday life in your, in your
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.460]   predictions?
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.460]   Mm.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.460]   Right.
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.060]   Is I think it's going to become part of almost everyone's everyday life.
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:34.380]   I think because it's on phones and because it's so easy to use, even people who don't
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.060]   have a smart speaker, they're going to search for information via voice.
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.900]   And I think that's already proven out.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.260]   They talk about like how people are using this today.
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.420]   Most people use it for searching for a quick fact.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.380]   That's, they say it's like 68% here.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:55.100]   That jives was how people are using the Amazon Echo, although the Amazon Echo, the most popular
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.660]   use case is still setting a kitchen timer.
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.660]   Timer.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.540]   But like they, some of the things like asking for directions, I do that all the time on
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.540]   my phone and I'm sure you.
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.540]   I do too.
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:07.540]   I do too.
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.900]   I say navigate to the Twitch studios or whatever.
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:10.900]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:11.900]   That's very useful.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:12.900]   Yeah.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:17.900]   And I was actually surprised 47% of people use it for searching for a business.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:24.060]   So if you think about again, such a direct interaction, you know, HAG, where is the nearest
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.500]   Jiffy lube to me?
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.740]   You know, there's, there's a lot happening in the back end and the voice comes out with
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:34.220]   it's 14 miles away, do you want me to navigate to you or navigate to there?
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.220]   And you say, yes.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.220]   And then poop.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.860]   All of that has happened without a chance for an ad, right?
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:47.900]   I would guess that the creators of these technologies are happy, very happy with the
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:48.900]   trajectory.
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.020]   It's not taking the world over yet, but it's enough.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:56.420]   It's enough critical mass so that when the technology gets better, they're going to have
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:00.740]   enough people who will be using it to then tell everybody else, oh, wow, you got to
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.380]   try Cortana or Echo or whatever.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.100]   It's amazing.
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.100]   Smart home speaker ownership.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.300]   Oh, here you go.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.300]   Yes.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.300]   Look at that.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:18.020]   In 2018, ComScore says that 50% of all searches will be voice searches by 2020.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.020]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.020]   Wow.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.020]   Do you believe that?
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.020]   Yeah.
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:26.180]   I do actually because I, I search for data probably equally.
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:30.100]   I actually think that might be low.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.580]   And do you prefer results on screen or on voice?
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:39.500]   Well, I tailor, I pick voice for things that I know voice is good at.
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.180]   So I search for quick facts and things like that on voice.
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.820]   This is such a, such a Microsofty report.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:50.100]   75% of households will have at least one smart speaker by 2020.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:55.180]   Next to it is the Harmon Garden Echo or Invoke, which I have, but very few do.
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:32:00.340]   In fact, it looks like only about 6%, I'm sorry, 5% of the population intend to buy one
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:04.820]   and then he compared to 43% for the Echo.
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:11.460]   Actually, a big drop for Google Home, which is kind of surprising for 58% to 17%.
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.180]   This is planned to purchase.
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.180]   I can see that.
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:20.420]   I think, I think people went out with Google because they, they were waiting for it.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.420]   There's pent up demand.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.860]   And I think once people had it, they were like, that's good.
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.300]   And it doesn't really have the buying share that other people.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.940]   Echo really is winning in this.
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.220]   I want to see the percentage of people who read this report and thought that that was
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.020]   a picture of an Echo.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.020]   I did.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.820]   I thought it was the Echo Plus.
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.820]   The percentage of designers.
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:40.820]   Maybe it is.
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:41.820]   Am I wrong?
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:42.820]   Maybe it is an Echo.
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:43.820]   That looks like an Echo Plus to me.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:44.820]   I think you're right.
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:45.820]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.820]   It looks the Harmon Garden is more, is more tilted.
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:49.820]   It's a triangle.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.820]   Yeah, it's a little more triangle.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:51.820]   It's like a little slightly more triangle.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.500]   It looks like it's tilted on top.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:58.980]   Yeah, that's a weird, there's a weird angle on this thing that made me, you're right.
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:32:59.980]   It's a never mind.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.980]   It's an Echo.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.980]   45% of our survey respondents.
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.380]   I think I changed my question too.
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:08.020]   How many people know reading this report even know what a card looks like?
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.020]   A Harmon Garden.
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.420]   Apparently not me.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.420]   The Invoke.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.420]   I don't even, are they still making it?
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.620]   I don't even know if you can buy it anymore.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:15.780]   I'm going to keep mine.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.860]   It's a relic of the past.
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.020]   How many people own multiple smart speakers?
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.500]   What would you think?
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.500]   59% only on one.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.940]   I'm in the 1% too.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.740]   I'm in the 1% too.
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.540]   Yeah, I think I'm actually the 1% and I heard the user.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:33.540]   We're 1%ers.
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:38.140]   Ooh, ooh, ooh, because they're cheap, they're 30 bucks.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:44.340]   Although right now in my 1000 square foot apartment, I only have three assistants.
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:48.980]   Yeah, because you're never too far from any one of them.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:54.260]   80% of users reported being somewhat or very satisfied.
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:59.620]   So is that number goes up?
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:04.300]   I can't go up much, but I think it's the somewhat satisfied, it's turned to very satisfied.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.100]   That's when, and you're good enough that you're going to have critical mass so that that can
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.340]   really happen.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:12.660]   And we're definitely, we're past the early.
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:15.340]   We're in the early majority or past adopt.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.340]   That's right.
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.020]   Here's the technology.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.940]   This is actually a graph you could use for other stuff too.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.740]   Technology adoption lifecycle market.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:26.700]   You got your innovators, techies.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.180]   We try it.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.700]   Early adopters, visionaries get ahead.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:31.700]   That's 13%.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:38.620]   Then the chasm, but we've bridged the chasm because we're right here in the early majority,
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:44.460]   34%, late majority, 34%, laggards, 16%.
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:49.660]   So you've got techies, visionaries, pragmatists, conservatives, and skeptics.
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.900]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.380]   This is good.
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.180]   Crossing the chasm.
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:58.460]   I think we could say safely that voice assistants have crossed the chasm.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.500]   Now they just have to get better.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.500]   That's a good report.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.500]   Thank you for bringing that up, Stacey.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.500]   That's very interesting.
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.700]   I am full of reported information.
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.700]   Yeah.
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:14.780]   Going back to Alphabet's earnings, one of the reasons they're doing these new Pixel 3 and
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:19.740]   3A so early is because the Pixel 3 seemed to be a flop.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:25.900]   So Nerpa Chai cited year over year headwinds.
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.020]   The market, by the way, responded.
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.180]   Google's a stock.
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.660]   I should show you the graph.
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.660]   Oh my gosh.
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.660]   It's kind of a--
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.100]   I mentioned earlier I have a little stock.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.100]   Well get ready.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.300]   Hold on to your hats.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.820]   You see that big drop right here?
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:46.780]   Oh, that's when the quarterly results came out.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:53.860]   They dropped from a peak of $1,287.58 to $1,183.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.500]   That's not a huge drop.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.860]   You'll be all right.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:57.860]   You know.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.380]   I mean, in the long run, that's why I was bringing this up though.
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:07.300]   I think that Google and Amazon are really smart companies.
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.260]   I'll start there.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:15.140]   And I think they're going to have a long future.
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.100]   But you know, there was Microsoft.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.740]   There were others.
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.740]   I still think.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:25.860]   But that's why I'm wondering if the ad-based business for Google is more challenged than
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:29.420]   we know today and they're so dependent and safe for Facebook.
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:33.020]   I was thinking about Facebook today too and I don't want to get into the whole-- well,
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.020]   actually I do because I want to--
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.020]   Let's talk about FA.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.020]   Actually, let's take a break.
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:42.140]   And I would like to-- because the Facebook Developers Conference was yesterday, we agonized
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:48.380]   over whether to stream it and decided not to because we're streaming Google and Microsoft
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.060]   events next week.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:53.940]   But I just couldn't bring myself to do it.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.660]   But there were some interesting things.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:56.660]   Yeah.
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.620]   Well, you're going to be our report in just a second, OK?
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.220]   We'll continue with this week in Google.
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.460]   But first a word from LastPass.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:07.020]   This is really more like a public service announcement.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:14.180]   If you're not using the LastPass password manager, do start right now.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.540]   Every security expert agrees.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:22.180]   So first of all, we should say, just to make you feel better, this password thing is way
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.180]   out of hand.
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:28.180]   This password suck, having to remember thousands of passwords is just not possible.
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:32.100]   And of course, it leads people to do dangerous things like reuse the same password over and
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.420]   over again.
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.100]   Use memorable passwords.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:41.380]   Usually memorable means easy to guess or easy to break.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:47.580]   So if you're using your kids' birth dates and your dog's name, you need good, long,
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.580]   strong passwords.
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.900]   No one could remember.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.180]   And then you use LastPass to keep track of them.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.380]   LastPass will generate them.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:00.420]   And then you unlock that password vault with one long, secure master password.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.820]   And then whenever you're using Windows or Mac or iOS or Android or Linux, it'll just
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.300]   fill it in for you.
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:09.020]   I've installed lately a bunch of new systems.
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:12.140]   And of course, the very first thing I installed is LastPass.
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:16.260]   That way I can log into everything else, get everything else set up.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.940]   LastPass is amazing.
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:24.180]   Very important if you're a business because maybe you've got your password hygiene under
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.180]   control.
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:29.460]   And I'm sure you do if you listen to our shows, but your employees probably don't.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.140]   We know more than half of all employees share passwords, sometimes even with people outside
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.740]   the company.
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:38.420]   They put Post-it notes on their monitors so they can remember them.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.020]   They think up a little bad passwords.
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:43.340]   LastPass fixes all that.
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:47.660]   We started using LastPass Enterprise at Twitch some years ago.
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.340]   I've been using LastPass for almost a decade since they started.
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.140]   It lets us manage password security.
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.100]   We have complete administrative oversight.
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:39:00.940]   We could do things, for instance, like 100 policies that you can configure, including
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:06.460]   requirements for the master password and requiring two factor, which we do.
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:12.580]   You could even use LastPass as his own authenticator app, but you can use a Yuba Key or Duo Security
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.940]   Google Authenticator.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:19.220]   You get to choose, and I think that's really a great way to make your stuff more secure.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:24.220]   If you're in the cloud, you've got lots of passwords that hold the keys to your business.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:28.780]   You need to protect them with LastPass Enterprise.
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.140]   There's LastPass teams for smaller companies, teams of 50 or fewer.
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.780]   LastPass Premium for individuals.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:38.620]   At home, we use LastPass Families, which has some nice sharing features, as does LastPass
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:45.020]   Enterprise, that let you share passwords with your spouse or your other family members very
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.740]   easily by just putting them into a family folder.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.860]   I also use the one feature of LastPass Families.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.900]   I really like emergency access.
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:57.540]   If I should become disabled or pass away, my wife would get access to my passwords after
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:00.540]   some precautionary things.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.180]   I think that's really important.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.820]   Really, really important.
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:04.980]   You got to try LastPass.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:09.700]   13 and a half million people use LastPass, tens of thousands of businesses.
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:12.380]   Visit LastPass.com/twit.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.500]   This is probably the single most important thing you'll hear today.
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:25.060]   If you're not using LastPass, get to lastpass.com/twit and protect yourself, protect your company.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.900]   LastPass.com/twit.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:31.660]   We thank them for their support, for providing a great product.
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:35.540]   We thank you for using that URL, showing your support for this week in Google.
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:37.020]   F8 was yesterday.
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.700]   I saw a little bit of Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.020]   He doubled down, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:44.660]   He doubled down on his privacy plans.
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.380]   Which actually bothered me.
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:51.580]   There's an image of him under the sign, "The Future is Private."
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:58.500]   That disturbed me because what I've been fearing is an internet that we all go into our turtle
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.300]   shelves.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.780]   I get all of that.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.860]   A full disclosure is that I raise money from my school, from Facebook.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.980]   I'm independent of Facebook, where you don't money personally, from any platform, and a
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:10.980]   disclosure.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:16.380]   But here I'm complaining about it.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:21.180]   What the internet does that I sow treasure is that all these voices can be heard and
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:26.380]   anyone can be public and that we share and that sharing is a public act at some level
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.940]   or another.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:35.140]   That's why I've celebrated Facebook, Containers Existences.
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.020]   I don't know what Facebook is going to do with the core Facebook besides Takeaway the
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.020]   Blue.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.820]   I've got to it a minute.
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:47.260]   But I do worry about the world we heard about here, which was that everything is locked
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.540]   down in private.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.060]   Everything is temporary.
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:59.980]   Do we lose the links and the permanence that build a culture in new ways?
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.900]   Yes, with things that go wrong and yes, with things we've learned.
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:06.980]   I'm not saying that I want everything to be public, I'm not saying that at all.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.780]   But if everything is private, I think we lose something.
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.180]   That bothered me.
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:17.580]   I think if you go beyond Facebook though, the same avenues exist.
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:21.020]   You could create a WordPress blog to make things public.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:26.820]   It's Facebook, if you think of it, better analogy may be the conversations you have with
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.660]   people on the street that you meet.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:32.060]   Imagine the public square and you're talking to them.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:37.500]   Having those be more ephemeral and private makes sense and you can even develop your
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:42.100]   opinions there and test them out against people without them penalizing you.
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:45.940]   Then you can go and write a blog post to post it on media.
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:51.980]   I still feel like there are plenty of avenues that are still accessible to lots of people
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:53.900]   that give you.
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:58.660]   Because Facebook was trying to be both things and I don't, in what it discovered is it couldn't
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:05.500]   be both things because no one tries out their public opinions, unless they're teenager,
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.140]   in front of everyone.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.820]   That's not a sophisticated way to develop things.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.820]   Or you.
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:12.620]   Let me play it.
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:13.700]   Go ahead.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:19.300]   Oh, and I think this is actually a really good move because it makes it safe for people to
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:29.300]   explore and it also helps protect young people from being penalized for things they said
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.300]   or did.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:35.020]   Even older people that they said and did when they were younger and stupid.
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:38.980]   I mean, that's a good thing and there's still those avenues.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.540]   Yeah, I don't disagree with that Stacy.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:44.660]   I just think that we haven't yet fully explored.
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:48.100]   So yes, I think you need those spaces and maybe Facebook was the wrong one.
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:52.500]   But let's just say that Twitter did what Jack has been talking about and goes to subjects,
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.500]   not people.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:57.740]   Then, you know, my now hack day, because I've said it so often, an example, but how do
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:03.060]   we get then the coalescing that occurs, the gathering that occurs around me to our Black
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.100]   Lives Matter or living while Black?
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.700]   How do we get Ferguson, Missouri?
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:12.020]   How do we get those moments when voices who are not heard can now find an audience they
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.660]   don't know, which is the point of being public?
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:16.660]   Right.
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.380]   And I think there's two things happening.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:24.580]   I think there is a cultural shift and journalists are looking at places that are not just quote
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:25.620]   unquote the mainstream media.
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:29.700]   And I think we've brought in more voices to journalism in general, which is good.
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:36.340]   And I do think that there are plenty of like a medium post can help draw attention to things.
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:40.540]   I think Twitter still, I mean, let's hope that that doesn't go away.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:49.380]   If it does, I think those things will still develop because I don't think we can turn
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.700]   our backs on most of the population, right?
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.180]   I don't think we will be able to.
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.260]   I hope not anyway.
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.260]   Maybe I'm too naive.
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.260]   Yeah.
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.260]   I mean, I like more.
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:00.260]   It is an either or.
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:05.660]   I mean, there's going to be plenty of a conversation in the public square.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:10.660]   I just think it's nice to have the option to really be private if you want to.
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:14.420]   You're saying everybody's private by default or public by default, but that's what he's
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:15.420]   saying.
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:16.660]   No, no, no, no, I'm not saying that.
[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.620]   Please don't put me in that position again.
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:23.460]   No, no, no, but Mark was saying that it becomes private by default, which is the right default
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:25.140]   well, but but not just default.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.380]   He's saying the future.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:27.380]   Well, let's private.
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:29.780]   Here's a the verge to the 12 minute cut down.
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:33.020]   I won't play the whole thing, but here's a little cut down at least to the beginning
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.540]   of Mark's comments at F8.
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.540]   Let me turn on the sound.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:40.820]   Everyone, welcome to F8.
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:47.540]   Today, we are going to talk about building a privacy focused social platform.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.380]   Privacy gives us the freedom to be ourselves.
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:56.740]   So it's no surprise that the fastest ways that we're all communicating online are private
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:00.700]   messaging and small groups and in stories.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.620]   This is the next chapter for our services.
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:09.740]   I get that a lot of people aren't sure that we're serious about this.
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:10.740]   This is all I know.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.420]   Do you think the laughter was written into the script?
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:15.980]   It did not seem organic.
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:19.580]   You know, for Mark.
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:22.700]   No, I don't actually feel bad for him.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:26.980]   I'm just like he sees an awkward individual and you know, power to him for.
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:27.980]   He is acknowledging.
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.660]   He could be that he's acknowledging that nobody really.
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:35.640]   He believed him when he said we're going to go private and good on him for acknowledging
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.640]   it.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.640]   Yes, exactly.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.640]   It was necessary.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:46.440]   No, we don't exactly have the strongest reputation on privacy right now to put it lightly.
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:52.720]   But I'm committed to doing this well and this vision is based on six principles.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:57.120]   You know, first, we're committed to working openly.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.360]   Now second, we're taking a more proactive role.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.720]   This is a super get better place.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.720]   It's why it's a little too.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.460]   We're taking a more proactive role and making sure that all of our partners.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.460]   What was that sharing all about?
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.300]   So that was that was developers seeing themselves on the screen.
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:18.620]   That was also funny because because Mark was about to say, well, we're cutting back your
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.740]   power as developers.
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:25.380]   So he was he says, well, the response doesn't match the words.
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.380]   Boy, sure.
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:30.600]   They're marketing people are great.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:34.240]   We're taking a more proactive role and making sure that all of our partners and developers
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.060]   use our services for good.
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.920]   We're also building out what were you saying, Stacey?
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:47.040]   Oh, I was going to say their marketing and PR team are excellent in terms of that juxtaposition.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:51.680]   Yeah, a lot of deep technical infrastructure and re plumbing the whole infrastructure that
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:56.000]   we build for this company to support this privacy vision.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.820]   It's not going to happen overnight.
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:59.700]   So let's start with our messaging apps.
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.780]   So we don't have to continue through this.
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:05.900]   By the way, by the way, just a little side note here, this back screen color, you know,
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.060]   does that thing with the screen color changes.
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:10.540]   There's about 20 seconds where he's behind.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.980]   He's in front of a green screen.
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:14.580]   Oh, get ready, meamsters.
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:16.020]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:17.260]   They're ready.
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:21.900]   So one thing that got a lot of attention is the new look, Facebook, which has, as Mark
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.700]   said, hardly any blue.
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.900]   I don't have Facebook.
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:27.200]   Oh, that's a--
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.560]   I have to say this morning, I thought, well, I should log in and see it.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.000]   And it said, who's Leo?
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.100]   Who are you?
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.300]   We don't have an account for you.
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.600]   So I literally, it's gone now.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.880]   But this is what it'll look like.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.920]   I think that's a much better look, I guess.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:48.040]   You know, what cracks me up is-- so this is a big thing back in 2000.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:52.360]   I think it was nine when Facebook launched their Open Compute servers, the first hardware
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.520]   that they built.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:57.940]   They, in the whole goal of it, was to reduce the cost of running their servers, right?
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:03.880]   They actually made a decision to use blue LEDs, even though there were seven cents more
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:07.380]   expensive, because it was Facebook blue.
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:11.600]   So like 10 years later, they're like, OK, we're going to get rid of it.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.600]   He laughed.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.300]   Zuckerberg laughed on the stage about how we're going to get rid of the blue.
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.940]   I think this is the fine good hand of FIDGC Mo.
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:23.360]   Notice the very front and center groups.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.440]   Stories, by the way, which is straight out of Instagram.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:31.560]   In fact, this middle thing looks a lot like an Instagram feed.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:37.680]   But groups, and what other big social network pivoted to groups all of a sudden?
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.080]   Communities.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.760]   How did that work for Google+ when they did that?
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.280]   So groups are--
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.360]   Or groups are already big here.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.800]   Yeah, Facebook groups.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.080]   And groups can be private by default.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:53.160]   He said something has surprised me.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:50:00.040]   You'd be able to share your health information with a health provider privately through Facebook.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:05.040]   That's going to take some relearning for people to say, yeah, I'm going to tell my privately
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:08.760]   tell my health provider on Facebook about my health issues.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.760]   Yeah, I don't think--
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.600]   That's where the wording changes, right?
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.600]   So what he's doing is saying you're not doing it on Facebook.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.200]   You're doing it via Facebook.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   Yeah, well--
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.200]   Which is going to be hard to--
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.960]   It's going to be hard to trade people.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.200]   That's an essence, what you're saying.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:26.480]   Well, that's what Apple is doing with their watch and other data efforts to share with
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.480]   your physician.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.480]   Good point.
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:33.240]   And that is where both Google, Amazon, and all of these, they all want to be the intermediary
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:39.880]   data provider between you and other organizations or other services.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.760]   So this isn't-- this makes sense from that perspective.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:49.040]   It's just-- and that's where Facebook-- honestly, it feels really strange that they didn't realize
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.280]   their privacy problem given that this is what they wanted to do and where the market was
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.280]   going.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:58.440]   So it feels kind of like they missed the opportunity much like they missed mobile and now they're
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:02.080]   kind of adapting to it.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:04.120]   And they may make it.
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:07.200]   So I went through my-- I said, what groups am I in?
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:11.160]   I'm in tons more groups than I could have possibly remembered.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:17.080]   My favorite here is that I joined the I like John C. Devorek group.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.080]   Good of you.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:19.080]   Right.
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.080]   Here's the better part.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.280]   It was last updated eight years ago.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:27.360]   A vibrant growing community on the Facebook.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.680]   This somebody pointed out in the chat room has no ads on it.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.680]   Is that going to be the future of Facebook, the no ad?
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:37.680]   Well, no, no, this is-- this is actually the wrong thing to look at because they're not
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.000]   going to-- they're not even coming out with this web version for quite some time.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   This is a mock up.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.280]   What they're out with today is the mobile version.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.280]   Okay.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.280]   Well, I'll just have to trust you.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.360]   I don't know if they have an image of that since you can't show us because you are--
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:50.360]   Let's see.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.880]   --snitty, snooty, and snotty.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:54.480]   Oh, I'm happy not on Facebook, though.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:55.480]   It snoots not.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.480]   I am very happy.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.480]   Show title.
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:58.480]   Let's see.
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:01.920]   Since I'm trying to find the mobile design.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:07.560]   I still like knee-deep and snit.
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.160]   I know how they're going to make their money back, though.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:15.240]   They're turning Facebook back into a hookup app.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.000]   You're adding secret crushes.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.160]   So it's basically Tinder.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:24.640]   You could see which friends have the hots for you.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:25.640]   And it'll match--
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.640]   That's how Tinder operates?
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.760]   Yeah, it'll match you up.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:32.760]   So if you indicate interest in somebody, you can't message them until they indicate interest
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.760]   in you.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.760]   And that's how apparently how this will work.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.440]   This is part of the new Facebook dating, which isn't available here.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:45.400]   If countries already launched 14 more, join the service today.
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.680]   Secret Crush lets you express interest in up to nine friends.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:54.080]   If that friend has opted into Facebook dating and likes you back, they get a notification
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:53:00.680]   saying, "Someone likes you if they pick you as their secret crush is one of their nine."
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:05.320]   Nine seems like a lot, but OK, you both get notifications.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.640]   This is where all the money's going to be in the future.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.080]   Yes, me.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:13.240]   This is what Facebook was already all about.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:14.240]   From day one.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.240]   Again, I'm going to apologize.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:19.000]   I'm going to go and mute for most of the time because they're grinding up trees behind
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   me.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   Well, it's about time, those gosh--
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.240]   I don't think we're hearing it.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.240]   Are we hearing it?
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.240]   She's muting herself.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.200]   When she came on and we heard it.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.200]   Oh.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.200]   Anything else?
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.200]   People are going to accuse me.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:35.280]   People are going to accuse me of talking over and interrupting Stacey.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.280]   So I want Karsten.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.280]   Make sure you--
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:38.880]   When Stacey wants to talk.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:39.880]   Make sure it's clear as can be.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:44.560]   I don't want to get accused of anything because tree grinding is going on.
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:46.000]   You'll hear the trees grinding, Jeff.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.960]   And you'll be like, oh my god, what is that noise?
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:48.960]   Stacey's here.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:49.960]   Oh, no, she's really angry now.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:50.960]   Her.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.960]   Stacey wants to talk.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:52.960]   I'll just mute Jeff.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:53.960]   Hey, there you go.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.960]   That's fine.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.960]   Nice.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.960]   Do we care about the Oculus Quest and the Rift S?
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.280]   Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:04.720]   While we're talking about privacy, can we talk about Google changing their data retention
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:07.640]   policies on their apps location?
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:08.640]   Sure.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:12.880]   That was a terrible way of paraphrasing that.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:19.640]   But Google is allowing you to-- it'll give you two options, a three month or an 18 month
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:24.360]   time limit on how long it keeps your data.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:30.480]   So you can now auto delete your location, history, and web and app activity by either
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.480]   after three or after 18 months.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.120]   Or keep it until I delete it manually.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:36.120]   Right.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.920]   Which is how it is right now.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:42.800]   Well, but manually deleting all of your stuff is pretty terrible.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.880]   So I mean, I guess it's kind of like deleting cookies from your website.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:49.240]   You're going to have a really crappy experience for a little bit afterwards where you're like,
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.840]   ah, I've got a lot of good and everything.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.640]   And nobody knows who I am anymore.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:53.920]   So that's the downside of doing this.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:59.240]   So this isn't an app, but it's going to be a new setting inside your Google account dashboard
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:05.880]   on mobile and on the web, a drop down option that will allow you to select those time
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:08.280]   windows, three months or eight months.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.920]   It'll also cover not just location, but web and app activity.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:19.720]   Things search for browsing Google services, maps, search Google Play.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:22.360]   Older data will be deleted on an ongoing basis.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:24.080]   This is a very good thing.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.560]   And why not?
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:30.280]   Because honestly, Google probably gets much more value out of your most recent activity
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.320]   than out of your 18 month old activity.
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:39.520]   I do wish I could tell it to stop doing YouTube videos, but keep my maps history, but kill
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.160]   my web search history.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.280]   You know, like there is a little bit more granularity.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.440]   I wonder if you can't in their dashboard.
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:49.280]   I don't know.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.080]   I don't have this option yet.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:54.640]   This does not make a distinction.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:57.400]   But yeah, that might be the next thing.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.600]   It's get a little more granular because maps might maybe I like.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:05.520]   Actually, that's really a good idea because I like to keep my location information as long
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.800]   as possible because it's a great way for me to look back.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:09.800]   I don't know.
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:13.600]   I'm not going to delete anything, but there you have it.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:19.200]   How about we were talking about the Oculus Quest and the Oculus Rift S available for pre-order.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.200]   They ship in three weeks.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:26.920]   I feel like this VR thing has just died on the tree here.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:30.200]   It works really well with my surround sound 8-track.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:43.000]   The Quest, both headsets use computer vision technology, Oculus Insight, which enables inside
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.120]   out tracking via sensors built into the units.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.520]   So you can navigate virtual and physical spaces in real time.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:55.920]   The Quest runs on a Snapdragon 835, no wires and no PC, which is kind of cool.
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:00.520]   There'll be 50 titles available when the Quest debuts.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:06.760]   Units are shipped with five preloaded demos, Beat Saber, Creed, Journey of the Gods, Space
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:12.200]   Pirate Trainer, and Sports Scramble 399.
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.640]   You can order it now.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:16.080]   As I said, it will be coming in three weeks.
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:23.120]   The Rift S is basically an updated Oculus Rift, but the new headset has reportedly much better
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:26.720]   optics, much higher resolution display.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:29.520]   399, much lower price.
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:37.680]   As somebody who spent 1,500 bucks on the original Oculus Rift, that's a big difference.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.800]   So do you order these things that still deal?
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:46.200]   No, we have the Vive, which is HTC's competitor.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:50.920]   The 16-year-old likes to play in the Vive with his buddies.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:51.920]   But I don't...
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:52.920]   Do you ever use it?
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:55.080]   I'm not a game player, so I guess that's why...
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.080]   It's fun for gaming.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.080]   I think it's...
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:59.440]   I don't know if this technology is going to take off.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:03.200]   I was a little skeptical even in the beginning.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:04.200]   Me too.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.200]   I'll have to ask Georgia Dow.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.240]   She's going to be on Twitch on Sunday.
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:13.640]   She and her husband actually bought a new house so that they could have not one, not
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:20.120]   two, but three virtual reality gaming rooms so that all of them could play simultaneous.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:23.720]   Are they padded walls so you don't kill yourself up in the walls?
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.720]   I'm sure they are.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:25.720]   I don't know.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:26.720]   But we'll talk to her on Sunday.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:27.720]   She's going to be on Twitch.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.520]   She'll actually be on this Sunday.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.520]   Oh, a week from Sunday.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:31.520]   May 12th.
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:32.520]   That's right.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:33.520]   Okay.
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.920]   When she built it, did she design them with different parameters?
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:39.320]   Like basically, how big does your VR room need to be?
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:40.560]   It's a known number.
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:44.840]   I can't remember what it is, but yes, it had to be that big.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:45.840]   Ha!
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:48.600]   But I don't think she padded the walls or did anything else.
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:52.400]   You just have to have a clear space of, I don't know, it's about 10 by 10 feet, something
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:56.080]   like that, 100 square feet.
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:59.200]   Somebody in the chat room is asking, "Great question, nothing original.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.040]   Would Mark pay $2 billion for Oculus today?"
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:05.360]   Ooh, that is a good question.
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.520]   I don't know.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:11.640]   I think he implied in that question is the answer that you shouldn't.
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:17.400]   Well, well, I mean, if you think about the focus on privacy and you can create basically
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:23.280]   worlds where people can actually interact in a virtual environment and have their interactions
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:26.840]   be private, there's actually a lot of interesting ways you could make money there.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:33.080]   There was a lot of attention originally on the Oculus to those kinds of spaces.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.960]   In fact, I think it was called spaces.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.600]   I don't hear a lot of talk about that anymore.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.200]   It's really boiled down to playing games.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.200]   Right.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:45.600]   But that's because the technology right now is so heavy, cumbersome, you really have to
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:51.920]   do it in the content for it is game related because it's so expensive.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:59.640]   But if you do get a consumer oriented VR device and you create a way for people with
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:04.760]   minimal action on their part to interact with people, I think that could be good.
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.560]   I just don't think we're there yet.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:14.200]   Other announcements at F8, we're going from the macro to the micro now.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.680]   Micro has new camera features.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:20.120]   They said that we really don't want you to have to leave Instagram to get the picture.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.280]   We want to be able to take it in Instagram.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.240]   And actually, I think this is interesting.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:30.640]   Likes are now less prominent, maybe trying to eliminate all that influencer stuff.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.600]   This is Instagram under Adam Masari who used to be in charge of news feed.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.760]   And there's an argument somewhere I saw online.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:42.480]   I don't think I like this on the rundown, but that Instagram becomes the old Facebook.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.480]   It's the public place.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.880]   It looks more like Instagram is becoming the new Snapchat.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.880]   But OK.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.360]   I'll grant you that.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:01:01.360]   Also, Facebook Messenger is going to somehow focus on close friends.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:06.280]   Because you labeled the people in your family unit like close friends or because it's nothing
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.280]   public.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.280]   So it's really a one to one.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.280]   Or a small group.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:18.680]   But you're only people you've chosen to speak to.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:19.680]   So that's a thing.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.680]   No way.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.680]   I don't know.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.280]   We might have made a mistake not covering it, but I just I just.
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.320]   I think there's kind of a fairness question.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.920]   They're a big company.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:36.440]   The other thing I wish that Amazon, because Amazon is so friggin private, wouldn't it
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.920]   be amazing if Amazon had a.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.920]   They do.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.960]   And we actually have covered it last year, but they don't have every that's more.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:45.960]   That's about right.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.960]   But you know what they're about to do.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:52.600]   No, in June, they're going to have something called Mars, a remars, which is going to be
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:58.960]   AI robotics and whatever it then reminds me when's my racer coming?
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.720]   I think it's pretty soon.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.280]   I'm very excited.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.360]   I really replace your bankrupt robot.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.760]   Oh, the on key Cosmo.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.400]   Isn't that sad?
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:19.160]   We had Kevin right about what's going to happen to on key and how this is sad.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.160]   He's very sad.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.240]   He picked the best picture of the story.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:26.360]   So on key, which we we covered quite a bit from the very first when they had a race car
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.920]   that followed a racetrack using cameras.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.280]   It was a lot of fun.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.400]   Then they came out with this little robot.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.400]   You see the kids staring at it.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.600]   It looks like a little mini but bulldozer called the Cosmo.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.320]   There were three generations of Cosmo.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:42.400]   We reviewed all three and loved all three.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.360]   You could most recently when you could program with Python and it seemed to have a lot of
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.360]   nice features.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.360]   It was expensive.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.520]   It was several hundred dollars.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.360]   And apparently the market just wasn't enough.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.360]   Was this the...
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.440]   Is this the robotic Theranos?
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.280]   So no, because they had a product.
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.280]   No, because they had a product.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.920]   They actually shipped.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:01.600]   Big difference.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.320]   The way it went down, it sounds like, okay, this is just me.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.280]   I was at Gigahome and that shut down.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.280]   So the way that...
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.760]   These are rough shutdowns are weird, aren't they?
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.120]   Yeah, I think what happened is an investor backed out.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.880]   It looks like someone either called something in like a debt in or an investor backed out
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.880]   at the last minute, leaving them...
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:25.680]   They had $200 million in VC.
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:32.600]   Well they also had $100 million in revenue from 2017, which was before Vector was launched.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.240]   So if you've got that much revenue coming in, I don't know how...
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:44.760]   I mean, I don't know if they were profitable at all, but that's not a small business.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:48.720]   So in the company basically said on Monday, they were like, okay, yeah, we're shutting
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.720]   down on Wednesday.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.720]   You get a week's severance.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:51.720]   That is...
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:52.720]   That is wild, isn't it?
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.600]   It means they had zero runway or they were running out of runway and didn't tell anybody.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.600]   Vector was 250 bucks.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.760]   It's the most recent one.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:07.000]   It had Amazon Echo built in, although the speaker was so bad, it wasn't really practical.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.600]   Kevin loved that thing.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.600]   We all loved it.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.600]   I loved it.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.600]   Yes.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.400]   He used it for very practical things.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.240]   It followed him around as a mobile, basically Amazon Echo.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:24.000]   He was doing cool stuff with computer vision on it and cool stuff.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   He likes Python.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.120]   It was Python programming.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.120]   And he loves Python.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.120]   Yeah, that's very sad.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.000]   And you're right, we don't know the whole story.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   That sounds right though.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.480]   Somebody pulled out at the last minute.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:40.080]   I've seen that happen so many times with companies that an investor somehow basically
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.720]   screws over the company.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720]   It's...
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.600]   That's why we do not have investors here at Twit.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:56.400]   So the Deep Racer, which is not nearly as cool as the Vector and was $400, will be coming
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.600]   July 10th.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.600]   So I got a little ways to go.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.640]   Oh, this is the Amazon thing.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.400]   Yeah, this is the AI.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.960]   The idea is you could...
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.400]   It's autonomous race car that you could program.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.480]   And I thought it'd be kind of fun to play with this.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.920]   If it's a race car, don't you need to buy like four of them?
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:12.920]   No, you...
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.760]   No, this is the wild thing.
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:20.000]   They're virtual racing leagues.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.760]   You should tell Kevin to get this.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.760]   I will.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:24.360]   Because it uses Python.
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.960]   It could be a good replacement for his vector.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.040]   I think he's actually looking at...
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.040]   It's so recent.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.720]   He sent a bunch of questions in that have yet to be answered.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.880]   They could open source the code.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.640]   They could do lots of things.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.440]   We're going to try...
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:45.680]   I know you can't be here next week and we're hoping to get Kevin in next week on the show.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.920]   So maybe he'll tell us a little bit more about it.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.240]   Oh, whatever happened.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.240]   Or you can read his blog post.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.240]   It's a little onky.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:58.520]   Okay, is that going to be on aboutchromebooks.com or Stacey and IOT?
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.320]   No, it's on Stacey and IOT.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.320]   You don't have to read it.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.320]   I'm just saying.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.320]   Is it already there?
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.320]   He's a good picture.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.320]   Yeah, it's already there.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.960]   Oh, but he still hasn't heard from them yet.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.560]   I don't know if he's heard from them yet or not.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.960]   I haven't checked the story for an update.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.960]   Okay.
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:18.120]   Kevin, if my budget was $400, I'd buy the HP Chromebook X2 today.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.680]   Wow.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.800]   I have the X2 Windows version, the X2NV.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.800]   You like it?
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.600]   Yeah, but it would be a good Chrome.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.240]   Seems is top heavy.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.240]   Yeah, it is.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.240]   It's one of those.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.240]   Obviously.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.240]   Convertibles.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.560]   You know, I'm not really fond of those that much.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.040]   I like a good laptop.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:40.040]   I need to buy a new Chromebook for my daughter for her graduation.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.120]   There's some very good choices.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.520]   Yes, and Kevin will have the recommendation.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.960]   Kevin will have it.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.960]   Yes.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:49.320]   Kevin, I'm coming to you.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.040]   I don't know if he's watching.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.440]   He does, doesn't he?
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.600]   He usually does.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:58.120]   But then he also, when we start talking about him, I usually get I am sperm him saying something
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.280]   commenting on it.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.880]   We should know one more often.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.360]   Well, it's fun to watch you and Kevin together here, too.
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:05.360]   We can get-
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:10.080]   We can't exist in the same place at the same time, only on the podcast.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.080]   Okay.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.440]   We could easily have a three-person show.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:17.880]   There's no reason we can't do that.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:24.920]   I don't think Mark announced this in his keynote, but he has built a sleep box for Priscilla.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:28.360]   I really did not want to click on the story, so I did not.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.360]   I didn't either.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.360]   I didn't do either.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.360]   I just-
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.800]   I was like, I thought about Michael Jackson in the hyperbaric chamber and I was like,
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.200]   "Yeah, I don't know."
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:39.080]   So the box sits on her nightstand.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.080]   I think this is actually-
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.080]   Oh, it's not that I-
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.560]   This is totally cool.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:50.920]   This is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg should be doing.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:55.520]   The box sits on her nightstand and emits a soft glow between 6 and 7 AM, which is when
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.520]   their daughter-
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:57.920]   Say, did you also think that she slept in it?
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.920]   Yes, I did, too.
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:07:59.920]   Yes, that's what I thought.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.920]   I didn't click on it for the same reason.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:04.760]   I didn't see like Hugh Leitbold cloth.
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:07.400]   I thought it was like a claustrophobic.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.000]   I'm acting for Priscilla Chan, waking up, like opening the lid and-
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.520]   I've made you a sleep box, honey.
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:20.800]   Come to the basement.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.960]   The funny thing is, there is such a thing already.
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:28.960]   Our sponsor, Casper, makes a really cool light called the Glow that does exactly-
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.160]   Do you have one of those?
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.160]   Yeah, love it.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.560]   I want one so badly.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.320]   I think, John, I think it's in my office on the desk.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:42.480]   You said it to what time you want to wake up and it's dark, but then it slowly raises
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.480]   the light.
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.480]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:45.480]   It also has a light bulb.
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:49.920]   It has some interesting- they pair so you can have multiple ones and they have some interesting
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:50.920]   other features.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:55.600]   Like if you go to the bathroom, you could pick it up on its charging stand and it will
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.880]   glow very dimly as you walk to the bathroom.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.720]   It's like a candle, and then you go back.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.560]   Also you can twist it.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:08.800]   So Mark, you didn't really need to.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.520]   I don't know why he did.
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.000]   Maybe he wanted to save the hundred bucks.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   No, he can be kind of cheap.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.480]   It probably cost him $10,000 to build for a sleep box.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.400]   That is a very well done ex-a-case box.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.400]   Oh, it looks good.
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.400]   I mean, it's very pretty.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:25.400]   Now that I know it's not a coffin, it's a matter of-
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.400]   He probably used his staff woodworkers.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:30.760]   Oh, you think he didn't build it himself?
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.320]   I would hope he'd build it himself.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:33.320]   I think it was kind of a thing.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.000]   If he kills things, he builds things.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   That's the old saying.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   Well, no.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.560]   If you kill things, you build things.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.560]   It's just right.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.560]   It's the only thing.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.400]   So this is actually- The glow has a really clever technology.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.040]   So that's the charger.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.760]   So he only has one charging pin.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.680]   And on either side, there's this circular conductive ring.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:02.920]   So any way you place it on the stand, it will charge.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:07.040]   And if you turn it, it turns the light up or down.
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.040]   Whoa.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.800]   Yeah, it's really well designed.
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:10.800]   It's really clever.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.960]   It's also the batteries dead.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:14.960]   I'll charge it up.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.680]   And we'll set it to glow slowly.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:22.280]   So Zuck got 478,000 likes on that Instagram post.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:26.880]   Why is there a Sharpie sitting next to the box?
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:29.600]   That's just the kids are going to come in and draw all over it, Mark.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.600]   Maybe that's the plan.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.440]   I think it's the Silicon Valley.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.480]   There's a rule that you have to have post-its in every room.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.480]   In case you have a-
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.680]   Because you have a design thinking moment.
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.720]   Once the light has started, you have to take a quick sniff of the Sharpie to wake the rest
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.720]   of the night.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:49.720]   Karsten.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:51.720]   I don't know.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.720]   That's my--
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.720]   He's being smitty today, Karsten.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.720]   They're often Sharpies to wake up.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:00.040]   I'm pretty sure-- isn't she a pediatrician?
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.040]   She's probably not more than that.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.080]   Yes, I have some Sharpies.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.080]   I don't know.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.120]   I'm going to start talking about his woodworking on his podcast.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.760]   I would if I were him.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:14.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:15.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.000]   Are you excited about one day shipping for Amazon Prime members?
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.120]   I am too, but I have a feeling the people in the fulfillment centers are not so thrilled.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:33.600]   They're going to spend $800 million to expand Prime from two day to one day shipping.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.040]   They said it won't be easy.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.200]   It won't be easy, but nothing worth doing is easy, is it?
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.800]   Is this really worth doing?
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.560]   Yes, because I want it now.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.320]   I want it now, Mommy, now.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.520]   Well, it's how to compete with Walmart.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.720]   I mean, it's just a step in the past because eventually they'll have it so you order it
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:59.160]   and you get it that, you know, an hour later.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.400]   That's I'm sure the goal.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.400]   If I were Jeff--
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.400]   Draw.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.600]   --on your head via drone.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.800]   They have approvals for drones, right?
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.600]   I think they got approvals.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.600]   They do.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:15.920]   Ring doorbell, which is no longer a sponsor, but was for a long time.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:19.920]   And I have a ring and I love a ring, has done something that Neiman Labs is maybe looking
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.000]   a little a scance at.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.720]   Ring wants to start producing crime news.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.280]   That is not true.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:31.120]   They're looking to hire somebody with a title, "Managing Editor News."
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.880]   Scroll down for the update.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.880]   Oh.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.880]   Well, we're going to an exciting new opportunity.
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:38.640]   I brought a whole piece of the Atlantic about this.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.640]   Oh.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:41.640]   OK.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.640]   But they said that they've already had this role.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.640]   It's not what people are making it out.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.320]   Well, it's OK.
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:54.800]   So they've received some-- a little heat, I think rightly so, for this neighbor's app.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:13:00.440]   If you even works within the Ring doorbell, you can see crime in your area.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:04.840]   And in my area, you could say maybe it's a little racist.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:05.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.840]   No.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.520]   I've talked to Jamie about how to talk about racism.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.520]   Yeah.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.080]   I'm not for the neighbor's app, but the way that the media--
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.640]   Well, I'm not against you.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:20.240]   --because the idea is that you could keep up-- if there's-- we often have package thieves
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.240]   as well.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.120]   And if there's a package thief in the neighborhood, people share it.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.840]   So I think it's kind of useful.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.120]   I just throw out the stuff where, what's that Chinese lady doing?
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.320]   Although there was a weird one.
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.520]   It was a really weird one.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.680]   Actually, it tracks you in the same way the police blader of a small town newspaper
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:41.680]   is attractive.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.680]   There was a weird one.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.880]   There was a woman, older woman, 70s.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:50.240]   She had a big bouquet of flowers, scissors, a water vase.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.240]   She was doing something on the person's porch.
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.760]   I don't know this lady.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:57.320]   The lady looks up, sees the Ring doorbell, flips it off.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:01.960]   Then gathers up the flowers, the scissor, the vase, and leaves.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.240]   And they're trying to figure out-- finally, somebody said on their--
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.560]   I know this lady.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:11.800]   She goes around, and she cuts the flowers in your yard, makes a bouquet.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:17.200]   So she had probably cut your neighbor's flowers, hustled over to your stoop to make
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:22.320]   the bouquet, and then saw the Ring and knew she was busted, so flipped you off, and then
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.320]   left.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.640]   She was a flower thief.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.360]   What a strange thing to do.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.720]   But see, without a Ring doorbell, you wouldn't even know.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:41.960]   Yeah, the only issue here is that it is in a time when stranger is danger is rampant.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.720]   It just really does promote that.
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.400]   The fear is that it promotes that.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:51.440]   And Josh Benton, who is the editor of Neiman Lab, who's really, really good.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:59.480]   His argument, I think, if I get it right, is that a company that sells devices to deal
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:05.400]   with us to call themselves an editor or journalism or news is a bit of a conflict.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:10.520]   Now, interestingly, when I was in the UK last, I saw Ring being advertised.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.520]   None of that scare stuff.
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.520]   It was all good.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.440]   It was back to the old convenience argument that Ring made.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:19.240]   And now Ring's gone to-- because-- it used to be Ring said, "Oh, good.
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:20.920]   You can find out where the package there.
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:21.920]   It's nice.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:22.920]   You can do this.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.920]   You can do that."
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.400]   Now, there's criminals everywhere.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:27.040]   We're going to stop them together.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.040]   It's sad.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:32.200]   It's sad because that's what it always descends to.
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.960]   That's what sells products.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:38.120]   I mean, fear, sex, and-- Fear sells.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:44.080]   But when we do the Ring ads, I always focused on the good stuff, the delivery and stuff
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.080]   like that.
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.560]   They didn't tell us how to slant it.
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:51.000]   When Amazon purchased them, I think that's when they stopped advertising on Twitch.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.440]   So I don't know what their current strategy is.
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.160]   I do have some concerns.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:01.800]   But it's the same kind of concerns about the neighborhood watch and the committees.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:05.640]   It's not so far from the committee positatus.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:08.000]   It's not so far from vigilanteism.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   Right.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   All right.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.280]   See the low?
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.280]   The low glow?
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.280]   You can't.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.280]   Because it's turn off the lights.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.280]   Yeah, you can.
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.280]   Here we go.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.280]   Bathroom glow.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.280]   So I shook it.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280]   Turn off the lights.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.280]   I shook it like that.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.280]   It's like a little candle.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.280]   It's like a little candle.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.040]   Or you could scare the children.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.120]   Hello, children.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.120]   Is it time for bed?
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.600]   Whoa.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.720]   It's very-- see, look at how-- did you see that?
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.280]   How it goes from the top to the bottom?
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:35.280]   It flows.
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.280]   It's nice.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.000]   Isn't that cool?
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.280]   And then you can turn it up and down.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:47.680]   Welcome to this week in scare tactics.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.680]   You could turn it up and down.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.680]   Oh, you can.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:53.280]   Maybe it's not doing it right now.
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.640]   But this-- I guess when it's off, you can do that.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:56.640]   Oh, there you go.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.280]   I think you should do the show this way.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.040]   It's bedtime with Leo.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:04.280]   Anyway, Mark, $100.
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.040]   Casper, the glow light.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.040]   Is it 100?
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.320]   I thought it was 79.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.120]   They just raised the prices.
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.120]   What?
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:14.680]   Casper did a whole press release, by the way, sponsor.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.120]   Did a whole press release on why they had to raise it.
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:17.960]   I haven't read it yet.
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:23.360]   Oh, Casper.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.440]   But apparently, the costs went up or something.
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.600]   I mean, I'm sure there's a good reason.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.480]   I don't think this is their prime business.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:31.720]   Yeah, they're not in the late-life business.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:32.320]   Right.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.920]   Although the engineering on this is really kind of fascinating.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.120]   The engineering on it's--
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:40.160]   I posted a bolt innovations to the tear down on this.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.440]   I said it was actually really interesting.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.520]   Wasn't that great?
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.440]   That's actually why I got this.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:45.240]   I said, wait a minute.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:45.760]   That's cool.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.880]   I got to get it.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:47.880]   It was 89.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.720]   It's now 129.
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.480]   Woh-ha!
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.640]   Cost-associated with making the product have gone up
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.400]   since our last production run.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:01.280]   They probably priced it optimistically in the first place.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.680]   Price to sell.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:07.240]   I think 129 is not out of the market, particularly.
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.960]   I mean, can you read by it?
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.160]   Yes.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.360]   And it's battery powered.
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:15.360]   So it is actually great for blackouts.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.600]   You know, it's an emergency light.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:21.960]   If I could read by it, then yes, $129 for a bedside table lamp
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:22.360]   is fine.
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.160]   That was great.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:23.720]   If I can't read by it.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.160]   There's an app and all that stuff.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:26.160]   I don't need an app.
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:27.720]   I hate apps.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:28.760]   So over apps.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:30.320]   Yes, I'm an app.
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:30.960]   So many apps.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:35.960]   Let's do the Google change log speaking of apps.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.960]   The Google change log.
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:43.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.920]   I almost this morning almost went out
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:50.520]   and bought a Google Wear OS watch.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:53.920]   Then I realized there is a chance, small but finite,
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.720]   that they will announce a new one on Tuesday.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.600]   So I'm going to wait.
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.880]   What motivated you to go out this?
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:00.720]   This morning.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:03.280]   They've added new features.
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:07.320]   They actually seem to still have some love for Wear OS.
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:10.000]   They've added something they're calling tiles.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.160]   As you swipe left on your watch,
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:17.520]   there are now four informational tiles.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.200]   Actually more than four goals, which I guess is tasks.
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.480]   Next event, that's your calendar.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:28.920]   Forecast, weather, heart rate, headlines, and timer.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:34.200]   So this is actually a big change in functionality for the watch.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.040]   I think that's pretty cool.
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.280]   Obviously, you can control which of those you see and so forth.
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.160]   They say the new tiles will be rolling out to your Wear OS
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:46.520]   by Google's smart watch over the next month.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.600]   But I suspect we'll hear more at Google I/O.
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:55.480]   Maybe Wear OS isn't dead, right?
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:20:02.120]   Or she is running around with her Wear OS watch.
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:03.720]   Do you wear a--
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:06.040]   No, neither of you wear a Wear OS watch.
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:10.120]   I actually have one I bought and haven't turned off.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.040]   I had a bunch of them, but then I kind of thought
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:15.200]   it was over for Wear OS.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.040]   You would not be the only one.
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.040]   It's still the rudeness factor.
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:24.400]   When somebody has either watch, either brand, the mobile--
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.400]   and I know they're just reading the same way they were
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.760]   on the phone, but I think, oh my god,
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:28.600]   I'm talking too much.
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.440]   I was going too long.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.680]   Oh, no, they're going to lose them.
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:38.240]   You can spend as much as $3,000 on a tag hoyer, Android Wear
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.960]   watch and-- I'm sorry, Wear OS watch.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:43.280]   Or as little as $150 bucks.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:47.320]   There's quite a surprising variety of watches out there.
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:51.200]   So there you have it.
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:54.720]   Wear OS is not dead.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.080]   We already did Alphabet.
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:02.560]   We already-- Google Docs are now getting native.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.800]   Well, maybe not.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.200]   What?
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.200]   Just getting a 404 on that page.
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:09.680]   So maybe that's--
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:11.120]   Oh, yeah, I saw that too.
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.680]   I mentioned the worst that that was a horrible--
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.680]   I didn't put it in there.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.400]   --offline support, no more browser extensions needed.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.200]   That's a good thing.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.080]   That means your Pixelbook will be a little bit more useful.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.040]   Yep.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:24.320]   Android TV-- wow.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.400]   Do you have an Android TV?
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.840]   Does anybody have an Android TV?
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:32.600]   5,000 apps and games up from about 3,000.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.080]   A year ago, the problem is where you're
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.360]   going to get an Android TV.
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:39.080]   As far as I can say, there's only one to get.
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:39.600]   I love it.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.960]   And I have it, the Nvidia Shield.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:46.480]   But honestly, it's not as capable as any of the other
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:47.840]   streamers, including Roku.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:51.920]   So maybe it'll help to get some more apps.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:55.920]   The Google Earth time lapses now are on mobile.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.240]   These are really cool.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.880]   You can go back 35 years.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:02.760]   Wow.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:03.960]   And see how--
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.880]   Oh, there was a look at Austin.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.640]   There was life before Google.
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:15.400]   1984 to 2018, it's really cool to see how stuff changes.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:16.040]   Now there's--
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:17.400]   Overdepressing.
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.200]   Well, look at Las Vegas.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:20.960]   You want to see?
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.400]   So let me see.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.640]   Where do I get the-- how do I start it?
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.640]   Oh, play.
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:32.320]   So you could see Las Vegas get built up by quite a bit.
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.000]   And the lake going down.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:34.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:36.840]   Yeah.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:39.200]   Let me go back to--
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.720]   Does it start at the beginning automatically?
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:42.760]   I wonder, or do I have to--
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:45.440]   let's go back to 1998.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.920]   Yeah.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:48.840]   So that's kind of fun.
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.840]   There's lots of different places that you can get.
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.520]   How about the bushfires in South Australia?
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.600]   You want to see those?
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.360]   You could do this now on mobile, I guess,
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.400]   is the new thing.
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:00.960]   This has been around for a while.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:12.480]   Are those fires?
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:13.080]   Well, there's--
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:14.080]   Or the results are--
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:14.360]   --the destruction.
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.400]   Yeah, the destruction.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.880]   OK.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.160]   We're going to be in Dubai in November.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.680]   This is-- this is-- along with Shanghai,
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:26.000]   one of the fastest growing regions in the world.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.360]   Watch as Dubai goes from a sleepy-living fishing village
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.240]   to-- oh my god, they're building islands.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.960]   You can't even see how high it's going.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.720]   Yeah, you don't see the skyscrapers.
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.600]   What's bringing you to Dubai?
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.320]   Crews, we're going to start in Athens.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.320]   We're going to stop in Jerusalem.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:46.680]   And Petra Jordan-- it's going to be really--
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:47.680]   I know.
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:48.720]   It's so jealous.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.400]   I have one at Petra's like, oh.
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.760]   You know what I did?
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.360]   This is really geeky.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:57.360]   So I've been trying to find a good way
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.640]   to cross-platform, where to share our itinerary,
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.840]   our schedule with Lisa.
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.840]   So I just made a web page on Google--
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:08.120]   on Google-- Google Sites.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.440]   So she'll know all the places we're going.
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:16.080]   And as I book schedules, stuff, then she'll know ahead of time.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:20.560]   And I'm even putting in-- here's a little Dubai video.
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:24.320]   To get her ready for the trip.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.000]   So there you go.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.160]   That's pretty geeky.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:30.040]   Rising from the warm shores of the Persian Gulf.
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:36.920]   By the way, really easy to do with Google Sites.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.120]   Oh, Sites is awesome.
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:43.600]   Took me about-- took me a couple hours.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:46.080]   Did you see-- I thought this was really cool.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.360]   But it did make me think, they're not
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.120]   working too hard in the London office.
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:54.680]   Google's London office, they're actually--
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:58.200]   the employees have made a sticky note art gallery
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:01.680]   on the glass walls of the office.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.440]   In Google's London office, we use Pixel Art
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.480]   to bring life to the building.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:05.480]   Pixel Art.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:07.000]   Using Post-its.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.400]   We have over 200 people that have contributed
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:13.000]   to these one art piece.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:13.800]   I love pandas.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:16.920]   So myself and my entire team worked on the Panda emoji.
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.640]   It was a very good team-bought experience.
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.800]   So if your Google Assistant isn't working very well,
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.160]   now you know why.
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:25.720]   I look a little bit more Mr. T but I quite like it.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.160]   The most important thing is how you
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.080]   peel the Post-it off of the pad.
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:32.320]   Turn it over and peel from the backside down at an angle.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.200]   Then, when you stick it on the glass, it's very smooth.
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.480]   Good lord.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:39.360]   I am making the 8-bit version of Link
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.120]   in the original Legend of Zelda.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.440]   I find that when you're really stressed,
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.600]   you should go off and do something completely not related
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.280]   and have that kind of space out time.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.840]   There was a lot of video game-related art.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.800]   And from me, Calvin and Hobbes.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:52.800]   It makes me happy.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.640]   Really nicely done, isn't it?
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:55.960]   And I thought that that might appeal to other people.
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.360]   I think if there's somebody you don't like,
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.440]   it's terribly British, passive-aggressive
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:01.440]   to put a good lord in front of them.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.040]   And block their view.
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:03.720]   Block their view.
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.280]   With a giant Post-it.
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:05.760]   Oh, it's hard.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.880]   You can't take that down.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.080]   No, no, no, it wasn't you.
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.800]   [LAUGHING]
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.720]   You're very British.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.720]   Chrome 74 is a ride for Enterprise.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:18.120]   The only reason I'm mentioning this
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:22.160]   is because it's Kevin's article about Chromebooks.
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.960]   OK, yes, I accept your cookies.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:24.800]   I accept them.
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:31.160]   So yeah, if you want to read about all the new features
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:36.240]   in Chrome 74, nowhere better than about Chromebooks.com.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:39.560]   I actually really like the PDF annotation support.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.520]   That's really useful.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:41.960]   That is.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:45.360]   You don't need a third-party tool anymore.
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.600]   And USB cameras can be used in place
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:51.440]   of the native built-in cameras if you
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.560]   want to use them for document scanning or microscopes.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.520]   And that'll work with Google.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.320]   It's pretty cool.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.360]   Audio support for Linux apps, too.
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.200]   That's audio playback only, but still.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.000]   Yay.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.080]   And finally, Google launches Calljoy,
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:13.960]   a virtual customer service phone agent
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:17.280]   for small businesses.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:22.960]   It launched today aimed at 30.2 million small business owners.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:26.440]   It's a low-cost customer service agent
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.520]   that block spam calls, provides call-out
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.640]   with basic business information,
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.080]   and redirects customers to complete their requests.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.520]   But I presume it's duplex, $39 a month, no matter how big
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:39.920]   or small your business.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:43.280]   We should hear some-- let's hear some Calljoy.
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:47.200]   When I started business took off, almost instantly,
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.640]   the phone became a burden.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.880]   I wasn't prepared for the volume of calls and customer
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:52.760]   questions that were coming in constantly.
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:54.920]   I started this business to devote more time to cooking.
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:56.360]   To make it meatballs.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:58.400]   With Calljoy, I can get back to cooking
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:59.960]   and never miss a phone call.
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:00.800]   Adaptive business--
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.760]   You think this guy is actually a chef?
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.280]   No.
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.840]   He's an actor, right?
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.560]   No chef ever delivered a line that well.
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.360]   I'm just saying.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:15.280]   Every once in a while, actually every episode on Billions.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.400]   Now they bring in somebody real famous.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.120]   I was thinking today watching the--
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:21.120]   Oh, no.
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.560]   I want to have that pizza.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.400]   That pizza is interesting, isn't it?
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.720]   And they had three porn stars on last night.
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:27.640]   Well, well, well.
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:28.200]   Playing themselves.
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.320]   You would have recognized them.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.680]   Don't worry.
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:33.600]   Let's not talk about Billions, because I am planning
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.160]   on watching it.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.160]   I just am waiting for all the episodes to be up.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.560]   No, no, we're talking about the food.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.040]   It's OK.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:40.000]   It's not anything to do with the plot.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.280]   Well, it is, in that case.
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.120]   But it's not.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:43.040]   You'll see.
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.040]   But yeah, there's some--
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.080]   Is he a famous New York pizza chef?
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:47.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:51.240]   There's a blog just about the food places.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.600]   Look up Billions' food.
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:56.960]   I know they had the ramen guy.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:59.120]   Ivan Ramen, serve him ramen.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.560]   But you always know they're real people,
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:02.800]   because they're surrounded by these great actors.
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:05.080]   And their performances are so bad.
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:08.680]   You go, well, clearly he's an actual chef.
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:09.680]   Not this guy.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:10.680]   Anyway, let's continue.
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:11.680]   He's called times.
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.680]   So wait, wait, wait.
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:13.680]   So what is-- we'll show it to you.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:14.680]   Wait.
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:15.680]   You're going to like this.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:16.680]   OK.
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:17.680]   So we're--
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:18.680]   Wait.
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:19.680]   No more news.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:20.680]   We got some digression to go.
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:21.680]   Here, let's do it.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:22.680]   Exactly.
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:24.680]   So there's the fun with Damien Dining-Guide.
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:27.680]   I guess that's the Google change log.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.680]   Wait a don't, Carson.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:30.680]   Shot the hell.
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:31.680]   OK.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:32.680]   She's--
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:33.680]   Carson.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:34.680]   Where did you put this?
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:35.680]   Where did you put this?
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:36.680]   The hook.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:37.680]   Yeah, right.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:39.680]   Where did you put the fun with Damien?
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.680]   In the chat, in the rundown.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:42.680]   OK.
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.680]   I just didn't belong in the change log.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.680]   We had to end the change log.
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.680]   Yes, we do.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.680]   Now Jeff, please.
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:48.680]   Now it's digression time.
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:49.680]   With your digression.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:50.680]   See it, Leo?
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:51.680]   No, fun.
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:54.680]   It's in the-- there's a chat.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:56.680]   There's a lot.
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.680]   OK.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:58.680]   Fun with Damien.
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:29:59.680]   But Stacy can see it.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:01.680]   Can Stacy, can you see it?
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:02.680]   I'm not.
[01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:03.680]   I wasn't actually looking.
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:04.680]   I don't see it in the chat.
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:05.680]   I think you put it in somebody else's.
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:08.680]   I think you put it in the chat, Jeff, where you always put things.
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:09.680]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:10.680]   The other category.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:12.680]   I'll put it down to the other.
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:13.680]   OK.
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:14.680]   Sorry, here it goes.
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:16.680]   He always tries to use the actual chat.
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:17.680]   Don't use the chat.
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:18.680]   Just use the other.
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:21.680]   Oh, Damien and Lewis is a star.
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:22.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:23.680]   OK.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:24.680]   Fun with Damien.
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.680]   It's fun with Damien.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:28.680]   The billions season three dying guide.
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:31.680]   So, keen steakhouse.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:32.680]   Babbo.
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:33.680]   Don't listen, Stacy.
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:34.680]   Momofuku co.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:35.680]   That's OK.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.680]   It's OK.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:37.680]   It's OK.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.680]   Nothing's.
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:43.680]   Stacy, for the one audio, Stacy is taking her earbuds out.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:44.680]   Can I mute Stacy?
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:52.680]   The funny thing is that after the guy came to their house to make these really fancy
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:59.440]   pizzas, they take him to his old pizza joint in Brooklyn or wherever to have real pizza
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.680]   because those did not look.
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:02.680]   Well, there's two different pizza places.
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:03.680]   One is a gourmet pizza place.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:09.680]   The other one is the place that the real guy acts used to hang out all the time.
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.680]   Wow, look at this.
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:15.680]   They really do do a lot of all the research on every place.
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:16.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:17.680]   Oh, what was there?
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:18.680]   Something else I wanted to eat.
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:19.680]   Oh, the ice cream place.
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:22.680]   I can't tell something about this.
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.680]   Yes.
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:26.680]   Kosars, bagels and biollis since 1936.
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:28.680]   Oh, there it is.
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:29.680]   Tom Calicchio.
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:33.680]   He was a top chef.
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:34.680]   OK.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:36.680]   And snack bar.
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:39.680]   That's the restaurant in Atlanta that's famous for his burgers.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:46.680]   So they bring wags and axe a burger that looks like it would kill you.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:48.680]   Wow.
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:51.680]   They really, so that's interesting.
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:52.680]   They really do shoot great.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:53.680]   It's Brian compliment.
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:54.680]   It's a stick.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.680]   He really makes a big point.
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:31:59.680]   That's interesting.
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:00.680]   Donna Hughes, Steakhouse.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:01.680]   OK.
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:03.680]   People are no longer listening to the show.
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:04.680]   So it's just the three of us.
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:06.680]   So, I was also thinking about it.
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:07.680]   I don't know if this is happening.
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:10.680]   You know how people make mockery of Ted Talks, which deserve?
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:11.680]   Yes.
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:15.680]   Has anyone done a good mockery of the keynotes?
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:17.680]   Because there's just this.
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:24.680]   So I was talking to my friend and it's this stick that's now because every keynote is the
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:25.680]   same.
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:27.680]   I have seen parody keynotes.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:28.680]   Yes.
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:30.680]   OK.
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:31.680]   Seems like that's something we need.
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:32.680]   Right.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.680]   Can I go back to call joy?
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:35.680]   I just want to hear it.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:39.680]   Let's just, I want the chef has been standing here with his meatballs.
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:40.680]   Oh, sorry.
[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:41.680]   I think it's time.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:42.680]   It's always first to answer.
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:44.680]   Make sure those calls are directed appropriately.
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:46.680]   Most people are calling to order the case back.
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:47.680]   I want to hear your calls to it.
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:48.680]   You can convert those calls to action.
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:51.680]   That means my phone is ringing less and my orders are going up.
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:54.680]   Call joy doesn't just help me manage phone calls.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:56.680]   It gives me more control over my business and my customers.
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:58.680]   I want to hear it.
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:32:59.680]   Call joy.
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:00.680]   Answer with intelligence.
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:04.680]   You just watched a whole stupid video without an actual demo.
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:05.680]   It was your choice.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.680]   You did it.
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:07.680]   It's my fault.
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:12.680]   See, my fear on this is that people are going to start using it to robocollomy.
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:13.680]   Yep.
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:16.680]   Does it end up pushing the call screen?
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:18.680]   We already have enough problems.
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:21.680]   And then Google will just be talking to Google.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:22.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:25.680]   Because the Pixel, you can do that.
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:26.680]   You can reject it and have them.
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:29.680]   I always do this with all inbound calls.
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:30.680]   Inbound calls now.
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:31.680]   Just push the screen call.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:33.680]   That explains a lot.
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:36.680]   Okay.
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:41.680]   I don't know where we went off target, but that is my fault.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:53.680]   So Julian Assange got his first sentence of 50 weeks in the UK jail spelled GAOL.
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:56.680]   They're still negotiating Assange's distribution of the US.
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:57.680]   Oh my god.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:58.680]   Is that pronounced jail?
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:33:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:00.680]   Yes.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:01.680]   I thought it was a gal.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:04.680]   Yeah, I just thought it was a gala or a gala.
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:10.680]   That's why we spelled it J-A-I-L for you Yanks who don't add a read.
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:12.180]   Wow.
[01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:17.840]   We knew if we called it a jail, you would say "Gail."
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.680]   And there's nothing gay about the old Bailey.
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:28.000]   So the joke on Twitter is which embassy will he serve the sentence in?
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.600]   The jailers are going to get rid of him in 30 weeks because I'm sorry, we don't want
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:32.600]   you anymore.
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.680]   Anyway, I don't want to joke about it.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:36.840]   It's much more serious than that.
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:42.720]   So he will be in a British gail and then perhaps extradited.
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:48.440]   Although there's some question about that because one of the rules of extradition, I
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:54.720]   think we mentioned this before, is that he can only be extradited on the charge that
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:56.080]   the extradition is.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:00.000]   They can't add charges after the fact.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.800]   The charge they have is kind of slender.
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:12.520]   This charge of offering to hack the emails or the hack the NSA to that he made apparently
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:15.320]   in a chat conversation with Chelsea Manning.
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:17.720]   That seems like a fairly flimsy premise.
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:22.040]   But if they do extradited them on that grounds, they can't charge them with anything extra.
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:23.800]   But now they have a year to think up a better charge.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:25.200]   Now they can come up with better.
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:26.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:27.200]   Maybe this is all a lot.
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:32.760]   I still think Trump's going to pardon him.
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:33.760]   I have the...
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:36.920]   You want to know my really complex conspiracy theory?
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:38.420]   Sure.
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:39.420]   So a lot of...
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:40.420]   Let me get my tin foil, please.
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:41.420]   Yeah, really.
[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:45.520]   A lot of the redacted Mueller report, almost all of the redactions were because of it's an
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:46.720]   ongoing matter.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:57.280]   They needed an ongoing matter with Julian Assange to redirect all the WikiLeaks stuff.
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:01.040]   And all of the WikiLeaks stuff was in fact redacted.
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:04.320]   So they come up with this.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.880]   They say Julian, just come out.
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:10.400]   We're going to put you in jail in the UK for 50 weeks.
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:12.240]   We will never extradite you.
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:13.560]   We will never charge you.
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:18.880]   But this way we can redact all those really bad, because those are the ones that are the
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:24.360]   most direct contacts with Roger Stone, Julian Assange, and the Russians.
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:25.360]   That was all redacted.
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:31.160]   Of course Roger Stone's stuff is still a matter of current action.
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:33.120]   Yes, that's interesting.
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:37.120]   That's like a really crazy, that's QAnon level, cray cray.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.400]   But that presumes that the world is that well organized.
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:40.400]   It's the problem of the first...
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:42.280]   I think the world is that well organized, honestly.
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:44.280]   But then I've been watching Vib.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:49.160]   Jonas for president.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:50.160]   Is that not...
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:51.320]   Oh my God.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:53.720]   I have to watch this show five times just to get all the jokes.
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:54.720]   It goes so fast.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:55.720]   I know I love it so much.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.040]   So good.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:02.480]   And it is replaying in a very satiric way, all that we've been going through over the
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:04.480]   last few years.
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:10.200]   Instead of the Russians, it's the Chinese, but otherwise.
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:12.200]   I think we could reasonably...
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:13.200]   Wow.
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:14.200]   This is swift.
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:15.200]   This is efficient.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:22.640]   Well, Leo, I would like to get some friends and family equity in the company, in your
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:25.640]   company, because I know when you're a soul for $200 million is...
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:26.640]   Cheddar.
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:27.640]   Like cheddar.
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:28.640]   Cheddar.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:29.640]   Cheddar.
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:30.640]   Cheddar.
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:34.120]   That's a lot of cheese.
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.120]   What is it?
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:36.120]   Cheddar.
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:37.120]   Do you know Cheddar?
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:38.120]   It's a financial news network for millennials.
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:45.920]   The other record, John Steinberg, who's very good, who I know, was at BuzzFeed and then at
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:53.200]   the Daily Mail and then he left to start his own company, which does financial news,
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:56.200]   in video, mainly at younger people.
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:59.200]   And he's got a whole bunch of shows and it's really good.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.440]   Well, that's actually about the right price.
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:06.880]   If they had 25 million in revenue in 2018, it's about 8X revenue.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.800]   It's about, I think that's about 8 to 10 times revenue.
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.160]   Oh no, it's usually 8 to 10 times profit.
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:13.160]   Sorry.
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:14.160]   What's their profit?
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.160]   I don't know.
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:18.000]   Bet it's not 25 million.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000]   You always...
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000]   I don't know if it's a profitable media thing.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000]   Yeah, it's...
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000]   It's so rare.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.160]   So you're actually much better off not making money I found out when you're trying to sell
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:26.800]   the business.
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.040]   If you don't have...
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:33.000]   If you don't have profit, there's no multiple of zero, so they just make up a number.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000]   Right.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.760]   Cheddar did get 40 million households.
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:41.080]   So they're on Dish, Sling, AT&T, DirectTV now, mostly over the top.
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:44.320]   But still 40 million households, TWIT...
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:50.440]   I mean, TechTV had 41 or 44 million households and sold for more than 300 million.
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:53.800]   So now it was cable households.
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:54.800]   And that was...
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:01.640]   TechTV did not make money except for one quarter that they faked it.
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:02.640]   So good.
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:03.640]   Good for Steinberg.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:06.120]   The website was always profitable.
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.280]   The website made a million dollars a year.
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.280]   Rainer shine.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:13.480]   TechTV website.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:18.560]   That's because they didn't pay you guys anything.
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:21.160]   The deal for Cheddar all in cash.
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.960]   Cash, but he's going to buy some Altisse stock.
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:28.040]   Is Altisse the company that bought him?
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:31.360]   Yeah, Altisse also bought cable vision along with...
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.520]   They're a cable company.
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:34.520]   They're a cable company in the US.
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:39.560]   They own News 12, which is in the Tri-State area.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:41.040]   For cable customers.
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:48.880]   Well, good for you, Mr. John Steinberg, Cheddar Executive and Sound Guy.
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:50.400]   Good for you.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:54.040]   You know, instead of this week in tech, I should have named this network.
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:56.120]   This week in tech for millennials.
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:57.120]   That was my mistake.
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:02.280]   Well, it doesn't help that you're old and people like me on the show are old.
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:05.000]   Yeah, I'm only Gen X, so I got to say...
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000]   I love Stacey.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.560]   I mean, more kids.
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:10.120]   You need those hot millennials.
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:11.560]   I love our audience, but they're not millennials.
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:15.160]   I put this in the rundown just to get Jeff's blood pressure up a little bit.
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:16.160]   Oh, no.
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:17.160]   Why?
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.640]   Holy sh...
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.160]   You must love the New York Times privacy project.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:24.120]   Oh, it's just driving me nuts because it's full moral panic.
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:25.840]   At least they mark everything opinion.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:28.920]   Actually, I thought this was a clever idea.
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:37.640]   What they did is they bought ads using all the traditional methods.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:39.160]   But the ad didn't look like an ad.
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:43.240]   It simply said things like, "Well, here's an example of an ad.
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:46.360]   This ad thinks you're trying to lose weight and still love bakeries."
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:49.880]   Both things can be true.
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:50.880]   Absolutely.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.120]   I probably would get that ad.
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.120]   This ad...
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.840]   I'm glad that they're both true, actually.
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:01.120]   This ad thinks you're male, actively consolidating your debt and are a high spender at luxury
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:02.120]   department stores.
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:03.560]   They even said, "Here's..."
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:08.560]   Now, the people, the ad brokers they were buying from would not say where the data came
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:09.560]   from.
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:12.480]   These are aggregators who get data from a lot of places.
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:16.400]   Most data providers say the Times declined to tell us where their data comes from or
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:18.120]   how they built their models.
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:23.640]   So the sources and the ads below come from the ad experts who helped us create the campaign.
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:28.160]   And by the way, this experiment would be blocked on Facebook because they ban most ads that
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:30.160]   say how you've been targeted.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:32.880]   They don't want to look behind the curtain.
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:35.080]   I think this is a good...
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:36.160]   Has anybody seen these ads?
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.320]   I haven't seen these ads.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:41.880]   But I run a brave browser, which is an ad blocking browser.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:47.200]   This ad says, "Thinks you're a female registered Democrat and are likely to vote for the sitting
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:48.200]   president."
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:49.200]   What ad?
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:51.600]   I don't understand.
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.600]   This ad.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:53.600]   Where's the ad?
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:54.600]   That's what the ad would look like.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:55.600]   That's what they're buying.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:57.600]   They're telling you basically how you're being targeted.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:00.760]   So they're buying ads that the ad says how you're being targeted.
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:03.400]   The second page of the ad says, "You're being watched.
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:04.600]   Are you okay with that?
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:06.480]   Introducing the privacy project from the New York Times."
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:10.280]   So it is subsequently an ad for the New York Times.
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:16.040]   But the point of the ad is to say to the ad viewer, this is who we think you are.
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:17.040]   Yeah.
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:18.960]   It's offering transparency in a lot of ways.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.240]   I think it's really interesting.
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:21.240]   I haven't seen...
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:22.240]   I would like to see these ads.
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.240]   The targeting the Times did.
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:26.520]   Yes, they bought these ads.
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:27.520]   Yes, they bought these ads.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:29.520]   They bought people in these suburbs.
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:30.520]   What's the big deal?
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.520]   What's the big deal?
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:34.120]   Because it is not transparent.
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:35.120]   And you can...
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:37.760]   I mean, because generally when you see an ad for...
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:42.600]   If I'm a mom who I think I'm going to vote for Trump or whatever, maybe a pack will target
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:48.120]   a specific type of Trump really loves women ad towards me.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:51.120]   And I'd see that and I wouldn't understand why I was seeing that.
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.120]   But now...
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.120]   The only difference...
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:54.120]   Sorry, Stacey.
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:55.360]   I thought you were going to go ahead.
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:56.640]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:01.000]   I mean, yeah, maybe you could say seeing that as so what, but at least...
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.040]   So you bought an ad on all the family because you wanted to get liberals.
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.040]   Well, that's the point is...
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.040]   There's no difference.
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:08.040]   Well, there is a difference.
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:09.680]   And these are much more granularly targeted.
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:10.680]   Yes.
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:11.680]   Because it's possible.
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:12.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:13.680]   But welcome to the future of media.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:15.560]   But people don't understand that.
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:19.840]   They don't understand how quickly and closely they can be targeted.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.480]   And I would say if you see something that says you are likely to be a credit risk who still
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:29.480]   likes to buy fancy goods, that's actually something you should be aware of.
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:32.080]   And you may not realize that you fit in that group.
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:34.600]   Let me just go back to the old days.
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:39.400]   I'm old enough to remember when we used Axiom and direct mail has done that forever.
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:40.400]   Right.
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:41.400]   Forever.
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:43.280]   With more data on you than anybody has.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:46.400]   And with your actual name and actual address, I can go to Axiom...
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:47.640]   I do this for my students.
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:49.840]   I can go to Axiom now.
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:51.400]   I haven't done this in a while.
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:54.480]   But on the past where I said, "Okay, you want me to creep you out students?"
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:44:02.960]   I can go in to Axiom and get the names and addresses of women within two miles who have
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:06.200]   this kind of car, this kind of education and so on and so forth.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.680]   And that's the way that business has worked for 40 years.
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:13.960]   40 years, I was going to say that because I interviewed them way back in the 80s or
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:14.960]   the 90s.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:22.760]   In fact, the Times quotes Axiom saying, "Well, it's not a science.
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:26.560]   We predict, for instance, whether you'll buy an SUV by looking at people who did buy
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:30.320]   SUVs, then checking whether you live in a similar region.
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.320]   You're about the same age.
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:33.360]   You share similar interests."
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:37.400]   So it's really kind of a predictive model, a guess almost.
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:38.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:47.040]   So a friend of mine started a company that was then sold to AOL where he did advertising
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:51.880]   where if you came into the New York Times to the travel section and then you left to
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:57.440]   go to weather.com, that data point about you that you looked at the travel section, which
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:00.240]   just really makes you really, really valuable, carried with you.
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:02.920]   This is the beginning of retargeting and everything we had before.
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:06.160]   So he was at the very beginning of helping to invent this.
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:11.840]   But the thing that he taught me was a lot of the correlations made no sense.
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:15.560]   This is the argument that my friend David Wenberger makes in his new book, Everyday
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:22.160]   Chaos, where A/B testing and machine learning and such comes up with a prediction, as you
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:26.720]   just said, Leo, of a behavior for which there's no necessary explanation.
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:31.360]   It's just, yeah, people who have bought SUVs in the past have these characteristics.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:32.760]   We have no idea why.
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.920]   We're not targeting those people per se.
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:40.280]   We're just taking data we have, people who bought SUVs, and trying to find similar correlations
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:43.240]   to get them to buy more SUVs.
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:44.640]   Nothing really sinister about that.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:46.520]   It's just the way advertising has worked for a long time.
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.440]   It just has more data now.
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:52.640]   Yes, I actually agree with you, Jim.
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:53.640]   But I still thought it's a great campaign.
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:56.240]   Or to put that on the rundown, this is the time when Leo did it.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.520]   No, I think it's a great campaign.
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.560]   I think it is good to let people know about this.
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.200]   It's good to let people know about this.
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:05.960]   It's not good to use that as a way of generating clicks.
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:13.480]   Well, the times is just jealous because the times has had more data points on people than
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:18.360]   most any media company because they started the paywall of the registration rather early.
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:23.360]   They asked you certain things that they wanted from you, and they have a reading history,
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:24.600]   and they've targeted ads to this.
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:28.680]   I haven't read the story, so I don't know whether they admit their own sins.
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:32.280]   Believe me, the times maxes out as much of this as they can possibly do.
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:34.880]   They just can't do as much because they don't know as much.
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:35.880]   Right.
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:36.880]   I am still.
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:38.040]   Are you upset about this, Jeff?
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:39.240]   I'm very upset about this.
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:45.080]   I subscribe to The New York Times, and they want me to pay $5 a month for their food site.
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:46.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:47.080]   I do too.
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:48.080]   I pay both.
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:51.640]   I really resent the heck out.
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.400]   I know, but you get a lot for the food site.
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:57.640]   You get all the recipes going back 100 years, and you get all the business.
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:00.800]   There's a lot of good things in that food site that you don't get just because you could
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:01.800]   get the newspaper.
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:03.920]   Well, but they still have some of the recipes.
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:04.920]   That's what drives me nuts.
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:08.040]   I'm like, yeah, if I click on this, is it going to?
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:09.040]   It works.
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:10.040]   Oh, good.
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:13.400]   But I say that is a model to talk about with more of those things.
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:18.440]   So when they tell you how many digital subscribers they have, it's not all to The New York Times.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:21.960]   It's to crosswords and food and such.
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:22.960]   Mmm.
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:23.960]   Yeah.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.040]   I pay for the crosswords too, actually.
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:27.040]   I don't pay for the crosswords.
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.040]   Also, important news.
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:30.040]   I'm going to put it in the rundown right now.
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:35.360]   I'll put it in the rundown because I've learned my lesson now because Karsten yelled at me.
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:36.360]   Yeah.
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:38.360]   Guardian breaks even.
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:41.360]   That's a big deal.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:43.800]   The Guardian was always the line was.
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:46.640]   Oh, it's real because they do not have a paywall.
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:47.640]   Precisely.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:49.120]   So they did a couple of things about this.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:53.200]   They always called themselves profit seeking just somehow they could ever find the profit.
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:55.480]   Now they've at least found break even.
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:59.080]   But full disclosure was I worked with the Guardian on their membership strategy and we've learned
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:01.160]   quickly and they learned quickly and it wasn't a membership strategy.
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:03.240]   It was a begging strategy.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:08.840]   Brilliant woman named Amanda Meckle basically runs it and and Kath liner, the editor at
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:13.400]   the end of every story has a piece that says you should feel very guilty right now with
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:17.040]   a foreboding English accent because you should all pay for this.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.920]   I see this every time by the way, I have not yet paid for it.
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:22.440]   But since you're here, we have a small thing.
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:23.800]   So they did ask.
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:28.920]   They did an off site with readers some time ago in this process in the strategic process
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:33.200]   and the readers said, you know, how many of you pay for the Guardian?
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.480]   Oh, some number went up.
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:38.280]   How many of you would pay for the Guardian to be free for the rest of the world?
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:39.280]   Every hand went up.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:40.280]   Oh, wow.
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:42.320]   They made the Guardian into a clause, which is what it is.
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:45.440]   And so this is not a lot of people called membership.
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:46.440]   Another word for subscription.
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:50.360]   That's not what they're doing here because you're not buying access to content.
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:54.800]   You are supporting the Guardian for the good of the world.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:56.880]   It's going to be donate to Wikipedia.
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:59.280]   Yes, which I do or NPR.
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:02.600]   I give a monthly donation to Wikipedia.
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:05.720]   Yeah, give a donation.
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:07.760]   I should get because I use the Guardian.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:09.560]   We frequently use the Guardian for a show.
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:11.160]   So I'm going to give them a look.
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:13.160]   Tax right off.
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:16.000]   No, actually, I don't think it is.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000]   I don't know.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000]   The US might go to their foundation.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000]   No, it doesn't have to be enough profit.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000]   It's a business expense.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.720]   I deduct the New York Times subscription.
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:26.880]   I deduct all the subscriptions because it's a business.
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:27.880]   Yes.
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:30.320]   No, I was just thinking as like, "Wick and media is to the foundation."
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:31.320]   Yeah, that's a charity.
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:32.320]   That's a tax right now.
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:34.320]   But then we do the same as the taxes.
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:39.120]   Well, that kind of then there's just branding it as a cause.
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:40.600]   It's not actually a cause.
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:44.520]   Well, truthfully, because of the tax laws in the United States, you have to give so
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:49.560]   much in charity to exceed what is it, two or four percent of the adjusted gross income
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:54.120]   that you really don't get to deduct charity unless you are really a big giver on the
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:55.120]   other hand.
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:58.240]   You can deduct all business expenses from dollar one.
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:49:59.240]   So it's good to see.
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:02.440]   Don't people donate 10% of their income to charity?
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:05.400]   Yeah, they're supposed to.
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:06.400]   That's tithing.
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.400]   It says God.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:10.000]   Well, I know, but that's, that's what we're about.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000]   Yeah, but they take, what is it?
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000]   Is it four percent?
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000]   I think it's four percent.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.520]   So the first four percent, you don't get to deduct.
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:16.240]   You could deduct the second six percent.
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:17.240]   Okay.
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:18.640]   I was like, "Wait, wait.
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:21.680]   No, people donate more than two to four percent, right?"
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:22.680]   No.
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:23.680]   Oh.
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:24.680]   You're very generous.
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:27.000]   You do not, you really donate 10 percent.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000]   We try to.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.360]   I don't know if we get, we don't always hit that exactly, but yeah.
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:33.360]   Good.
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:39.440]   Well, going from Stacey's generosity and fun to, I'm going to go to one more story that
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:43.760]   I'm curious to hear your reactions to Burger King and the Impossible Burger.
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:46.600]   Oh, it's so good if you can click them correctly.
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:48.080]   I'm so excited about this.
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:52.720]   I think they might be able to, with the, with the, with the, because they flame them and
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:53.720]   all that.
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:57.800]   Well, no, the challenge is a lot of companies where you get the Impossible Burger, they,
[01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:59.520]   they cook it too long and it's not good.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:04.880]   Can I tell you something about these so-called flame broiled burger at Burger King?
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:08.320]   It is not flame broiled to order.
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:09.480]   They flame broiled it.
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:10.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:11.480]   Earlier.
[01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:12.480]   Long before.
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:15.720]   Perhaps at the store, perhaps somewhere else.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:20.760]   Then they bring it to the store and they microwave it and the hint that that's happening is
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:23.440]   the ding right before your order gets delivered.
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:29.920]   Well, they put it through the grill thing, then they put it in this plastic thing.
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:30.920]   You watch too many ads.
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:31.920]   Look, they take it off.
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:34.160]   They actually go to Burger King and watch what happens.
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:35.400]   They put it in a microwave.
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:38.600]   It goes ding after, after they put it to the thing.
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:40.160]   But here's the issue.
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:42.360]   Should a pickle on a burger be hot?
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:43.360]   No.
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:46.240]   Well, that's the problem with microwaving the burger.
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:47.240]   The pickle becomes hot.
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:48.240]   Oh, microwave.
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:50.240]   The pickle you assemble the burger later.
[01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:52.080]   You just microwaved it.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:54.600]   You never worked in fast food clearly, Jeff.
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.640]   Oh, I did.
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:57.640]   Where did you work?
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:58.640]   And roast steakhouse.
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:01.360]   Have I told you this story of my finger?
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:02.760]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:03.760]   Yeah.
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:08.080]   That was real food though, that even though it was a chain.
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:09.240]   I worked at McDonald's.
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:13.200]   I know, I know fast food.
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:15.200]   Yeah, so don't overcook it.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:17.160]   It's the key on the processor.
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:21.320]   I had one at, this is a big mistake, but it was the only place I could get it near here.
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:22.320]   A white castle.
[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:23.320]   Big mistake.
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:24.520]   Yeah, they do it on their sliders.
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:26.320]   That's not good?
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:27.320]   No.
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:29.320]   Because they kind of, they steam it.
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:32.480]   And it was bushy.
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:35.800]   Don't steam a hamburger.
[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:37.360]   Yeah, that's what they do.
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:42.200]   Well, you know, so some people sous vide hamburgers, but then you have to like char it on the outside.
[01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:44.280]   Yeah, I have a little torch for that.
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:47.760]   There's a torch for that.
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:49.240]   So now the chat room says I'm wrong.
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:52.840]   You can look into the Burger King and see the flames.
[01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:53.840]   Yeah, it's there.
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:54.840]   That's right.
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:57.160]   They just, they just might do it an hour beforehand.
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:52:58.920]   Okay.
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:00.600]   And then microwave it later.
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:02.640]   And then they assemble a microwave, yes.
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:04.520]   Burger King cooks his burgers over a flame grill.
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:08.320]   They use a broiler and you load frozen patties onto a tray and shove them in.
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:09.320]   It's a flame grill inside.
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:13.200]   If the broiler messes up, then you have to count the entire load as a waste and cook
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:14.200]   more.
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:15.200]   Okay.
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:19.240]   If you see smoke coming out of the roof, then you know they're cooking.
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:20.240]   True.
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:23.200]   Is it like the hot sign on Krispy Kreebs?
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:25.640]   Because that is awesome.
[01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:30.520]   Or a pope has been elected one or the our show today brought to you.
[01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:31.520]   Are we done?
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:32.520]   Have we done?
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:33.520]   Have we said everything?
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:34.520]   Yes, now we're not wanting to get the impossible burger.
[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:35.520]   We're done.
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:36.520]   Yeah, actually, what?
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:37.520]   Now I'm hungry.
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:40.840]   One of our continuity people, Sarah, is a vegetarian.
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:45.640]   She's all excited about the availability of the Impossible Burger Burger King.
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:47.400]   She's all excited about that.
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:48.400]   Is it out now?
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:49.400]   Are you?
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:50.400]   Not yet.
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:51.400]   No, it's coming.
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:54.760]   They did it in St. Louis and it obviously passed the test so now they're going to roll
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:55.760]   it out.
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:56.760]   But they haven't said where it was.
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:57.760]   Has anybody had?
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:59.240]   Well, you had it, but it was steamed at a white castle.
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:01.480]   Oh, no, I've had impossible burgers before.
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:02.840]   I've had several.
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:04.840]   It depends on how it's prepared.
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:06.320]   It's good if it's prepared correctly.
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.320]   It's got to be rare.
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:12.040]   Well, no, it just has to not be cooked.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:14.960]   It goes from good to overcooked really fast.
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:15.960]   Got it.
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:16.960]   Don't overcook it.
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:17.960]   Okay.
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:21.680]   Our show today brought to you by CapTera.
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:26.960]   If you're in a company and you use software for your company, and I think we all do, but
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:33.120]   we call it line of business software, often that software is old at a date.
[01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:40.160]   You know how you know if you're still required to use Windows 98 at work or Internet Explorer
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:46.640]   8 or Windows Vista or XP, that means that they got that software and nobody kept it
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:47.640]   up to date.
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:48.640]   Nobody's fixed it.
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:51.640]   No, they whoever wrote it's long gone.
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:52.840]   There is a better way.
[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:53.840]   CapTera.
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:55.200]   CapTera is a cell software.
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:02.240]   It helps you find software for your business and almost any business over 700 categories
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:09.840]   of software, CMS, email marketing, IT service, SEO, workflow management, yoga studio management,
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:15.240]   dental office software, whatever it is, it's there and it's not just one or two.
[01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:24.560]   It's every program in that category plus 850,000 reviews, verified reviews by real users, 30,000
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:28.320]   new fresh reviews available every month, 1,000 every day.
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:33.480]   So this is a really vital, exciting place, millions of people use it every month to find
[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:36.520]   modern software for your business.
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:38.480]   Look at all these different programs.
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:40.600]   And what's the user interface couldn't be better.
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:44.960]   So pick a category, construction management software, let's say, or I don't know, pick
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:51.040]   one in a car, there's all sorts of, you can see all the categories, it's just crazy.
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:57.640]   And then once you're in that category, cemetery software, nice choice, Carsten.
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:00.520]   I bet the names are really great.
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:03.760]   Then once you're in there, you're going to get the full selection, but you can narrow
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:05.000]   it down with the filters.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.080]   Like, do you want it on the hard drive or do you want it on the web?
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:16.280]   Do you want to manage, I don't know, what are some of the categories, cemetery software?
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:17.720]   You can do grave search.
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:18.720]   Grave search?
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:20.720]   Okay.
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:22.200]   Embalming services, anything.
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:28.560]   So you narrow it down, you can create a comparison chart of up to four different programs.
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:31.280]   So you can look at Semify.
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:33.040]   Wow.
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:43.040]   And then you can compare them and Plotbox, Plotbox Cemetery Solutions.
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:44.600]   You know what?
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:47.000]   It's probably, look at it's five stars.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000]   We narrow it down.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.160]   It's a five star.
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:53.560]   So then read the reviews, people who actually use the program.
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:55.920]   Maybe it's the perfect program for you.
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:58.240]   But find out before you buy.
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:03.480]   Now I know you would pay a lot of money for this service, but the best part about Capterra,
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:05.040]   it's free.
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:09.000]   Not freemium, free free, like free forever.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.720]   Capterra believes software makes the world a better place because software can have every
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:18.640]   organization become a more efficient, more effective version of itself.
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:20.040]   This is awesome.
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:21.040]   You know what?
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:22.040]   People love Capterra so much.
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:26.720]   That's why they get 1000 new reviews every single day because people want to share back.
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:30.100]   No matter what kind of software your business needs, Capterra makes it easy to discover
[01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:32.160]   the right solution fast.

[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:49.600]   We thank them for their support and we thank you for supporting us by using that special
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:50.600]   URL.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:59.440]   Capterra software selection simplified.
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:01.640]   Stacy do you have anything to share with us?
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:03.320]   I do sort of.
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:08.840]   This is a little dicey, but I'm doing it because I hate when companies screw this up.
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:15.400]   So with that in mind, I am linking to somebody else's stuff because I have this product,
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:17.400]   but I'm under embargo.
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:19.240]   Oh, but they're not apparently.
[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:22.440]   They shipped the product to pre-order customers already.
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:23.960]   So it's out there.
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:31.160]   So I am not going to show you mine, but Wwise announced last month a $20 Wwise Sense device
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:32.840]   that is a sensor.
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:39.040]   So you can see in the video for this particular blogger who got theirs the sensor.
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:42.760]   It is a motion and open closed sensor.
[01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:48.880]   So they have two different kinds of sensors or is it 20 bucks?
[01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:53.000]   It's 20 bucks for a sensor that does open close motion.
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.160]   I think it's open close motion.
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:56.160]   No, no, no.
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:57.800]   You get a wireless bridge.
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:01.560]   You have to have the Wwise Cam, which we love.
[01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:06.000]   And that will communicate with a motion sensor and two contact sensor pairs.
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.360]   So you'd have to buy the for under $50.
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:09.760]   You have to buy the bundle.
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:10.760]   Oh, sorry.
[01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:11.760]   Sorry.
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:12.760]   Yes.
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:13.760]   The bundle.
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:14.760]   I have that's a heck of a deal.
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:18.800]   That's a heck of a deal as usual with Wwise.
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:21.160]   I cannot show you mine.
[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:24.840]   I cannot tell you my experience with it yet.
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:25.840]   Next week, I won't be here.
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:30.240]   So I don't know if you want me just to record something and send it to you or what, but
[01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:31.240]   that is.
[01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:32.240]   Thank you.
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:35.960]   Our audience is hugely interested because we've been talking about these Wwise cams.
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:36.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:37.960]   Those are awesome.
[01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:38.960]   And then this is a hand cam.
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:39.960]   They're so affordable.
[01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:43.640]   They've really kind of set everybody on their ear because they don't have monthly subscriptions.
[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:45.880]   They really work.
[01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:47.080]   It's a great little company.
[01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:49.000]   Are they in Seattle?
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.200]   They are based in Seattle.
[01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:52.520]   They're former Amazon people.
[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:57.920]   And the, I mean, this basically is a $50 home security kit with two open closed sensors
[01:59:57.920 --> 01:59:59.320]   and then a motion sensor.
[01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:00.320]   Holy cow.
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:02.720]   And they're very petite.
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:05.080]   As you can see in the camera, I mean, the cameras petite.
[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:06.640]   The sensors are much.
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:08.280]   I mean, there's the camera.
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:09.280]   Here's the video.
[02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:13.320]   Here's Dave Zatz's unboxing and overview video.
[02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:14.320]   So you can see how small it is.
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:15.320]   So that's the camera.
[02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:16.320]   We've all seen that.
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:17.320]   That's the Wwise cam.
[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:18.320]   Yeah.
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:22.920]   And then presumably he'll move over and open the Wwise sensor in a minute.
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:23.920]   There we go.
[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:24.920]   Yeah.
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:25.920]   The sense.
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:27.600]   I mean, yeah, it's look how small that box is.
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:29.800]   That has all three sensors and the brain.
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:30.800]   That's the box.
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:32.520]   That's the holy cow.
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:33.520]   Oh, look out.
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:34.520]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:35.720]   You can't tell from there.
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:36.720]   Yeah.
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:39.560]   So on the right is the sensor for a hue light.
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:41.880]   On the left is Wwise's sensor.
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:43.440]   It's a lot smaller.
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:48.040]   In that sensor, that's the size of a SmartThings motion detection sensor, the Philips Hue,
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:50.760]   just most of the on market devices.
[02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:51.760]   Wow.
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:52.760]   This is so much smaller.
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:53.760]   It's so cute.
[02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:54.760]   Good for you, Wwise.
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:55.760]   Apparently,
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:59.760]   Thank you guys that I bought a Wwise camera and we discovered our cats gender dysphoria.
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:00.760]   Dysphobia.
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:01.760]   Dysphoria.
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:05.600]   Your cat thinks it's a human.
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:08.680]   No, our cat is a girl.
[02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:10.160]   The peas like a boy.
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:11.880]   Oh, that's very common.
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:14.280]   That's just a dominant trait in animals.
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:16.040]   Is that what it is?
[02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:17.040]   What's Stacy said?
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:20.120]   It shoots out past the litter box.
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:24.880]   Well, so we could.
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:25.880]   I don't want to say it all.
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:27.880]   I got a big litter box.
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:31.920]   Put the Wwise camera down there to figure it out.
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:36.160]   It was a unique use of the Wwise cam.
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:37.720]   That is a unique use.
[02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:38.720]   Yeah.
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:41.760]   So in the open close sensors are as small as the motion sensor.
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:42.760]   It's there.
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:43.760]   Here it is.
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:44.760]   It's on the screen.
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:45.760]   That's really cool.
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:46.760]   Wow.
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:48.520]   Who are these guys?
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:50.120]   What's their story?
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:53.400]   So they basically are licensing hardware.
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:57.400]   So this Wwise camera is the same hardware as Elmi's camera.
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:02.080]   So it's basically they're buying Chinese gear and reselling it.
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:03.080]   They're licensing.
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:04.600]   They're OEMing the Chinese gear.
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:08.120]   They're putting their own software platform on it and their business.
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:11.840]   And their business model is basically like Amazon's because that's where they're from
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:17.760]   is to sell a bunch of things at very low profit margins, keeping that super minimal
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:23.560]   to gain market share and start understanding the user and releasing new products.
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:27.380]   Well, it's doing well because according to Zat's the first batch of Wwise sensors,
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:28.760]   it's already sold out.
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:29.760]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:30.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:35.400]   That's a this is these Dave's that's is that's not funny blog.
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:37.120]   Zat Z not funny.
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:38.120]   That's funny.
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:39.120]   That's funny.
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:40.120]   That's not funny.
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:41.120]   Yeah.
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:42.120]   He's Dave is a good guy.
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:45.000]   He's a close friend at Kevin's I think from a long time ago and I've known him for a couple
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.000]   of years.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000]   Yeah.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.800]   Oh, and the key thing for people who like this sort of thing is the Wwise cam, you can
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:54.400]   record everything locally to your your camera.
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:55.400]   Right.
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:59.540]   You can watch it on your phone without a micro SD.
[02:02:59.540 --> 02:03:00.540]   Yes.
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:03.540]   But there's no subscription, which is really awesome.
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:08.500]   There's no subscription and you don't I don't think things have to go to the cloud where
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:10.020]   they don't store it in the cloud.
[02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:11.020]   No, they just go.
[02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:15.700]   No, they do work with Madam a it also works with if they're working on a Google assistant.
[02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:16.700]   Nice.
[02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:22.140]   And they just announced I have to give them a plug for this two factor authentication for
[02:03:22.140 --> 02:03:26.440]   everybody out there who uses the same password again and again and again and again.
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:30.200]   This will help you not get hacked when you do that.
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:39.400]   By the way, the wire cutter recommends the litter robot three open air auto cleaning cat
[02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:40.400]   litter.
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:44.000]   And I think it was scare that was scare the cat.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.160]   No, I thought so too.
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:49.620]   And then we got it cats the cats love it.
[02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:50.620]   And it's amazing.
[02:03:50.620 --> 02:03:57.680]   The problem is the cat is it's an orange cat, which is normally almost always male, but
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:03:58.680]   ours is female.
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:03:59.840]   Yeah, that is unusual.
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:00.840]   Yeah.
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:05.920]   And she will half the time pee like a boy.
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:07.160]   And so it'll spritz.
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:09.920]   It'll cover the whole back of that thing in pee.
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:12.640]   If you don't watch the whole thing all the time.
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:15.040]   Does she spritz when she's in a snit?
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:16.040]   No.
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:17.040]   Oh, it's not.
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:18.040]   It's the worst kind of.
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:19.440]   It's not a schnitty.
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:20.440]   It's not a shrissy.
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:21.440]   Shrissy.
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:22.440]   It's a.
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:23.440]   I'm so sorry.
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:27.180]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:28.180]   Okay, hold on here.
[02:04:28.180 --> 02:04:29.180]   Hold on here.
[02:04:29.180 --> 02:04:38.500]   My number of the week is one two, oh two seven six two is going to blow the minds of
[02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:39.500]   the kids.
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:42.500]   One four seven six two one four one.
[02:04:42.500 --> 02:05:06.020]   It's wrong.
[02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:07.020]   It's wrong.
[02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:09.020]   No, it's right.
[02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:14.020]   Did he say 640?
[02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:15.020]   Okay.
[02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:16.020]   All right.
[02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:19.580]   So it blows kids minds that we used to be able to call a number.
[02:05:19.580 --> 02:05:20.580]   Remember popcorn?
[02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:27.180]   Remember you call popcorn in any in any area code you call P O P C O R N and you get the
[02:05:27.180 --> 02:05:28.740]   time the time lady.
[02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:30.660]   The best I have no idea what you're talking about.
[02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:32.740]   The best was in Massachusetts.
[02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:37.580]   We always we we we would play this trick on people at parties.

[02:05:43.380 --> 02:05:48.780]   They track who's calling them.
[02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:53.740]   So they have audio on this on this post about the crazy things we used to do when we were
[02:05:53.740 --> 02:05:56.580]   kids with the ladies voice who did it.
[02:05:56.580 --> 02:05:58.180]   Do you want to back in the day?

[02:06:55.900 --> 02:06:57.500]   lady, where I guess the popcorn time.
