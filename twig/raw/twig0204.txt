[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.640]   Some new Google features. They're taking one out of Google search.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.880]   Did you ever use the tilde? Do you even know what it's for?
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.320]   We'll also help Jeff decide should he buy Google Glass tonight?
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.440]   It's all next this week in Google.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.600]   Netcast you love from people you trust.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.400]   This is Twig.

[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.840]   That's 99 designs dot com slash twig.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.800]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.840]   And it's the core cast today.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000]   Gina Tarpani from smarter where dot org think up dot com.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.600]   To do text dot com.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.800]   Better really recognized happily berry dot com.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.040]   A little bit legal.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.240]   Betterly recognize the federally recognized Gina Tarpani.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.400]   Great to be here. Very happy today.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.480]   I got my angular shirt on today.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.560]   Oh, I like that. What's that?
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.680]   It's angular is Google's open source model view controller, MVC,
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.520]   JavaScript framework.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.680]   Well, there you go.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.960]   I know that's a mouthful.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.480]   There you go.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.440]   Turns out that it's actually a really great framework.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.360]   So I'm now I've got the company the company shirt on today.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.720]   Were you using the Twitter one?
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.360]   Bootstrap is kind of like a it's like a CSS layout framework.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.040]   Oh, OK, Angular is like is is like a jaxi kind of.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.920]   So they're not incompatible.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.400]   They're not they're not.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.240]   Yeah, Angular is more like jQuery.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.840]   Got it.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.480]   And that's Jeff Jarvis over there.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.680]   The heat of jQuery's.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.440]   JJ query.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.200]   Good to have you from Buzz machine.com and points all over the world.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.280]   Glad to see your back home.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.760]   I'm so glad to be back home.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.520]   I bet you are.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.440]   But you are indeed.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.840]   Well, first of all, congratulations, Gina on the Supreme Court ruling this
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.360]   morning overturning the defensive marriage act by a five to four majority.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.520]   I know that makes you very happy.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.600]   It does it does.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.640]   Thank you very, very very very legal and very legally.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.800]   It is now I can now file joint tracks returns.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.080]   I never thought I'd be this excited about something like that.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.400]   So you ran out and celebrated by buying a.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.160]   H one one one.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.840]   Was we are one exactly.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.360]   I was hoping Google would have like the rainbow edition.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.920]   Oh, a lot of people, everybody was tweeting.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.920]   Oh, look, when you search for gay marriage on Google, you get the rainbow.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.560]   That's an old.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.880]   No, they're for gay pride week.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.360]   Yeah, that's the gay pride week thing.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.600]   They do that every year, every year they've got rainbow.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.240]   It just it was very well timed.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.800]   Very well timed this year.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.680]   And very nice.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.320]   Yeah, you search for Stonewall.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.840]   You get it too. Oh, you do.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.440]   Yeah, if you search for marriage equality, there's a few search terms that you get it.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.920]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.440]   That's really cool.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.640]   And it makes me happy, of course, Jeff went down to the Stonewall.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.920]   It's in the village, right?
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.120]   Yeah, it's a bar down the village in the West Village.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.040]   First Street and there are people out there celebrating.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.360]   It was in 1969 that probably the most important.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.640]   Well, I certainly a first step in gay liberation happened there.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.920]   The sign the sign above says where pride began or pride began.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.600]   So we had talked before, Gina, about whether to get one of these Google
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.400]   experience phones, they're now on sale.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.840]   You won't get it till for a couple of weeks, right?
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.680]   It doesn't mind. It's not going to ship until like July 9th.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.240]   So I've got some time to wait.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.400]   Yeah, we talked about it and you had said that you felt like you what did the
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.240]   Google edition didn't make sense because you missed out on the HDC software that
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.920]   makes some of the hardware run really well, like the Zoe's, like the camera app.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.280]   Right.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.920]   And Brian Clue did another one of his great posts on a non tech where he I guess he
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.600]   got both ahead of time, did a lot of testing.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.080]   And so you don't lose out on a lot of the HDC one camera features.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.040]   OIS, for instance, the optical image stabilization still works.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.360]   And so because it's a HDC one kernel,
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.000]   he said, and the same thing with the Galaxy S4, it's Samsung kernel.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.160]   Lot of the hardware is still supported.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.720]   It's just a UI thing and you don't get what you don't get is the Zoe's highlights,
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.040]   the gallery.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.600]   Right.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.400]   But you also don't get sense, which is maybe a fair trade.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.680]   Yeah, the verge of the nice side by side as well.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.520]   And you know, and it seems like the differences are there, but they're very subtle.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.560]   You still get Beats Audio, which is great.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.200]   Still get Beats Audio that the camera is slightly better in the HDC.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.960]   The battery life is slightly better for the stock edition.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.360]   It seems like the difference is a pretty subtle for me.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.720]   You know, I'm a developer.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.480]   I want getting updates direct from Google is a high priority for me because I always
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.160]   would be kind of on the current version of Android, the current pure version of Android.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.200]   And that's important to me because it's because the Google experience is is Google
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.720]   sort of a reference or what the software is going, you know, their best practices
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.560]   for what the software should be.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.320]   So that's that's really important to me.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.560]   And, you know, I feel like with I know you made a really good case about the camera
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.720]   and I thought long and hard about Zoe's and highlights, but I think with the instant
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.160]   upload to Google+, and the stuff that Google's doing on the Google+ side with.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.720]   It is.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.760]   I don't feel like I'll miss it that much.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.880]   Well, in fact, it doesn't work too well with the instant upload because it uploads
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.520]   way too many images to Google+.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.880]   So it's kind of right killing stuff off all the time.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.720]   Gina, why the HDC versus the Samsung?
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.640]   You know, I'm just going to be honest.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.720]   50 bucks cheaper.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.520]   It's no, it's just pretty.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.080]   It's pretty.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.720]   Better looking.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.920]   It's a lot prettier.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.640]   I just love it.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.440]   If you're running a OSP stock Android, then it really is more the hardware is what
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.560]   you're going to go.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.920]   But isn't there a battery problem with the HTC?
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.800]   Well, it's not removable.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.800]   That's the bad.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.520]   There's two things you lose.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.160]   You lose the SD card, which I think on Android is moot because Android really
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.720]   doesn't support putting much on that SD card.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.240]   Right.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.840]   And two, you lose a removable battery.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.240]   I've had very good results with that snap
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.280]   dragon battery monitor that I told you about last week.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.640]   G.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.960]   Sam is that it?
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.400]   No, it's from G. Sam, you should put on there just so you can see what's going on.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.080]   And then the Qualcomm has a program called the snap dragon battery.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.840]   And put that on there because the snap dragon battery guru watches your
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.560]   behavior for three days and then it's turning off the thing that's a problem,
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.480]   which is background updates.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.200]   So you can put that on the OSP.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.600]   No problem at all.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.400]   Neither one of these require root.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.640]   Although you do you have root out of the box or
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.200]   on, oh, you don't know yet.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.000]   That's a good question.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.640]   Yeah, I don't know yet.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.080]   It's easy.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.680]   It's unlocked.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.080]   So you can.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.840]   Yeah, it's unlocked.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.040]   It's not locked.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:49.160]   Now the Google Google selling the one for 50 bucks less, 600 bucks and it's 32 gigs.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.560]   Whereas you have to buy the 16 gig
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:57.400]   GS four and I'll tell you the GS four, even with an SD card, it's tough.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.480]   Fortunately, the stock
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.400]   the AOSP ROM on the GS four is a lot smaller than Samsung's.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.280]   So you have you have something like 12 gigabytes free.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.800]   But I think 32 gigs, I think you're going to be happy you did that.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.040]   In fact, I filled up 32 gigs.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.920]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.880]   I have a 64.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.880]   Mm-hmm.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.840]   Um.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.080]   I'm excited.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.120]   I think you're going to like it.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.400]   It's a beautiful phone.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.840]   It's going to be a big upgrade for me.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.160]   I'm upgrading from the Galaxy Nexus, which I've cracked the screen.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.920]   Yes, it's time.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.920]   So it's really time.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.200]   I mean, I generally don't buy phones unless I unless I I need a new phone.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.360]   I don't I don't buy every single new phone and I just I just I love the one
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.560]   that I've been in the last few years.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.760]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.680]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.600]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.200]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.200]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.760]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.360]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.160]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.960]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.600]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.400]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.000]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.040]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.040]   I've been in the last few years.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.040]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.600]   I guess it would be a bigger bigger images.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   That's one thing you can't save on an SD card, although you can't on the Google
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.800]   experience phone, apparently, according to Brian Klug, the stock camera doesn't
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   know about SD cards can't save SD cards.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.840]   That's a drag.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.400]   I think you made the right choice, to be honest with the other two.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.680]   I'm waiting to hear the odds.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.120]   So I still have a a note to that I've got a cell that I've never
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.560]   used.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.960]   I bought it on eBay and I'm not using it so I can sell it as I'm used and I messed
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.760]   up the auction once I've got to sell that.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:50.200]   And then because I do get lost for these things, though, I love my Nexus 4 and it's
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.560]   still working, Dandy, but I'm one of the odds we're going to see in Motorola.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.200]   We are going to see a Motorola Google phone and I think we're going to see it in
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:57.800]   a month.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.840]   Yeah, I had to really let kind of let go of that.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.880]   You could sit around and say there's a great new phone right on the horizon forever.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.520]   No, right.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.680]   Yeah, that's going to hurt a little bit.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.000]   I'm sure.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.680]   I get, by the way, much better battery life on the HTC one that I get on the Galaxy
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.080]   S4.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.720]   I don't worry about it on the Galaxy S4 because I have four batteries.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.280]   So I just I'm going to a flight tonight to Denver.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.640]   I'm bringing all four batteries.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.160]   I don't care.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.520]   I'll go through my hotcakes.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.080]   I don't care because I got more.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.960]   Whereas this, you know, it's pretty good.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.960]   If it suddenly dwindled, I would worry on the HD.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.960]   Of course, I carry I carry the extra batteries in my bag, right?
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.920]   Yes, which is the same I bake in at Google I.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.400]   Oh, I was I was using ice.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:43.760]   That's right.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.120]   I got backup backup power.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.480]   But you could you can't oh, you see, I see what you're saying.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.800]   You get the ones that to charge her.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:50.920]   You can always do that.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.640]   I just backed a Kickstarter project, which is like which is a charging brick,
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.800]   which is also a backup thing.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.880]   So like the brick you plug it in and it charges your phone,
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.800]   it also charges itself and then can do a couple of charges.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.200]   I'm hoping that I'll be good.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.920]   Because you know, as much on one hand, I really want the kind of I want the updates.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.520]   I want kind of the developer pure developer experience.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.360]   On the other hand, I kind of want to act like a regular human and I don't want to
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.360]   have the root and and up deal with rhymes and constantly wipe.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.800]   And I just want the the updates to come direct from Google.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.320]   And I also just want to experience, you know, what's it like to just use the phone
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.920]   like a regular person and see, you know, see how I do with the battery.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.600]   But I'm hoping with that the it's flux mob.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.000]   It's called the bolt charger.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.400]   That's a good idea.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.440]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.600]   I'm hoping that that's going to hopefully hopefully I'll actually get it and it'll
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.160]   work.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.600]   So I compromised this is an AT&T HTC one.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:50.080]   I did unlock it through official channels at HTC dev.com.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.360]   And then I rooted it, which wasn't so hard once you've unlocked the bootloader.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.400]   And then I put trick droid.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.800]   There are a number of their HTC sense ROMs.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.440]   They're not AOSP, but therefore it's 422.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.000]   They add some customization, which I kind of like, but it, you know, it has the, you
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   know, the the four point stuff as well, four point two stuff as well.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.800]   And HTC says they will offer the AOSP ROM for people with unlock.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.280]   Now you have to have an unlocked, you know, a factory unlocked HTC one, which I
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.000]   don't because I have the AT&T version.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.880]   But a lot of people will have that choice.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:35.680]   And the HTC solution is dual boot so you can go back and forth.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.560]   Interesting.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.000]   Not to not to make you unhappy.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.040]   Great Leo.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.080]   Let me see if I can get.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:43.880]   No, no, no, no.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.000]   I think you do the right thing.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.880]   You should stick with it, especially as a developer.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.400]   But I love the idea that I could put any ROM on here now and I could put things
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.480]   like titanium backup and stuff.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.520]   Why do you think here's a question for you?
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.200]   You know, Google has traditionally always had one Nexus phone, the developer phone.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.440]   The Nexus four was the last one.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.640]   Now they're going to have at least three.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.560]   They're going to have the Motorola X, the HTC one, the Galaxy S4.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.240]   What is the thinking here?
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.480]   I think there's a difference between the Nexus and the Google Play edition.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.000]   You know, like if you notice, even in the play store, the Nexus is on top, right?
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.840]   So the next four, the Nexus seven, the Nexus 10.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.080]   And then there's a new section that's like, hey, Google Play edition.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.320]   So they unlock the latest and greatest from Google, the best smartphone for you.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.240]   So they're basically saying, hey, these smartphones, yeah, you want choice in phones.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:34.720]   Here they are.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.720]   You get the latest and greatest from Google.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.720]   That's an interesting, it's a good market market.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:44.800]   I mean, aren't the people who buy Google edition phones, the same people who buy Nexus phones?
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.000]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.880]   I would say so.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.080]   Now they have three manufacturers.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.000]   I think it's partly political.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.160]   Everybody's got actors who all have official Google phones and nobody.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.480]   And that's a motor.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.120]   It's going to be the fourth soon enough.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.520]   And that's that's a good point.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.400]   That's a good point.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   And the Moto X is is not going to be an excess.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.280]   I don't know.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.880]   I thought I was always was that Google wants to offer one Google experience phone
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.400]   so that they could just say here it is the pure thing for developers like Jean.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   That's why the Nexus 4 was $300, I think, but also so they could say to the manufacturers.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.600]   Here's what it could look like if you didn't crap it up.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.400]   Right.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.600]   Brian and his review on a non-tech says, and I think he's probably right, that the manufacturers say,
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.600]   well, no, we're making it more appealing for consumers.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.320]   Things like all those Samsung apps, that's what they're selling.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.640]   That's what differentiates them.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.200]   I still say that what they should do is just give us choice.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.920]   They should take some of those apps and make them absolutely download it.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.000]   Only download that phone.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.200]   Yeah, or uninstall them.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:56.840]   Right.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.800]   Either way, if you want.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.280]   And you know, the Nexus remember the Nexus experience too is a hardware spec as well.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.480]   Like the HSC ones buttons are not.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.920]   Yeah, I don't like true Nexus.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.920]   I don't like that.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.120]   I like that I actually love the Galaxy S4 with a physical home button, a menu button.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.400]   Always the same spot, a back button that's always in the same spot.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.560]   I like that.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.120]   Right.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:19.560]   Right.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.280]   But that's not, you know, that's not Google's, you know, ideal vision, right?
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.640]   I think they're wrong though.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.320]   So I'm glad there's choice on that one.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.160]   There's it's good.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.360]   The other Washington I've been having is I love my Nexus 7.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.840]   And I keep going in and looking at the note eight.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.720]   Same size as a small iPad and it's it's just two.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.320]   It's that that inch is too big for the hand.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.680]   Well, they're going to be a number of six inch phones.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.280]   There's the Xperia that Sony just announced, which I'm very intrigued by.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:50.680]   What's that?
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.160]   Six point four inches, right?
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.280]   It's huge.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.240]   And then I the rumor is that there's going to be an HTC one in a six inch form factor.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:58.920]   Right.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.680]   All right.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.880]   One mini or something.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.480]   That would be very attractive.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.520]   I don't know.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.840]   I don't know.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.800]   It's it's a good looking phone.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.520]   I totally just got to do it.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.520]   It's gorgeous.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.040]   And you'll love the front speakers.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.800]   That's how speakers should be.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.840]   I don't know why everybody doesn't do that immediately.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.760]   I wish it had a little higher resolution camera, to be honest, but it's OK.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.760]   It's pretty good.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.680]   You'll be happy with it.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.320]   You got glass.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.440]   You don't need that.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.160]   All right.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.080]   Issue number two.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.880]   Should Jeff buy glass you have till tonight to decide?
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.560]   I got I got the invitation.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.520]   No, I got I just decided to wait for the show to make this is a hot and share minor.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.360]   Should we have a poll?
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.040]   We we could we could.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.440]   So here's here's the issue.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.560]   You agree to be bound by the poll?
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.200]   Be god.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.680]   No, I'm bound by nothing.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.680]   OK.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.120]   The issue is that, of course, it doesn't work with apps.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.760]   That means that on on one of the issues.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:03.320]   So that means that that only my only Gmail thing is my Google Plus because
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.560]   that's where it was grandfather, of course, right?
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.840]   So everything else for me is apps, which means that I'll get no value out of Google.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.200]   Now I'll get no value.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.080]   I'll get out of my calendar.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.160]   I'll get no value out of my real email.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.800]   I'll get no value out of my contacts.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.440]   None of that will be accessible to me on glass.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.880]   And that becomes fairly killer.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.480]   Also, I have to wear a glass on glass.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.160]   So I look dorky enough already.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:38.080]   And it's 1500 bucks, which even though all you know, I'll get the school to buy it.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.760]   And it's good for people to play with and all that.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.400]   I'm just having third thoughts on this.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.240]   What do you think?
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.600]   But then again, the other other hand, I'm on this show.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.520]   I do what I do.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.800]   I've forgot six Jarvis.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.920]   You should know what class does.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.840]   You should be playing with it.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.680]   You should be thinking what news can be with it.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.840]   You could do all kinds of things with it.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.080]   What do you think?
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:04.520]   strawpole.me/136687
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.640]   I thought we were just going to do like a play.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.920]   Well, we can do a poll.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.040]   But that's great. I would just see what happens.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.040]   What's saving the chat room?
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.080]   Strawpole.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.520]   I think that the glass on glass issue is a bigger issue than the apps problem.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.320]   Because I'm like you.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.120]   I split I split my stuff across to Google accounts.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.040]   One is an apps account.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.160]   One is a Gmail account.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.240]   And but I have to tell you the things that I use glass for primarily, which is
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.760]   taking pictures, taking video, uploading those things to Google+, which is which is
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.480]   my general Gmail account, those things all work.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.760]   The Google now stuff works.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.080]   You get you can get navigation.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.040]   You can get the weather.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:47.120]   You can get new now alerts, even just with your vanilla Gmail account.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.080]   The contacts thing is connected to your Google+, so if you're maintaining your Google+
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.080]   circles, you're going to be fine.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.640]   You can do hangouts from glass using your your Gmail and vanilla Gmail account
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.240]   because it's all via plus.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.840]   It's a bummer to not get your email.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.480]   I have to say, I don't I don't get my email, but honestly, I don't know that I want to read
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.280]   your email on Google now stuff that I want.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.200]   Don't you don't you want those kinds of updates or like course, Google now doesn't
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.960]   work terribly well for me anyway.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.280]   I you know, yeah, but you don't like directions and weather and all that stuff.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.560]   That all that all works, even with your vanilla vanilla Gmail account.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.400]   You know, I use Google voice.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.600]   The one thing, I mean, text messages will work, right?
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.240]   Regardless, because you're you know, you're connected to your phones.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:32.760]   That's going to work.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.680]   And that's what you're going to want.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.520]   You're going to want SMS more than you're going to want email because it's one
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.320]   of those those notification things.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.840]   So I don't know that the apps thing, I don't feel like it's really degraded my
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.040]   experience that much.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.560]   I mean, for you, I think that the taking pictures and taking videos and sharing
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.680]   direct to Google plus is going to be one of the kind of the key features beyond
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.200]   navigation, navigation is a big one.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.840]   And that that stuff all works with, you know, with your regular,
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.440]   your vanilla Gmail account and they're going to support apps eventually.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.360]   You know how it is.
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.880]   There's there's I don't know what the exact reason is, but there's some sort of
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.280]   service privacy issues that that are they're bound up by stricter guidelines
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.280]   with the apps accounts and they are with Gmail accounts, but it'll work eventually.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:17.040]   The glass on last thing that's that that's going to be you might want to go
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:17.640]   and just try them on.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.280]   I mean, the good news you can buy them if you don't like them, you return them.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.120]   You get like 30 days.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:21.960]   You do.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.960]   Yeah, we'll then do it with return period.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.840]   Oh, then do it.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.840]   Yeah, there's a 30 days you'll send it back.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.680]   You don't need it.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.320]   I mean, come on.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.680]   Have you exceeded your 30 days yet, Gina?
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.080]   I think I think I have.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.800]   OK.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.240]   Yeah, I do believe that I didn't consider.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.240]   I guess because you have a baby, you didn't consider.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:44.880]   Yeah, no, I I've been I'm still I I'm not wearing glass every single day,
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.880]   but it is kind of Jason and I were talking about this last night and all about
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.240]   Android.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.360]   It is kind of a weekend thing like I'm going out and about and we'll take some
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.760]   pictures and yeah, with the baby, I've been getting great video of the baby feeding
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.080]   the baby and just holding the baby that I wouldn't get otherwise.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.880]   So it's worth it for me to hold on to it.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.680]   And I'm also just kind of interested in in the glass where sort of at market and how
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.960]   that's going to evolve and so I enjoy trying new apps and things like that.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.160]   So yeah, holding on to it for me is
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.800]   just a return period.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.640]   There is a return period.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.440]   You understand, Jeff, you could get a brand new pixel for that price.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.920]   You'd have to then.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.760]   I mean, people are saying where are their nose coming from?
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.360]   By the way, it is it is about two to one, yes, on our straw poll.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.880]   But the nose come from the cost, I think that's a lot of money.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.800]   It's a lot of money.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.880]   I mean, that's what I would give me.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.160]   I would wait for the next edition.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:39.800]   Right.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.640]   The not the beyond the question professor, Owen Youngman went and got them and he
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.400]   wore them at graduation and all kinds of stuff.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.480]   And he's doing a course about Google.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.520]   So he's talked to me and so he kind of needed to have it and he rubbed it in that he
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.880]   got a week before I did.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.440]   So that's the main thing is as as
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.960]   journal, Jeff, I have it.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.560]   I think journal, Jeff journal, Jeff should have them at least try them.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.720]   And then we're talking.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.120]   I mean, you wrote a book about Google.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.280]   I think you should have them just because that's part of the ongoing conversation
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.680]   about Google.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.760]   And I had to say the customer service is great.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.000]   I've had glass, my glass person call and to ask, you know, how are things going?
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.880]   Yeah, I raised this question on Twitter and somebody from glass came on Twitter
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.080]   and said, we talk.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.360]   So that was that was impressive.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.160]   That's rare.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.040]   The customer service is very good.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.720]   I got the worst of both worlds.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.760]   I spent the money and didn't get glass.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.600]   Get glass.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.480]   Because you're amazing.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.040]   Jason is getting some amazing photos of his songs.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.560]   The worst of both worlds.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:47.480]   Speaking of the pixel and speaking of apps, I'm just going to jump ahead to one story.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.360]   They released this new app
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.440]   so that you can pixel only so that you can just put a photo card in and it will
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.840]   upload everything directly to plus.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.440]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.320]   Sign into your browser, it says, OK, my machine is all set up with, of course,
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:10.560]   my apps account and it will not let me use the account that is tied to plus.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.040]   Really, you you you you ranted about this on Google plus and I agree with you.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.480]   This is this is ridiculous now.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.880]   At this point, it's ridiculous.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.480]   It really is. It really, truly is.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.040]   And I know that somebody said, I'm going to unfollow you because you ran about this.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.280]   Fine. I'm going to rant anyway.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.720]   No, I can't.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.880]   I don't understand it.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.320]   It can't possibly be that difficult.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:38.600]   No, they're treating the paying customers as second class citizens of apps.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.200]   There's I have there's anybody giving you a credible reason why they have
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.040]   emerged at the world. No, they said two things.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.040]   They always say it's more complicated than you know.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.120]   I would love to sit down with the whiteboard and figure that out with them.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.560]   And because, hey, you're Google, you go to the friggin moon and right.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.600]   We can figure out the privacy policy.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.920]   Yeah, they said, well, but it's a lot better than it used to be.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.760]   And when I was with a bunch of media people and bloggers with them, we all said to them, no,
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.320]   it's not.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.280]   No, it's not better than it used to be.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.320]   It's not. It's still a problem.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.880]   We all beat them up about all the things we lose.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.920]   And I say to Google, you think I'm two people.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.400]   You want to know that I'm one person that'll give me better services
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.760]   because they're also gives you a hell of a lot more value because you can't target
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.040]   to me as one person.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.160]   You want to know I'm one person.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.840]   All you want to do is to say this person is the same as this person and let me
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.400]   merge some things.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.520]   I understand in some cases something has to win.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.080]   You probably have to have one calendar.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.120]   You probably have to have
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.240]   one male being the dominant male.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.200]   I'm OK with that.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.680]   But let me choose what works with what and let me merge those identities.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.280]   Good for you, Google. I don't get it.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.360]   I don't either.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.920]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.320]   Sorry, man. I end of rant.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.800]   I had a pixel moment that I thought you'd appreciate.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.160]   I hadn't really played with the pixel very much since Google I.O.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.240]   Not for any other reason.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.640]   I just been busy and habit of using my MacBook Pro.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:09.600]   But my wife wanted to start using Evernote and can't install stuff on our
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.440]   computer. So I go, why don't we'll just give you the pixel?
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.280]   So I pull out the pixel and I'm like, hey, sign in.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.840]   I was I was getting her set up and I was like, wow, this is this is a really nice
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.440]   machine.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.880]   I was like, so are you going to give me so I can have that computer?
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.160]   And I was kind of like, this is really nice.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.880]   It's not so bad, is it?
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.960]   And I can't believe it.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.880]   You're not going to give it to me.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.400]   I was like, well, you know, we'll share it.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.160]   We'll share it.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.360]   We'll just be here in the living room.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.040]   The keyboard is butter.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.400]   The screen is magnificent.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.280]   I still love it.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.200]   It's beautiful.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.600]   It's a great machine.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.000]   And I was like, oh, the Konami code is she's like, the what?
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.320]   And I made the light of bar go and it was very impressive.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.760]   But yeah, I had I had this moment.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.680]   I was like, this is a really nice computer.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.840]   I have to figure out how to work this into my into my routine.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.200]   And it helps to that.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.920]   Well, actually two things.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:01.240]   One Leo, I had something going on where some sites actually are sluggish
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:01.960]   scrolling now.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.080]   I thought, OK, all right, I'll admit it.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.080]   I'm just going to just build.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.280]   But but then I had I had an issue where I was doing partial screen grabs.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.600]   And suddenly it was like 20 pixels off and I couldn't figure it out.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.960]   I went on on to the Chromebook Pixel user group.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.880]   And I said this, I also see Steve Rick Byers, who's a wonderful pixel guy out of Canada.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:26.320]   And Bingo, you know, we get the answer from them that it was I had read on the
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:32.600]   screen size down and I've used the the the placements and in build 29 is fixed.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.800]   But he explained what to do.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.400]   And so it's also because I can people will watch what I say because I'm on the show.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:43.400]   But I can get service on the machine in a way that, you know, beats Dell.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.000]   How many blog posts to take before Dell
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.680]   Dell responded?
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.560]   But Dell's gotten better.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.480]   I don't want to say anything.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.920]   I think this was quite nice.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.480]   But it's just not a practical product for any normal human.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.720]   But it's a lovely little.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:02.960]   But if you're freak like me, well, it's just it's it's so expensive.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.520]   I wish they would make a kind of more moderate choice crumb book.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.880]   Yeah, there's some controversy because I think the five hundred fifty dollar one,
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.600]   the Samsung one, I think is going off the market.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.400]   So you only have high end and low end.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.080]   You have middle.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.200]   Yeah, they need something in the middle.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.280]   They need it. They didn't in the middle end.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.240]   Yes. Yeah.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.480]   They also need I think what will happen next is they get the new power
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.280]   efficiencies.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.280]   What do you did?
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:29.760]   We talk about the LA school district buying iPads.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.360]   Yeah, we did.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.000]   That's right.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.280]   Yeah, because it was this whole back.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.560]   The fact I tweet tweet storm went on all around.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.280]   That's right.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.800]   I won't bring it up again then.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.360]   I won't bring it up again.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.120]   The funny thing is that out there, the kids get very upset when we get mad at each
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.320]   other.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.480]   The kids, I can tell you the kids in the LA public schools would rather have iPads
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.240]   than Chromebooks.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.520]   I know that the teachers might want them to have Chromebooks.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.880]   I don't know.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.160]   It's kind of great when I see on there there's a Chromebook
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:04.200]   education group on Google+, and they all get they all get their shipments in
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:09.160]   and you see a picture of a thousand Samsung pixels stacked up.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.880]   This Samsung Chromebooks stacked up, but it's really kind of cool.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:18.360]   Let's take a break.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.080]   Well, here's another picture from the Stonewall.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.240]   Look at that.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.680]   Jeff, you put it on the call.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.440]   All right, nice.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.240]   Just think of how great these would be if they were through glass.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   Yeah, think about that.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.640]   Well, I was thinking about that just now.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.360]   Yeah, I took out.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.520]   I shot with both my phone and my camera.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.520]   I've had the weirdest thing.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:44.080]   I take pictures with my camera with my Nexus 4 on either sell or on, you know,
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.480]   Starbucks shared kind of Wi-Fi.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.160]   It will not send the tweets in.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:47.720]   Really?
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.800]   It's just too big.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.600]   Well, I got home.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.080]   I can send them in.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.440]   And then it uploads them.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.560]   Yeah, I think that's I think that's the they may even be blocking it.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.360]   I have to say that that is one of the things to to me, Google+, is finally gone
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.840]   over the top with the camera uploads.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.400]   That's fabulous communities.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.360]   Firepost.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.560]   Yeah, I'm this close to deleting Facebook.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.960]   I really wanted to leave Facebook.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.600]   I've taken it off my phones because it is also a battery drain.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.440]   And that's one good thing.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:22.120]   You won't be stuck with Facebook if you don't want it on your HTC GE one.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.480]   I'm going to find a home.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.320]   We thought it was going to be a big deal.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.240]   What a flop.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:31.440]   Oh, that was kids don't even like Facebook anymore.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.160]   You know that, right?
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.160]   It's a Snapchat Snapchat Instagram Instagram.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.560]   Instagram is book though.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.960]   Well, yeah, I think they still like vine better.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.960]   It's hard to know what to do those extra nine seconds.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:52.920]   You saw Jimmy Fallon had a great bit where they would do a classic vine video,
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.480]   but they do it on Instagram and then they then they had like nine seconds and
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.280]   they just got to stand around.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.440]   I don't know what I don't know what to do.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.640]   That's so hip.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.040]   So hip, Fallon's hip.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.080]   Our show today brought to you by 99 designs.

[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.720]   There's a movement among graphic designers.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:30.720]   Some people say you shouldn't do specs, but I think if you're a big hot shot,
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.240]   you don't need to, but it's like telling an actor, you shouldn't have to audition.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.560]   You know what?
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.040]   Welcome to the real world.

[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.200]   We have a special number for twig listeners.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:48.600]   That's 800-513-1678-800-513-1678.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:53.240]   Or go to 99designs.com/twig.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:58.600]   99designs is making the world a more beautiful place, one design at a time.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.280]   99designs.com/twig.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.800]   We're so glad to be working with them.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:09.160]   And we're going to do a kind of thing.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.400]   Game kind of thing.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.880]   Not a twit player app.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.680]   There's great ones. We don't need to do anything there.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.200]   We thought we'd do a game.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.640]   That would be a very Twitter thing to do to
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.040]   screw the developers and do your own.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.640]   I'm not doing it. No, exactly.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.640]   We like our third party developers.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.200]   They're Greg and the gang.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.160]   They do great stuff.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.520]   But we thought, you know, we were so hooked on the Simpsons game.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.680]   We thought we should have a game for twit.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.840]   And you could be in it and you and you and you and you.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.680]   I love it.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.120]   That'd be fun.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.080]   Totally fun.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.600]   I'm very excited about this project.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.960]   I like it. I love the idea.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.040]   Let's get the latest straw poll results.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.120]   Jeff, 6040 by the glasses.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.000]   OK, people that figure that how many votes is that?
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.200]   That's about the hundred bucks each.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.120]   And I got it.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:02.040]   Now we'll just shift this over to indiegogo over there.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:07.720]   All right, we're going to we Lisa just come over and made a suggestion.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.200]   Would it change your mind, Jeff, if we offered to buy them for you?
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.480]   Oh, no, no, you don't need to do that.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.440]   Thank you very, very much.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.360]   But I can do that.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.360]   Well, we're glad to.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.480]   It's kind of part of why we didn't buy him for Gina, though.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.400]   We'd have to give her a check.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.360]   No, you're not.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.560]   That's very good.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.040]   She says, she says, Mary Christmas.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.880]   In June.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.400]   In June of all things.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.600]   Right to me.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.400]   I think the thing that put me over is that you have 30 days to change your mind.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.760]   Yeah, that way you can play with it.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.640]   You can have a great time.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.960]   It's a very leo way to look at things.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.160]   Yeah, that's as long as you use anything.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.880]   30 days is a lifetime.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:44.280]   If I could send every gadget back after 30 days, I wouldn't buy anything.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.360]   Well, that's not.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:45.680]   Verify that.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:46.160]   Verify that.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.720]   Here's a business I want.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.280]   I want the business that I think about this a couple of years ago.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:57.440]   I even try to suggest it to Best Buy where it's the early adopters club.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.800]   Where you can get something as soon as it comes out and use it for like a month
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.200]   and you pay a portion of the value based on how much it loses it goes on.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.760]   Or you can decide, no, I don't want to be first.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.960]   I want to be third.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.240]   I want to just try it.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.440]   You know, like the note to I didn't care about being first, but eventually I want to play with one for a while.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.520]   And it's kind of a rental club based on when you get it in the sequence.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.080]   I think people do that.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.440]   Yeah, I think there are companies that do that.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.400]   There are a lot of companies that will buy their stuff back from you.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.560]   Who does that?
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.760]   That sounds familiar.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.920]   But, you know, I mean, that's a great idea.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.880]   Best Buy should do that.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.560]   They should.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.800]   But yeah, there has to be a brisk market and use devices.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.440]   They're done.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.280]   But I think there is.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.360]   I mean, if you look at eBay, amazes me.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.440]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.240]   And I sold.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.600]   I actually got stuff.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.600]   Well, that's how Gazelle works, by the way.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.440]   Gazelle has a eBay portal.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.640]   Right, but Gazelle will only buy certain of the hottest things.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.880]   I had some like old Nokia phones.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.040]   There's no market for this thing.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.200]   Sure enough, you know, I'd sell them for 80 bucks or something like that on eBay.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.240]   Well, that is the argument against glass, by the way, is that it's non transferable.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:03.840]   Yes.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.520]   So you can't in three months say, yeah, I'm done with it.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.840]   I've reviewed it.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.360]   Well, I can really ask you about that.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.840]   What does it mean to be non transferable in terms of me having, you know, students or
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.240]   colleagues being able to use them at school?
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.760]   That's the thing.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.040]   That's that would be the problem.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.160]   So you're when you go pick up your glass or when you when you purchase it, your account
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.080]   gets whitelisted.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.240]   And from what I understand, that's it.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.360]   Your account is linked to glass.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.760]   So a lot of the glass administration that you do you do in the web browser on your
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.880]   desktop, like logged into your Google account, there's a guest mode on glass.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.160]   You see, you can set it in a guest mode if you want to let other people try it,
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.560]   you know, without getting your, you know, text messages or seeing personal
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.760]   information, but it's a kind of a limited thing.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.520]   You can't someone else can't attach their Google account.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.280]   So this is, you know, another journal friend of mine was like, was having this
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.840]   problem, you know, the publication wanted him to, you know, drop it off the office and
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:53.880]   let everybody try it.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.680]   And it was like, no, you get whitelisted.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.480]   Your account gets whitelisted and it's very heavily linked to your account,
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.320]   all your contacts and your circles and things.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.760]   Can't you give glass away?
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.760]   Didn't they say you could give it away?
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.160]   Is there a way to transfer it out of your account?
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.360]   That's a good question.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.440]   We talked about this at one point.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.440]   I thought there was a way to gift it.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.120]   I think they said you could gift it.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.840]   So you never registered Leo.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:21.600]   Oh, you can gift it, but only before, but it has to be right away.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.040]   Couldn't be after once you've hosted a total account.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.600]   What? I don't know.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.680]   Is that? Well, how did you do it?
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.680]   It wasn't mine.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.280]   It was Jason.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.480]   Jason had signed it.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.480]   They weren't in the way.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.520]   In fact, they wouldn't even let me pay for it with my credit card.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.240]   We had to reimburse them.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:40.560]   That's right. That's right.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.600]   I feel the need for trumpets.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.160]   One more thing.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.920]   Somebody suggested I think is a great idea
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.240]   that we do one show.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.680]   We do it as a normal show, but we post a hangout of from Glass's point of view.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.080]   So when you get your glass, Jeff,
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:04.320]   you two wear yours, I'll borrow Jason's and we'll do a hangout with the three points of view.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.760]   Can we do that, right?
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.960]   Yeah, we can totally do that.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.760]   It's going to be you're just going to see the other side of the studio
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.600]   for me, you're going to be looking out my window and out my screen.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:17.760]   You know, I mean, we'll do the show as normal, but with it'll be an extra feed.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.760]   Yeah. Right.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.760]   Let's see here.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.040]   I don't know if you can see it.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.520]   I have a cicada being eaten by a spider out here.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.440]   That's drama.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.840]   That's good. That's good TV.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.560]   Well, here's a funny.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:34.160]   Someone I know is going to run for mayor of a certain major city in America.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.200]   And it'll become out soon.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.480]   And so I was talking with him today.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:39.680]   I was a tech guy.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.440]   And so I was saying, well, at some point, I was pushing to make videos, videos, videos
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.800]   when people need to know who you are.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.480]   They need to hear from you.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:48.400]   I also talked about maybe make some with class.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.880]   And at first, it's appealing.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:54.760]   But then immediately a politician doesn't want to have a picture of himself with class.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.080]   It's like, oh, you're the robo candidate.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.000]   Yeah, that's actually a good point.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.480]   Yeah, I wouldn't vote for a guy wearing that stuff.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.680]   Aside from.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.280]   Something wrong with it.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.280]   He's watching you.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.200]   Right.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.200]   Now I'm thinking about who this could be.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.160]   I think I know who it must be, but I don't know.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.360]   That's interesting.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:22.480]   We'll find out when I've been researching the glass question under the terms of
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.600]   sales, says you have reselling gifts.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.480]   You may not commercially resell your device, but you may give the device as a gift
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:36.520]   unless otherwise set forth by the device specific addendum receipts of gifts may
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.800]   need to open and maintain a Google wallet account in order to receive support from
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.160]   Google.
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.800]   These terms will also apply to any gift receipt.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.280]   And this is under the class.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.560]   Has anybody ever done that?
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.440]   I wonder how hard that is to do.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.640]   And I wonder if the Explorer edition has an addendum because it's such an early
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.240]   prototype.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.720]   I should probably I should probably know that I should look at my like my glass
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.480]   materials, but this is all stuff that you can ask.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.640]   I mean, you have to call to buy it and all sign up tonight then.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.160]   I'll do it.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.440]   Hey, we made the decision for him.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.080]   I probably will be able to pick him up before my next trip.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.480]   I don't think so.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.640]   He's going to get him, but we at least it was in cereal.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:14.640]   We'll pay for your guys glass.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.560]   No, no, I appreciate that.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.280]   Because it is kind of part of your job.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.640]   I mean, it's part of the show.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.800]   I'll have you get a Moto X for me.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.720]   Just a deal.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.520]   We just don't know.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.680]   It's a deal.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:29.360]   I'll ask guy when I see him.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.320]   So when are you when are you doing that?
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.000]   July 10th.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:33.720]   July 10th.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:34.760]   I haven't been in.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.360]   I mean, I didn't say, hey, keep this under your hat or anything.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.120]   What what's this?
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:44.240]   So a guy Kawasaki, as you know, is now working at Motorola.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.120]   Set me an email.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.440]   Say we'd really like you to come down to the Google campus for an event.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.840]   Small group of journalists, 50 people in July.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.640]   There's two groups July 10th and July 11th.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.480]   Can you do it?
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.720]   I said, well, I have to move stuff around.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.120]   He said, we'd really like you to do it.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:03.000]   I said, OK, I'm thinking it's the phone, but I don't know.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.640]   Could just be, you know, a meet and greet.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.680]   I mean, it could be just some silly thing.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.640]   But guy knows me.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:11.040]   Guy knows I do not do these things at all.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.200]   So.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.440]   So the 10th is actually Twig Day.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.920]   That's a Wednesday.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.480]   Are you in the 10th or the 10th?
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.840]   Evening of the 10th.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.120]   Oh, it's evening of the 10th.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.400]   So it'll be right after the show.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.560]   Yeah, run out of here.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:29.200]   I think I'm skipping a triangulation that day or something like that.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.600]   Huh?
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.800]   It's a prerecorded show.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.920]   So just run out the door.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.560]   I don't know.
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.960]   I could be completely wrong.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.640]   And I hope I'm not reaching a confidence, but I didn't say,
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.640]   "Hey, keep this under your hat or anything."
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.960]   So I don't think I am.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.920]   You'll find out.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.520]   Time to play some trumpets.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.120]   Chad, are you ready with the trumpeters?
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.080]   Are they all in the line?
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.840]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's time.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:56.440]   Well, I'll let your announcer tell you.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:00.520]   The Google change log.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.160]   Ha ha. What's new at Google?
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.640]   Let's ask Gina Trapani.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:11.320]   A new Google Groups interface revamp is available to everyone.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.160]   They've been testing this for for quite some time.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.080]   Google Groups, if you don't know, if you don't use it, it is one of their kind
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:23.280]   of undersung products is kind of an email list product that lets you put together
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.200]   groups of content contacts and have conversations.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.200]   And it's got new revamp management features, moderation tools,
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.200]   or mobile site. I'm really, really happy about this.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.360]   I run several of my open source projects using Google Groups.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.080]   And I've been testing the new interface for quite some time.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.720]   And it's quite good.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.720]   It's really good for support situations.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.960]   I feel like users you have to support.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:48.920]   You can they have this new inbox feature where you can say you can assign an email
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.000]   to another member of the group like, "Hey, can you please respond to this?"
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.640]   Which is really nice for customer service type things.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.840]   So that's available to all now.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.120]   Let's see. What else?
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.440]   New Street View images from the tallest
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:08.080]   world's tallest manmade structure, which is a skyscraper in Dubai.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:08.480]   Yes.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.000]   The Verge Khalifa.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.640]   I hope I am pronouncing that correctly.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.320]   You know you are.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:16.600]   Yeah. First ever Street View collection of images from the Arab world.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.560]   And this is the this building is described as the vertical city.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:26.040]   World's tallest manmade structure towering over the Dubai skyline at two thousand
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.840]   hundred and seventeen feet. I'm not going in.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:29.920]   I'm not even going.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.840]   I'm not looking at that.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.920]   It wasn't open when I was in Dubai.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.640]   I really wanted to go up there, but it wasn't open yet.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.520]   Oh, I want to see some of these images.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.120]   Yeah, very nice.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:44.200]   So they sent up they sent up some Googlers with the old camera backpack.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.920]   And got some some images.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.520]   And nothing looks heavy.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.280]   It does.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.040]   While you're there, if you go up in the rundown, just a little bit up there.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.600]   Also, same thing they're doing.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.720]   A couple of those islands.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.000]   Oh, neat.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.360]   Maybe that's a place that only a very few people can go.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.000]   It's highly protected.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.760]   Blue flitted booby.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.200]   There it is.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.680]   No, that's not the blue.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.880]   That's not the blue.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:11.040]   But yeah, apparently they put Googlers out outside the building.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.920]   And you really does that scare you?
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.000]   She doesn't look like it's that heavy.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.120]   She looks like she could carry that pretty well.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.400]   Yeah, she looks like she looks.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.960]   Oh, I don't want to do that.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.640]   So window cleaners usually only get this view, but now everybody can and
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.160]   speak view.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.480]   That's pretty damn cool.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.480]   Yeah, wow.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:28.840]   Wow, look at that.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.280]   Oh, it's crazy.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.880]   Yeah, this is the this is the answer.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:37.200]   Jeff, look at these three view images would even just go into into the images
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.840]   and go out now.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.240]   No, really?
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.160]   Yeah, you don't like heights.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.400]   I hate heights.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.760]   Oh, I thought it was bridges.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.640]   It's heights.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.200]   It's it's vertical things.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.880]   Yeah, it's the cliff effect.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.720]   Things you could fall off of.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.000]   Yeah, playing OK.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.360]   Playing OK, that's good.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.160]   What else we got?
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.200]   Oh, Google dropped a search operator, which I'm sure you have never used the tilde.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.920]   I don't know if you if you knew you could do this, but you do it.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:09.280]   Tilda, you could use it to tell to get synonyms, right?
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:14.360]   You could do like tilde muffin and it would be like cupcake and other related
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.640]   terms for synonyms.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.720]   That sounds very useful.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.280]   Yeah, now I know existed.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.720]   I want to use it.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.800]   You know, it was really useful and I knew about it.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:28.840]   I just I didn't use it very much because I just, you know, when I have to look up a
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.080]   word, I usually just go to the dictionary.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.600]   There's not often that I'm looking for.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:35.120]   Well, the reason because Google will do that for you, it just automatically looks
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.720]   the synonyms.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.480]   Again, I mean, yeah, kind of I feel like if you do a Google search, you will get
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.960]   pages that that have similar terms related terms.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.040]   That just makes more sense.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.360]   I shouldn't really expect users to remember to use the tilde.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.440]   But yeah, Google confirmed that this was dropped.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.360]   The feature was dropped due to lack of use.
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.480]   That's a little little spring, spring cleaning.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:59.720]   And I really liked that they Google actually gave a statement to, let's see.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.480]   This is search engine land saying, yeah, we've deprecated this.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:05.320]   Two few people were using it to make it worth it, maintain.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:09.120]   And I happen to agree with this one, maintaining all these synonyms takes real
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:13.840]   time and costs us real money and supporting operator increases the complexity of
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.480]   code, dropping support, free, apple, a bunch of resources.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:20.440]   I love that they were just so kind of forthright and transparent about this.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:25.280]   I wish that they had given more of an explanation about Google Reader as clear
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.080]   and straightforward an explanation about Google Reader as they did about the tilde.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.400]   Of course, the tilde, a lot less controversial than Google Reader.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:37.360]   Did they say that the synonyms had to be done by hand by humans?
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.000]   They didn't.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.520]   They just said that they did.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:44.520]   There's a lot of code that made made synonyms go.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.240]   Synonyms go.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:49.040]   They didn't say that humans did it, but it does sound like it was it cost them
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.960]   money and CPU cycles to maintain one more of the more difficult computational
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.680]   tasks, I would think, synonyms.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:01.520]   I guess Google now for Android got an update with a couple of new features.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:06.440]   If your phone is on the same network as your smart TV, you can get information
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:08.000]   on live TV.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:08.600]   That's on.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:09.800]   I haven't had a chance to try this out.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.240]   It knows what you're watching because the TV reports to it.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.080]   Right.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:13.560]   Exactly.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.360]   That's so weird.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.800]   So it'll give you give you information about what's on TV.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.640]   It's a nice second screen prompt.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.320]   There's third party music client support now.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:27.040]   So there's a Google voice action where you can say something like play Michael Jackson.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.120]   And now with this new update, you can choose what app plays the music back.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.440]   So I tried that before.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.040]   Could you?
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.880]   I thought that it just supported plain music.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:40.040]   But choose what client you want to play.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.280]   And my choices, I don't have a lot of music players on my phone installed, but
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.200]   it gave me the choice to play music, Google Play, YouTube or Pandora.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.080]   It's kind of nice.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.240]   Nice to have the choice.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.600]   So I said play Michael Jackson.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.560]   You could move it down.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:53.680]   And it's a.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.200]   And it says, are you sure?
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.360]   Are you really?
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:01.360]   No music found.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:03.640]   So did you have you gotten the?
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:04.800]   I must have assigned it.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.920]   I should see if I have a default action on that.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.160]   Yeah, you might have assigned it.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.520]   The action taking the voice action.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:14.520]   I actually just there's the note to self voice action, which goes to Google Keep.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.760]   And here it is.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.680]   There's a drop down.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.160]   You can choose a drop down.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:18.920]   I see.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:19.880]   I see.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.560]   Choose what client you want to use.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.200]   So what choices do you have a big menu there?
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.920]   Yeah, well, I had I had my built in music player and there is no Michael Jackson
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.720]   on the phone, but now I can make it play music.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:34.440]   I could search SoundCloud, YouTube, Spotify or Tune in radio, Pro.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.680]   And presumably install other capable apps that would add those to the list.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.880]   That's one of the best things about Android, frankly.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.200]   I totally agree.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.760]   We just added for the view text.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.160]   We just added note to self capability and it was like a few lines of code.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:51.040]   So if you say note to self, you know, pick up the milk, you can now say, hey,
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.320]   used to do text to handle this in addition to Google Keep or something else.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.720]   And it was incredible how easy someone sent me a pull request.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.640]   One of my developers, it was like five lines of code.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.640]   It was crazy.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.120]   Great, great thing about Android.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.800]   Now, the funny thing is it is playing something,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.240]   it's fan letters to Michael Jackson by a Canadian group called the Ria Statics.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.960]   That's related.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.200]   It's close.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.600]   I guess it's because I own that.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.480]   So it preferred that over something I don't own.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.040]   Why do you own that?
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.560]   But you know, with all access and play music, right?
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:28.000]   In the play store, you really can have it just play play anything.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:28.400]   Right.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:32.200]   If you're paying for that, I have to do that with Spotify.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.240]   You know, maybe that was the Samsung voice app, not the Google voice app.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.480]   But I would say, well, what do you want me to?
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.680]   The first time you say play Michael Jackson, say, well, what do you want me to play it with?
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.920]   And it would remember that from then on.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.320]   But that must have been the Samsung voice.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.160]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.520]   And yeah, that's it.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:55.480]   Oh, and last thing in Google now on this Google now update location aware Google offers.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.920]   So it begins.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.200]   Yes.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.720]   So how is that going to work?
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.760]   Advertising begins.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.280]   You know, I haven't seen it yet.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.320]   I haven't been out and about with this updated version yet.
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:08.040]   So I'm not exactly sure how it's going to work.
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.720]   Although I've been getting prompts in Google Maps.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:14.200]   Have you guys been getting this show offers or don't show offers?
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.640]   Yeah, I've been getting some prompts about Google offers.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.680]   So it's phone knows where you are.
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:24.360]   It seems like Google now pop up a card that says, hey, you know, there's a sale
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.920]   going on down the block.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.760]   I kind of imagine that it will work.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:29.680]   I'm looking for screenshots.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.400]   You know, you need pants.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.800]   And you know, you need pants.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.160]   And there's a better deal to your left.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:36.760]   Right.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.400]   Exactly.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:38.800]   Turn left.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.760]   So that's all I got.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:44.240]   The chain log and that's the Google change log.
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.840]   Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.680]   Very cool.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.120]   We mentioned the best of me in the chat and said, what about the bell?
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:56.480]   We mentioned the bell on Google plus the notification bell before.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.680]   But I think now everybody's got it by now, right?
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.160]   Yep.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.360]   I did get it.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:04.440]   Oh, you know, when someone mentioned to me and I think it was a show that I
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:09.680]   miss, I miss a show recently, G mail, you can send money through Gmail now using
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.160]   wallet.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:11.080]   We mentioned that.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:11.960]   You did.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:12.720]   OK, OK, cool.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.760]   Yeah, it was back in May.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.440]   But I was like, what?
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.360]   I was like, well, somebody in the chat was saying this is really true.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:21.680]   It's Google doesn't do a good job of surfacing it.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:25.080]   All these cool things, but that's because they're so damn many of them.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.320]   There's so many of them.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:26.720]   It's true.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.800]   I don't know how you would.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:28.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.440]   I mean, how do I like the tilde?
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.920]   Yeah, like the tilde.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.520]   Exactly.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.080]   Honestly, sometimes I drop stuff because something seems super minor and
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.160]   something's aren't going to roll out for a while and something's only work.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:43.320]   If you're, you know, if you're like the the the Gmail, you have to have a wallet
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:46.400]   account and I may be the person who's sending to us a wallet account.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.840]   So but though that sending money was was a big thing, that's something I would
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:50.520]   definitely mention.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:51.960]   So I think that was a show that I missed.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.320]   But I don't like you guys.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.800]   I have it back.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:55.800]   I don't have it either.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.080]   I just checked my compose.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.720]   I check my compose window.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.080]   I hit that little plus button.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.440]   I can insert use photos and drive.
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:06.280]   I can start photos, emoticons and sort of invitation.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:10.400]   But no, I don't I don't have the money, the dollar sign yet.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.760]   Oh, so I guess it's rolling out slowly.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.680]   Yeah, it must be.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.840]   Oh, well, I go back to what you said earlier about about plus and photos.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:23.520]   I finally took a camera along this time to Europe and and I really use more than
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.000]   ever in life than using photos because it's so easy on plus.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.280]   It's it's it finally put me over the top on plus use that all the time now.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:33.880]   And it's makes it so easy to share.
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.600]   It's great to have a backup of all your photos.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.440]   That's exactly.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:41.400]   And for me, because I use two different phones, I have one place where all my
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.600]   pictures are.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.960]   So that's nice too.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:47.360]   Do you need to use a camera with a card?
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:50.000]   I do like an old school.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.680]   So the thing is you can use that you can use that thing now.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.320]   On the pixel, another reason to use your pixel.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:01.040]   It will just upload every single photo and automatically no must know fuss, no
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:01.880]   bother.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.440]   Yeah, I've got I've got an SLR where I take, you know, I take a
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:08.920]   portrait of the baby, you know, on her birthday and stuff and and often the
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.360]   photo is just sort of the language on language on the card until my mom is like,
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.320]   what's the latest photos?
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.840]   And I was like, oh, I got to take out the card and upload.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:19.920]   But yeah, I'm going to try those out that those those do those new apps that
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.920]   just so I have to make sure that my card fits into the slot in the pixel, but I
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.120]   totally work.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:27.720]   Which is really, really nice because transferring into Picasa, then uploading.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:30.480]   It's a it's a whole thing.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.240]   It's a McGillis, we say here in New York.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.520]   It's a McGillis.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:38.440]   I had no idea Jesus H Christ had a
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.640]   Google plus account.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.400]   Really?
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:46.440]   I'll just I'll just reshare this one.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:50.480]   Yeah, he's responding to Governor Mike Huckabee.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:53.920]   Isn't that a pseudonym?
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.280]   Maybe it really is him, though.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.280]   Is it verified?
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.480]   WWG.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:09.000]   This is so a terms of you as violation, by the way.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.080]   Not going to complain.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.080]   Yeah, you just busted Jesus, Leo.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.280]   I got Jesus in trouble.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.280]   You think I did?
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.480]   Maybe that could be a guy's name.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:21.360]   I got a gardener named Jesus.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:23.480]   Could be a guy's name.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.960]   This is a very pro gay Jesus.
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:28.120]   Yeah, it's a pro gay Jesus.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.320]   Wouldn't he be?
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.800]   We don't know.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.280]   I like the tagline is setting the record street.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:40.600]   Yeah, that account will be gone by tomorrow.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.200]   So here's a question for you.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.080]   It's all the rundown.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.480]   Google mine.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.120]   Do you think that's a parody?
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.080]   Do you think that's real Google what mine?
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:56.400]   I think it's a new product that's in testing that lets you.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:00.440]   Jeff, tell me if I get this wrong, but that lets you inventory your stuff.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:01.680]   Like everything you have.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.160]   Oh, it's mine.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.000]   It's mine.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:04.680]   All mine.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:07.520]   Yeah, it makes this does not make sense to me.
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.880]   This is I don't understand.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.800]   Share your belongings with your friends.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.240]   Keep up to date with your friends are sharing.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:15.160]   It's the share economy, Jeff.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:16.160]   Come on.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.960]   So this is like neighbor goods.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:23.120]   So like I need a lawnmower who's got one I can borrow.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.440]   Maybe it seems like it could enable something like that.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:30.640]   This this reminded me, of course, the Big Bang Theory episode where Sheldon was
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:34.280]   was scanning ever was putting RFID tags and every single piece is like
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:38.800]   a clothing and scanning them and then creating a database of his entire wardrobe
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:42.440]   so that whenever he traveled, he could very easily just print out.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:45.080]   We're seeing that there is a Sheldon t-shirt site.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.800]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.440]   I think it's a very good idea.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.960]   Can't go back a little bit.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:53.880]   Can't log your belongings, track what you have, review your belongings
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.160]   for your friends to see.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.280]   Really, my friends do not want to see what my belongings are.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:06.080]   No control who sees what track conversations send requests to borrow or try out friends stuff.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:10.120]   They killed Google groups for this share stuff you wish for.
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:14.480]   Get recommendations, share stuff you're giving away, find takers.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:17.680]   Follow browse search stuff.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:20.800]   There's also an Android app.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.200]   But you have to be a Google employee.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:25.000]   It's in bizarre. Oh, I see.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.720]   OK, got it.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.560]   Wow.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.760]   This sounds like a 20% project.
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:34.000]   Yeah, 20% project that there may be testing internally.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.840]   I don't know if this is ever going to see the light of day.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.560]   All right.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:37.720]   I could not get it.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.960]   I don't understand it.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.880]   If you had glass, you could take pictures of it.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:45.440]   Well, you could use as an insurance inventory.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.080]   Yeah, but you don't have to share with your friends for that purpose.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.520]   No.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:52.640]   Google would love to know what you own.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.560]   Yeah, that's valid information for them.
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:59.080]   Well, I hear the question telling about, you know, there are times
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:02.200]   and I'm like, oh, do I know anybody that has
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:07.040]   this kind of, you know, gadget or, I don't know, I was, I needed to, you know,
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:11.520]   a tool or something that I mean, there's, it doesn't happen very often.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:16.520]   I guess there's some some value in that being like, you know, can I borrow?
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:17.960]   You know, I don't know how we've gone.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:18.920]   I don't know.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.120]   Here's the problem for me.
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:20.760]   Let's see.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:25.920]   The nearest person I actually know who's on who I actually have an internet life
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:28.320]   with is probably about 30 miles away.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.360]   Mm.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.760]   Right.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:36.800]   Unless they enabled some sort of like, you know,
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:41.640]   mailing stuff, sending stuff, find metric wrenches near you.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:49.120]   So either it's a preternaturally sunny day in the United States today or Google
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:53.320]   has deleted the clouds from its satellite imagery.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:57.760]   And in fact, it's the latter case, another 20% project.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.000]   It is God.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.440]   That, you know, they buy the satellite imagery from Keyhole and, you know, NASA
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.360]   and a lot of other people.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:10.360]   Problem with satellite imagery is it's a dog gone clouds.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:14.160]   There's something ironic about Google deleting the cloud from the cloud.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.480]   Exactly.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:17.160]   Ain't no clouds here.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.160]   But I'm changing.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.080]   Same thing on Google Maps.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.120]   This is from a giz.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:21.480]   I know.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:22.960]   Is this true?
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.600]   Were there clouds before?
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.280]   I guess it's from the Google blog.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.840]   You and the Joni Mitchell, please.
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:32.560]   I've looked at life from both sides now
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.120]   from when and lose.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:38.480]   And still somehow.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:41.200]   It's a lot of illusions.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.840]   I recall.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:46.480]   You know, this is completely official.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.920]   There's a post on the other one.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:52.480]   Here's a central papua in Indonesia before and after.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.280]   Saudi Arabia before.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:57.280]   Well, it's how they really didn't really have a lot of clouds.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:01.480]   It's only clear skies in Googleville.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.840]   Satellite imagery is usually created like a quilt writes the Google blog.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:08.240]   We stitch together imagery of different parts of the world using a
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:11.920]   process similar to how we produce the global time lapse imagery of Earth,
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.120]   which took hundreds of terabytes of data from the US Geological Survey and NASA's
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:18.440]   Landsat seven satellite.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:23.800]   Sometimes dozens of photos of a single spot analyze the photos to compute a clear
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:30.120]   view of every place, even in tropical regions that are always at least partly cloudy.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:36.440]   You are now looking at an 800,000 megapixel image of the world.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:41.040]   Earth or maps when you're zoot out to the global world, the images global view,
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.120]   the images that's kind of look naked.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.880]   Yeah, it's weird looking.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:48.040]   The image is so big, if you wanted to print it at a standard resolution of 300
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:53.840]   dots per inch, you'd need the piece of paper, the size of a city block.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.040]   Wow.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.240]   That's cool.
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.360]   Somebody's got to do that.
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.920]   Some artist has to do that by hand, you think?
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.240]   Or no, they say computationally.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:07.440]   They did it. They did it. The computer says, no, I still see clouds.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.240]   What else you got?
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.760]   Oh, there's clouds there.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.360]   What else you got?
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.240]   I think that's cool.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.040]   Only Google.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.280]   I mean, in order to do the city block.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.440]   Oh, the city block print out.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:23.040]   Yeah, Kristo could wrap up actual city block.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.640]   Yes, it'd be great.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.440]   And there'd be garbage gates all around.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.640]   Come on. Is this true?
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.840]   Google buying Tesla?
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.000]   No, it's it's rank speculation.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.440]   Oh, it's from Bloomberg.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.800]   People speculate.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.120]   Yes, I stuck it on there.
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.040]   I thought it was amazing.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.840]   Yeah, I don't think Tesla's sale.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:43.440]   No, it's true.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.040]   It would cost them 12 billion.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.640]   That's a lot of money.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.240]   Yeah, even for Google.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:51.240]   Yeah, I don't think Elon Musk is looking to sell it.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.640]   I think Steve Jobs might have bought Tesla.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.640]   That I could understand.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.520]   Well, Apple, yeah, Apple cars.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:01.720]   That's a that would have been seems like his right up his alley.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.040]   We feel the cars are just too hard to use.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.920]   So we're putting the accelerator on the left.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.040]   And there's only one button.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.240]   Break accelerator.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.120]   It's all it's all the same.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.320]   So yesterday, you're now going to you want to go right.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.800]   You wave your hand right.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.880]   You're going to go left to wave your head left.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.600]   Oh, God.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.080]   Thank God, Apple doesn't design cars.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.640]   Only rounded corners.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.720]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:35.600]   Let's see what else before we go to our picks of the week here.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.480]   I've got a question for you on the NSA story.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.960]   Yes.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:46.600]   Because I I wrote a piece that I haven't put up yet, but but arguing that the internet companies
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:52.840]   should take the bull by the horns now and have to do everything they can to protect our privacy.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:56.800]   And it's in their light and self interest because people are going to lose faith in the crowd.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.440]   They're in your company.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.560]   And so what do they do?
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:05.960]   Well, we ought to have as we've discussed before, the right to private communication
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:11.600]   guaranteed by law, but of course, only our first class physical mail is guaranteed in that way.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.880]   It's not going to come from Congress.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.880]   It's not going to come from courts.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:14.960]   It's not going to come from telcos.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.400]   So Google and Facebook and Twitter and those folks have to protect us.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.440]   So here's the question.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:24.560]   If what would it take to have
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.040]   end to end encryption?
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:31.200]   If the industry got together and got their act together, a does that help?
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.720]   Be how hard is that?
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.040]   And see what are the unintended consequences of that?
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:41.000]   Does that break Google now because it can't see my boarding passes?
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.080]   It does, doesn't it?
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.680]   If and if it could see your boarding passes, then we wouldn't trust it
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.240]   because that would mean Google could see it, which means they could probably give it to the government.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.960]   So that really I think it would break a lot of things, wouldn't it?
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.800]   Wait, why why would Google's
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.400]   Google being able to see your boarding pass is a function of their products,
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.120]   being able to talk to one another because of their.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.400]   Well, they can read your mail.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.280]   They can read your mail.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.640]   If I may or if I encrypted.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:11.000]   But if I encrypted all my email, they wouldn't have boarding passes for me.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.040]   I see what you're saying.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.640]   So you're not saying encrypting the transmission.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.880]   You're saying, yeah, encrypting the data.
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:15.360]   Well, it has to.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.440]   We'd have to encrypt it in such a way that only you had the key because if Google has the key, well,
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.040]   that is not.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:20.840]   We've seen that.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.480]   We've seen that story before.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:23.120]   Right.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.080]   Right.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.840]   I don't think it's going to happen, Jeff.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.440]   But I and of course, as we know,
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:35.120]   if you use encryption, the NSA just says, we don't care if you're in the US or not.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.480]   You were keeping an eye on you.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:44.800]   And if you use the onion router, the privacy tour, privacy system, same thing.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.320]   We don't know if you're in the US, so we're just going to collect everything you do.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:48.880]   Right.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.840]   And I use both.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.040]   So
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.440]   watching you.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:04:06.360]   Vince surf was in London along with Tim Berners-Lee, Bob Kahn and Lewis Puzat to receive the $1 million inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:13.080]   At Buckingham Palace, there's Tim Berners-Lee getting his ugly award.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.080]   It is a weird looking.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:18.360]   It is a Queen Elizabeth prize.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:24.240]   They asked Tim Berners-Lee about Edward Snowden and the NSA.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.920]   Tim said, the original design of the web 24 years ago was for a universal space.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:32.640]   We didn't have a particular computer in mind or browser or language.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.480]   When you make something universal, it can be used for good things or nasty things.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:41.760]   We just have to make sure it's not undercut by any large companies or
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.720]   governments trying to use it and get total control.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.840]   Right on.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:48.520]   Right on.
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:48.920]   Well said.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:49.400]   The internet.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.720]   Right on.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.320]   He's a guy invented the world wide web.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:05:00.560]   So Android nation store, I want one of those.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.280]   What is that?
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.720]   You can buy a nation in Android.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:06.840]   What in India, they're starting stores just to pump Android.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.760]   Oh.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.320]   Like physical stores?
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:10.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.520]   Rick and mortar stores.
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.520]   Rick and mortar stores called Android Nation.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.760]   Hmm.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.640]   I want that.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:21.920]   Apparently, Google's also subsidizing cell phones.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.800]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.960]   Oh, well, Facebook does this too, right?
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:32.160]   If they subsidize the usage of Google of primary Google apps, so you get that for free.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.280]   Well, that's kind of the opposite of net neutrality.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:39.200]   In fact, we've got all mad at Comcast's other internet service providers who
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:43.560]   proposed not having bandwidth caps on some of their own products.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:46.920]   Oh, that's an interesting question.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.440]   Well, well, wasn't it?
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.240]   Was it for rise?
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.320]   No, I think it was I think was it was for rise.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.280]   It or somebody said, Oh, yeah, we're not going to
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.800]   if you use what was it?
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:58.720]   I'm trying to remember now.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.720]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:03.000]   If you bounced up through like their V store, they wouldn't charge.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:03.760]   It wouldn't charge it.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.800]   It wouldn't go to your bandwidth.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:05.600]   Right.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:10.080]   And everybody got upset that that was anti competitive, that was anti net.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:15.400]   No, but it's but it's really no different from I can I can watch a show
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:20.520]   on Netflix and pay for it or I can watch it on Hulu and and suffer a few ads and
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.200]   I get it for free.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.040]   Right.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.720]   So it's subsidized by that sense.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.800]   I don't know that that's bad.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.560]   I'm just bringing it up.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.240]   I don't know.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.440]   It seems fine.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:37.520]   I mean, if they want to give some free stuff away in India, go for it.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.520]   Who am I to say?
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.520]   I want to see what these stores are going to look like.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.520]   I wanted the Android nation store here.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:43.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.080]   So now it's the best part.
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.120]   Sorry.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.800]   It's the best buy, right?
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.520]   Is the closest I have to it is really turning into a marketing space.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.960]   Yeah, because you have a Samsung store.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:07:01.760]   You have a Windows huge Samsung Apple, Microsoft and Little Google stand.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.800]   You know, they're just trading their space over to marketing space.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.040]   Until they go bankrupt.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:11.160]   Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.160]   It's just one more idea.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:17.480]   Well, you know, when I was in Paris last week
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.720]   for one day, it really struck me.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:27.200]   I wandered around the the Marais and just the number of just great little shops to look at.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:33.040]   I put up a screen, a gallery of just shop windows and it's just phenomenal.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.480]   And we don't have browsing physical browsing in the US anymore.
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.280]   We just don't.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:37.840]   Oh, I love it.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.040]   I mean, Manhattan and I used to be able to go out.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:40.840]   Really? You can't do that.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.760]   And I thought that was that was the I love you.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:47.400]   So love walking in New York just because it was so fun.
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.440]   You don't really have it.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.440]   I mean, you have some chains stores.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.880]   You have the gap and you have the best buy, but I can't go to record stores anymore.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.160]   I can't go to book stores anymore.
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.200]   It's true.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.280]   There's nothing to wander.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:58.880]   It's true.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:02.120]   I was just thinking the only time I go to Best Buy is when there's very something very
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:06.280]   specific that I need and I always motor directly past all the all the marketing
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.840]   stuff right to the eyes.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:12.240]   It's fries is the only electronic store that I'll really kind of take my time and
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:12.640]   water.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.920]   That's unique, unique to California.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:15.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.440]   The world's right anywhere else.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.640]   I think Amazon.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.320]   That's my fault.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:21.520]   I'm buying everything on Amazon.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.440]   Oh, I am too.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:22.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:23.880]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:29.640]   So Google Reader going to die soon like at the end of the month, right?
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.600]   Yeah, like in four days.
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.360]   What are you doing?
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.080]   Feedly.
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.840]   Are you using AOLs now and ask that they're going to do a.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.520]   Well, I've tried AOLs.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:42.000]   I've tried dig digs.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.080]   Feedly.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.040]   Feedly.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.720]   That news wire.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.240]   I've been using it for a month.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.880]   So I'm used to it.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.560]   I kind of like it.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.640]   Which?
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.520]   Feedly?
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.600]   You know, I gotta be honest, the only time I hit an RSS reader is to prep for the show
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.680]   and for all about Android.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:04.040]   It's the only time that I kind of want this like complete view of a set of
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:10.480]   sites. Otherwise, I'm really OK with just sort of, you know, finding links through
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.560]   my various social streams.
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:15.080]   I just started trying potluck yesterday, which I kind of like.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:19.560]   That's the new thing that from the branch team, I haven't settled on another
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.160]   on another reader yet.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.080]   I guess I don't know.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.360]   I was kind of waiting for everybody else who's a power RSS reader to come to a
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.840]   consensus and then go to that thing.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.240]   Although I'm interested in dig reader.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.840]   Well, one is actually not bad either.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:32.920]   I've got to give them points.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.840]   It's a private beta, but you could sign up.
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:40.320]   I signed up and I got into both of those reader.aol.com.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.920]   I'm a little upset that I think we're in one sense, we're moving away from the
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.520]   notion of feeds and I like feeds.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.080]   The New York Times has been killing blogs like crazy.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:53.000]   And and say, well, we'll now are our our own media pages act like the blogs.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.360]   Well, no, there are static collections rather than feeds or as Dave Weiner would
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:06.240]   be rivers and the unpackaged nature of an RSS feed and find the stuff that interests
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.120]   you in it.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.320]   I still like it's not the whole world, but it's part of the world and we're moving
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.080]   a lot of things away from that.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.280]   I'll show you which bothers me.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.240]   Well, I guess that's an old fart and all of these unfortunately are in beta.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.760]   These all these readers here, they're not
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.560]   yeah, they might not quite be at where Google Reader was.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.400]   Ken from Chicago was saying this surely you're subscribed to the twit feeds.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.480]   You know, of course, with podcasts is a different thing.
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:33.280]   I certainly use a pod camera and I certainly subscribe to the shows that I want.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.640]   So but that that and I guess that's that's basically a feed reader, right?
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.320]   But that's kind of a different thing.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:42.520]   I'm talking about just reading websites versus I think you I think you're the one
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:47.240]   who got me on the podcast, one I use now, Gina, which was a talk catcher.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.040]   Pocket cats. Yeah, that's yeah.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.080]   Yeah, it's really good.
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.440]   So I didn't realize this, but a but
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.880]   Yahoo's acquisition of Tumblr has already gone through.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:01.560]   It's done deal. Meanwhile, Google says the FTC is going to review the ways deal.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.520]   This one might take a while.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.360]   I want that one to go through just because I want.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.440]   Yeah, I love ways.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:13.040]   Lawyers according to this article in the Wall Street Journal say it's unlikely.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:19.200]   The FTC would tell Google they can't get ways.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.160]   It you'd have to find evidence that it would significantly crimp competition
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:26.640]   mapping market. And I know I think you can make a pretty good case that there's
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.600]   some other good competitors there.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:35.240]   Though last week, Gina showed us the carousel of local advertisers and things.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:39.600]   Somebody did a study and found that the clicks on the carousel are 48 percent
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:43.080]   versus 15 percent on the map and Google's embedded another thing.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:47.800]   So Google local, they really could they don't own that kind of local advertising
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:52.720]   now, but that's probably the fear that the carousel is the search result.
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:56.800]   Bar you say pizza parlors in New York City, you get a list of nearby pizza bars.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:57.400]   Great idea.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.680]   Click through is really hot.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.600]   Is it really hot? Well, because it's the right result.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.800]   Yeah. Yeah. And it's pretty.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.320]   It's visual. It makes sense.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.240]   It's local. It's right at the top there under the numbers.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.320]   This is the number I'm not going to use Leo.
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:13.760]   So it's OK, but under the numbers, there's a heat map of clicks and the carousel,
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:18.040]   of course, yeah, because it's pretty and it's useful. Yeah.
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.880]   Danny Sullivan running in search engine land.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:30.520]   Notes that Duck Duck Go has posted a 50 percent traffic increase in the last eight
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:34.640]   days, probably because of the NSA prism stuff.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.120]   He says, but it's not.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.760]   He says people don't care about search privacy.
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.160]   Because the number is still tiny.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:43.320]   It's still teeny, meany, teensy, weeny.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.440]   And I had a little Jarvis fit.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.360]   Duck Duck Go PR people.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.080]   We can have it.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.240]   We didn't know about this in the show, but right after the NSA stuff breaks
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:56.840]   and there was still the mistaken belief that the NSA had direct connections
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:01.120]   into the servers of Google and Facebook and such, which was wrong.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:07.520]   Duck Duck Go sends out a press release and once made an interview them because
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.440]   gee, now you can not have to use awful Google.
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:16.160]   And I thought that was just awfully exploitive of what is for everybody, a bad
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:19.680]   situation, it's bad for the internet and it was exploited in that way.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.400]   It's not pissed. And I told them.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:23.920]   That's flakery and leave me alone.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.320]   Wow.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.640]   I just I thought that was that was untoward.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.640]   Well, in a way, it doesn't prove anything.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.560]   If you look at this graph, this is Duck Duck Go compared to Google.
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.680]   Here's Duck Duck Go before the prism revelations.
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:44.000]   Here's Duck Duck Go after still kind of small compared to Google.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.040]   That was a good analysis.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.040]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:49.480]   It is sort of exploitive in that it's it's it's it's been it's using people's
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.840]   beer, right? To promote their product.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.120]   But we know we see this a lot.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:56.480]   What was that? Was that the scruggled?
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.760]   Microsoft Gmail man.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.800]   And there's one where somebody's like,
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.360]   somebody's saying, did you know the Google Play Store that developers have
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.400]   your name and address and phone number and all your personal information whenever
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:12.040]   you buy an app, that doesn't happen in our platform, which I was like, I'm a
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.520]   developer, I have a developer console.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.200]   I was like, I do.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.960]   I don't think I have any information.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.120]   I've never seen my users names and phone numbers and addresses.
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.520]   It has news to me.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.280]   Yes. Wonderful.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.040]   Wonderful.
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.760]   Wait till we start using Google Mine.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.280]   Gina's going to be at all of her underwear.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:31.200]   I can send you snail mail now.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.080]   Whoa.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.800]   To be boxers or briefs.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.000]   I know.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.400]   I shall send you underpants.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:42.840]   You should you should guess.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.120]   No, no, she shouldn't.
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:49.280]   No.
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.400]   I didn't tell you I'm collecting everybody's
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.400]   to-do list and running, you know, running algorithms.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.560]   Oh, yeah, you could do that.
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.680]   Your life is like and why aren't you doing that?
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.680]   You're missing out on some great opportunities.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.920]   That would be some really interesting data, though.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.080]   It would be people's to-do lists are very, very private.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.480]   That's one of the selling points of do taxes.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.760]   It goes straight to Dropbox.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:11.600]   I never, my app doesn't see any of it, but yeah, it's.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.560]   It's pretty, it's indicative of, you know, tells you a lot about your life,
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.280]   your intentions, it's intention.
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.200]   I think you should put out a press release
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.520]   that you've seen a great increase in the number of users of two new texts since prism.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.760]   Oh, yeah, everybody's just jumping on that command line.
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:27.400]   Yeah.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:28.680]   I love it.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:34.680]   Plain text is the new black bash.
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:39.120]   I want to use the bash shell.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:42.480]   Anything else?
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.560]   That's good.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:46.000]   All right. Let's get our picks of the week.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.440]   And I'll start with you, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.880]   What's your pick? Oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.720]   What am I saying? That's a different show.
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:57.680]   In this show, we always start with Gina Trepani and her tip of the week.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:58.520]   I apologize.
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.600]   I didn't mean to throw you Jeff.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.840]   My tip this week is more of a PSA than anything.
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:07.240]   Like we just said, Google Reader shutting down, I think, in four days on July 1st.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.400]   If you're anything like me, you've probably seen a little pop up that said
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.560]   this is going to go away on July 4th, July 1st.
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:13.680]   Make sure you back up your data.
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:14.840]   I just dismiss it.
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.400]   I go, yeah, I'll take care of that later.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.800]   But you really got to do that this week.
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:22.360]   So make sure you take out your data, go into Google Reader, go to Settings,
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:26.240]   import, export, yeah, settings and then reader settings.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:32.320]   Thank you, Chad, import, export tab and then export your.
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:37.120]   Can't read that word and it takes you directly to take out which will export
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.560]   all your subscriptions.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.080]   Oh, yeah, it's an OPML file.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.320]   OK, yeah, it's an OPML file.
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.800]   Yeah, Google just said email this all ROPML.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.280]   Give me my, yeah, but it would have been nice if it had done that.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.160]   Now, here's the question.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.640]   If you sign up for Feedly or one of these other alternatives and they are
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:57.920]   pulling your Google Reader, is that sufficient or will I not have access to that later?
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.040]   That should be sufficient.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.240]   It's OPML, which is an open standard for subscriptions for outlines and our
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:07.520]   assessments and any feed reader feed reader is going to be able to import OPML.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:09.280]   So yeah, that will be sufficient.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.960]   I'm I haven't tried this, but I'm pretty sure it won't it won't preserve your
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.760]   like red and on red items.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:19.640]   So you might want to do one last pass on on reader and make sure that you've
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:23.080]   seen everything you want to see and then just then then import, you know, export
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.480]   your feeds, import them into your new reader, Mark all is red and then you'll
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.040]   be able to kind of start start from start fresh.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.760]   But I got I got to do this and I got to move to something.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.280]   So I'll be prepared for the show.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.880]   The changelog may not make it.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.120]   I don't have a good feed reader going.
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:42.000]   So yeah, you'll see when you click on export, it takes a few seconds to build
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:46.840]   your feed if you've got tons and tons of subscriptions, you can say, hey, email
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:51.960]   me and then when this is done and that's thanks to the data liberation folks
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.240]   doing Google take out.
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.200]   So there you go.
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:59.800]   So yeah, because I so I'm on my feedley and it has
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:06.280]   all my Google reader links in it, but my my only I presume that I don't have to do
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.360]   anything additionally.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.360]   I didn't import it.
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.800]   It just did it by itself.
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:10.760]   It did it by itself.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.280]   You connected to right, right.
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:16.040]   You won't be able to do that after July for a but if I'm hoping, you know, maybe
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:20.120]   I still should export it because I'm hoping that, you know, on July 1st, all
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.120]   of a sudden, feely goes, well, Google readers did.
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:24.840]   I don't know what you want to read because that would be right.
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:25.320]   Right.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.320]   In writing cases doing a lot.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.400]   I'm not sure if you might be live.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:27.960]   I don't know.
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:31.000]   Yeah, it's doing a live sink or not.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:32.800]   I think I better.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:36.400]   The reader, it's been a good few years.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.800]   It wasn't.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.360]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week, the number of the week is 32 of the Internet
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:50.280]   Hall of Fame, which I didn't know existed from the Internet Society has
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:56.880]   installed 32 new members of its Hall of Fame, including I saw this because John
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:59.160]   Perry Barlow did a humble brag about this as well.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.680]   He should on Twitter.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:02.440]   Did he win?
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:03.040]   Schwartz.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.840]   Yes, Aaron Schwartz is their Schwartz.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:05.480]   Is there a host?
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:09.320]   Oh, Richard Stalman.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.600]   Yeah, Mark Andreessen.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:16.720]   It's a whole bunch of people I don't know.
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.520]   Is there any women on this list?
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.360]   Please tell me there's at least one question.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.280]   What is it?
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.200]   Oh, I now want to look at this.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:27.880]   So where is this Internet Hall of Fame?
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.960]   Is there a place, a physical place?
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:30.480]   You know what?
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:35.640]   Gina Karen Banks, networking leader who used information, communication technologies.
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:39.920]   And applications as tools for social change.
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:43.480]   OK, on Riet Esterheisen.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.200]   That sounds kind of female.
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.560]   Ida Holtz.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.840]   Sound like a female.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:49.640]   Ida Holtz.
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.160]   I don't know.
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.400]   This is a pretty good group.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.720]   And the actual window.
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:19:59.440]   Nice.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:03.640]   An implementation of DNS security extensions, technology and usage procedures.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.040]   Jimmy Wales is on there.
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.240]   It's appropriate.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:07.440]   Yeah.
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:10.400]   Friend of women and
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.600]   Wookiee Leakers.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.960]   Sorry, that's terrible.
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.040]   So is internet halloffame.org?
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.760]   And this is the first year?
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:20.440]   I don't.
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.080]   Well, I didn't say.
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:23.600]   Oh, this is the Internet Society.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.320]   They're doing and they're going to have a.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.800]   Yeah, this is a legitimate.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.800]   They're going to have a award ceremony.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.960]   August 3rd in Berlin, you can watch it on the live stream.
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:37.240]   I was supposed to be announced in Istanbul, but that that that is.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.760]   This thing messed it up.
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:41.680]   Look at all these people.
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:43.400]   I know some of these people.
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:44.320]   And who else do you know?
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:47.000]   I'm sure that you've interviewed a lot of these people.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.320]   Yeah, Bob Medcalf.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.680]   John Perry Barlow has been on triangulation.
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:53.720]   Good for him.
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.280]   I was going to say this could be your upcoming slate for triangulation.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.800]   We should just all these people.
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.080]   Just knock through everyone.
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:00.760]   Go through them one by one.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.200]   Mark Andreessen.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.760]   Yeah, this is good.
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.760]   Richard Stalman played the flute on our show
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:11.800]   some moons ago and sang the free software
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:12.600]   Foundation song.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:13.600]   Free software song.
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:14.800]   I'm so great.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:22.160]   I tried to get him to do a dramatic reading of his great manifesto,
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.280]   but he won't do it.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.360]   Barlow.
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.160]   Yeah, I tried to.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.680]   You asked me when we got him on triangulation.
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:28.280]   That's why I asked you to do it.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:28.680]   That's right.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.480]   And he said no.
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.880]   He said he actually I think he disowned it really.
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:36.280]   It was the one that begins people of the Internet.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.440]   Because people say he disowned it and he said, no, no, no.
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:40.000]   I just this is a little over the top.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:40.920]   Yeah.
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.280]   But which is his charm.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.360]   But that's what's good about it.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:47.080]   And a dramatic reading would be so cool.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:51.800]   I want I want you to get Stalman to do a dramatic reading of his of his writer.
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:52.680]   That's what I want.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.440]   The canoe Linux writer.
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:58.400]   The the the the packet that he sends out in advance.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.600]   You may not call it Linux.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.520]   You must call it canoe Linux.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.720]   You Linux.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:05.800]   That's the only one I know.
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.400]   Does he have other things that he won't do?
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:11.040]   Yeah, he had he apparently sent out this sends out this.
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.560]   He doesn't want business class.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.240]   He's rather you pay you pay him more.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.120]   Oh, that's good.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:15.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:16.080]   Mind that.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:18.440]   What's a rod from the airport I think or something.
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:19.640]   This is reasonable.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.560]   No, no, it's actually fairly.
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.160]   There's some really good parts where he's like, you know, sometimes if we go out to dinner
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.080]   and on board with the conversation, like I'm going to pull out my laptop and answer email
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.320]   because I've got a lot of email to answer.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.400]   Yeah, he's in it, but at least he's up front about it.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:34.760]   Yeah, not too any of that when we had him on tech TV.
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:38.400]   He merely said that for the day that he was going to be on the show,
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:41.600]   we should call Linux, canoe Linux the whole time.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.000]   And I think we did.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.120]   I can't remember what we decided because I don't normally do those kinds of things,
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:50.280]   but for him, maybe that's fine.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.160]   That seems OK.
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:52.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.560]   I don't really have a tool.
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:59.400]   I'm trying to think but nothing happens.
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.640]   So
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.240]   the war sponsors are going to run.
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.240]   No, that's it.
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.880]   We're just going to go home.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:10.880]   You know, I want to there's things I want to recommend, but I'm not sure.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:17.400]   I'm reviewing right now, for instance, the new Logitech smart remote control,
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:23.360]   which will turn your Android phone or your iPhone, but your Android phone into a smart
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.280]   remote control.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:26.320]   Now, we already have that capability.
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:29.520]   Well, you don't, Gina, because you don't have the special software that does it.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:32.640]   But the galaxy is the IR blaster.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.080]   Our blaster Galaxy S4 and the HTC one have IR blasters.
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:41.480]   And I have to say there's no reason to buy the the Logitech stuff because this works
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:45.080]   so well by itself.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.600]   You don't really need to spend any more.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.600]   You've got software if you have a Galaxy S4 and HTC one.
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.280]   Now, if you don't,
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.760]   stay tuned for my review on Wednesday. I'm having some issues with setup and so forth.
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.400]   But it'll be on before you buy next week.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:59.080]   Next Tuesday, I should say my fire.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.560]   I know what I was going to talk about.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.760]   Thank you, chat room for reminding me.
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:06.360]   And I'm surprised Gina didn't mention the Google Cloud playground.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:07.800]   Oh, yes.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.200]   I meant to mention that.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:10.920]   Thank you. I what I.
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:13.600]   What's the difference between a playground and a sandbox?
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.520]   It's kind of like a sandbox.
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:16.560]   OK.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:19.120]   It was kind of a developer thing, right?
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:28.840]   Yeah. So the idea is let's say you you want to learn Python or right now it's just
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:34.280]   Python. I'll presumably go and other Google languages will be included.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.440]   You can go to the Google Playground.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:41.200]   It's cloud dash playground dot app spot dot com.
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.200]   Log in if you wish.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:48.920]   But if you do, you should be aware that all of your code and coding will be
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.640]   visible and they say this is a shared public playground.
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:55.520]   Anyone can read, modify, modify or delete your projects.
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:58.160]   But it is a great way to learn stuff.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:02.600]   So they come with a bunch of project templates, a hello world, of course, in
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:08.400]   Python, but also more sophisticated stuff like a guest book.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.720]   You can and you can just take these projects.
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.840]   App Engine last across the finish line.
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.280]   Example application uses the task Q API.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:20.360]   So if you're trying to learn Python, this would be great.
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.920]   So once once you copy it over, then you can open your project.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.440]   Here's the hello world project.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:30.080]   Now, there's a lot of extra stuff because there's some yaml that you have to do.
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:34.680]   And hello world in Python is really can be as simple as print hello world.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:38.280]   But in this case, you have to put a handler and so forth because what happens
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:40.520]   when you run it is look at the bottom of the page.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.640]   It runs right here in the bottom of the page.
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.040]   It's the hello world.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:45.880]   Interesting.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.880]   So it's a little code academy.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.200]   Yeah, it's code academy.
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:50.960]   Exactly.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.520]   Not quite as without any instruction at all.
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:54.680]   Right.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:56.640]   You know, you can do this yourself.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:00.440]   Python has a number of IDEs that will allow you to run Python and so forth.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.960]   But I think this is kind of cool.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:03.920]   There's kind of cool.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:06.480]   Gina, did you see edit E?
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:08.320]   Oh, that's another cool one.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:09.720]   No, what's it?
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:15.520]   EY, this is a code editing environment for.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.960]   For Dropbox or no, for drive.
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:20.080]   Oh, for drive.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:20.920]   Very cool.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:23.760]   Create dynamic Google Docs.
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:26.600]   So you want to, yeah, you can create when you go to create instead of a doc,
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.760]   you can create not that I could do it, but I have it.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.080]   I installed it anyway.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.560]   You can create to actually put a website on Google Drive.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:41.240]   HTML, JavaScript, Pixler, website, and other stuff.
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.160]   And these just become new ways to create these things.
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:47.320]   So I need to it's in the web store.
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:52.040]   So if I go to the Chrome Web Store and search for it's entity, A-E-D-I.
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.400]   T-E-Y.
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:54.840]   T-E-Y.
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:57.640]   It's a Chrome, Chrome extension.
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:59.760]   Oh, yeah, HTML for editor for Google Drive.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.520]   Simple code editor for the drive.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:06.480]   It's easy to create new HTML, JavaScript, CSS files right from the create menu.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.200]   And it's free.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:07.960]   Very nice.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.760]   It looks cool.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.560]   Cool cloud tools.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:13.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:14.320]   I'm digging it.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:14.600]   I liked it.
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:18.160]   The cloud that the Chrome based cloud code editors are getting better.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:21.920]   Well, you know, that was one of the first things I looked at when I got the
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.360]   pixel was what can I do with this?
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.680]   Because I, you know, but I.
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:28.600]   Yeah, it was pretty limited.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.240]   Yeah.
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.640]   Pretty limited.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:34.320]   Um, good.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.480]   I think this was a fabulous episode tonight.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:40.040]   Jeff Jarvis is going to get glass.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:42.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:44.480]   I'm interested to hear you think, Jeff.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.040]   When will you have it?
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:49.080]   Well, I probably can't pick it up until I'm back from Europe.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.240]   The next trip.
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.800]   Oh, no, you got to get it before you go.
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:53.720]   I would hope so.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:54.640]   I'll see if I can get it Monday.
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:58.760]   Say tell them you need it for the show next Wednesday.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:27:59.520]   Are you going to be here?
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:00.640]   Stop at the border with it.
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:03.440]   I'll be in Belgium.
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.240]   Well, it's Wednesday.
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.640]   This must be Belgium.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:07.240]   Yes.
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.040]   So you will not be on the show next Wednesday.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.040]   No, I'm planning to be.

[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:14.120]   I have to fly Thursday morning.
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:16.040]   This is this is a sin.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:22.280]   I have never been to Rome and I'm back and forth to Rome one day
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:24.840]   to go to a Google Big Ten event.
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:25.720]   That's terrible.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:27.120]   You have to eat pasta.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.720]   Yeah, at least eat pasta.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.640]   You have to eat pasta in Rome.
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:32.040]   And get some.
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:32.840]   Isn't it?
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.840]   That is a tragic.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.040]   That's frustrating.
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:36.840]   That's wrong.
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.840]   We'll talk to you next week in Belgium.
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.440]   Tell them you go into this thing.
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.640]   They're going to get you the glass.
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:45.040]   You say, look, I'm going to a Google event in Rome.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.040]   You need to have the glass for me.
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.040]   All right, I'll try to come on.
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:49.640]   That's true.
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:50.640]   That would be good for them.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:51.440]   Come on.
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:53.640]   And then maybe next week we can all wear glass.

[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:56.240]   Yes.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.840]   Is that OK with you?
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:58.840]   Fine with me.
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.840]   Do your people celebrate in any way?
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:04.640]   The celebrations will happen that the following day.
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:05.640]   Yeah, no, I'm good.

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.040]   That'd be kind of cool.
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:14.840]   Yeah, that'd be fun.
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.240]   And Jeff will be in Belgium.

[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:35.640]   Oh, no, what was it for security on WordPress?
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:37.240]   Was it SSH logins?
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.440]   I think it was.

[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:06.440]   It's so much more fun than writing.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:07.040]   It is.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.640]   You know if it works or not, right?
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:10.440]   You don't know if it works until it's published.
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:11.840]   Right, right, right.
