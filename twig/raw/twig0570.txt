[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.020]   Hello everybody. Yeah joining us now in studio. We have of course the wonderful Stacy Higabotham
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.500]   Stacy on I

[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.500]   So stay safe. He took a nap
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.420]   Jeff and aunt watched as long as they could and gave up I
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.860]   Had to do windows weekly, so I only saw the opening statements
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.340]   We're talking about of course testimony today in front of the
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.180]   house judiciary subcommittee on antitrust by four of the
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.180]   I don't know five or six big
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.660]   Tech CEOs from Amazon Jeff Bezos first time he's ever testified in Congress, which is kind of interesting
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.580]   Mark Zuckerberg who's been there before many times
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.620]   If senator Pichai who's always been kind of a favorite of Congress, I think he's always done very well there from Google our own
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.620]   our own CEO and
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.460]   They are on CEO, but this is this week in Google
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.180]   So we'll own him or or as a Republican congressman called him mr. Peach. I
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.900]   He Chai or P. Kai
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.260]   How can you not how can you not know who Sundar Pichai and how to say his name?
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.780]   That's just that's poor briefing on the part of the staff if mr. P. Chai mr. P. Chai and then finally of course
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.540]   Tim Apple from cook no Tim Cook from Apple
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.980]   And actually I have to say I was listening
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.660]   I was getting ready to come to work so because it was delayed by like an hour and 15 minutes
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.900]   Which is frustrating, but then after all I do the same thing
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:12.340]   So now I know how you all feel I finally said well look I'm taking a shower and of course as soon as I started
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.580]   Got in the shower they started so I was listening to all of them speak
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.500]   Then I quickly wrapped myself at a towel because I wanted to run out and living room Lisa was watching living room
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.460]   And I wanted this is a visual. I don't really want but go ahead. I wanted to see because
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.580]   part of the theatrics of this all for
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.260]   CEOs were on
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.940]   video cameras I think we're all using web is that the
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.580]   congressional choice
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.860]   Webex has some security features. I think that might be why they're there that would make sense
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.620]   Some members of Congress were there some were not the chairman of the house judiciary committee Jerry Nadler was not
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.060]   but Jim Jordan was and so was Chitulini the
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.620]   Jordan's the ranking member Chitulini's the chairman of the committee and
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.820]   I
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.260]   Wanted to see the backgrounds of all four CEOs because I thought this is gonna be kind of telling you how they were dressed
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.340]   Zuckerberg kind of had a loose tie looked like he looked like you got some Sun
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.580]   But as one would expect with Mark Zuckerberg. It wasn't a tan. It's just very freckly nose
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.860]   And it kind of looked burnt. Well, of course everybody made fun of him because he put the zinc on his face
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.900]   Yeah, he was surfing. Yeah, and now we know why they made fun of him for protecting himself from sudden
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.140]   That's the right thing to do. Thank you. Yes, it is and
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.300]   so
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.780]   He looked like he was at his Martha's Vineyard house
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.900]   I don't know it was like on the porch of his house with him
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.260]   And then I was a little disappointed. I expected the richest man in the world to have something a little better
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.540]   But Jeff Bezos just kind of had an office
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.660]   With a credence. That's why you're the richest man in the world. Yeah, he saves money. Well, very
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.780]   Rave my skype room
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.820]   rated
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.940]   Bezos and all they did a ball. Okay. Yep. You need to go. Okay, great my skype very famously for years
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.500]   Amazon had desks made out of doors on
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.580]   Saw horses. I don't know if they still do but that was that was actually the
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.420]   The big thing at the time. So I you're right. That's why he's rich. So here's let's see what
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.260]   Let's see what room Raider has to say
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.180]   There's Jeff Bezos
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.540]   And you see it's just a credenza
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.220]   Looks like it could have come from Ikea
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.860]   Not well, a little more expensive
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.340]   You know, and it's got a not a lot of effort put in dressing and I don't think that's a real place. That's probably a
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.220]   Nice you nice use of the rule of thirds back off the soft focus says room Raider add books remember books
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:46.620]   Order a couple of ring lights. Here's one you gave it 4.5 stars six out of ten
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.700]   Yeah, I feel like but I like that he's just slightly off center
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.500]   I like I like the rule of thirds. Yeah, and even the fact that this is a straight behind him
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.500]   This is all I think by maybe wrong very conscious
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.540]   That the idea is to make it look like an executive in the office
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:12.700]   Not not a stage set so or maybe it's his lawyer's office, but go ahead
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.340]   Yeah, you know it and in black suit black tie white shirt very nondescript
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.940]   Didn't want to look too rich probably Mark Zuckerberg
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:28.620]   As you can't choose a bluer red tie anymore because that's not it's not saying something's up is wearing a checked
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.620]   Blue tie with a white shirt both zuck and Bezos affecting the rich man's spread collar
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.220]   Which of course is a Britishism that I find particularly annoying because
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:46.140]   Anyone with taste wears a good preppy button down collar anyway, he does look like all about how your faces
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.940]   I'm just kidding
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.660]   He does look like he's got some freckles. So he's been in getting some Sun
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.980]   His tie is loose not exactly tight
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.820]   But he remember we kept him waiting an hour and in the green room and I don't get the background here
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:06.260]   But honestly looks like he's on the porch of his nantucket summer home. It doesn't it's an odd kind of background
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.060]   And it says he have an end it's ship up by the way
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.020]   He's well lit in fact if you look in his eyes
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.300]   You can see it may not be a ring light, but he's got some good lighting going on there
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:25.020]   Hostage video says room Raider Putin has not released him, but has allowed him to loosen his tie
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.660]   That's nice two out of ten. That is as simple a background as you can get
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.660]   Tim Cook who even worse
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:38.380]   This looks like there's some dying's in the lance. He's in the lobby. Yeah, this is awful
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:45.580]   There's those partitions, you know those cloth partitions. They used a dead noise. He looks like he's in borrowed somebody's cubicle
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.260]   It's terrible
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:53.060]   And and you can see in front of him and I'm not sure why you can see a
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.700]   It looks like an iPad. I don't know a Macintosh. No, it's I think it's an well
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.660]   It's obviously an apple device for some time
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:06.380]   Tim wearing gray gray suit light gray tie kind of great light grace shirt off white shirt
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:12.780]   Yeah, it's nice not doing the spread color, but it's still a little more spread than Americans where Tim Apple needs some work
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:19.140]   Plants help but that wall needs a patch of art depth would help too. I
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:26.100]   Think the plants look dying my favorite was an obvious because what room Raider thinks yeah, so DARPA CHI loved him
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:31.540]   Loved him this very textual sculpture or painting behind him another credenza
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:36.620]   Baffling it looks kind of like you know you could buy a textured baffling
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:43.860]   Expensive sound baffling also serious dark suit dark time almost matching but a little bit lighter gray
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.340]   And the least spread of all the collars
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:52.940]   Well tied I feel like this actually might be his office. What do you think I feel like it almost might be no
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.860]   He also has a plant room rate of course loved him
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:01.940]   Love the texture great composition the vase and plant a perfect strong nine out of ten
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.220]   It would be ten out of ten with more color
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.260]   Should have stuck a product the little
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:13.100]   Yeah, I'm going to call right there home. Yeah, I would set that off nicely
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:18.860]   But you know what none of these guys in fact one of the things they all said is hey
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:27.140]   What are you talking about none of us are dominant Tim Cook was famous? He said we we Apple is not dominant in any of the markets
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:33.380]   We participate in we're a small part of any market we participate in however, that's not our goal
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:38.100]   We don't want to be dominant. We just want to make the best products, which actually I think is sincere
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.820]   Well, he's not dominant even an iPhone. He's dominant in mind share
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.140]   But even in the United States where the iPhone is as strong as it's only 50%
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.180]   But it's the well
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.340]   The app store not the phone
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:57.700]   What they talked to a little bit about they kept him mostly on the sideline
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:02.620]   It was from what I read in the play-by-play mostly Sundar Pachay who did a lot of talking
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.260]   As as we already mentioned and expected
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.220]   The Republican members of Congress were more interested
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:15.100]   Even though this is the antitrust committee were more interested in bias
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:23.220]   That any conservative bias than they were in any trust because governing is hard and they want to don't want to do that
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.700]   They just want to get all
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.300]   Aggravated and get their talking. I mean
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.660]   What is even
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.400]   I know I think that the Bezos's
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.260]   Bezos's shot was carefully contrived remember he's got the best people right
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:42.700]   He is contrived to kind of blend into the background
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.660]   Seriously, he's just like I'm just
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:55.620]   Isn't that how he deals in general? He never gives interviews. He's very much a blend in the background kind of CEO
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:02.260]   And and so I think that that was very conscious. I think all of these are pretty conscious for those tight shirts at Sun Valley
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:08.420]   There isn't blend in it's well, but he doesn't expect anybody to be taking pictures of him at the Sun Valley
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:14.660]   Yeah, Tim's got got Tim and Sunday. I have normal normal collars, but the rich guys
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:22.780]   The founders and the rich guys founders well, they're the two they're the founders these guys are just hired hands
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.200]   Of the four he says the rich guys guys
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:33.900]   Suck is so rich he lost 70 billion dollars in stock value over the last three months
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:41.840]   And he's still the one of the richest guys in the room. That's how rich Zuck is so the founders prefer the British spread colors
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.380]   That's all I know
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:50.900]   Although I said I I felt like after I watched the four speeches. I felt more like Jeff. I
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.700]   Felt like because the L4 of them were great pains to say look at the benefit our companies
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:03.100]   Yeah, have brought us that we are the economic tech in general the economic engine of the United States
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.500]   It's brought huge benefit, especially during this time of quarantine
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.860]   We are not trying to be cutthroat competitors
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:16.100]   We're just trying to do a good job and I felt like I wanted to wave the flag. I felt like
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:23.900]   Awesome God bless them and we know there's problems and there's things that should be addressed whether Congress is the right way to do that
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.900]   I don't know but I
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:32.620]   Tend to stay away from this stuff because quite frankly I hate politics even though I know it's it's part of our life
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.380]   I mean it's it is what it is not alone mr. Pruitt and
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:40.100]   But I did want to attempt to watch this here and today
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.740]   Just for the sake of the show and try to have a little bit of information
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:48.100]   And it just made my blood ball listening to some of the crap coming out of these
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.500]   That the mouths of our leaders of the nation
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:59.420]   You got one one guy the guy that you talked about off off air was it dr. John something other Jim Jordan
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:05.740]   Jordan that's it the guy without the jacket. Yeah, he's going on and on and just being rude and
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:13.300]   Asking I give him I give him credit for asking a yes, no question and I hate when I
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.740]   Ask a yes, no question and people won't give me a yes or no
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.780]   I give him credit on that for being frustrated on that but
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:24.380]   It's still it was still a lot of other chatter going on with people saying hey
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.380]   Well, why is my campaign email?
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.220]   showing up as spam and
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.740]   my father's gmail account and
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.860]   And I'm like really your campaign it just
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.980]   Just don't quite understand how all of this stuff work
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.900]   I expected dinner because this is a subcommittee that focuses on antitrust
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:51.060]   So they are theoretically more up to speed have staff that's more focused on this exact issue
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:57.980]   They've heard a lot of testimony. I thought oh, it's gonna be better than the senators who quizzed Mark Zuckerberg
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.020]   And it was it wasn't much no I wasn't and and these
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.020]   Sorry calm down
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:09.340]   Again, so we're just looking at the
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.780]   Go back to the spam email thing
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:18.140]   I mean this man was just so passionate and pissed off about the the idea that his
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:24.780]   Campaign messages are not going directly to the inboxes of all the citizens that requested it and
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:29.620]   I'm like man, there's bigger problems on this planet. There's bigger problems in this country
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:37.380]   But you weren't about spam email, you know and improper tags of your campaign messages going out there
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.980]   Just it just really really frustrated me and then there was a democratic
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.320]   Representative from Florida
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:50.420]   She asked questions and wouldn't allow mr. Pachata fricking answer the question every time you want to answer she cut them off
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.460]   My time we're claiming my time I
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:58.860]   Think what a lot of this even happening what a lot of this is and this is the frustration
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.860]   I think most people see
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:07.940]   Have when they watch this kind of congressional testimony is it is especially lately mostly a
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.100]   opportunity to
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:18.260]   You know take the stage for these members of Congress to get on TV to get attention and to showboat
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.900]   And that's really what I think we saw is a lot of show boating right? I don't even know that's
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:29.440]   Let's look is that they're wanting to show vote for who the people that could potentially vote for yeah
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.300]   Okay, so what does that say about the people voting for them if this is what's impressive?
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:41.900]   Remember most people are not going to watch these hearings. They're going to see sound they see the sound bites and they get excited
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.020]   There is very much a nihilistic strain in
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:52.620]   In the world. I mean I look at my parents and I look at people who are fed up with politics and to them these people are like
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.740]   Yeah, stick it to the big CEO screw all these people I
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.060]   Mean that's
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:04.100]   For them. This is exciting. This is candy and I guess I
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.700]   Guess they don't realize that
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:15.140]   Unfortunately, we still have to govern a country and yelling and this doesn't really help and I feel like sometimes it's a very big
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:20.060]   They're playing to the immaturity as opposed to rising above it and realizing that
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.260]   Government and if we could talk about this realistically
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.460]   You need government to do some things
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:31.060]   We can debate what those things are and how far we're gonna go on them and that there will be winners and losers and
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:36.740]   Unintentional winners and losers each time and Jeff you and I come up against this a lot where I'm like
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.060]   Yeah, this is gonna hurt some people and you're like I don't want it to hurt these people that will be bad
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.700]   I'm like, let's see what happens. Let's see how people adapt
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:47.460]   But we don't ever have those discussions in the US because they're too hard of a conversation
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:55.460]   And they're very I don't even think they're too nuanced. It's just we can't have them in the formats that we currently have no
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:00.220]   No, I think a great example of that is 230 right. I don't think 230 should be touched
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.660]   I think it's good law
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.820]   But even if you do think it should be touched those who think it'll be you know
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:09.460]   We can serve a little bit you open up that Pandora's box and what the heck happens then
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.740]   And you can't have a scene an informed
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:20.340]   Discussion they actually I'm a camera for was sense and printer, but they actually did bring up 230 in the protection and offered and
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:27.100]   And talked about it in a negative way implying that it gave these companies the right to censor
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.580]   Speech they didn't agree with as opposed
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:34.140]   I have to say
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.540]   Government is intensely boring
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:42.780]   Unless you're a particular kind of person if you're a walk and you really enjoy this stuff
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.420]   It's not it's fascinating, but for most people
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:54.420]   Watching government is like watching paint dry. It's slow. It's tedious. It's detail oriented and it's boring
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:59.540]   What's sad is that as they as the more and more of these hearings are televised and this was everybody knew
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:03.500]   This was going to be a lot of attention that we're you know everybody's gonna be talking about it
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:08.900]   It unfortunately brings out the worst in these members of Congress who are taking this as an opportunity to
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.740]   exactly as you say Stacy
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.620]   Preach to the base. It's all about you know
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:23.220]   Feeding meat red meat to the base whichever base they have and very much less about governing because they know that the actual
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.740]   Government main part of the testimony would be intensely dull
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.020]   They didn't really seem that interested in fact finding
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.420]   And don't get me wrong. Yeah
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:38.380]   For them to attack the CEOs of these large companies I get it because ultimately
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:43.500]   The leader of the company is responsible even though a lot of those questions
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.860]   They're not gonna have the answer to right at that moment because there's so many different levels of
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.580]   management in that hierarchy, but
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.700]   They were asking those questions as if they would actually know right at that time
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.300]   That's the kind of stuff that frustrates me if you're gonna ask the CEO about something
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.780]   You know do a little bit of your research if you're a government and you're so
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.580]   detailed oriented be detailed oriented in your research too
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.300]   What happens is the
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:16.820]   The conversations that you see and the back and forth that happens prior to this between the congressional aides
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.260]   We're the people who are actually crafting the policy
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:26.460]   They mean they they educate the Congress people and then the lobbying firms and lawyers on behalf of the tech firms
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:32.300]   So what's happening is this mass of people that we'll never see or hear from they're hammering out
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:36.300]   their statements their questions their
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:42.060]   Not I mean, it's not entirely scripted, but they know exactly where they're gonna go and so
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:51.140]   And they do that because most people will find it boring and these guys have to get their sound bites out of it the
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:56.020]   And there is there is some accountability for this like I
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:02.020]   Do think this is a good warning slash wake-up call
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.900]   That you know when you're when your lawyers come in and they're like, yeah, this is a big deal
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.180]   You got to get you got to go address this you're you're the CEO. They need you
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:16.020]   You know, no one else is gonna do this. It's got to be you. That's a that's like a
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.420]   That's an oh poop moment for these guys in the sense that
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.460]   Don't you know, it's like oh
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:31.340]   A little bit like a court trial you have a witness who is clearly gonna testify in his own interest
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:36.260]   He's hostile. They're not I don't think they were under oath. Are they under oath? I don't think so. Oh, yeah, they're there
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.340]   They weren't there sworn in before yeah, they were yes, I don't think they had to stand up because
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:49.100]   Okay, so they were say after I was listening to car and I heard him say you could remain after that you could remain seated
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.580]   Okay, so they do get sworn in so it is a little bit like a trial in that sense
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.660]   There's the risk of getting caught in perjury. So you're gonna try to avoid that
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.960]   Yeah, lying to Congress is actually a serious offense
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:11.860]   Is it perjury maybe it's not called perjury, but it's lying to Congress. Oh, it's lying to Congress. You're right. Maybe it is. Yeah, so
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:18.460]   But I think the opportunity is there for the members of Congress to ask
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:27.820]   So there's two kinds of questions they can ask the questions that are just theater like asking the question for the rhetorical purpose of asking the question
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.820]   They know they're not gonna get a good answer question
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:34.740]   It isn't a federal crime to lie to Congress while under oath. It's not that is considered
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.540]   It is
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.660]   Okay
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:43.500]   It isn't oh, it is a federal crime. Yeah. Well, this was a terrible articulation of this story
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:49.580]   I was like what yeah, I'm sure and it is a little to make false statements to Congress even if you are not under oath
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:53.340]   Oh interesting. Yeah. Yeah, you really have to be honest with Congress. So
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:23:01.900]   There's two kinds of questions pointed questions that are purely rhetorical to make the point and then questions where you're actually trying to get the answer
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.900]   I would hope a committee like this
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:10.060]   Would be trying to just like the Supreme Court when they're asking questions during oral arguments
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:15.940]   The questions would be more to gather information so they can make a decision
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:21.860]   then to make a political point a rhetorical point or just or to you know showboat to and
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:28.620]   But unfortunately, I think especially when it's a televised hearing like this. It's kind of hard to get people to do that
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:34.340]   What would what would it what would this have looked like in a perfect world Stacy? What what should have gone on here?
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.700]   well
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.740]   This might be as close to perfect as we can get and I say this
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:45.100]   I wish we could get like the money out of politics and some of this crazy grandstanding
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:50.220]   Like maybe if you had less Twitter adi and more just straight up C span
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:56.620]   We could have some better conversations, but this is kind of how it should look which is interested parties get together and
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:01.900]   Talk about how this I mean people with actual expertise helped the
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:06.940]   Politicians figure out that's right. That's right. That's right and
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.620]   You know staff those people there
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:17.020]   Because they you know were some of them lobbyists. Yes, and that's why I think money is the ultimate corrupting influence here
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:21.780]   But they had educated people doing this they have you know the companies on the other side and
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:26.820]   If you had a and I don't want more like
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:33.340]   You could envision a system where I call my congressman and I can like vote them in or out immediate feedback on stuff
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:39.300]   But I don't know like I as a short-term person or my dad for example. I don't know if we really want that kind of
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.420]   instant response to things because I think we need to
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:49.300]   Term that's right. You don't know how to start people to do a complicated job, right?
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:54.260]   But that isn't the way it is these days well and then as somebody in the chat rooms pointing out there's you know
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:25:00.780]   They're closed hearings where you perhaps get more serious about it. Although I bet there's a bit of show boating in there
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:09.500]   Yeah, I have friends who was be go ahead. Yeah
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:12.340]   I was gonna say I have friends who work on the hill and these
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.660]   This is this is like it is. Yeah
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.180]   well, so Jeff is there I mean
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:25.780]   We I think we'd all agree there is meat for there is a reason to have this conversation
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:35.100]   That these are real questions that these companies do wield huge amount of power whether they're monopolies whether they're trusts under the legal definition
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:40.940]   Well, okay, so let's talk about how to have a conversation right because what what what scares me to death here is
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:47.980]   That you have a pincer movement of the left for its reasons and the right for its reasons are going after the proprietors of the internet
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:52.800]   And see I'm scared for the internet. These are the temporary proprietors. These are the people who were in charge of mounting
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.540]   I'm gonna be there forever. I don't think that's the internet Jeff. I
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:01.980]   Would say the people building walls on the internet. I mean we
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.580]   The internet has changed and is not as is not a
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.340]   Not it's a it's a moving entity
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:15.300]   It's sort of saying is that it's not these are the these are the temporary proprietors of much of the internet
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.660]   We see I very much believe temporary
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:24.460]   Nevertheless they can impact and what the internet is going forward. Yes, but so how would you have this discussion?
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.220]   You said oh, they have a lot of power. Well, let's have evidence of that
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:32.580]   Let's have research that informs the discussion if we're gonna talk about anti-trust
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:39.860]   Let's do it in the line of the legality of it and define the legality of it and say what I think it's some of the questions
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.520]   I've had a bunch of emotional things. No, I think some of the questions that actually happened
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:50.500]   I can't remember who it was there was a member of Congress who was talking to Jeff Bezos and said we I you know our research shows
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.020]   evidence shows that
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.100]   Company that pays you for advertising is gonna be higher
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.860]   Ranked is gonna be more like in fact
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.680]   Okay, I mentioned testimony from the owner of pop sockets who said
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:07.700]   Amazon competed directly with us by making a clone ripoff product of pop sockets
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:12.440]   They'll stay on the first till we pay two million dollars in advertising and then they stopped
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:17.260]   So stay on the first point for me. That's the point. Um, how do you think Coke gets?
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:22.940]   The end cap no no I that was my immediate reaction is that Amazon's doing nothing different
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:27.820]   In some respects than a grocery store does that's how grocery store you play
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:35.780]   grocery stores as opposed to the dominant place people network effects on the internet are much more
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.060]   There there are if you imagine, you know that you imagine those things
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:45.920]   You it's science museums that you throw the quarters in and it spins around and around and around and it but it always goes down
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.780]   The two do you know what I'm talking about on the internet?
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:54.140]   I know this is this is the drugs talking
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:28:02.860]   of how many dollars if you're big enough site you become that funnel and nothing can escape and you to get anywhere in the
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:07.500]   Consumers at the bottom you have to go through that funnel in the real world
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:13.860]   There is friction that we're a custom to so we go all over the place and maybe you know
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:19.860]   Buying an in-cap at a Kroger versus a I don't know who they're all owned by like Safeway now. So I don't know
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:28.260]   But I would say actually our issue isn't our issue is our current definition of antitrust
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.620]   And I think that's where we need to start is our current
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:38.100]   Framework in the US for antitrust law is demonstrating actual competitive harm
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:44.340]   Which I think is the wrong thing to look at in this particular era
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.060]   because I think
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.660]   It's hard and it's pricing harm is what we're looking at
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:55.060]   I think what we need to start looking at is the harm of you know
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:29:02.100]   Aggregated data and the decisions that you make because of that and then the features and service and that's much more difficult
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:08.540]   It's a much fuzzier problem, but that's actually like that's in part how Europe structures therein to trust laws
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.540]   And they're looking at these companies too
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:17.220]   So I think actually what we need to do is to build more sophisticated
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.020]   legal framework for antitrust
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.660]   And that's what these here right now Jonah Hughes is asking
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:31.100]   Jeff Bezos if it uses data from AWS glean from hosting other companies data for competitive purposes
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.740]   This is something Amazon is used of
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.620]   I'm reading cashmere Hills tweets
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.580]   I
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.060]   think that
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:46.780]   There may be maybe now later in the in the game. They're getting into some of the more serious questions. Val Demings is
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.420]   grilling
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.820]   Sundar Pichai
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:56.860]   Because Google promised not to combine Google and double click data when it bought the ad company in
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.780]   2007 but then did it 10 years later
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.420]   After Sundar Pichai became CEO
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.620]   So these are these are pointed questions
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:09.700]   But I think and perhaps they don't expect answers from the CEOs except you know
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.780]   Deflection but these are important questions
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:17.740]   And they need to get them on the record someone mentioned this in the chat a lot of this is to get their
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:21.780]   Conversate get this on the record and start these conversations. Yeah
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:27.060]   But the but the but the desire still is the problem is much of the
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:32.900]   Attack is anecdotal rather than what you need to show under law is a
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:38.220]   Pattern and one person who's going to accuse you of something
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.380]   That's not but it's dramatic it goes to our earlier point about Brahma
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:47.780]   Oh, that's gonna make a good clip is this woman at her bookstore and and I have no idea what the pattern is
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:52.860]   So when we do these hearings they actually have the data they pick
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:57.820]   It's like actually it's just like in reporting Jeff. I call it the dead baby lead, right?
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.820]   You've got to find the dead baby to get people
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:07.260]   Excited about your boring story about our dark today hospital, you know admission trends, right?
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:13.420]   So you find the dead baby that's your anecdote and then all the data so the data is actually there
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.880]   But they don't know that's that's that's a that's an article of faith
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.460]   They could be picking out one anecdote. It could be represent data. You don't know in the case of these folks
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:28.740]   They it's like it's like Jim Jordan lists 20 anecdotes of how they're against conservatives
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:33.100]   I don't think that he has data behind that that proves that on some cases
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:39.500]   And some cases you're in stuff is never gonna become law like so I've been part of like I know
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:44.140]   I've done like broadband. I was very much against broadband data caps, right?
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:48.340]   I talked about the harms that that could cause and the GAO actually
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:55.540]   GAO yes GAO actually called because they were gathering that data and trying to figure this out and they had surveys that they were
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.700]   looking for actual data not just anecdotes and I've had
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.860]   people who work
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.700]   staff for
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.500]   Congressman and women they call and they
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.980]   They read your stories for example
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:16.540]   And then they call you and they ask for the data and the people who will give you the data the anecdotes are
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.860]   What's going to play in the hearing?
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:23.220]   Yeah, they have the data. I think it's some cases. There's true. Yeah, I can't be assured that they're
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:28.020]   But I think it's how we do their job right the members of Congress said we have the data
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:33.900]   We have the research as shows and I think there there are a number of very pointed questions. They've asked we it's still going on
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:38.580]   Unfortunately, so we can't really give you a final take and all this that's it
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.780]   I'm not slightly less like I want is another take enough takes
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:47.700]   Well, I think at some point that's why I'd like to go through all the testimony and kind of find some you they Patel
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.700]   You know, I tell is also
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.780]   Create up a storm about doing a very good job
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.820]   good
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.600]   You know, there's other moments here where it shows
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.700]   You know that we see especially the Senate but also in the house ignorance of how the internet works
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.860]   But then ignorance of how business works how retail works?
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.900]   right that this this scandalous view that
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:16.060]   Coming up with your own house product is a terrible thing. Well every single retail company does that right? Yeah, and
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.260]   Everybody how we do
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:26.380]   right rask raskin was going on about about HBO Max isn't on the fire devices yet and
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:32.020]   She's getting into the details of a negotiation about that. There's none of his damn business. Yeah, really
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:38.100]   That his constituents care about right so that's when people
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:43.620]   He's playing to the political point rather than the legal point
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:49.220]   Well, you could argue that's why he's there. This is political. Yeah, this is not a this is not a legal hearing
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:52.620]   This is a very much a political hearing, right?
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:56.060]   I mean there
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:03.100]   When consumers call their Congress people and they say hey, I'm really pissed that this is happening and it doesn't seem right
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.700]   you know that gets their attention and
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.220]   you know
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.660]   There is some of these negotiations. There is an
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:16.780]   Antitrust or a competitive issue there that does actually harm consumers, which is what our laws are designed to protect
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:20.220]   I think I think we also are gonna listen for
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:23.100]   moments where
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:29.220]   Accidentally perhaps the CEO lets slip something or gives us a better insight into what their goals are
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:32.380]   This is all a chess game and I don't think that
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:37.580]   You can't it's gonna cherry pick exchanges at this point is premature
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:42.020]   I do think there are some points reading an Eli Patel's threads now on Twitter
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:45.300]   It sounds like there are some good points being made by the members of Congress
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:51.500]   and and I think you know, maybe the thing to do is wait till it's over and and
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:57.260]   Then let people like me lie and the cashmere Hills synopsides the most important points for us
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:01.860]   I will try to watch it and Stacy one more thing about our our dear field
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.580]   Yes, a good journalist too should do what you say
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:12.420]   But journalists also pick out anecdotes to make the story the narrative they want to make and don't necessarily have the evidence and back up
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.860]   For it and so we're guilty of that too as a profession. Oh
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:22.980]   Yeah, dead babies. I can tell you yeah because I write I tend to neglect the dead babies
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.940]   There are some after Sam looking at Val Demings
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:31.800]   She's asking Tim Cook about something that was a big issue a few months ago about Apple
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:36.060]   Restricting parental control apps because they used MDM and then bringing them back
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:44.820]   I think these members of Congress are actually fairly well prepared at least some are fairly well prepared with information from their staff and so
[00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:51.340]   And are asking questions that I think are important. So I'm gonna say on balance, you know, this is an
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.220]   This is an important hearing and I hope that we hear
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:58.500]   You know, I want to read the details more, but I hope we hear
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:06.420]   Some of these accusations responded to by these CEOs. I doubt they will right I doubt they will they will turn in further written testimony later
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:11.740]   Yes, that's right. That's right. There's some of the questions are are of a nature where if I were sitting there
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.860]   I would say I know this right now, right?
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.860]   Because I'm gonna make a mistake and I don't have the details and so we're gonna get back to you
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:18.780]   So it sounds like an evade
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:24.300]   perhaps sometimes the question is meant to draw that out so it sounds like an invasion when in fact it's a responsible answer
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:31.940]   Jeff Bezos for instance early on and there was an exchange about whether Amazon had
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:37.860]   demanded this pop socket a testimony demanded two million dollars in Bezos was very clear he said
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:42.740]   We don't that would be wrong if we did that that was wrong. I'll investigate
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:47.020]   He made a very clear statement about what their policy is and sometimes I think it's just
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:54.340]   That's the point of it is going on record very publicly in front of Congress saying this is we don't tolerate that
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.420]   Or we don't do that so that if they are found to do it later
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:01.580]   They you know, there's some there's some meat there or even just getting them on record to say it
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.660]   I think this is going well to be honest, but
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:12.660]   It's going better than I thought it would there is a lot of stupid stuff which will you see push it
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:17.380]   I think it's going to be a little bit more than I thought it would have been speaking into first hour
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:19.380]   It just takes time
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.180]   I cut well it's government is getting back in now
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:25.940]   Yeah, well, they're coming back around the other round Mike Masnick is getting a my great I can tell
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:33.380]   Here we go one more round of questions six minutes ago. Oh, no, no, no reps Sicily and just pulled out fire in a crowded theater and asked
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.380]   Does that course coming from?
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.380]   Honestly, he said that's a good thing
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:47.740]   Honestly, he says rep Sicily is coming off as the democratic version of Jim Jordan this hearing both are screaming incendiary nonsense
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.780]   so
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.900]   Yeah
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:54.940]   Well, I wouldn't be so quick to judge my friend. I think there's a lot going on
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:59.500]   I think you're gonna unfortunately you're gonna see the hot sound bites cuz there's oh here's here's the
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:05.740]   Here's the people here's the essence of it all from Masnick so rep Sicily right? That's how you say it right?
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.740]   So
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.780]   From Rhode Island. Yeah, thank you. Oh, it's so committee
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:18.940]   So reps of celine is demanding Facebook take down the content that Matt's gets earlier was demanding the Facebook keep up
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:22.140]   That's the yes everything about this hearing
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:32.260]   That's what that's the that's the vice they're stuck in and so trying to have a decent discussion about real issues around that is very difficult
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:36.060]   Well, I mean we have trouble here
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.700]   frankly, it's a
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:43.100]   This is all very challenging stuff. I don't know what the right answer is and many cases
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.740]   This is this is about Jim Jordan saying you took down
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.540]   the
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.060]   hydroxychloroquine
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:54.820]   Video and you have the left saying why aren't you taking down these disinformation videos? That's what I'm saying, right?
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:39:03.180]   Let's take a break. We're gonna come back with more our show today brought to you by worldwide technology my friends in St. Louis
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:09.820]   We were so impressed by the Advanced Technology Center. We talk about it a lot, but there's a lot more that WWT does
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.780]   Including I don't know if you know this software development
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:20.140]   They do apps for their customers and they do apps right and having been involved in the production of a number of apps over the years
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.180]   This is exactly how you should do it
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.860]   WWT software development experts use constant customer collaboration
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:32.820]   That way they develop solutions that are better than what could have been imagined at the start of the project
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:39.940]   It actually gets refined and improved as time goes by we know software can change lives transform business disrupt industries
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.460]   We see it all the time
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.740]   WWT can do that for you solve your toughest challenges
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:49.380]   With its proven approach to agile software development
[00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:57.780]   This is something WWT is has always been and I found this fascinating when we talked with them always been interested in process
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:05.580]   They do a lot of work with the executives in management and process. They are very interested in development processes
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:10.260]   They support DevOps the DevOps model. They support the agile model and
[00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:15.580]   And because they're using agile they are able to deliver end-to-end digital experiences
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:19.060]   That blend best in class software development with the strengths
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:24.300]   capabilities and expertise of a multi-billion dollar technology integrator
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:31.860]   They do the hardware and they do the software if you're looking for the rare partner who deliver both strategy and execution for your next project
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.020]   WWT is the partner for you
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:39.100]   They worked with a very well-known hospital and won't say the name you would know them to help patients and families
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:45.460]   Better navigate the care journey. They created a custom app for patients and their families
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:53.020]   That allowed care teams to interface with the patients to give families all the info they needed from travel arrangements
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:58.860]   scheduling appointments to wayfinding and they really got results within a year the hospital started seeing a
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.700]   reduction in preventable
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:06.940]   Readmissions for patients fewer days spent in the hospital because they were able to do virtual care with this app
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:13.580]   Fewer septic shock deaths occurring in patients treated remotely again. This is all the app the app has been so successful
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.580]   It actually won a webby award
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:22.660]   Partnering with WWT one of America's favorite sandwich chains brought digital transformation
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:31.260]   to more than 1500 stores the customer's investment and next generation technology included mobile kiosk point of sale and loyalty
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:38.860]   enhancements the technology is positioned to scale with the company's pace of growth and has enhanced its ability to deliver best in class service
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:46.440]   Finally WWT worked with a large grocery retailer to improve its customer experience that led to the creation of a custom app a
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:52.860]   Loyally program enhanced signage. It's kind of amazing apps really can't change the world
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:42:00.740]   WWT helped this retailer achieve its two and three year goals on less than a year if you've been thinking we need an app
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:08.020]   We need a custom app or a digital experience if you're looking for somebody to do something will exceed your expectations
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:16.100]   WWT's processes are unlike any other true agile software development from planning to ideation delivery agile
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:22.580]   And I've worked with agile has a number of benefits one of the chief benefits is it's one of the best ways to listen to a customer
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:29.340]   To respond to the customers is it column user stories in a way that really makes the the resulting app
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:34.780]   Reflect your needs more accurately. It also helps you develop as you go through this process
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:38.500]   Exactly what your requirements are it's a really good way to do requirements
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:45.900]   Of course, they support DevOps as I mentioned that combines people processes and technology to help your teams continuously deliver service and value
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.140]   to your customers with speeds stability
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:53.580]   Availability and wwt's all over container platforms. That's the hottest technology out there
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:43:00.420]   Of course, they're expert in that cloud native and best practices to help you rapidly create services that can scale and perform
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:06.180]   So here's the bottom line solve your toughest challenges with the software experts at wwt

[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:29.340]   They're not just hardware integrators. They do it all go to wwt.com/twit one to find out more. It's great site lots of information there
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:38.660]   wwt.com/twit and the number one delivering business outcomes and modernizing it infrastructure all over the world
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:43.300]   wwt.com/twit and the number one
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:48.180]   Google is trying to get Samsung to drop Bixby
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:52.820]   So yeah, I put that up there. That's a really interesting story
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:44:00.020]   It really is both both Bixby and the Samsung app store. Yeah, which my reaction is personally was oh
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:02.660]   Maybe I'll buy a Samsung phone
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.620]   This would be a good thing from your point of view. It is one of the knocks on all Samsung phones
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.620]   We're gonna have a big Samsung
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:15.020]   Reveal August 5th next Thursday a week from tomorrow the galaxy note
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:21.260]   20, I guess they think they're gonna call it a new watch new earbuds a bunch of new Samsung stuff
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:27.460]   And I agree with you it's the wrap on all Samsung Android devices is they duplicate existing Google products
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:33.460]   They have their own mail their own gallery their their own messaging. It's really annoying. They're doing a pretty good job though
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:39.980]   Well, you know a lot of people agree that the Samsung internet browser is a much better browser than
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:47.380]   Bloatware was so bad and just so
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:51.980]   It got in the way of just simple tasks, you know several years ago
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.020]   And I think they've just learned from it and things just got a lot cleaner
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:45:01.460]   And just made the outstanding hardware that they already working with just even better
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:05.200]   So kind of tip the hat to them on that. This is carrying these days and
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:12.820]   Pardon what for you carrying these days? I'm still a pixel guy, you know courtesy your uncle Leo there
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.140]   We got our pixel fours
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:17.940]   And by the way, that's another rumor the pixel 4a
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:23.380]   John Prosser is now saying August soon like next week for the pixel 4a
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:28.500]   It's gonna be a very busy a couple of weeks in Android. So this is a writer scoop
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.860]   They said they saw correspondence yesterday
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.780]   between Google and
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.580]   Samsung
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:42.980]   Saying Samsung's considering dropping not only Bixby but the app store from its mobile devices as part of a rev sharing deal
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:50.060]   With Google Samsung's response to rotors is we have no plans to drop either Bixby or the galaxy store
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:53.620]   We remain committed to our own services and ecosystem
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:57.260]   Oh be interesting
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:02.420]   Stacy if you didn't have to deal with Samsung bloatware would you consider a Samsung phone?
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:06.220]   The hardware is great. Yeah, the hardware is
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:10.500]   Probably I mean I would consider it
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.540]   There and there's a lot more options. So sure
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:19.500]   I mean I the only reason I'm on pixel is because I I want the cleanest Android experience. So sure
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.100]   Yeah, the clean on the experience better
[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:28.260]   On the other hand Samsung, you know this it's kind of interesting because for a while it looked like Samsung
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:35.780]   Actually wanted to go its own way that they did yeah that they really didn't want to be dependent on Google services at all
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:43.140]   They have a desk they actually they have the reason they're on chips and was it we're doing they have the accident
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:46.580]   Oh, and they were trying to I mean they were trying to pull a full on Apple
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.860]   And we know that for years Google has wanted them not to do that
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:56.180]   So this this this letter that writers saw might simply be a continuation of a years-long
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:47:01.220]   Debate between the two and are you sure sure pretty please?
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:05.180]   Kill this for Bixby
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:08.060]   Now I admit Bixby
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:11.780]   It's easy to imagine Samsung dropping Bixby. It doesn't serve
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:18.620]   Any purpose and of late what Samsung's done with Bixby is make it less a general voice assistant and more of a
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:23.820]   Tool to help you use the phone the open apps integrate interact with it's a paper clip
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:27.060]   So talking paper. Yeah kind of is a little bit like yeah
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:35.260]   But I don't know anybody who uses or loves Bixby, so I think Samsung could probably get rid of it
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:39.140]   They've gotten rid of things in the past remember they had a music service called milk. They dropped
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:45.740]   But I don't know the Samsung people that I know that are hardcore Samsung people they never ever
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:52.940]   Mention Bixby. Yeah, but every year they get the next line of Samsung device. We'll pay top dollar for every note
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.940]   They've ever done and I'll buy this one too
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:48:02.620]   And I have to admit I use the Samsung store for Samsung specific stuff. So there are a few tools
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:05.900]   That Samsung offers there's wallpapers
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:12.740]   Fonts there's there's things that Samsung does that are unique to Samsung that they should be in the Samsung store
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:15.220]   They shouldn't be in the play store right?
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:17.660]   You buy fonts for your phone. Oh, yeah
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:22.500]   Yeah, there's some nice fonts and Samsung has a font tool that lets you change the font globally
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:27.180]   There is a series of apps that are really nice apps
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:32.580]   Designed to change the UI on your Samsung phone in a lot of dramatic ways
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:36.900]   It there it's a it's called Samsung unlock. I can't remember the name of it
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:42.980]   But I always download those and put the the latest versions of those and that's where you get those is the Samsung store
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:47.140]   So I know I think at this point I you know
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:54.740]   I don't use Samsung gallery or Samsung mail or Samsung messages. They're all way too close to the Google offerings. I don't use those
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:49:00.940]   But I but you know you can disable them and they're they can't uninstall you can disable them and put them aside in effect
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.980]   I really like Samsung phones are the cameras are great
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:10.420]   The where they're really excel is the screens. They have the best screens anywhere. Yeah, so
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:15.260]   Because they do that beyond the phone that yeah, yeah
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:19.660]   Somebody saying Carson saying Sam somebody this guy named
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:27.060]   Remember him. Yeah, I used to work here. He's the guy with the mask. Yeah, Samsung health is better than Google fit
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:29.660]   I would argue that's true. I think you're right. It's fact
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:37.180]   It's not all that Google fit is like come away and talk you about it. Yeah, and Samsung owns a lot of
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:44.020]   Fitness hardware, right? So it makes sense that they would integrate in better perhaps Google unfit
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.460]   Says Zephyr in our chat room
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:52.700]   Google has announced that they are going to keep employees home until next summer
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:56.900]   This is the most aggressive of all the Silicon Valley
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:02.140]   Companies, you know Twitter said you never have to come back Apple's starting to bring people back
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.940]   Google says, you know, we don't know what's gonna happen
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:08.140]   So why don't you just stay home till summer 2021? Why? Yep
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:13.060]   Is that is that is that scary to you all when when you read that headline?
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:19.860]   Just just to think about the ramifications behind it. This is a big company that clearly has enough
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:24.100]   manpower, I shouldn't say manpower enough resources to
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:28.740]   Get a lot of things done remotely and they are already just saying you know
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:34.860]   It's not even worth having our team meetings here together for camaraderie and get the brains together and think
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:41.420]   about the next big project and you know all of those creative juices now y'all just stay home stay home until next year
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:46.620]   Yeah, just stay home to next year that that that scares me a little bit when I think about just
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:52.460]   Day-to-day life, you know what we're dealing with you know, I'm sorry. I think it's the right move
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:54.540]   I think I mean I am not optimistic
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:57.340]   like then like
[00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:01.900]   You know, it's think about business travel because I haven't been in a trip in forever, but it's because
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:09.820]   It's not safe and I don't think it'll be safe for probably until early next year or even this time next year
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.900]   Madonna says we have a vaccine
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:18.460]   Yeah, and I think that given the lack of trust we have with our government with
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:24.940]   Everything else. I think we're just gonna be hanging out for a while. That's what scares me would be Google saying
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:28.780]   Let's all go back next week. That would scare me another way to look at it
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:33.180]   Is I saw and one of the maybe was that story, but one of the stories about it, which made me feel
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:38.700]   A little miller about it. It was what they were saying was the talent Google is its talent
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:41.900]   And so Google had to be able to say to people
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.540]   uh, we respect
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:48.780]   Your your safety and we know you need some firm answers to know where you're gonna be
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:52.300]   So we're just gonna do the thing that's probably right for you now
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:56.940]   And it may maybe what I'm saying is maybe less a prediction and more a benefit
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.380]   so I will say in
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:03.420]   in adding on to this
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:05.180]   the um
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:08.300]   This isn't a silicon valley company, but it's a huge company zemons
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:12.300]   Uh german company 300,000 people last week
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:19.660]   They said that they were going to make the establish mobile working as a core component of its new normal
[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.940]   They will make it permanent. Yeah both during the pandemic and beyond
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:28.220]   I think that's what's gonna gonna be the upshot of all this. Yes. Yeah, and I really enjoyed
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:29.900]   I
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:36.620]   I liked the way they talk about it because they talk about it as a continuation of what digitization has wrought
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:43.980]   So the pandemic is a forcing function that is pushing people out of the office because they don't really need to be there every single day
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:46.220]   and
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:48.780]   I want to find the quote because it was really good
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:53.660]   Is forcing function a term you just made up or is that a is that a standard business?
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:57.020]   No, that's a term that that's I've not that I like that
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.660]   That's oh, yes you are
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:02.300]   I'm one of the few people that
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:08.140]   That think that meetings are okay in person as long as they're productive meetings
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:13.980]   When I started at twit one of the first things I remember remarking on was we just had a meeting and holy
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:20.540]   Holy crap. We got stuff done in the meeting. You know, everybody was in person. We've hashed everything out and
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:25.180]   The ideas were bouncing off and it just felt like a productive use of time
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:30.780]   and I'd like to think that a lot of the bigger companies are able to do just that in person instead of
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:38.460]   Uh, it's not the same as being remote other people will argue and say yeah, we can just do it remotely and have that same energy and same
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:41.020]   uh attention span
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:48.780]   I don't know. I I don't know because I know how people's attention spans are just watching youtube videos, you know, you get two minutes and
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:51.580]   You're looking away, you know, right?
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:55.820]   But you before you came to twit how long were you working on your own?
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:01.100]   Excuse me before I came to twit. I was in it for
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:10.060]   17 years 18 years something like that were you and were you full time employed in it before you came right and so I thought you
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:12.300]   I thought you were independent and before
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:15.260]   Well, I was still independent on the side
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:23.820]   Was I right I got I got I didn't realize that and so in my it experience there were a lot of meetings that were a total
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.940]   Waste of time and right and they would happen
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:35.740]   Way too often and then we would try to try to get things and move them to doing uh, what do you call them scrams the little 10 minute scrams
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:39.260]   Stand up, right those were somewhat better
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:44.780]   But a lot of times it was just it was a waste of time and I used to hate downs like man
[00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:50.060]   Why are all of these meetings that could have been handled over a quick phone call to the three people involved?
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:54.540]   You know or just an email just to say hey, this is what I need done
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:58.300]   This is when I need it done and this is who I need to do it
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:03.740]   In the story, you know, because the meetings were just sort of political and just him hauling and just
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:06.700]   a waste of time and when I came to twit
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:12.300]   I'm dead serious. We went into that conference room back there and we hashed out some things and
[00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:18.780]   I just started and everything just made perfect sense and everything just tied together and it blew my mind
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:23.740]   And I said something to one of the staff there and they laughed and it's like no, we always have fun in these speed
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:27.100]   It's not like no, we really got some stuff done in here. I'm not used to that
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:32.780]   So there's two things I hear a lot from people uh about office culture
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:35.260]   Well, actually there's quite a few in fact we're reading a book
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:41.340]   A number of books about office culture and how it's a perversion and uh all sorts of things
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:43.900]   But two things I hear all the time meetings are number one
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:51.900]   Everybody hates meetings number two is the employee who wanders around who doesn't seem to have anything to do but manages to screw you up
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:55.020]   By coming over and talking to you. Mm, right?
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:58.620]   You know the the time wasting employee
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:02.940]   But I have to say there are definite downsides karsten if you had a choice of working at home
[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:06.780]   Which you're doing right now or coming back and working in the studio, which would you prefer?
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.500]   I would bet he'd prefer to work in the studio. So there are
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:15.260]   Collaborative things that happen at work that are positive. I think there's positives and negatives
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:22.060]   There are times when that collaborative energy is just so much better in a studio or not studio in an office environment
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:24.460]   Sometimes I'd be that though this particular business we're in
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.820]   Uh lens itself better than that than other businesses
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:32.060]   I don't know and I don't think they're gonna get rid of that like for now because of the coronavirus
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:35.420]   I think it's good that google said this and gave a long time frame, right?
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:39.740]   I do think that the future of work is going to we'll see more
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:42.220]   Focus on
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:45.420]   Yeah, like half and half time or whatever. That's what person wants
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:51.980]   But yeah, okay. So as the boss though, I interpret that as karsten wants to work half as much and get paid the same
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:54.620]   No, that's silly
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:57:02.060]   No, I'll just tell you the boss point of view and I think it's not always wrong is that people don't work as hard at home
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:06.620]   Come on. I know you don't i've heard that. No, I work twice as hard at home
[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:12.300]   When I like a giga home and and part of it is the nature of the job. You do have to think about your writers
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:18.140]   But I mean I worked so hard. I worked like 12 hour days
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:23.260]   And when I was in the office, you know, I got half as much done because I was I was in meetings
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:26.940]   It's hard to get stuff done at the office because the meetings in that time wasted and commutes
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:29.020]   I had a three and a half commute every day
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:34.140]   But as a boss, I think that there's also this concern. I'm not looking at this person
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:39.580]   I don't know what they're doing. I think that is the wrong metric and I think that is so much
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:45.580]   I think that's actually a negative that speaks more to you and your insecurities than it does to the
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:51.180]   It's not just me by the way. It's a general feeling among all employers
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:55.820]   I am a boss. I employ someone I never see this. I've worked with
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:58:01.340]   In your business you could do that because there's a distinct product that either gets delivered or not
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:08.140]   There's there's in most businesses. There's some sort of metrics and if your metric is is that person's but in the chair
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:12.460]   Then that's the wrong metric wrong metric. It depends on the business. It seriously does it
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:17.500]   Yes, if you're the person who greets people at the front of an office, then yes the but in the
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:21.180]   Or if your customer service representative, I think there are a lot of jobs
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:23.260]   where
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:28.460]   You know, I agree. I think the factory floor is a bad metaphor for especially for information work
[00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:30.940]   And it is so I agree
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:36.540]   But I also understand that there's this kind of you know, I find it hard to work as hard at home
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:39.740]   And see I don't I don't
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:44.540]   I remember when all of this went down most of my professional career
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:48.620]   Ended up being a remote work from home full-time because
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:54.060]   One of my managers bosses or whatever came up and sat with me one day
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:59.580]   And realized you know what this dude gets so many interruptions that has nothing to do with him
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:01.740]   Yeah, you do eliminate that
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:07.420]   You know, what what are we doing? And didn't he would get the emails from something that I had
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:12.060]   Done from home later on that night because it was on my brain. I didn't have anything else to do
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:14.940]   So I just did a little bit of work didn't bother me any
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:21.180]   And he's like wow you you just you get a lot done when you're not here and I said, yeah, I know
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:24.380]   Let's think about though the jobs that are done at google
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:29.980]   Um engineering some engineering is physical you have to be and the server
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:36.860]   Right, uh, so let's that's so that's those people have to go to work our engineers have to come to work
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:38.700]   um
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.060]   coding
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:41.260]   so
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:46.540]   Coding is a lot like writing in one respect because a lot of time is spent. Solidarily typing
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:51.420]   But there is also a very big especially in big projects collaborative
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:56.540]   Side decoding now there are a lot of tools and coding that are designed to make that easier
[00:59:56.540 --> 01:00:02.380]   Remotely, but I think there I think a lot of coders benefit from sitting across from or being in the
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:09.340]   Room with or at least having meetings with people who are working on a similar project or the same project that that's valuable
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:11.420]   Maybe not. I don't know
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.420]   Now I
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.420]   Go on. No you go ahead
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:19.260]   I was going to say when kevin and I collaborate we do it
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:23.500]   We just set up a video and we we have time set aside
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:26.460]   To interface that way and I think if you have
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:29.740]   Time set aside for your group to get together
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:33.900]   Like to truly focus together and you limit that to like an hour
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:39.660]   That's important, but you don't physically have to be in the same place. You just have to make
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:46.380]   Time for it and you have to use that time efficiently and I think what happens in big companies
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:51.020]   Is your meetings are not that time because they're taken over by politics
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:57.740]   And that's what the idea of like I walk around and I talk to someone and we get more productive because we're in the same place
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.060]   that's because
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:02.700]   You're just in the same place and you're taking your
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:10.380]   Your jiu jitsuing you're using that time to do the thing that those meetings were probably supposed to be designed for it does that make sense?
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:11.900]   Yeah
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:12.700]   It does
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:15.580]   Boss advantage editor the examiner when I was there in san francisco
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:20.140]   Yelled at me one day. He said because he sees me looking around the office and looking for gossip
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:24.460]   David Jarvis. I pay you to be the town crier. Not the office crier. Oh, I like it
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:26.540]   Yeah
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:31.180]   Yeah, I used to have my my publisher used to when I was at a business journal
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:36.700]   My editor would be pissed if we were in the office, right? He was like, uh, why are you not like
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:39.980]   Why are you here? My publisher though
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:47.980]   Wanted our butts in the seats at 8 a.m. We would get a memo like at least once a month about the reporters the news are being totally empty
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.900]   you know
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:56.780]   At 8 a.m. In the morning and we're like dude, that's because we were at 7 a.m. Breakfast, you know with our sources and you know to it
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:03.020]   But there are people like you who are self-starters, but there are also people who aren't self-starters
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.580]   um, there are people who
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:08.140]   uh
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:15.100]   Whose job requires them to take initiative to come up with things to do things to make calls
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.820]   Uh sales is a good example salesperson
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:23.500]   A lot of that job is is calling people and staying in touch with and some people can do that
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:26.620]   I'm sure stacy could do that at home, but some people
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:30.700]   Won't do it at home like those may not get a sandwich
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:34.140]   Rather than make that card
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:37.260]   No, they don't necessarily get fired and they don't get fired in a similar way
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.820]   It's inefficient
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:43.740]   But these are not things that are deliverables, so it's hard to get a metric on it
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:50.620]   You know you do start to notice things are not going well or maybe you know, maybe the deals aren't being made that should be made that kind of thing
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:54.620]   Yeah, those are metrics eventually eventually I think it probably hurts so
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:59.340]   But why don't you think that there are a lot of employees who just aren't capable of that?
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.340]   What you're saying they should just not have jobs those people
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:04.540]   No, I'm not saying that at all
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:07.500]   Yeah, I think I think we will move to a future right now
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:12.780]   It's tough, but I think we'll move to a future where there will be a larger class of people
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:17.100]   Who will want to work from home and who can successfully work from home? Yeah?
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:19.820]   Those people are getting in good shape
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:22.460]   You know
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.100]   It's easy. Well, they have tiny apartments
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:28.940]   Right or you know, they've got five people in the house and they and they need to go out
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:31.260]   They're more efficient and I think it could be more choice involved
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:36.700]   But the interesting thing now is you already see the remote lash occurring I put in two things in the rundown
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:40.780]   Where the Wall Street Journal is just acting like well companies are saying this is not working
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:46.460]   Well, but they're missing every other factor that's involved the stress of the disease, you know sick relatives
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:49.340]   Children
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.340]   Children school
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:54.060]   Public transportation. I mean jesus. It was ridiculous
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:58.700]   The dior and then there was I put up another blog post that was kind of similar as it's all a good work
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:04.780]   We don't know yet. It's it's it's what you call it's tasty of forcing. It's also a company function
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.340]   It's also a company. I don't think there's it is
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.260]   I don't think there's is it does and it doesn't work
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:14.860]   Maybe it does work for some people it doesn't work for some people it does work for some jobs. It doesn't work for some jobs, right?
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:17.580]   What's bothersome is everybody around it?
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:21.660]   This is the dior times did a story about my old building used to be the time life building
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.060]   1271 6th avenue and
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:28.700]   Everything is closed around it and there's one hot dog. Oh, you both worked it
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.700]   That's still at that building
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:35.820]   Right. That was a great article. I didn't realize that both of you had worked there. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:40.220]   They used to sell 400 hot dogs a day now he sells 12 10 10
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:45.420]   That's that's all of this stuff went down
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:51.980]   I remember sitting my boys down to to you know to say look we need to get prepared and I will
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:58.940]   Openly admit my boys have some privilege in this, you know, they they have the resources here for us having a decent internet connection
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:03.420]   But you know being able to log into to whatever
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:08.380]   Online schooling that they need to log into they have that and I tried to tell them look
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:13.500]   I want you to get used to this because this may be the norm not just not just for school
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:17.180]   But when you're out of school and you get into the professional world and start working
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:21.420]   You know, I tried to stress to them that most of your childhood most of your life
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:25.100]   You've seen me working in the house somewhere, you know
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:28.460]   Just just sitting at a desk for eight to 12 hours in a day
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:33.820]   Working you need to get used to that. I wasn't necessarily getting up and going to the office all the time
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:40.300]   Understand that it takes some some self-discipline to get up and put some clothes on not necessarily a t-shirt
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:45.820]   Or sweatpants like what I have on today, but I would typically put on regular clothes
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:50.540]   As if I was going to the office and I was literally just turning the corner in my house
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:55.100]   And sit down and work so it's definitely going to take a little bit of training
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:06:00.220]   Um for the future generations to try to you know get their minds and wrap around it
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:03.020]   It's going to be challenging because everybody's not wired that way
[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:08.780]   I have family members that they're struggling with it right now for 80d reasons or whatever, you know
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:11.580]   So this is and I would also say
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:16.220]   For some people like I get migraines right obviously yo, I've got one now
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:23.180]   When they were super bad, I would sit at my desk and I could still work not at 100
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:25.580]   But I could still work
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.740]   And I couldn't do that
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:34.620]   At a normal office if I had to go in like commuting into a physical location where I couldn't control things would be too bad
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:38.940]   And so like I would have a hard time if I weren't allowed to work remotely
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.500]   Probably holding down a job
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:44.540]   Despite the fact that I'm super hard worker and I think I'm pretty good at what I do
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:49.100]   But you wouldn't want to hire me because you know, I'd be calling out sick like twice a week
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.940]   Um
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:54.460]   But you know when I was at home, I could just and there there were days I'd do this
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:59.660]   I'd be typing stories and then I'd throw up and then I'd finish my story and then I'd go
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:05.340]   They down and you know, you can't do that in the office. I don't know. I mean, so there's lots of people who
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:08.140]   Working from home actually helps them
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.340]   One one concern
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:15.260]   And then this was the the New York times article about the time and life building is
[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:21.420]   That this might be a harbinger for what will happen to cities that there might be an exodus
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:26.700]   Out of cities has been for years a trend of people moving to the cities
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:34.220]   Do you think that's uh reasonable that I know from New Jersey friends of mine who are and and spouses of friends who are real estate agents
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:38.140]   They're selling houses out here on the berbs like hotcakes at a certain price point
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:42.620]   Um colleagues of mine who would never think of coming new jersey are now
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:44.780]   2
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.820]   Yeah, yeah
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.580]   And then they came back to the city
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:53.260]   So that's the question is they going because of covid and will they come back after covid or have they found a new way of living?
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:55.980]   I think there's some there's a there's a
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:03.980]   Group of people who enjoy being in a city and will stay there for a while and I think maybe it's age dependent
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.060]   Maybe it's wealth dependent. I don't know
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.100]   Um, and then taste I miss it, but my wife wouldn't do it
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:12.300]   Yeah
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:16.140]   I would live in New York if I could but my husband would just divorce me and I like to
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:23.180]   I would like to live in New York too, but my wife won't let me so the three of us should we can make it a tv show
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:25.340]   the three of us living in a
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:33.420]   Liqueur mr. George or walk up. I really like New York, but you can keep it. Yeah, I'm not living next happy in petaluma or
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:36.380]   You know, he likes the farm country. I like it here. Yeah
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:41.900]   Um, I would move to I would live in Manhattan actually every once in a while. Lisa teases me. She says
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:46.140]   Now I don't get all excited, but you know, I think I maybe would like to live in Manhattan
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:48.380]   It's like what and then you know
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:51.820]   So pretty she thinks it smells
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:54.060]   I've as I've been
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:56.060]   I
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:01.420]   I like the subways or cleaner. I like yeah, I remember visiting our buddy dan and
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:06.940]   Right in the taxi to his neighborhood in in Brooklyn somewhere back when he used to live there
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:14.540]   There was a pigeon that I saw on the side of the road and I I swear that pigeon had a cape on
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:17.820]   It was actually just trash just drink to the pigeon
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:21.980]   It was super pigeon
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:26.460]   Is cape said nestling
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:30.300]   And poop on them
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:36.140]   Come on. What is going on here? That would be a dramatic demographic shift though if people fled the cities
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:37.580]   Uh, yeah
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:44.060]   I what I fear is that people too portively the cities will end up the cities will be where you end up
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:50.780]   Uh, if you are economically disadvantaged. Oh my gosh, it'll be just like white flight way back in the day. Yeah
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:53.660]   I mean, that's right
[01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:57.100]   From suburbs. Yeah, uh today
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:02.860]   In staity redlining and saying the poor people won't live next to you when your house price is going to go up as a result
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:06.220]   You're welcome. That's where we are now. Oh lord
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:11.260]   Yeah, it was bad. It's one of the worst things he's ever time. I'm gonna say something cheerful
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:20.460]   Google is putting in a new underwater cable connecting the us to the uk in this spain and they're going to name it the gracehopper
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:23.260]   Yeah, she's a cable folks
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:30.540]   I wouldn't mind having a cable named after me the jeff javus. It'd be it'd be a grumpy cable
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:33.020]   Yeah, it would be
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:38.620]   16 fiber pairs of 32 fibers. That's a lot of bandwidth
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.380]   When you think that every individual fiber
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:46.540]   Can carry the entire telephone traffic of mother's day in the United States
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:50.380]   Well in the old days when it okay telephone traffic
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:53.580]   I know
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:55.660]   That's a
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:11:00.220]   That's the stat I would use on live with regis and kelly. Did you know regis
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:04.620]   One of these fibers could carry every phone call on mother's day
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:09.820]   I want a moment for regis. Yeah, what a great guy. I uh, spectacular
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:13.980]   Did you did you get a chance to know him at all jeff? I didn't know a lot of me
[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.660]   I knew we you know we knew each other we don't you know recognize these other
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:18.940]   um
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:22.380]   After after he died. I was I said I didn't tweet this but I wanted to
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:27.420]   Every tweet that I read over the next three or four hours. I wanted to do his a regis shot
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:31.260]   Yeah, what's a gigabyte leo? What's a gigabyte?
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:35.420]   I uh, my I think it's one of the greatest bits of my career
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:39.260]   His teaching regis filled it in a text message how to tweet
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:42.700]   Okay, so it's kind of like that except instead of going just to one person
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:47.420]   Yeah, when you tweet it goes to everybody who's following you you got a lot of followers
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:50.300]   You've got hundreds of thousands of people who watch your twitter account
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:53.980]   Is that so if you type something on twitter all those people will see it
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:55.260]   Well, who's been talking to these people?
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:56.780]   I think that's really
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:57.820]   I think that's really well
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:58.780]   Kelly talks a lot
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:01.980]   I want to be a part of your on this is the web page the twitter web page now
[01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:04.380]   Well, it looks different now to this is 2011
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:07.020]   We have to deal with a lot of different devices, but you can also do it right from the computer
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:11.180]   So you see there it says what's happening in that box there. That's where your tweet goes
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:12.300]   Hey, what's happening?
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:17.180]   Yeah, so now a tweet could be anything it could be I just you know had a great interview with uh, steven
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:21.340]   Even the music reflects an innocent more innocent more upbeat happier here
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:27.260]   The idea is it should be the best part was after after Regis tweeted and by the way
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.220]   Getting him to tweet was painful. He types
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:35.660]   So very very slowly it went to me because i'm following you now
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:38.060]   Somebody's not following you
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:40.780]   But the best part and I don't know if we got it as part of the segment
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:43.820]   He had that day
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:45.980]   I know where no one knew was going to do it
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:51.340]   um announced on the show that he was going to retire which is a big big deal this back in 2011
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:58.060]   And I remember I'd been doing this show for 10 years and the number one fear everybody had all the producers all the staff
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:00.380]   The camera operators the crew
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:07.420]   Is please don't retire reach because they thought if Regis retires the show is over it's never right and Regis the show
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:09.500]   It was his show he created
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:15.420]   So they were terrified and so that day and they're all like ashen that Regis says because they didn't he didn't warn him
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.860]   I'm going to retire it wasn't going to be for months and that was his tweet
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:23.900]   Was I today? I announced my retirement and he starts getting all these tweets back
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:33.500]   Just tweet after tweet back now. This is a guy who's been on television that's 17 000 hours of live television more the world record holder
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.100]   uh
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.060]   He
[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:38.940]   For 50 60 years he'd be on live tv
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:41.740]   But for some reason all those tweets coming in
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:48.300]   Bloom away just tickled him. He this is the moment. I'll never forget he jumps on the phone. He calls his wife joy
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:54.140]   Says joy joy. Look at the twitter. They're tweeting at me. He was so excited
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:57.180]   That he was tweeting
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:02.700]   He was a he was a great guy. I mean his his persona was this irascible kind of
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:06.860]   Every man who you know was irritated at life. What's that gigabyte?
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:12.380]   Uh and some of that was an act some of it was genuine, but he was he was a real sweetie and uh
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.660]   I was a real honor to get to work with him for many many
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.300]   I somebody I couldn't find it
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.740]   I looked I
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:23.260]   Googled and I found someone had quoted in a biography of
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:28.060]   Regis my review and I said he was a game show host with no prizes
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:31.820]   That's perfect
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:34.220]   Brilliant. Yeah, he didn't need prizes. No
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:38.380]   No, he was he was a real character. It was always a lot of fun
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:44.540]   You were talking about cables. Yes, and I need you guys to explain something to me because this this this story struck me as
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:48.700]   I need to understand why it's not the utter BS. I think it is
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:54.780]   What's the quantum internet? Oh, I think this is BS too and I got a lot of heat for saying that
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:15:03.420]   Stacy will try to defend it. If you're still sending data, what does a quantum computer have to do with it?
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:06.060]   Stacy's gonna tell me where i'm all wrong and stupid here
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:09.820]   But it made no sense to me and the story didn't explain it at all
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:13.260]   It was a poorly written a story in the washington post
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.020]   Stacy
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:19.020]   And I think that that was part of the problem was that the person who was writing it
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:22.060]   But the story was about how they
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:25.020]   Stacy's looking for it in the rundown. I think the federal government
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:29.820]   Donated not donated. It's never a donation the federal government is spending
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.860]   700 million dollars a year to develop
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:39.900]   And this was the headline of the story a hacker proof quantum internet a second internet
[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:42.780]   No, okay. Why does it work?
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:50.060]   Yeah, this is with um quantum computing. I think and I have not let me I'll read I'll read it to you Stacy. So you don't have
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:51.020]   There we go
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:53.020]   Um, I'll read you a couple of the things
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:56.380]   That boggled my mind and made now look people
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:16:01.500]   People messaged me as if I had no idea what a cube it was or what quantum computing was
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:04.860]   It's how many how many of you 40 of them make an arm Noah?
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:08.780]   No, I know what a cube it is. I know a quantum computing is I'm well aware of that
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:13.100]   I know they've even made quantum computers. It's not that but it's a quite a leap
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:15.900]   from these very relatively
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:22.060]   Simple a primitive quantum computers to a second internet that is hacker proof
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:29.900]   One of the reasons this reporter must have gotten this wrong jean whelan writing in the washington post a quantum internet
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:35.500]   relies on photons exhibiting a quantum state known as entanglement
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:39.100]   Which allows them to share information over long distances
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.900]   Without having a physical connection
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:44.060]   No sense
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:46.060]   You're right jeff that doesn't make sense
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:52.380]   So there have been research so there's been research into quantum entanglement as a method of
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.100]   transmitting information
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:56.700]   and
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:02.940]   They may be talking about that. So that isn't actually quantum computing that is that is
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:09.420]   And if you if you do if you google like quantum entanglement and I just pulled up the report from the doe
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:15.100]   I'm looking at the blueprint. So what they're talking about isn't quantum computing. It's
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:16.860]   it's
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:21.900]   Information transfer via quantum entanglement, right and that is so nascent
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:25.660]   Um, so it's not bs, but it is not like real yet
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:30.140]   If that helps. Yeah, it's it's fairly speculative
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:34.460]   They also say and I love this it'll be hacker proof
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:38.620]   Because of the hasenberg uncertainty principle
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:42.300]   The networks promise to be more secure some say unhackable
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:46.540]   Because of the nature of photons and other quantum bits known as qubits
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:52.620]   Any attempt to observe or disrupt these particles would automatically alter their state
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:55.740]   And destroy the information being transmitted
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:18:01.340]   This is true. Uh, this is true, but this is not going to make it a secure network
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:03.900]   It just makes it a very easily disrupted network
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:06.780]   So yeah
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:14.220]   There's there's legitimate fears about quantum computing killing encryption
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:18.380]   That's legitimate because they're potentially very powerful. Yeah, so much man
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:25.020]   No, no, this is an announcement the governor prittsker jb prittsker of illinois the mayor of chicago lory lightfoot
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:27.420]   Are at a we're at a big announcement
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:29.580]   Uh in chicago
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.420]   Because the d oa
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:38.940]   The d the d oe is going to fund this new second internet the second unhackable quantum entangled internet
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:44.060]   Uh, they're getting of course the people who are most excited about this or the scientists are getting money for it
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:49.980]   Uh, they'd quote a professor at the prittsker school of molecular engineering at the argon national lab
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:54.460]   Calling the internet project a pillar of the nation's quantum research program
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:19:00.220]   David ouchlam said it's the birth of a new technology. It's becoming a global competition every
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:04.380]   Major country on earth has launched a quantum program. We have a quantum gap
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:07.900]   Because it's becoming clear and clear there will be big impacts
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:09.500]   um
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:12.860]   Now and then I think the reporter just kind of spun up some
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:21.660]   Crazy stuff like eventually computers might also tap into the quantum internet to buy products with less risk of their credit card details being hacked
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:26.860]   Or do that that's just trying to make it relatable. That's the dead baby right there is that what?
[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:29.500]   I was about to say there's your dead baby
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.580]   It's possible
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:37.900]   Consumers will surf seamlessly between the regular and quantum internets as they make purchases and send information
[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:43.260]   Without necessarily knowing whether they're switching platforms. I honestly think this guy is
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:47.580]   News. Oh, okay. So here's here's some good articles that are going to help
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:55.740]   Add context and make this less bse perhaps come back to me. Where's our chat? Where where should I put this?
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:58.460]   I can't I can't multi task today
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.100]   There's an article or 2018
[01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:03.740]   Here is the actual paper
[01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:07.740]   That the article is referencing
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:09.980]   um
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:13.100]   That'll help I got I got your link from the chat room. That's good
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:19.580]   Yeah, sorry. I'm not great and you're talking about this is and we actually did this story when this happened google
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:23.980]   claimed a breakthrough in uh and quantum
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:33.100]   Research but no no that google's doing the computing. Oh, this is this is so entanglement is there
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:37.500]   So that's spooky action at a distance is what you what they usually call it
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.460]   here's
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:46.460]   Essentially, I will tell you by the way. I know all about this. I read all about this. I'm not ignorant
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:49.980]   Uh, the notion is that two particles at a distance can
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:55.500]   Effect each other without any communication in between. That's why it's spooky
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:21:00.300]   But the idea the notion of for instance a national backbone spanning
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:07.340]   3,500 miles with particles spookily interacting with each other just seems a little far-fetched
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:12.860]   Yeah, so that's what I was thinking this the last thing I sent from 2017
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:18.540]   And this is I think is the last time I really paid attention to this was researchers transmitting data
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.540]   to
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:22.540]   Using photons that were
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:29.500]   Up to 1200 kilometers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no they can do it. It's like teleportation
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:33.900]   Yeah, but but how many bits of data did they send just out of curiosity?
[01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:36.460]   Not a lot
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:39.100]   To make it
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.900]   more useful
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:47.660]   Because they they the lifespan of that intent they only stay entangled together for like
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:52.300]   Not even a second like it says this article says a quarter of a millisecond
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.780]   So then you need a lot of repeaters to be like
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:22:00.860]   By the way, those repeaters have not yet been invented. That was also in the article
[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:05.340]   So there's kind of a critical piece of technology that doesn't actually exist
[01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:12.380]   But I wouldn't call it bs. I would call the like speculative whatever highly speculative. Yeah, but it sounded to me like it was
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:16.460]   We have an internet. It's like we have a store, but it has blockchain
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:20.940]   Yeah, right. It just sounded like it was somebody quantum is the new blockchain for sure
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:30.620]   But it's really important research and the reason the reason this is important is because we've moved from electrons to light with the internet, right?
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:32.860]   So electrons
[01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:39.180]   Yay, they do it. It's not the same way. It's not light in the same way that a fiber cable is light. Well, hold on
[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:42.380]   That's where I'm going. Okay, so we've got fiber and photons
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:47.900]   And then the next stage to get even faster and and do this even better would be
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:50.060]   Quantum
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:57.260]   The problem is and so that's where this research is going. It's like, oh, what's the next faster thing because how is that faster than the speed of light?
[01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:59.900]   Um
[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:08.060]   It's instantaneous. Yeah, it's like blue. That's why it's spookier. The millisecond. That's be me up Scotty. Yeah, speak is spooky
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:14.060]   As far as I know it's instantaneous. You don't have to be physically connected. That's crazy
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:20.060]   Because of the spooky. I'm the fuddled. That's the spooky. It's okay. All right
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:25.740]   Oh, and you can only do one calculation at a time. There's all sorts of limits to this
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.340]   Um
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:30.140]   So skype won't run any better. Yeah, it's a very
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:34.540]   Of course you should do blues. You should do research on this. No one's saying you shouldn't
[01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:41.340]   It's a little early to talk about the next internet as a result. Yeah, it's but that's how you try to make it relate up
[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:46.380]   Right. I mean, right as someone like I I've written entire articles about using the
[01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:51.100]   Uh, uh, the spinning of photons in an electron
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.900]   No, sorry the spinning of electrons in an atom
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:59.900]   And building like a whole new semiconductor based off of that and there's actual research happening around that
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:04.700]   But you know when I tell someone like that your eyes are going to glaze over you're gonna be like who cares
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:09.660]   But if I say it's for the quantum internet, it's the next big thing then you're gonna be like yay
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:14.460]   And if you're still glazing over i'll tell you that you can buy something out of store securely and then you'll be like
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:16.540]   Oh, that's cool. That relates to my life
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:19.180]   I appreciate you just
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:21.180]   Is this a donation?
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:27.900]   None of this stuff makes any sense to me, but it's also made it relatable significantly. It would be significantly
[01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:30.140]   faster
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:33.100]   Uh at higher data density and theory
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:37.420]   Uh, I don't know if it's higher data density. I think it's faster
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:41.980]   Because you can know two things at the same time in two different place. You can know one thing
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:48.220]   Here it is. You can know one thing in two different places at the exact same time. Right?
[01:24:49.020 --> 01:25:00.140]   Well, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you've just broken the laws of physics. You've you've gone beyond this. Like, cool. That's what that's why i'm just i'm just i'm I
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:06.380]   Hmm they did it between the earth and a satellite it's one hundred three kilometers
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:10.460]   That's why this is neat is because you can that's what
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:16.140]   That's what quantum entanglement is. It's this weird spooky stuff
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:20.540]   I guess I should celebrate that the government is planning to spend a billion dollars a year to develop this
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:24.860]   I would guess that the government bureaucrats who signed off on that
[01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:31.420]   Sign off with the belief that the Chinese are very close to getting a quantum internet so we better have ours
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:38.220]   Rather than this is blue sky scientific research is fantastic and make might actually deliver something
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.860]   Because it's a lot easier to convince
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:45.340]   Government bureaucrats to sign off. Are you sure this isn't an act from david copperfield? It sounds
[01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:48.220]   It sounds hard to believe but it's
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:50.380]   Read the papers jeff they are real
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:53.740]   The I mean this is actual science. It's actual physics
[01:25:53.740 --> 01:26:01.260]   Is it something we can control a deal with today? No, but is there someone at google who's paid to think about these things and look at it?
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:03.900]   unfortunately
[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:07.900]   Unfortunately according to the dog
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:13.820]   The real problem is the photon loss in the channel which scales exponentially
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:16.380]   with the channel length
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:18.380]   So that's why getting any decent distances
[01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:21.900]   Incredibly difficult you could only obtain
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:30.060]   10 to the minus 12 to photon coincidence events per second in other words the bit rates kind of low
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:35.740]   But I don't know I think it's interesting and at least it's not going to be hackable
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:44.140]   Yay, somebody's feeding a bunch of a bunch of hooey. I think to that watching a general reporter
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:49.020]   Hooey, it's just theoretical physics. Yeah, it's hard
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:54.620]   It's not even theoretical. It's actually it's who we to say it won't be hackable because
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:59.980]   Of the heisenberg uncertainty principle. That's hooey. Yeah, well you could just throw it. Well
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:03.980]   Maybe I don't know. I don't have that sort of
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:08.300]   Sounds like hooey to me. Are you ready?
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:12.300]   Play the drums it's time for the google change law
[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:15.820]   The google change log
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:21.500]   Carsten says that was trotting trottingers dog barking earlier
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:27.980]   Now we don't know if he's dead or not. We'll never know she's alive. She's alive. Hallelujah
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:32.620]   Google messages now let you reply with emoji reactions
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:35.580]   Well, it's about time
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:44.140]   Compare this to apple which allows you to apply with messages with fireworks balloons hearts beating hearts
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:47.500]   All kinds of things now we can send an emoji use long press
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:52.780]   The message you have to be using messages for android the google app you long press the message
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:55.340]   And you can send an emoji
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:57.340]   I feel like
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:03.100]   Friends the people on iPhones will now suddenly get written out things stay seat just to set heart on this
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:09.900]   This actually is useful. We use this a lot. I use this in my family and I even at work a lot people we do it on the
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:13.900]   Uh, you know, what's your call it?
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:17.420]   What's wrong with my brain? What is that slack?
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:22.300]   We do it on slack where if where if I send a message somebody and they say okay instead of responding okay
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:27.100]   They'll put a thumbs up on that kind of thing. It's handy. Yep. It's handy. I guess
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:29.980]   They're also adding a new feature to smart reply
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:36.060]   Which automatically suggests emoji stickers in addition to just text
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.700]   This will only be available in english
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:41.100]   so
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:46.060]   Uh, how you doing? I'm okay hanging in there. I miss you so much and it suggests a weeping cat
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:50.140]   I get the weeping cat a lot. I don't know why
[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:58.140]   Uh, there you'll be a new video call button and messages you can go straight to a google duo video call
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:02.460]   And a media editor you can use this is actually kind of nice to mark up photos
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:07.100]   And share them so you can put arrows who here has ever made a google google duo call
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.180]   Me
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:11.020]   We do. Oh wow. Oh
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:16.380]   I actually saw the other night because i'm on an android and some person i was talking to was on an android phone
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:24.300]   We activated and I didn't i'm sure everybody else knows this but if you're talking on the phone to someone who's on duo
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:29.420]   You can actually just swap it seamlessly to a video call. Yep. Yeah done that too
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:35.100]   I do v- google do a video calls all the time some of my family has android some my family has iphone
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:37.660]   never the twain shall meet
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:42.540]   You take the iphone and i'll take the android phone
[01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:45.820]   And i do vin scott on android devices too
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:48.380]   I mean iphone
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:52.540]   Google's motion editor helps android developers build smoother
[01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:55.340]   animations
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:57.980]   smooth jb smooth
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:03.580]   Don't know anything about this don't do android development, but if you use android studio 4.0
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:08.700]   The new motion editor will simplify the complex task of adding motion
[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:12.300]   Animation look at that you just go
[01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:16.860]   And there it is look how easy it is to make that cat bounce
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:22.060]   Easy easy. This is what it's called android studios nice. I like it
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:26.460]   We mentioned the grace hopper cable google store now does price matching
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:30.460]   I like that in the us and 23 additional
[01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:39.740]   Countries so if you go to store.google.com to buy a pixel for for instance and you notice there's a better price at best by our target or walmart
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:42.620]   Uh, you can say I demand
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:45.340]   I demand the better price in fact
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:49.820]   You can even request a credit or refund within 15 calendar days
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:55.980]   If you'll find a lower price, this is also now available. I think it smells like antitrust to me
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:31:02.620]   Giving us a deal how dare they saving consumers money what actually you have a panic stop a debt take no panic
[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:10.460]   Google launches the match up initiative for local sports. Tell you about this tell me about the match up
[01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:15.260]   so um, this is the newspaper industry after uh,
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:19.420]   30 years finally deciding that they might be able to do something together
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:24.620]   So because the the athletic has stolen all of their best writers and competes with them
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:32.460]   Now they're going to do basically a shared content and shared subscription model, uh across their sports sections
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:35.020]   Oh, that's a great idea
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:39.500]   And finally so google's not actually doing it google google gave the money a good friend of mine
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:44.860]   The local media consortium is the industry organization doing it and a friend of mine at temple university air and pilhoever
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:48.540]   Is the guy who put it together and then another friend of mine named dave garing
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:51.580]   Who runs the distributed media lab is doing it with amp
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:57.900]   Because and this is part of what amp was meant to do was to be able to seamlessly share content with the same content in multiple places
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:31:59.660]   And make it work
[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:01.980]   Uh, and so it's an effort to to you know
[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:08.860]   Create more money for the newspaper industry now. I lived through a torture in my industry many years ago called the new century network
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:15.660]   Very early on before there was a web kids. Well, was it no? I think it was after the web just after the web
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:17.740]   Um, yes, it was
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:23.340]   Uh, we were going to come with this consortium the top 12 newspaper companies most of whom are ready to die now
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:26.940]   Uh came up with a company called the new century network where they're going to share content
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:31.180]   They're going to share advertising. They're going to have one sign in they're going all kinds of beautiful things
[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:33.900]   And they couldn't get a lot and they couldn't agree and so it died
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:36.060]   So they're trying again
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:39.580]   kind of Mike orin at the dallas morning news
[01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:45.580]   Uh helps spearhead this and let's hope it works and if it does then maybe it is a solution to bringing together multiple
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:48.220]   media properties to be able to compete with
[01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:55.820]   Um, there are new kids on the block like the athletic so the way it would work you'd be reading the dallas morning news about the
[01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:58.700]   Cowboys eagles game and you'd be able to
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:03.580]   See the eagles the fillea newspapers reporting the same game
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:09.980]   Um, it will be part of existing sports pages on member sites and they're going to have a match up site
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:12.460]   Uh in early 2021 as well
[01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:17.260]   So it's not the match up was not meant intended to make any money. It's intended to benefit
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:19.820]   The newspapers which may be what dooms it
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:23.980]   Well, and how did the newspapers trust google to do that or
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:29.180]   As google gives money. Googles don't rain. Oh, that's right. It's the local media media consortium. Yeah, yeah
[01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:35.740]   And uh, you'll like this dacey youtube kids is launching the summer of movies

[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:55.340]   Collaborating

[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:14.700]   Almost anywhere where you've got teams working on projects and big or little it doesn't matter
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:16.300]   Five to five thousand
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:19.580]   Monday.com it's just the easiest way to keep everyone on track
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:24.540]   Everyone connected and you know with a lot of people working from home now you need

[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:39.660]   Sometimes you just want to be able to put your workflow on autopilot and the ability to do that without having to write code

[01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:59.020]   And now it's off CES. They've decided
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:05.020]   Virtual they're they're not that remember we thought it was really strange that CES and how they were going to
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:07.740]   uh do this
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:11.580]   Kind of mini trade show and vegas people are going to get together
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:17.260]   At I think great cost to them the cta the consumer technology association has decided
[01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:24.460]   Nope, gary shapiro the president says that every every month went by it was our hope somehow this would resolve by january
[01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:30.220]   But the assumption is there will not be a vaccine. It'll be widely available and considered safe by then
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:33.340]   At our board meeting the issue was what's the right thing to do?
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:35.820]   We're making a decision based on the right thing to do not the best
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:42.220]   Financial thing for us to do it's you know, it's got to hurt the cia because i'm sure they have hotel rooms
[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:47.100]   They've got they can't get out of contracts with the vegas convention center and other venues
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:51.740]   It's got to be tough, but I have virtually sore feet just thinking about it
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:56.780]   Well, and this is the other thing that must have figured into their thinking
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:59.420]   I don't care if they have a have a
[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:03.900]   In person event I ain't going no one I know would go right
[01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:07.740]   So you can do it, but if no one goes that's worse
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:12.300]   So i'm sure that's what that's up my problem with this is
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:15.100]   This probably won't happen with ces
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:19.340]   Um into future, you know, unless this thing gets all cleared up
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:24.300]   But I look at all the other conventions and things that are out there that I enjoy attending
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:26.220]   because of
[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:28.940]   I like the content creation side of it. It just
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:34.540]   Fires me up for some reason. I don't know. I don't sleep or anything like that. It's just I love it
[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:36.060]   I really love being there
[01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:44.220]   But I also like the network inside of it and I hope this pandemic doesn't totally kill off those conventions
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:47.740]   I don't think ces will will be going anywhere, but I think about
[01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:51.420]   Um, it don't be max and two months is going to be virtual
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:53.020]   Yeah, I know you love it
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:54.620]   And just
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:56.620]   Seeing all of the creators that I that I
[01:41:56.620 --> 01:42:04.060]   Growned to love and look up to and be able to sit down and look at me and I and talk about things and learn some things and it's
[01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:07.900]   I love that stuff. Here's some good news. You might appreciate this
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:14.540]   Keith 512 in our chat room says that in the UK on friday the snooker world championship starts
[01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:17.180]   300 people you can go watch and play snooker
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:20.940]   How about that? Is that is that the game with small pool balls?
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:25.740]   I have no idea what snooker is
[01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:31.100]   Is that I mean, it's like pool. I'm sure no one surprised my dad
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:32.940]   Yes
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:38.780]   A game played with cues on a billiard table in which the players use a cue ball white to pocket the other balls 15 red and six colored
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:40.620]   That's a lot of balls
[01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:42.860]   in a set order
[01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:44.860]   So, yes, so it is like billiards
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:50.780]   It's like it's like pool. Yeah, but it's a snooker. Oh, what is the difference between snooker and pool?
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:56.220]   Let's see the main difference is with respect to the number of balls in snooker 22 balls
[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:58.860]   Pull as you know, they're only nine
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:05.500]   And I bet the balls are a little smaller plus there is no side pocket in snooker. Oh
[01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:10.620]   Oh the Knox Harrington that sounds very British
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:16.380]   I don't think the balls are any smaller. The table is much bigger. Oh, the table's bigger. So it makes the balls look smaller
[01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:19.420]   You know, that's always been my excuse
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:27.100]   So it's it's the size of the table. That's really it's it's a it's a okay moving right along. Just
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:29.340]   Stations in too much pain to hate you
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:30.860]   Yep

[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:11.260]   You know, it's not easy, but you know what leo that's okay. I didn't do an order
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:14.940]   person woman man
[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:17.100]   camera tv
[01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:21.500]   robot usage is soaring during the pandemic oh surprise
[01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:29.180]   It's interesting. Yeah, that's what it's what um ant was saying earlier about, you know fundamental changes that are going to continue
[01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:33.420]   They'll never stop. That's right. Once it once you go robot. You never go back
[01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:40.540]   Unless there were three stories related there, which I found interesting. Well, I thought this was wild the one you posted
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:43.180]   From vogue magazine
[01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:48.300]   Yeah, I am a model and I know that artificial intelligence will eventually take my job
[01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:54.380]   I guess she what she means is deep fakes things like that, right? Yes. Yes, it's explaining
[01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:58.540]   Like you think photoshops bad wait till we create perfect people
[01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:04.140]   Yeah, that's a good point. What do you need? Uh perfect? Well, you know, I mean perfect people are very expensive
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:06.860]   Plus they're not they like drugs
[01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:15.100]   Mr. report you remember the demo in at CES that we it was no wild. Yeah, we met you knew them from france. Yep. Yep
[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:16.060]   Um
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:21.660]   It was lifelike. It was very hard to tell the difference between a regular model versus something computer generated
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:23.100]   It was beautifully done
[01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:28.620]   It was and they even built in things like, you know, hair wisp at a place and things like that
[01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:30.460]   I did ask them afterwards
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:36.460]   Uh, and they said well they actually are real people because I said is that person a to that person exist and they said yes
[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:41.020]   But what we've done is we've captured as ma'am's we've captured them and now we can make them do anything
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:48.220]   So that's my hope for twit is that we now have enough video of me that we could just completely replace me
[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:52.620]   Uh, and you'll never know the difference in fact for all you know, it already happened
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:58.620]   When's the last time you saw me in the flesh? Good point. We have no one seen you. No one has seen me
[01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:02.060]   And uh art lebadev
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:05.580]   I think I think well, it's it's it's it's what you you what you used to be on
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:12.620]   Uh, it's the instrumental branch. Yeah. Yeah, you finally finally found that even I like to think of it as an dev null show, but okay
[01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:15.020]   Thank you
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:18.780]   A russian design studio
[01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:23.180]   Art lebadev was famous for projects that really are as much art
[01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:31.100]   Events as they are actual products has developed an ai designer and for year has been passing it off as a human
[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:34.380]   I'm always wondering with art lebadev whether
[01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:41.340]   It's a anything as a prank or not. They created an ai called nikolai ironov
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:49.660]   And the ai hat was introduced as a remote employee with his own profile portfolio
[01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:52.460]   uh and
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:59.420]   All the art was generated with ai there is the portfolio. Yeah, it's in russian
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:03.420]   That looks doesn't matter doesn't matter because it's about art. Look at that
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:05.900]   So, you know what it's terrible
[01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:09.260]   So maybe there is some hope
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:13.420]   Maybe a russian style kind of
[01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:17.420]   Maybe could be has a it has a consistent
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:22.060]   Yeah, look this one's objectively bad. I would say yes
[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:27.740]   Um, you want to hit translate on that and see what that is. Yeah. Yes. Yeah
[01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:31.980]   If you had google you could just have a quick translate button right there, but no
[01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:34.460]   I don't want to give google
[01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:39.020]   It's too good for you that oh no, I don't want to use chrome because i'm special
[01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:43.740]   Uh any any stories that you all wanted to talk about that I missed
[01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:47.900]   I mentioned we'll be doing the sam sung unpack 2020

[01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:38.060]   That's the that's a conclusion. So

[01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:55.580]   There's a robot making a phone. There's a man holding glass
[01:49:55.580 --> 01:50:01.900]   There's a ball covered in paint. It was folding. It's folding glass. There's a galaxy. There's oh
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:07.020]   And that's it. I hope you cut it all there's a watch there's some buds august fifth
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:09.340]   Ta-da
[01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:10.780]   Ta-da
[01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:13.740]   All dogs in Shenzhen china will be microchipped
[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:16.780]   This year by the end of the year
[01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:20.220]   Is that good wasneac
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:22.300]   Oh wasneac. I didn't do that story. You're right
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:25.500]   Steve wasneac suing youtube
[01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:31.340]   Because youtube ignored his pleas for months that they take down
[01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:38.140]   A spam video pretending to be from him. It was another one of those double your bitcoin
[01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:40.700]   scams
[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:47.100]   So now he he and uh, doesn't other uh plaintiffs are are suing youtube they will lose because of
[01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:49.100]   the
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:50.540]   section 230
[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:53.500]   But I think it's more about bringing attention to this
[01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:57.020]   Problem his wife Janet was his wife Janet went no well
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:51:04.380]   Uh, had been calling youtube for months saying take this thing down and she said you couldn't eat you know human nobody ever answers
[01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:06.940]   I appreciate
[01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:11.820]   Mr. Wasneac going about it the way he did instead of using the power of was
[01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:16.300]   You know, he went at his good points just like any other person would that
[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:19.660]   Have an assimilate issue, you know, we didn't try to jump through
[01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:23.500]   Um jump over anybody's head or anything to get it done
[01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:31.020]   He went about it the right way and it just proved the point that yeah youtube and a lot of the tech companies need to fix this problem far is
[01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:34.140]   Their ai is catching this or that but
[01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:38.940]   Sometimes you need some type of human interaction when it comes to actual service
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:42.700]   He pointed out twitter took down those bitcoin scams in a matter of minutes
[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:48.460]   But uh youtube has it's been it had been going on for months. He says uh, we wouldn't be here
[01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:51.340]   If youtube had acted quickly to stop this
[01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:54.780]   Always our hero the was
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:52:02.940]   I am going to do one dumb story one dumb story coming up. This is the new feature on the show one dumb story
[01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:03.980]   Dumb story
[01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:05.980]   That was we've got past quantum internet
[01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:07.820]   um
[01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:11.100]   Why would you do buy a device to block the microphone on euro?
[01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:15.340]   Why would you just not have an old right? Uh, I I
[01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:21.260]   Well, especially since all echoes have a button on them to mute them
[01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:27.260]   But apparently if you don't trust that they're being muted and it's true
[01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:34.460]   Which is a little weird that if you try to talk to a muted google home, which also has that button the google home would say
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:38.620]   Try it. I can't hear you right now because i'm muted
[01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:43.020]   But wait a minute. How did you know I was talking to you?
[01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:49.580]   They have a local wake word detection all of them have local wake word detection and then they send it to the clouds
[01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:54.780]   So what's happening? So they're not really muting it. They're just not saying to the cloud which they say they don't do anyway
[01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:56.860]   Unless you say the wake word
[01:52:56.860 --> 01:53:03.580]   So I guess how would they tell if you were saying the wake word if they didn't have the ability to detect it though
[01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:05.660]   Well, the mute should just turn off the microphone
[01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:08.220]   Period
[01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:14.220]   Yeah, I thought mute mute right what they're saying is well mute means we just don't send it to the cloud
[01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:17.340]   That's not what people think of when you press a mute button
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:18.860]   Is that still true?
[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:20.860]   Try it's mute it and talk to it
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:26.460]   What do you know?
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:30.220]   Yeah, my google doesn't talk to me when I mute them mine does or maybe
[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:32.860]   It's the weather everybody at home try that
[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:36.540]   Actually, oh god. I'm so sorry you guys. Oh, they just did
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:38.540]   it
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:44.220]   I'm sorry y'all I
[01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:53.180]   I love this. All right. All right. All right time for our anybody else any other dumb stories
[01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:57.580]   Nope, I'm out of dumb stories for our pick of the week
[01:53:57.580 --> 01:54:02.460]   And i'm a lovely one. I'm gonna start this week's pick of the weeks with steve
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:04.860]   See you think about them

[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:24.540]   Is it an IOT think and you control from your phone space?
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:27.020]   I can't control it through my phone
[01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:29.500]   Does it heat and vibrate?
[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:31.740]   It heats and bubbles
[01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:39.100]   Now the cool thing about this apparently is that the water stays hot and it actively heats the water for you
[01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:41.260]   Because some apparently don't
[01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:43.260]   Nice and those have gotten better over the years
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:48.620]   And so the bubbles are nice. The base is nice
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:51.500]   It's got these little jelly things
[01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:55.260]   I'm getting one of these for at least a right now because she really misses her many petties
[01:54:55.260 --> 01:54:58.300]   And even if you're not a manny pettie person
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:04.700]   Sometimes it's just nice to stick your feet in hot warm bubbly water. Which one do you recommend?
[01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:10.780]   Oh, I I got the one I linked to which is the bubblefoot spa with heat boost power
[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:15.100]   I think that's the right one
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:17.740]   They have one with a power roll massager
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:20.140]   And
[01:55:20.140 --> 01:55:25.820]   You know there there are options here, but I just went with basic because I wasn't really sure I needed the massage action
[01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:29.500]   That may have been a mistake. I don't know. I think you need the massage action
[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:36.140]   So but that one was $130. I think yeah, they're a little pricey the deep soak duo footbath with power roll massage
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:38.940]   That there's your Cadillac of a foot
[01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:47.180]   Oh, the stock. Oh no, you bought the last one. You know why it's at a stock another covet winner
[01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:52.300]   Yeah, another covet winner. Let's see the premiere
[01:55:53.180 --> 01:55:58.220]   Also at a stock. Wow. I think there may be a run. We try Amazon on footspas
[01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:04.940]   You know, I am shamed admit that's exactly what I was going to do is just find out which one you recommended
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:08.460]   And then go to Amazon
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:11.580]   Well, they already have my credit card. It's
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:17.340]   Fast the curbside pickup was nice because we were stopping by where a best buy is anyway
[01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:21.740]   So I think it's by my kids worth the donest but the point is
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:25.020]   Just I mean
[01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:29.660]   Again, I'm not a fancy pants person. I don't do manicures. I don't add a cure
[01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:36.060]   Sometimes you just need like a little treat and this was a nice treat and not crazy expensive good
[01:56:36.060 --> 01:56:39.740]   And you don't mind that the name of the company is home edicts
[01:56:39.740 --> 01:56:42.620]   They make a lot of stuff. Um
[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:44.860]   It's like home
[01:56:44.860 --> 01:56:46.860]   Medic it's like home, but they capitalize
[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:52.140]   They capitalize the M. So it really does kind of never noticed the word of a size
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:54.620]   Wait a minute the waterfall
[01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:57.260]   No, the way it's spelled the water. Oh, yeah, that's a waterfall. Yeah
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:56:59.740]   home edicts
[01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:01.740]   Kind of when they have a whole bunch of them
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:06.540]   Never noticed that and I've seen that brand of gazillion times. Is that is that the good one aunt?
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:08.540]   Yeah, deep
[01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:12.940]   I can always have those spies over the years and they've gotten better and better each year
[01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:19.820]   Yeah, and when she talked about the water staying warm. That was a key complaint years ago. I should get some of this
[01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:25.260]   Tea tree oil foot soak infused with stem sale and coconut oil Epsom salt for athletes
[01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:26.460]   Stop
[01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:28.060]   I will say
[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:28.860]   Yes
[01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:34.780]   My my thing that I would always do is I would bring a thing of Epsom salts soaked with a little bit of peppermint oil
[01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:36.860]   Yes, and that actually works
[01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:38.380]   It does
[01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:42.220]   So I don't know why I don't know what it is about Epsom salts, but that actually works
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:48.060]   Jeff jay, do you have a number of them? Oh, hell. I just lost it. Oh, hell
[01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:52.220]   Put in the wrong link is it the mckenzie scott story? No, I was gonna do the other one
[01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:57.100]   Um, the musical notation of the subway closing chimes
[01:57:57.100 --> 01:58:05.180]   Yeah, you put the wrong that's the wrong link in there though. It is the wrong link. I messed it up. Okay. Well, I guess we're doing mckenzie scott
[01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:13.020]   Um, so mckenzie scott may be well, how do you say this nay Bayzos nay bayzos nay scott?
[01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:15.900]   She's actually nay scott actually scott's her middle name apparently
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:19.980]   Oh really? Oh, okay. So she's doing away one x
[01:58:19.980 --> 01:58:26.700]   Right, she's given away 1.7 billion dollars of the money thus far
[01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:28.540]   Wow
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:31.260]   And she did her she's done her excellent job. She's she
[01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:35.980]   In the medium post which I have screwed up again. I didn't put that link in there. I put this handle times like in there
[01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:38.380]   Put it in medium post
[01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:40.620]   She
[01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:42.460]   Here. Yes, no, I don't
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:44.300]   um
[01:58:44.300 --> 01:58:49.820]   Yes, I have it. She talked about the uh diversity of the grantees
[01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:55.740]   And it's impressive what she did. She uh, where is it here? Oh, it's lost
[01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:58.460]   Um
[01:58:58.460 --> 01:59:00.220]   Well it was here
[01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:01.420]   Damn
[01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:03.420]   Um, that's a lot of yes there it is
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:09.980]   Of this list 91 percent of the racial equity organizations are run by leaders of color 100 percent of the lgbtq
[01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:16.540]   Equity organizations are run by lgbtq leaders 83 percent of the gender equity organizations are run by women
[01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:21.420]   Um, and so she really put a lot of effort into finding leadership. So it's
[01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:27.980]   Out of this this total amount racial equity is 586 million lgbtq is 46 million
[01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:33.900]   Gender equity 133 million economic mobility 399 million lunch around it up
[01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:36.700]   It's hard to do charity, you know, I
[01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:41.980]   I don't I hope I hope she has i'm sure she does have a lot of help
[01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:45.580]   Putting these this list together because good honor
[01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:50.540]   You don't want to I mean remember what uh marx seckerberg famously did giving money to the new york schools
[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:55.020]   Yep, uh, it's easy to it's easy to give away money foolishly
[01:59:55.020 --> 01:59:58.780]   And it's such a lot of money. She is one of the richest people in the world worth
[01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:02.140]   22.2 billion. Oh, i'm sorry
[02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:06.140]   Her her value went up 22.2 billion this year
[02:00:06.940 --> 02:00:11.980]   Uh, who she took the giving pledge, which is the bill and malinda gates and warren buffett
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:20.220]   Uh pledge program. They started 10 years ago to encourage the most wealthy to give away at least half of their wealth
[02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:29.340]   Um her husband her ex-husband's the richest man in the world. This is kind of stunning. It's worth 178 billion dollars
[02:00:29.340 --> 02:00:33.100]   You know, that's mind-boggling bill gates 117 billion
[02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:37.340]   Bezos has not joined the gates pledge, although obviously bill has
[02:00:37.340 --> 02:00:41.420]   Some still pays less taxes. Yeah
[02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:44.700]   Yeah
[02:00:44.700 --> 02:00:48.540]   So good for her, uh, that's that's wonderful and it's great that she wrote this
[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:52.460]   Post on medium herself and you know and put it up there. I think that's great
[02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:58.380]   Last year she pledged to give the majority of her wealth back to society that generated it
[02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:00.460]   That's an important statement
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:02.700]   The society that helped generate it
[02:01:03.500 --> 02:01:05.980]   Billionaires are not billionaires in a vacuum
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:10.300]   Oh, they feel like they are. I know often they do
[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:14.140]   So I think it's important that she said that I think that's really good
[02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:17.820]   Uh, aunt your pick of the week
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:20.860]   Okay, my pick of the week is
[02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:26.860]   Faded words and this is a podcast from a friend of mine that I know he's been
[02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:29.020]   just creating
[02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:34.620]   Content as a passion product and he's a photographer. He's actually a film guy
[02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:41.340]   So he's a different side of the brain type of thinker very cool guy up in Minnesota named david swyduck
[02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:44.620]   I'm not going to try to spell it. That's why I just said faded words
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:51.580]   Um, but he's he's pivot from doing his podcast called adventure and creativity where he talked about
[02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:58.540]   Storytelling and try to help people be inspired with their creativity where this photography or drawing or what have you and just
[02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:03.100]   Teach them to try to you know, be able to bring the story out. So he pivoted into
[02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:06.220]   diving into stories that are
[02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:12.060]   Sort of forgotten or things that you may not have heard of and just doing a little 10 to 15 minute
[02:02:12.060 --> 02:02:16.460]   Story reads nice a week and it's he's got the great voice
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:22.620]   And it's it's really really good. Now. I I openly admit I much rather enjoy his
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:28.140]   Creativity show, but this is I'm starting to come along come around to this one here
[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:31.180]   And let me play a little as he says on his website
[02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:36.060]   It says the goal of adventures and creativity is to celebrate the art craft and story
[02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:43.180]   That story telling by sharing stories breaking down just why stories make such an impact on earth and everyone of us
[02:02:43.180 --> 02:02:46.460]   So, yes, I'm a fan of love crafty and horror
[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:49.260]   He's doing the other gods
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:53.660]   This one not so much horror. Maybe a little bit. He's got great pipes
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:58.380]   Yeah in Ulthar, which lies beyond the rivers and he knows how to say the word
[02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:01.260]   And old and old and avid to behold the gosh
[02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:09.740]   Lulu deeply learned we have a fight over how you pronounce it only karsten knows how to pronounce it. Yeah karsten. How do you pronounce?
[02:03:09.740 --> 02:03:11.420]   saloon
[02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:12.940]   saloon
[02:03:12.940 --> 02:03:18.300]   House karsten gonna tell us in the chat karsten cam. I think karsten has been replaced by ai
[02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:20.940]   I think he's a robot now. That's why we don't see him
[02:03:21.420 --> 02:03:26.540]   Uh, we do have a photo he would answer faster than we do have a photo of karsten. Oh, no
[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:31.340]   It's a 404 karsten a photo of karsten's a mask of the week
[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:36.380]   Oh karsten i can't do it. Oh, that's how I it's not kasulu
[02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:39.900]   karsten don't you remember we had that talk
[02:03:39.900 --> 02:03:50.060]   Maybe we'll find out is an hbo doing a lovecraft story. Well, if you look it up on wikipedia
[02:03:50.780 --> 02:03:53.980]   There's a long story about why it's hulu
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:59.980]   The first few consonants are unpronounceable intentionally and it's not a cut
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:03.500]   It's not a cut because if you see it it will make you crazy
[02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:09.420]   Now here's his humvex bionic shield now. Can you breathe in that karsten?
[02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:18.460]   This is his mask of the week. He doesn't he doesn't need to he's bionic. He's a robot. It's okay. I carsten only $28
[02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:20.460]   I'm a little off put by this because it says
[02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:26.940]   It offers only secondary protection and must be worn with spectacles or goggles. So what's the damn point?
[02:04:26.940 --> 02:04:33.820]   I ask you. I think I wish I could get this picture of karsten. That's last $28. I guess
[02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:36.700]   Yeah
[02:04:36.700 --> 02:04:40.700]   And he also wanted to point out ben heck
[02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:46.860]   Who is a great maker in his own right and he has made a mask? Oh, yeah, I saw that video
[02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:52.700]   Ooh that is like a transformer the next version look at that you push a button and it automatically closes
[02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:57.020]   And then you can open it with a push of a button. Oh wow
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:05:02.700]   It was you're gonna make that you know, I'm a I'm a textile guy. I'm not a machine guy
[02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:09.100]   I like I think this is really though the one of the trends which is masks are rapidly going to become kind of a
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:14.620]   Statement about personality and fashion and so forth. Yes, that's a ben heck if I ever saw one
[02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:19.820]   Boy, I really shouldn't do a pick given how many how long the show is
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:24.860]   But but I can't resist this one. It's so good. Give me a sentence any sentence
[02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:29.340]   Just I'll type whiskey tango fox trot is the best whiskey
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:35.660]   Tango fox trot is the best give me one more
[02:05:35.660 --> 02:05:41.580]   Make it a little longer. I love the nightlife
[02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:44.620]   I love
[02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:46.460]   To boogie. All right. How about that?
[02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:54.380]   So that's a sentence now here. This is called vocodes at v o dot codes. It is a celebrity voice
[02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:56.940]   synthesizer
[02:05:56.940 --> 02:06:02.460]   And I'm gonna try first david at burrow rickman get ready. I'll do allen rickman in a bit
[02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:04.780]   This is david aton burrow reading our sentence
[02:06:04.780 --> 02:06:10.620]   It actually takes a little while to process it whiskey tango fox trot is the best
[02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:13.580]   I love the nightlife. I love to boogie
[02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:16.540]   Yes, pretty good, right?
[02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:20.780]   Wow, you want to hear gilbert godfrey do the same one? No
[02:06:20.780 --> 02:06:28.940]   Poor stasis suffering don't do it. This will give you a migraine if you don't already have one
[02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:34.220]   By the way apparently gilbert godfrey takes a lot more calculations than david aton burrow oddly
[02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:41.580]   It's all of the extra amplitude is quite a bit of this is a really good synthesizer. I think it's kind of amazing
[02:06:41.580 --> 02:06:47.020]   I thought that that was very good that david aton burrow. Yes calculating it says
[02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:54.140]   Oh, you broke it. Did I break it? Oh shoot don't everybody go there now. Oh, that's probably what's happening
[02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:59.580]   All the people here's craig fargus and a little girl scott. I know you like the scottish accent
[02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:07.340]   Oh, yeah, we broke it whiskey tango fox trot is the best. I love the nightlife. I love boogie
