[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.440]   Aunt Pruitt is here. Lots to talk about. We'll tell you why you don't have to fear Amazon's
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:19.120]   sidewalk. Tiny little Zen booths for Amazon stressed out workers. And no, President Trump is not back
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.960]   on Instagram and Facebook. It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:50.880]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google we event Pruitt from Hands-on Photography fame. Hello aunt!
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:01.680]   Father of the fattest, fastest, fastest, hold on there. Whoa! Father of the fastest high school
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.080]   track star in Northern California. That's right. Did I say that right? You did. You did. Is that
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.520]   Isaiah? Fastest high school kid in Northern California. That's pretty good. That's awesome.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.920]   How fast is it? Easy. How fast do you have to be to be that fast? Well, you have to beat an 11
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.040]   one in the 100 meters if you want to be fast. Oh, that's fast. Wow. He was moving. That's moving.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.120]   He was moving. But it was a good one. Were you chasing it? It was a really good one.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.760]   I was not shooting back. I was yelling like I knew all the people. I bet you were. We always know
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.600]   when your kids have sporting events because you come in a horse the next day. That's so true.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.560]   Also with us my friends the great Jeff Jarvis. Frank Sinatra once called him a bum.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.000]   I'm a TV guide critic and the Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation at the
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.880]   Craig Newmark. Graduate school of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:11.440]   Someday I have a fantasy that we will get somebody great in here. Maybe I don't know the
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.680]   guided Hamilton to sing that. Well, Miranda. Well, Miranda come in. That's why I love John
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.680]   Krasinski show. Of course he's a little more famous, but John Krasinski, you know, as I say,
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.880]   oh, let me ask my friend Lin more when well, when Miranda sing a song and he just pop in.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.760]   Can you ask Steve Martin to do it on the bandalin? I could. That's not a bad idea. We might get a
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.000]   banjo red edition of it. Oh, he could probably you're in New York. We can go down and visit
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.120]   Craig and do it live for him. We can do it for Craig. We can we can serenade him outside his
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.200]   serenade him. Yes, exactly. Get get thrown in jail for no good reason. Also with us from Stacy on
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:02.720]   IOT and the IOT podcast Stacy Higgehim bathum. The eponymous Hey Stacy. That's the one.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.960]   Nothing to say. You've been typing for the last 15 minutes and you have no worries.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:17.120]   Do you want me to keep typing? No. No, no Stacy. No, so much to say to your keyboard and so little
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.520]   to say to us. Oh, I've got opinions about all kinds of things. Let's see if any of them will
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:28.080]   work with what we're talking about on the show. Let's see. I'm eager to hear your opinion about the
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.800]   kerfuffle under furor about Amazon and. I've never been where you are. Is it is it?
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:45.040]   I'm never going to say the words technopanic. It's just it's not but they are upset about this
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.000]   for all the wrong reasons. I will give you three reasons you can be upset when it's time to talk
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.400]   about this. If we want to talk about it now, let's do it now. I was a little upset because Dan
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.680]   Gooden, who is a very good security guy in ours, Technica, I think got it wrong and
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.720]   and it's kind of spread a little bit of fun about it. He says this is the headline.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.800]   Amazon devices will soon automatically share your internet with neighbors. Amazon's experimental
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:22.400]   wireless mesh networking turns users into guinea pigs. And you know, and his only complaint is well,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.560]   other wireless technologies have had security flaws. This might too. That's not good enough.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.760]   Here are the three reasons you should opt out in my humble opinion.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   Oh, you're saying you should opt out. No, no, no, no. I think you should. Well, if you wish to.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.400]   Okay. If you wish to opt out, but you're not you're not happy to let's be clear. You're not
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.640]   recommending that's locked up. Okay. Good. I don't think you should opt out. But
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.040]   here's the way that here's how you should be thinking about this. You should not be worried
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.120]   about the security things, especially if you're not worried about the security of Wi-Fi.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.280]   Basically, his argument is like, Hey, people break into wireless protocols all the time. And
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.440]   they do. He's right. Yeah. So stop using Wi-Fi. Right. Is that what he's advocating? No.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.160]   Yeah. I mean, web files. I mean, wireless technology is like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth have a history
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:23.040]   being insecure. Okay. So we'll stop using Wi-Fi. Well, and furthermore, Amazon's taking
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.760]   great pains, I think, to avoid these problems. They have done a good job on the security
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.440]   protocols. Here's why you should if you want to opt out, here are some good reasons that you
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.280]   might want to opt out one. You're in a rural network that charges you per megabyte or per
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.840]   gigabyte. That would be bad. Yeah. Because this is going to Amazon says that it will use up to
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:51.120]   500 megabytes per month. So that's how I suspect it won't be anywhere close to that.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.320]   I don't think it will. But 80 kilobits. It's very slow. It's dial up low speed.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.520]   But if you're worried about that, and that's a big issue for you, then that would be a true
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.360]   reason to have a real fear. If you're a meter, that's a good reason. Because if then clause that,
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.920]   if worried, then yes. Yeah. Two, if you are like, you know what? I think it's pretty
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.480]   dickish of Amazon to opt into something. And I have real issues about that.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:23.120]   Yes. And if you want to make a point of like say, in all the other services that force you to opt
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.920]   in and you stop using them and all that, you're, you know, that's a big issue. Then yes. Three,
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:34.560]   you think, hey, you are asking to share my network Amazon, you're going to benefit from this.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.720]   Why aren't you paying me something? You are Amazon. And I actually think Amazon should be
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.160]   saying, hey, we'll give you a digital download if you opted to this. I actually think to
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160]   put it done then.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.600]   Similar to like, yeah, the Helium's got it. It's got an incentive for you to join, right? I don't
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.040]   think they have to do like a whole token network. That's crazy talk. But basically saying, hey,
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.680]   we have the resources. We want a, we see the benefit.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.320]   Well, thank you.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.200]   Really for being a community.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.360]   Yeah. You see the benefit of having this big ad hoc distributed network that everyone can use
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:17.680]   as Amazon. Then Jesus give people a discount on something.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.360]   Let me play Amazon here. We'll do a little role play.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.000]   Sure.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.680]   So, because I think I understand why they, what they're doing is, first of all,
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.360]   I'll be Mr. Amazon, but not as rich.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.240]   Where's your monocle?
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:39.200]   We're not doing this for us. We're doing this for the community. Everybody can benefit from this.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.840]   For instance, Tile is going to use this. I imagine others will use it for lost dogs or lost
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   parents or lost children. There will be lots of ways you can use this. And in fact, we're not
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.680]   really using this for anything that we don't really need it. For instance, we already know
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.320]   where our trucks are. They're loaded with GPS. We already know where your packages are.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.960]   We scan them every step of the way. So, it's not a benefit to us.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:11.040]   We're doing this because it's a good thing. It's creating a new low speed mesh network
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.360]   in places where there's no connectivity at all. And there's lots of uses.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.120]   So, maybe we'll benefit down the road, but we're not going to give you something
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.400]   because it's not for us. You're doing this. You're doing this for community.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.680]   I'll laugh like Jeff Bezos.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:34.960]   And then number two, the reason we admittedly, as Dan Gooden says, is kind of a dick move
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.000]   to make it opt out. But if we made it opt in, nobody would turn it on.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.040]   Right. That's why you've got to incentivize people. I feel like if Amazon could benefit from
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.320]   this, they will eventually provide devices that work on this network. They could eventually use it
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.440]   for other people. Yes, yes. Other people can use it. They've already put up the code.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.920]   You can actually build a sidewalk compatible device today. You don't have to license it from
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.320]   them or anything like that. No. And I have talked to people who are building sidewalk compatible.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.760]   They're actually really excited about this network. You had a fourth stage.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.640]   I want you to forget you had a fourth. Okay. We'll get there. Hold on.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.680]   Okay. Let me finish this point. Sorry about that. Amazon could benefit from it.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.360]   But if you really believe in the power of IoT and you want to make the pie bigger for others,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.880]   and Amazon historically has done this, they've actually invested in things that were a little
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.440]   dicey convincing someone because you could kill two birds with one stone. You could say,
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:43.760]   you could get people to opt in by promising them a digital download or something that's not
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:52.240]   that's not I mean a lot for Amazon. It's not for intended. Well, or intangible as it were.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.080]   I mean a digital download isn't even a movie. You don't get to keep it. Amazon owns the rights to
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:05.360]   that. Yeah, true. I'm just saying. So, yeah, I feel like put your money where your mouth is.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:11.360]   You've got a lot of it. And this network, while today may not exactly benefit you,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.440]   it is designed to benefit you. Ring devices will eventually work on this network.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.880]   And it will help them expand their devices that they can sell. But it's not fast enough to send
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.320]   video. No, no, no, no. It's only 80 kilobits per second, but it's fast enough to send. Yeah,
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.600]   like turn on the light. Right. Think here is your dog GPS. Think.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:38.720]   Here is your soil temperature is 80 degrees. I think Phoenix Warp in our chat room is saying
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:44.400]   people aren't yelling at Elon Musk for creating Starlink. This is kind of like that without
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:52.160]   blocking, blocking view of the sky and charging $99 a month. This is, I think it's a great public
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.440]   standard. Yeah. Well, and look at it. Okay, let's talk about Apple's AirTags, where they're
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:03.440]   creating a Bluetooth network on the backs of your cell phone data. It's, again, it's not,
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.560]   I have no problem with creating the AirTags network. But, you know, anytime you're sending
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.600]   location and pinging someone about where you saw a tag, you're actually using your data plan,
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.200]   your cellular data plan on your Apple phone. I mean,
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:26.080]   is it safe to say it's just most important to make sure the consumers are educated in all of this
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.560]   and understand what the potential risk are, just like they are with regular
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.920]   Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. That's a great, they're not going to read any.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.720]   But don't spread the don't don't do the link, baby, things say, oh my God, Amazon's,
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.960]   you've got to run over to your all your Amazon devices and turn this off immediately,
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.280]   because I don't think that's fair. And I'm really frustrated by that.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:51.680]   Yeah, I do. It's not fair. And I also, and I get this, people who don't trust Amazon,
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:57.600]   the reactions I've been getting when I'm like, hey, I don't actually think you should turn it off.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:05.840]   And I get some very, a lot of vitriol. And it's not rational. It's very much hatred of Amazon.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.560]   And it's the Amazon should never benefit from anything I do because they're an evil company.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.280]   Oh, and that's the last point. If you think Amazon is a fundamentally evil company and you want
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.600]   nothing to do with them, and, but I would also argue, because a lot of people are like,
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.200]   I'm sure you know, because they're evil. I think you shouldn't let anyone in the Amazon device.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.560]   Yeah. Right. So I feel like.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.760]   So if I may, I just headlines such as the top three headlines on Amazon,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.200]   search for Amazon news, the Guardian, Amazon, US customers have one week drop down of mass
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.080]   wireless sharing PC, Meg. What is Amazon sidewalk? And how do you disable it?
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:47.760]   K H O U Amazon will soon share your internet with others near your home. Here's how to opt out.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:54.800]   Media have taken this, this, this, an attitude that isn't just we're going to complain about it.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:00.400]   We're going to, we're going to make a moral judgment that you should stop it. And we're going to tell
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.200]   you what you should turn off and not really make your own judgment, not say, well, if you want to
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.440]   know more, here's what it is, make your own note. The headlines are all that kind of clickbait.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:15.760]   Headlines are asking you. So I will say, if you want to turn it off, I've done this. I will tell
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:21.760]   you here is how you do it. So listen up, y'all. If you're like, so let me, before I tell you that,
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:27.760]   let me just make the case. We are in desperate need of a low power wide area network to fill the
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.960]   gap between our home Wi-Fi network and something like cellular networks, cellular networks are
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   expensive. They use a lot of batteries, but they are awesome because they let you have data pretty
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:45.680]   much wherever they're cell coverage. The idea with Amazon sidewalk and with Laura Wann networks by
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:52.800]   like Senate makes one, Helium has one, the idea there is that you will have devices that just
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:58.800]   have a little bit of data, just to share state or a temperature or location or anything
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.920]   easily and cheaply. So that's what this is. It gets you a network that provides coverage
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:12.320]   outside of your home area and it's mesh and it's distributed. Apple's building something similar.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.960]   As a sales you money with phone companies, everybody gets more.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.120]   Oh, yeah. And that's the thing. You can build internet connected devices that have a different
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.320]   business model because the cellular business model is way too much for like simple devices,
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:30.880]   like low power trackers for your water bottle. So right now you only track high value stuff
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:37.280]   because that's all that makes sense. It'll also let you have like, I could stick like,
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:44.160]   I don't know, a weather station, a tiny weather station at a park near me just and share that
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.680]   data with everybody if I wanted to. It would be much easier to build some sort of community
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:54.480]   air pollution network or all kinds of cool stuff or track temperature readings or the environment.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.760]   At a point a lot of us have weather stations. I have a purple air sensor that I share back to
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:06.240]   the purple network using my Wi-Fi, probably using more bandwidth than is used by the sidewalk.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.480]   Why is it a battery hog and you have to have a network?
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.120]   There's a lot of really cool things that could happen from having this.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:21.280]   So the only way to build something like this cheaply is to get, you can't put up cellulotowers.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.520]   That CapEx model doesn't work for the type of price you want to offer this.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:31.120]   And so what Amazon's done is basically turned, imagine it, turned your echo devices,
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.600]   some of your ring devices and Euro routers into little mini cell towers and created this network.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.400]   So I think you should turn it on.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.160]   Yes, good. And that's by the way, that's the lead.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.600]   Now, if you have concerns, I'm always playing it to you. Look at the
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.400]   my journalists as Stacy, but the lead is a recommendation.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:55.120]   Question. So the earlier attempt to do this, tell me if I'm wrong here, was phone to an extent.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:00.640]   Yes, it's exactly like phone. And a lot of people actually share their Comcast.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.280]   If you have a Comcast network, you probably are sharing your Wi-Fi already with the Comcast.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.640]   By the way, when you say phone, you're talking about F O N.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:14.400]   Yes. There was also a moraki. Both of these were attempts to create public mesh networks.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.040]   It's always just phone every day.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.520]   It's on the right page.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.800]   Well, moraki is now, but what moraki started doing what phone did, same idea,
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.520]   which would you buy it?
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.800]   I didn't realize that.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.560]   Yeah. Now there's just an exhibit to enterprise.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.280]   Okay.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.720]   It was a good business.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.200]   How much did it cover?
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.680]   Do you did the phone ever get, which is part of the point too about Amazon is Amazon has
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.520]   a tremendous reach and it puts it to good use now. Whereas phone spent years and years and years
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.200]   trying to build a reach, which I don't think was ever if you weren't in density.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.280]   Phone is still around, believe it or not.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:45.760]   It's all around.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.560]   I know.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.520]   They have more than 23 million hotspots around the world.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.000]   Moraki founded and based on, founded by MIT.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.040]   They're in Europe.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:00.240]   And based on roof net, which was a mesh network developed at the Massachusetts Institute of
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.000]   Technology, same idea.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.440]   Same idea.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.960]   Hot spots will Amazon have.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.480]   If people don't opt out because we're always even a-
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.640]   What's great is this is solo bandwidth.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:16.080]   You know, I think 500 megabytes a month is a significant amount.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.560]   I bet it's a considerably smaller amount than that.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.560]   That's the max they said they will do.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.240]   It'll tie out in them.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.880]   They'll never ask for more than that.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.040]   But I do think this is a good example.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.640]   I hate to admit it, Jeff.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.160]   But I do think this is a good example of how
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:38.320]   this kind of general fear of technology could actually make it hard for us to have nice things.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.520]   It's media bias.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.160]   Put it another way.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.560]   It's a prejudice now against the internet.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.680]   It's a legitimate prejudice.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.520]   I will say a lot of people covering technology probably don't read the white paper about
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.360]   Amazon sidewalk security efforts.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.600]   They also are not-
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:19:01.920]   I mean, it's hard to agree with a behemoth, especially a behemoth that has behaved so badly in the past.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.960]   But this is a big page.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.760]   This is one spit and twice shy.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.760]   And this is actually why I think-
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:15.440]   I don't feel bad for Amazon, but I feel frustrated with Amazon because to me,
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.880]   the IoT, we're entering this era where you're asking so much of people and trying to provide
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.160]   some very real benefits.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.640]   But you need a lot of information about them.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.720]   And if people don't trust you, that relationship isn't going to work.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   And I think you're suggesting-
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.880]   I think you're suggesting-
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.920]   Joe, I think you're suggesting so important.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.880]   Is that if you-
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.240]   If you are sitting in a boardroom with your one page email for Jeff,
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.720]   your one page report or whatever it is you're allowed to be able to say,
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:48.000]   "Whoa, let's talk about how people are going to react to us and what we're trying to do here
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.120]   and how we can do it better.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.800]   What if we gave everybody who did this reward just to give me?"
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.120]   Right?
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.560]   I think that's a really smart way to do it.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.440]   It's not even-
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.560]   Not even to opt in.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.680]   You're already opted in, but if you're opted in after end days,
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.480]   here's the reward.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.960]   I thank you because you're doing something we're going to tell you how.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.840]   I'm going to channel the Amazon executive again.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:11.760]   The problem with that is if we do that, there is an implication that there is a tit for tat
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.280]   that we're asking something of you.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:13.920]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.240]   And I don't want to give that impression.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:22.880]   Truthfully, if we make it opt out, it's on by default on all Amazon devices that were
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.960]   sold in the last couple of years, and it's got a half mile radius.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.800]   That means it's going to be pretty much everywhere.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.600]   99% of people, they'll see these articles.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.520]   Look, Jeff, don't worry.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.680]   It's going to go away in a couple of weeks.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.440]   Nobody will even remember this.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.520]   And 99% people are going to leave it on anyway because it's hard.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.200]   So don't worry about it.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.040]   No, we don't need to give anything away.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.600]   In fact, the best thing we could do is to say nothing,
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.080]   let this blow over because the thing is going to happen because we made it opt out.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.440]   Well, when we get to--
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:58.320]   But at a larger level, when we get to Google, which we well, because it is this week in Google,
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.920]   and I was thinking before the show, you know, similar for the problem,
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.920]   Facebook was getting everybody's problems.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.480]   They were the ones that got an average, and everyone everything wrong, right?
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:14.720]   Google was better, but now after the AI thing, after other things,
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.680]   they're seeing the week underbelly, they're going after Google now too,
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.040]   and maybe for good reason.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.920]   And so I wonder, what would you advise Sundar?
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.600]   What would you advise Bezos?
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.640]   What would you advise any of these companies to start to fix this?
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.440]   I think that's the question that Stacey's asking.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.240]   It's the right question.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.400]   Wait, I promised people I would tell them how to opt out.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.600]   Can I do that for them, though?
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.160]   Yes.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.800]   And while you're doing that, I will show Dan Guten's article,
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.080]   which has the step-by-step.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.440]   So you can follow along, everybody.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:53.200]   All you do is you go into your Madam A app, and you open more select settings,
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:58.000]   get into your account settings, select Amazon Sidewalk,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.320]   and then there's a little toggle switch, turn Amazon Sidewalk off.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.240]   And that will do it for all your devices?
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.920]   That will do it for all your devices, but every single person associated with your account.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.160]   So my husband has his own Amazon account.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.000]   He actually needs to go into his Amazon Echo app and do it right.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.040]   So if you turn it off and he doesn't, it's still on?
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.720]   Right. I believe so, yes.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.560]   So that's what I'm saying.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.680]   So there's your caveat.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.120]   You got to get your whole family together.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.440]   And then poof.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.320]   I wish Amazon didn't do it that way, but I understand why they do.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.840]   So Ant was trying to get in before.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.400]   Sorry.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.040]   Yeah, go on.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:40.000]   I wanted to ask the demographics of the people reading the different articles,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.440]   whether it's Arts, Technica, or CNET, or Tech Republic, or whatever,
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.160]   because of how things are being presented in the headlines.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.440]   I think back to when I used to write for Tech Republic,
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:54.240]   things were totally different on that property versus CNET,
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.200]   which, you know, when they at the time were the same people,
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.320]   under the same umbrella.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.960]   But the readers were totally different from those of CNET,
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.000]   because CNET,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.200]   Sidewalk was a little bit more consumer-based and stuff on Tech Republic.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.840]   It was a little more enterprise-based.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.160]   So it was a different mindset, if you will, when people were reading those articles.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:20.880]   I thought Arts, Technica was a little more so leaning towards the nerdy,
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.840]   enterprise-y people that already know this stuff about Tech,
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.520]   that already know that this isn't opt out and this is the ins and outs.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:35.280]   So it surprises me to see that such a click-baby article even went up.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.680]   But well, here's our demographics changing nowadays from the people that are re-know.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:45.040]   No, because it's not just TechSight's USA Today's headline Amazon Sidewalk feature,
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.320]   we'll share your internet connection.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.760]   But that's USA Today.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.640]   USA Today is a regular person.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.840]   But that's right.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.840]   So it's both, it's PC Magazine.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.840]   What is Amazon Sidewalk and how do you disable it?
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.200]   It's universal.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.240]   It's universal.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:58.800]   The same thing.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.640]   Now the one person I'm going to give credit to is Dan Patterson,
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.760]   your good friend in mind.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.400]   My buddy.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.120]   My man.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.960]   Writing for CBS.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.360]   So this is a very big mainstream.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.360]   And his headline is completely neutral.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.440]   This is in MoneyWatch Amazon devices to start sharing connections with neighbors.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:22.240]   And he, I think, does a fairly good job of talking about the pros and cons.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.000]   He does mistakenly say Amazon did not provide security details.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.840]   That's not true.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.400]   They did.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.280]   They provided it.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.840]   In fact, Steve Gibson has twice now reviewed that white paper once in December and just
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.880]   yesterday.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:40.640]   And in both cases, Steve has says he was impressed with the attention that they gave to this.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:48.240]   Even if, for instance, the key password keys are broken, as has happened to both Wi-Fi and
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.240]   Bluetooth, the data itself is properly encrypted.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:57.440]   So it would be a fairly big challenge for somebody and encrypted and anonymized.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:03.440]   There is no information in that data about you at all, not where it's originating from,
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.320]   not where you are, not whose account it is or anything.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.000]   So even if it is cracked, there is very little harm that can occur.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.520]   There's still some work to be done.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.240]   And I was just talking to the CTO of Level Lock.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.040]   He's actually my guest this week on the podcast.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.080]   And we talk a little bit because Level is actually participating in Sidewalk.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.160]   They announced it with Tile.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:29.920]   And he was excited about this opportunity.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.320]   It's great.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:36.560]   This allows us, for him, it lets them put Bluetooth and Zigbee in a lock, but they don't have to
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.520]   worry about Wi-Fi.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:43.280]   And what happens is if you are out of Bluetooth range, you can piggyback on this network to
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.600]   communicate back to your Bluetooth lock, which means you have a lock on your door without a huge
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.800]   battery and using battery sucking Wi-Fi.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.400]   And he evaluated, I asked him about security because he's a lockmaker.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:59.520]   He's like, Amazon historically has done things like ask their partners for data.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.280]   This network doesn't do any of that.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:06.640]   He's comfortable sharing using it because it's not sharing stavity about the lock.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.320]   So that's a means.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:08.400]   So that's a means.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.680]   Masnic, sorry.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:16.320]   I was just going to say developers, at least some want to use it because they've evaluated it.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.960]   And they're like, yeah, this actually offers something for us.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.800]   And for the people.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.000]   So I always go to Masnic for sensible and insane takes.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.800]   And his is Amazon's idea.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.560]   Well, YouTube, you're already here.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.800]   Amazon's idea for a mesh network is cool.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.880]   It's method of rolling it out is not.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.680]   That's a headline.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.320]   That's fair.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.600]   That's what's the answer.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.360]   That's the lead.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.160]   Yep.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.960]   But I understand why Amazon did it that way.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.240]   Any other way it would not have gained critical mass.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.920]   And that's, you know, if that's your goal, sometimes you have to do things.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.160]   And it has to be your goal when you're building a network.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.840]   Like, I think you'll get this.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.360]   It doesn't work with everybody doing it.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.120]   Well, not just that.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.480]   No one will build devices if your network doesn't have coverage.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.000]   And no one provides coverage unless your network has devices.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.920]   I mean, it's a bear to do a double-sided market or a network.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.560]   It just is.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.280]   Okay.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:09.680]   That's all.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.240]   He says.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.200]   Do you ask another questions?
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:11.840]   Stacy, I was right.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.080]   Go ahead.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.400]   Mike says the real issue is then is forcing everyone under the network.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.560]   Obviously, it's no surprise why this was done.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:23.520]   Just as we just said, a mesh network only works if you have enough nodes in the network to make it useful.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.840]   While it's possible Amazon is betting that the concerns over this will blow over.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.400]   And having so many nodes in the network will make it worthwhile to take the short-term heat.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:37.120]   It still surprises me that the big internet companies don't take more steps to alleviate
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.600]   these kinds of concerns upfront taking a more cautious approach.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.760]   So he's agreeing with exactly what we said.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:43.760]   That's great.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.040]   But I do feel like what I don't know how you would do this if you're Amazon.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.040]   Anything you say is going to be the problem Amazon has is the problem all these big tech
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.320]   companies have is that people don't like them because they're big and powerful.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.560]   But they hate their phone companies more.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.400]   And I think that there was a PR way.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.520]   Maybe you could have done that.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.720]   We could all share our internet together.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.240]   We can all have a benefit.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.440]   It gives you another option.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.200]   It's a generous thing to do to your neighbors.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.080]   We've worked on all the security and all the everything.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.400]   We're not sharing this or this or this or this.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.080]   It's a way that you can all help each other on those times when you're somewhere.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.440]   And you just be able to get the internet because we know how valuable it is to you.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.600]   And we have these devices all over, which is my question I'm going to ask in a second.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.440]   And so we wanted to put them to good use.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.040]   Now here's my question.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.200]   Where was the point in the design chain of these devices?
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.280]   Was there a point three years ago when they said,
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.960]   if we add this little guy here, someday we can do this.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.400]   So when did they realize that they could do this?
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.960]   Should they have been started talking about it then maybe, someday?
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.440]   Hold up.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.480]   Amazon has been talking about this.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.480]   So Amazon launched this.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:04.160]   They soft launched this concept of a shared low power network in 2019 at their device day
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:04.960]   with reporters.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:11.280]   Probably not that many people, but I wrote a long article how this was Amazon getting
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.120]   into the network services business.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.000]   Yeah, you talked about it here.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.560]   Big deal.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:16.560]   Yep.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.600]   So and then in 2020, they said, here's how or so September 2020,
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.320]   they actually started talking about how they were going to do it.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.800]   And they put their people out on a huge press tour.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.360]   They went every major media mountain outlet.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.040]   They explained the limitations, the data limitations.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.880]   They explained the security protocol.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.800]   They did not hide any of this.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.480]   How long ago?
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.360]   What's the oldest device that works with this?
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.320]   The oldest device is the, I think the, well, actually they say
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.640]   all echo shows that are currently sold.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.320]   I don't know if the first generation one is, but it's the third generation echoes.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.200]   Those came out in 2019.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:00.240]   Probably devices coming out in like 2019 would have this.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   They probably started building it beforehand.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:09.360]   I mean, this is, this whole in the network has been around for a while.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.440]   And it's been very obvious to anybody that NBIOT was not the solution because the cell phone
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:21.120]   companies, they just took their stupid cell phone attitude and was like, how much you gonna give
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.000]   me per gig?
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.960]   And you know, they, they just didn't make it tenable for less expensive devices.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.960]   And Amazon needed that.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.440]   So they were like, they saw a hole and they started filling it.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.440]   Are Google devices similarly situated?
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.240]   Could they do this?
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.320]   Can anybody else do the same thing that Amazon just did?
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.320]   You could do it with Bluetooth.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:49.600]   So to be clear, the sidewalk network can work with Bluetooth as it will with side,
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:55.600]   or tile and it can work with Laura Nguyen, which is what I expect to see devices coming out
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:02.160]   that will be Laura Nguyen devices that will work with sidewalk, which is a much longer range.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.360]   So Bluetooth, short range, Laura Nguyen goes up to half a mile.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.040]   So, so what was the question?
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.520]   I forgot.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:09.760]   Good.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.520]   Who else could do this?
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.000]   Who else?
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.080]   So, here they had scale.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.840]   Who else technically could do this?
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.720]   There are Laura Nguyen networks out there today.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:26.240]   They have undergone a shift in the last year to build these sorts of business models.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.440]   So Helium is one.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:33.280]   That's the company I talk about because they're doing that token to insight coverage.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.440]   So that's one option.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.840]   Senate, which is a formal Laura Nguyen network for enterprises,
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.280]   has also started telling their customers that have set up their networks,
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.480]   that if they share their network, they don't have to pay as much for coverage.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:56.640]   So Google doesn't have any long range chips that I know of in their devices.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.360]   I mean, again, this was very smart of Amazon.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.960]   That was smart back in 2019.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.000]   When are they start building these in 2019?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.280]   With that saying--
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.080]   That's what I started talking about.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:04.640]   We're kind of saying.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:10.720]   So, Bluetooth, the tiles started this in 2014 with Bluetooth.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.200]   Right.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.520]   I mean, if you want to think about ad hoc mesh--
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.560]   It was pretty feet.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.360]   But that was the idea.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.600]   They were like, if everybody has tile on their phones,
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.160]   there's enough phones around in a lot of places that this will work.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:25.120]   The ad hoc mesh network kind of concept is not new.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:31.760]   It's the getting those underlying chips in, like what Jeff is getting at.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.160]   And yeah.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:40.720]   I want to take a break and I want to then talk about cookies,
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.760]   because everything is about to change once again.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:52.160]   And this is another example of how fear of technology is leading to an unintended
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.040]   consequence, I think is probably the best way to describe that.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:59.040]   But first, I want to ask you, have you all purchased your Father's Day gifts?
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.960]   Are you ready, Stacey?
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.880]   Is Andrew going to give so high?
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.760]   I am ready.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.320]   Is he going to get so high?
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.280]   No, I haven't purchased my Father's Day gift yet, sir.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.000]   Well, you have a Father, right?
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.600]   No, my dad is gone, but my Father's Day, I tend to buy my own stuff.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:15.840]   Oh.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.280]   Seems to work this out.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.160]   Because you know best.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:18.560]   Oh.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.840]   Father knows best.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.880]   I just want to make a suggestion.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.680]   I don't know if you noticed this lovely chemise that I'm wearing.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:34.400]   It's actually a beautiful shirt from a very unpretentious company called Untuckit.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.640]   And in fact, I love this shirt because I don't have to tuck it in.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:41.600]   I can, but it's just the right length so that you can wear it untucked and it
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.480]   doesn't look sloppy.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:42.880]   It looks great.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.560]   Who wants to tuck in shirts anyway?
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:49.360]   If you're struggling to find the perfect Father's Day gift, I have a gift for the
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.280]   dad you love, a shirt from Untuckit.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.160]   I have now half my wardrobe is now untuck it.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.680]   Once I've found these guys, first of all, they're wonderfully made.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.720]   That's their very high quality.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:07.040]   And the length is just right about halfway down your zipper, which means it doesn't look sloppy.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.360]   It doesn't look like you're wearing a moo moo.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.360]   It just looks cash and relaxed.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.600]   Untuckit mates make shirts designed to be worn this way.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:21.360]   They designed Untuckit frankly because this untucked shirt style is a tough style to get right.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.800]   This is just perfect fits all shapes and sizes.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.440]   In fact, that's one of the things I love about this size is up to triple XL, but
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.040]   in within each size, you also have slim relaxed and tall fits.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.880]   So I was able to find a fit that worked perfectly.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.520]   And now I've just got a lot of untuckit shirts.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:45.120]   I also love it that they have a huge variety of styles and fabrics.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.160]   They have performance shirts that wicks sweat.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.280]   I have a number of those short sleeve button downs.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.600]   They have polos.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.720]   They also have linen.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:58.000]   I'm a big fan of linen and I bought short sleeve linen.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.120]   This is my new linen checked shirt.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.000]   It's stylish.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.560]   It looks good.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.120]   It feels good and it's great for hot weather.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.720]   Nothing breathes better than linen.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.160]   It's just great.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:12.240]   And their wrinkle-free styles are fantastic.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.840]   You just wash them, tumble dry, hang them up.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.520]   They look ready to go.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.160]   They untuck it tests every batch of fabric to make sure.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.600]   And I could tell too, I'm a little bit of a fabric snob.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.400]   They're getting the best quality and consistency.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.160]   That way all their button downs, their polos, their teas, their henleys
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.720]   have more than that just right fit and length.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.120]   They have the highest quality as well.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:43.760]   Every aspect of the shirt is checked five times to ensure they retain their shape,
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.760]   their color, their strength.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:50.240]   And if ever there's a problem, nobody has better customer service than untuck it.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.640]   If you're looking for shirts for going back to work,
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.280]   if you're looking for shirts for dad, if you're looking for shirts
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.440]   for your upcoming vacation, I bought a bunch of them for our trip to Hawaii next month.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.880]   Untuck it has you covered.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.040]   Check out that wrinkle-free collection.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.680]   I'm a big fan, whether it's short or long sleeves.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.160]   You're ready to get back to work and look sharp.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.280]   Now you can't go to the store.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.840]   They have 85 untuck it stores nationwide now.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.880]   But they also can be ordered online.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.440]   And as always, they offer free returns and exchanges.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.440]   There's no reason not to try.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.040]   And now you can't take mine tuckets away from me.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.200]   I'm just such a fan.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.480]   Get an untuck it shirt for the father in your life.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.320]   Or if like you're the father in your life, get it for yourself.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:39.520]   And by the way, save to use the code TWIT for 20% off your first purchase at untucket.com.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.920]   That's untucket.com.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.680]   Use the code TWIT. I'm actually sending this to my family
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.360]   so that I don't get socks or ties.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.400]   I want untuck it.
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.400]   Untucket.com.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.440]   Do use the offer code TWIT so they know you saw it here.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.240]   Untuck it.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.520]   Shirts designed to be worn untucked.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.040]   But they have great dress shirts too.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.040]   I'm just a huge fan.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.320]   I'm really loving this.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.760]   Linen, it feels so good.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.240]   It looks good on you.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:04.960]   Does it look good?
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.520]   No.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.440]   I know you look relaxed.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.120]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.160]   That's the untucket look.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.640]   And I am resisting writing the limerick for this.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.080]   Thank you.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.720]   You're welcome.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.200]   So get ready.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:26.800]   This is actually a really interesting example of the tyranny of the default
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:33.440]   and how companies use dark patterns to get you to accept something.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.800]   We've all seen the cookie banners that are all over the place.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.720]   Now the UK body responsible for policing these laws
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.880]   has published new guidelines and it's going to change those cookie banners.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.680]   Right now the cookie banner basically on anywhere you go says,
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.560]   "We use cookies.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.440]   You okay with that?"
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.600]   That's about it, right?
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.960]   They don't even ask if you're okay.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.840]   They just let you know.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.600]   We're using cookies to pass.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.840]   No, it's a quick click.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.120]   Some websites actually let you adjust them.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.640]   They actually say perfect.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.960]   It's a hard thing to do.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.960]   We don't do that because it's a hard thing to do.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.040]   Now suddenly we have to write a lot of JavaScript.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:16.640]   Plus there's a problem because if you reject cookies,
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.920]   then you're going to get the same request every time you visit because guess how
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.800]   a site knows what your cookie preferences are.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.080]   They save them as cookies.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:29.920]   So if you don't do business in the UK and you never care if anybody from the UK visits your site,
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.880]   you can ignore this.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.800]   But almost everybody is going to have to do this.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.840]   Get ready.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:39.360]   Those cookie banners are going to get a lot bigger and a lot more complicated.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:44.240]   First of all, no non-essential cookies unless you ask first.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:50.320]   Google Analytics, Facebook buttons, comment boxes, social plugins, tracking pixels.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.560]   You have to have this box that says, "Analytics cookies."
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.240]   And oh, by the way, it has to be off by default.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.120]   Who has to be off by default?
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.720]   Is this fast or is this just been approved by the UK?
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.880]   What body?
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.000]   The UK, I'll show you the guidelines.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   It's ICO, the Information Commissioners office.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.440]   By the way, as soon as I go there, look at the size of this cookie banner.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:22.400]   There are fines.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:27.280]   This is not a guidance in the sense that you can ignore it.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.560]   This is real.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.040]   No non-essential cookies.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.320]   You have to give people the ability to turn them off.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:40.880]   People will have to turn them on if they want them, which means no one will ever,
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.680]   you will never again be able to use analytics of any kind.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.040]   We use Google Analytics all the time to know if somebody's visiting our site.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:51.280]   You cannot emphasize, accept, over reject.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.680]   No big green accept button with a little reject button.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.120]   They have to be equal.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   That's non-compliant if they're not.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:05.120]   You cannot deny access if somebody says, "No, I don't want any cookies."
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:10.640]   Many websites block access until a user accept their cookies under the new guidance.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.240]   That's expressly forbidden.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.800]   I've seen a lot of that.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.440]   I don't think that's terrible.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:21.440]   Well, I tell you what, it means analytics are gone.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.560]   Because who's going to?
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.600]   It's the same thing as Apple.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.480]   Who's going to say, "Who's going to turn it on?"
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.080]   It's off by default.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.160]   Let me go back to this.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.360]   What they're going to do is they're going to hurt the media business.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.920]   It's not just the technology companies.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.440]   They're going to hurt the media business.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.080]   No, I know.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.560]   By the way, here I am on this ICO site.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.720]   Look at the size of this cookie banner.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.760]   Yes, that's awesome.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.040]   Look at what I have to read.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.080]   How about some people they just did?
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.360]   I can't click through this.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.440]   I have to do all these settings.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.120]   Now, if I say accept all cookies.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.520]   Which I do every time.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:56.640]   Effort.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.960]   I think analytic cookies is still off.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.680]   So basically...
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.040]   What was it all been all?
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.960]   I don't know.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.920]   That's a good question.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.920]   That's a good question.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.280]   That could should mean all.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.920]   Yeah, I was about to say, I think,
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.000]   did you accept necessary or did you accept all cookies?
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.600]   Well, I have to kill my cookies so that I can reload this.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.840]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.160]   Remember last time you killed your cookies and what you did?
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.600]   That was not a plan.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.720]   Cookies aren't bad, folks.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.520]   Cookies are not a problem, period.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.720]   Well, cookies are a tool.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.160]   They're aware of website and save information about what you want.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:36.560]   Yes.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.960]   What your preferences are, where you go.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.200]   It's useful for websites for analytics.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.640]   If you don't want a website to know you've been there,
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.400]   okay, I guess.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.000]   That's great, but it can also annoy people,
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.640]   especially when it comes to like the Amazon ads
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.240]   when they go to look at some news stories somewhere else.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.600]   Something that they were looking at on Amazon,
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.280]   just browsing around, not necessarily interested in buying it,
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.040]   is now popping up in their face.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.960]   And that's a bit intrusive to some people.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.600]   The UK ICO also says, "Analytic cookies are under no circumstances necessary."
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.440]   So you can't say...
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.680]   But accepting necessary cookies.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.480]   So try to run a media and then they turn around and they say,
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.280]   "Oh, technology companies are ruining the media business."
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.560]   They just put a nail in the coffin of the media businesses with this.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.760]   Well, the media businesses have to adapt.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.040]   I mean, come on, y'all.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.760]   We understand that what's happening here is
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.240]   we have developed a technology that works to track
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:38.640]   that saves your information so you can be tracked around the internet, okay?
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:39.200]   Easier.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.120]   This is good for the following reasons.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.200]   This is bad for the other following reasons.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.640]   But we don't talk about cookies like that.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.200]   We talk about cookies like they are a demon and people are like,
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:47.920]   "Cookies bad."
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.160]   And regulators said, "Oh, cookies are bad."
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.920]   Well, okay, let's ban that form of tracking people around the internet.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.320]   So now we have to come up with new business models.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.040]   Just ask Andrew what your new business model is going to be.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:42:59.520]   Right.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.560]   But well, why business model doesn't involve that?
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.280]   Yes, it does.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.000]   How else do you know somebody's a subscriber?
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.960]   You're going to make a vlog in every single time?
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.080]   Well, you've been to my site.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.480]   You're going to have to make a vlog.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.400]   We would basically turn off that banner.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.920]   Actually, we probably wouldn't have on that.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.920]   I'm going to make a vlog.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:24.240]   Seriously, the only way you would know when I come to your site that I am a subscriber
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.080]   is by a cookie.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.560]   Otherwise, you're going to have to ask me every single time.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.920]   We don't ask people if they're a subscriber when they come to the site.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.480]   Do you have ads on your site?
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.680]   Only thing we do, but our ads don't ask that.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.200]   We only track if you click on the ad.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.800]   Okay, so you have an ad set up.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.440]   We have tracking links.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.600]   Where if you click the ad, it charges somebody.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:51.440]   But the ad impression, you don't charge for that.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:51.920]   We don't.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.280]   You're unusual, by the way.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:53.760]   Yes.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.200]   I know we're unusual.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:00.480]   And almost everybody would prefer to charge for the ad impression because you're getting the ad.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:04.000]   I wanted to build a site that wasn't based on that.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.920]   So I built my media business one because I could,
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.200]   but my goal was to build something that didn't involve tracking.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.120]   So that's the point I'm trying to make is, yes, this kills today's media business.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.680]   But people are smart.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.160]   We can figure out other ways to do this.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.960]   The only way I can make money on advertising, if I know how many people download the ads,
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.040]   that's how we charge.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.560]   We don't charge a flat rate.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.560]   There's no click through on an ad in a podcast.
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.880]   How would you suggest I monetize?
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.400]   You have a different business.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.240]   I mean, you have a more challenging model because
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.120]   say goodbye to all ad supported podcasts.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:41.440]   Right.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.200]   Try being the Cleveland Plain dealer.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.320]   Try being a local news.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.280]   At the time we're declaring local news, oh my god, it's in such trouble.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.560]   This kind of crap happens.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:54.880]   It comes out of it comes from the Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch with the,
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:00.160]   what they know scary series years ago where Murdoch having given up on the ad model
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.240]   tries to pull like Apple tries to pull the rug out from everybody else who's still trying to
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:04.880]   figure out the ad.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:09.040]   Well, this is why we had to start club to it because,
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.800]   but I have to say I just spear for podcasts.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.240]   It's not going to, and you know what?
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.000]   You're going to really hate what happens because the podcast industry is going to be
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.240]   dominated by companies like Spotify that force you to use their app in order to listen to a
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:24.720]   podcast.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.400]   You're going to hate it, but that's what people like the ice.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.840]   You would say actions have consequences and this has consequences.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:32.000]   Right.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.600]   I think business models like club twit have a lot of promise.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:38.560]   I think that.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.800]   Well, it's not enough money for us.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:44.080]   It might be at some point enough money for us to operate.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:47.840]   I don't think it will ever be enough money for us to operate at the level we operate now.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.080]   So this show will be canceled almost certainly.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:55.520]   Seriously, no, it's one of the first shows that will be canceled.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:58.480]   Do people hate us that much?
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:04.880]   No, it's just that without ads, I can't afford to pay you guys, pay the engineers,
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.040]   pay the light bill and pay the rent.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:11.360]   We will only do stuff that is either paid for by club twit members.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.600]   And that's a hand right now.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.640]   There's 3000 members.
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.160]   It's $15,000 a month.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.280]   And can you make that's my salary period?
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:26.240]   Can you find your advertisers and find out how advertisers will buy an ad.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.600]   If you don't tell them how many people heard that.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.360]   Nobody in the world will buy an ad from somebody will I say,
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.920]   advertisers who do that? Well, you're very, you're being used to see it's very different.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.760]   You're very lucky because if I say to an advertiser, yeah, maybe a personal
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.760]   listen to show or maybe a thousand or maybe a hundred thousand.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.240]   I don't know.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.320]   And I'm not going to tell you they will not buy.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.600]   I tell them I give them my stats, but where do you get those stats?
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.560]   I get my stats from WordPress.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.240]   Don't give them.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.120]   Well, I don't get I don't get website stacks.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.960]   I give them downloads.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.320]   So they get all of my stats.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.760]   All of that's analytics for my show.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.880]   All of that is forbidden.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:09.040]   Now what are you tracking my podcast downloads are not done via cookie.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:12.720]   Well, that's an interesting question because you're right.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.160]   We don't set cookies.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:19.120]   It's done by IP address and which is is a person.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:22.000]   I personally don't know if I have information on a GDPR.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.400]   They have yet to enforce that if they do.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:32.160]   That basically breaks the internet breaks any any models, any monetization model that
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.280]   makes sense on the internet.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.320]   You don't like big companies?
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.720]   Only the big companies are left because only Google has its first party data.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:39.600]   They'll figure this out.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:40.400]   They don't need the cookies.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.040]   They got flocked.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.080]   They'll figure out something else.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.520]   Amazon is selling you stuff.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.720]   They're figuring it out.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.600]   You'll only this.
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.840]   This is the takeover of the big companies.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:48.960]   And again, I'm sorry.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:49.680]   I'm going to say it.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.880]   I'm not going to use the MP words, but I am going to use another M word,
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:53.360]   Murdoch.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:59.440]   This starts with Murdoch and I think Apple too highly cynical acts to declare all advertising
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.760]   models to be evil and surveilled.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.400]   Yeah, unless it's the first party model.
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:09.920]   This kind of regulatory political move as the as the unpopular UK government is taking right now.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:14.880]   As a media person who cares about news, I'm pissed.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.480]   I don't care about news, but I do care about my business.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:21.200]   Your news.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:29.440]   I you know, I so the ICO has enforcement power.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.320]   We have listeners in the UK.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:32.960]   I don't.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.720]   I'm not sure what's going to happen.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.720]   We'll what would happen if you didn't do it.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.560]   Well, that's right.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:38.720]   Thank you.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.560]   No, they find me.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:41.760]   Get a fine.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:42.160]   But they can't.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.000]   Well, how do they collect?
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:44.480]   I don't know.
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:51.680]   It's a constant question mark for us since GDPR.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:55.440]   We just really don't know what we just recently put a cookie banner on our site.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.640]   I I was either pinning.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.800]   We didn't need one, but we were informed.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.720]   We absolutely had to have one.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.280]   So I just really don't know.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.640]   I honestly don't know.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:08.480]   I hope we're just being I'm just being
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:13.120]   oversensitive to it.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.600]   Maybe you're you're you're trying to manage your business.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.920]   I just want to thank you for being here.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.600]   Thank you guys.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.160]   Thank you.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.440]   Let's talk about Google.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.600]   They hired a guy.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.600]   I
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:35.280]   as a head of diversity head of diversity strategy guy named Kamal Bob.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:44.800]   In 2007, he wrote a blog post when he was a research associate at Georgia Tech in which he
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:50.000]   wrote Jews have an insatiable appetite for war and killing and an insensitivity to people's
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.040]   suffering.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.200]   Whoops.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:50:00.800]   Now he has the right to say that, but he probably shouldn't be the head of diversity at Google.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.160]   Yeah, maybe a different job.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:07.600]   Anyway, he's.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.560]   How old is he?
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.400]   So this was 2007.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.200]   And we're.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:19.040]   Now we have a discussion about the Associated Press firing a young starting reporter.
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.560]   Oh, I would not say why.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:21.440]   And that's a whole mess.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:22.080]   I thought that was.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.560]   The problem is, yeah, your post from 14 years ago live.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:34.160]   I'm not saying like, I mean, I will say back in college, you know, when I was young and stupid,
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:39.120]   I did not have horrifying takes about Jewish people because that was not something.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:39.920]   You weren't that stupid.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:40.240]   That's probably said.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.600]   Well, I just.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.960]   It's.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.840]   Again, I grew up with Jewish people.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:46.720]   They're my friends.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.000]   I it's not a way I think.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:48.400]   That's true.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.760]   If you didn't know anybody who's Jewish, you might say, you know what?
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.520]   I think they have really big noses.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:57.600]   I don't know because I've never met one, but I seem to remember that.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:02.080]   And that would be a very dumb thing to say, but it wouldn't necessarily be a bias thing to say if.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:04.080]   Three years later, you said, gee, I'm really sorry.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.280]   I said that that was stupid.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.240]   I used to say things were retarded.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.280]   And now I would.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.080]   Yes, me too.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.760]   I used to say things were late.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.520]   And I tried never to do it.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:14.480]   We.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.240]   We've all in our language had things like that.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.280]   It's not again.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.160]   I'm not.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.760]   I'm not saying that it's a great idea, but I also to.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.360]   I mean, I can't condone someone saying that, but I do think.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:33.600]   We're old enough on the internet and we have enough history of people growing up being on the
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:38.880]   internet that we need to start talking a to our kids about what they put on.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:46.640]   And I think they're getting better, but b we need to talk about what to look for in remorse in
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:53.920]   learning and taking accountability for our mistakes and saying, hey, like, you know what,
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:52:00.000]   if that guy was like, yeah, I was 19 and I was pissed off at the world and I said this and
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.840]   I'm really upset.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:05.440]   And that's an upsetting thing to have said to people and that hurt people.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:10.560]   And I know that now and I've done this research to understand why that's such a.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.880]   Sorry, terrible thing to change.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.640]   Shameful is what you were about to say.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.200]   Shame is.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.040]   John was near the dump button.
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.240]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:26.320]   But I don't know if that's I mean, you probably shouldn't be head of diversity,
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.680]   but I don't know if that should.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:30.960]   That shouldn't hunt you for the rest of your life.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:38.400]   We live such a such sensitive times that sometimes things people say in good faith
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:44.720]   are can be taken the wrong way. I don't think that too, but I think people say things in bad
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:49.040]   faith with the I mean, like, God, when I was 19, I was so I had such a dark and bitter
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.440]   to humor. I was only offensive.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.720]   Yeah, I know.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.440]   She was a you were a goth chick, I think, right?
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:00.880]   You had dark eyeliner and black, black hair and oh, you still do.
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:03.760]   I mean, I have brown hair.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.400]   I'm just teasing you.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:12.800]   Anyway, I just thought I'd throw in a Google story just just for grins.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.720]   Just because yeah, what the heck.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.320]   Did you see it is after all our last show.
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.200]   So we might as well live it.
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:25.840]   My is not don't start that just just because I said just because I said that don't start it.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.760]   We got three good ads today.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:32.320]   Of course, they'll all be gone as soon as we have to tell stop tracking people.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:39.920]   And by tracking, I merely mean make a note of your address.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.720]   Yeah. So that's how we know that you don't.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.160]   Surveillance.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.760]   Yeah, I mean, I don't think your IP personally, I don't think your IP address really says much
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.760]   about you. And every single website you go to knows that IP address.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.320]   That's too.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.080]   Otherwise, I can't send you the back to you.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:55.280]   They can't respond.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.960]   They need your return address.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.240]   Otherwise, they can't respond.
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.440]   They probably should throw it out.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:04.720]   And in fact, I think we now do throw out our logs pretty quickly because of GDPR.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:05.840]   But we still.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.520]   Joe Amazon have my address.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:14.240]   We still have to we still have to note your IP address, make a note in a little black book.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:18.320]   And then if you've, you know, see if you downloaded it again and stuff like that, but
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:26.720]   apparently they did have analytics on the blog from the desk of Donald J. Trump.
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:32.560]   And the numbers were so bad that the president said,
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.120]   I'm not doing this anymore.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.200]   They have actually, remember we announced the,
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.720]   he would say, well, I can't be on Twitter and Facebook.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.200]   I tell you what, I'll write tweets on a blog.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.280]   Nobody read them.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.600]   My wife's theory is that actually he doesn't know.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:50.640]   And that they just tell him that he's still tweeting.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:59.280]   And they're patting them on top of his head too.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:54:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:00.400]   Right.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:00.800]   Exactly.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:01.600]   It's still going out.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.520]   NBC news.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.080]   Careful to hair there and careful to hair.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.440]   And very expensive this year.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:13.520]   I'm sure that the the blog from the desk of Donald J. Trump has actual analytics,
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:18.640]   but NBC used data compiled with a company called Buzz Sumo to estimate it.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:24.880]   And his engagement on the blog was a quote fraction of that on Twitter.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:30.480]   Which by the way, what interests me about this right now is that he's utterly silent.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.360]   Everybody thinks he's in Florida.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.880]   He's actually five miles away from me right now.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:33.680]   But he even knows that.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.480]   Is he a Bedminster?
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.840]   Yeah, he is.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:37.760]   And he's saying nothing.
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:44.400]   And people are acting as if the entire half of the country is quaking in fear of him.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.200]   He's not saying it.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.640]   He's not doing anything.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:47.840]   How is he still in charge?
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:51.520]   He's more of an idea than a reality.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.480]   That's interesting.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:57.920]   He's kind of a chimera haunting the Republican party.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.160]   He's going to say he has negative spirit haunting the party.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.320]   Our website is that difficult to access.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:10.080]   If you're following a celebrity that you just love and they happen to say,
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:15.360]   you know what I'm done with social media, I'm just going to keep putting things on my own
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.440]   space because I own my own space.
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.000]   I tried that.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   I got a fraction of the engagement.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.840]   But that's what I want.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:25.920]   Is it just that hard for consumers to even get to a website?
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.080]   I honestly think most people don't use Twitter.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.040]   So I'm not sure really.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.520]   But Twitter goes into mainstream media.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.280]   That's where you get the media tweets, Twitter.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.320]   Yeah, that's where you see it happen.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:38.080]   The engagement comes from the news covering your tweets.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:42.320]   And the news apparently decided it wasn't worth covering the blog.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:47.120]   The news also covers things that people are talking about.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.960]   That's why you were getting all these negative headlines about like sidewalk, for example,
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.200]   because people are talking about it and you want to get on those slides.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:56.400]   But it's chicken and egg, isn't it?
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.280]   Which came first.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.560]   People talk about it because it was covered or because I think a lot of news.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.240]   No, no, it's definitely people talking about it.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:05.040]   I mean, but you didn't put your finger to your note.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.880]   You're here to the railroad tracks and figure out what people want to know about.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.000]   And then right.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.080]   Your nose, your ear, your nose.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:12.640]   Your nose.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.600]   Whatever body part.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.160]   I talk to my sort.
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.920]   No, I talk to my sources.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:22.880]   Like I figure out what I want to write based on what people I know and trust are
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:23.520]   talking about.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:28.640]   If that's no different than the mainstream media, I mean, sure, every now and then you're going to
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:32.480]   find a story where there's usually ways to get stories.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:38.080]   You're saying, you're saying why so many people follow certain people.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.800]   Okay, if this man had millions of people that.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.760]   You had tens of millions of followers, but that's a fraction of the number of people
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:44.800]   that even that voted for him.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:49.680]   So it's not a, it's not even a majority of the 75 million votes.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:51.040]   He only had 10 million followers.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:51.520]   It's not.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:59.440]   So, okay, but let's say he were to get just 10% of those followers going to his website.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.960]   Why, why couldn't he get?
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:01.360]   He didn't.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.040]   He didn't even get 10%
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:07.920]   Why would that not cause, cause, well, this is the debate we're having.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:12.320]   Stacy says that news covers stuff because people are talking about it.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:17.360]   It's my opinion that Stacy, you would just look at a story, you know, you get a press release
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:20.480]   or you see something and go, I should write about this because I know people will be interested in it.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.680]   Yeah, but.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:22.880]   Don't you like what I do?
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.000]   What I'm saying is people.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:24.800]   There's, but there's not like.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.640]   People are super fans, right?
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:27.680]   People are super fans.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:29.840]   They, they love this person.
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:33.600]   They love whatever celebrity that they follow or what have you.
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:37.120]   And I would assume that they're going to go wherever they're going to go because there are
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.280]   super fans that exist out there.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:44.640]   And it just seems, I don't know, it just seems weird that people can't seem to just go to websites.
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:47.760]   I, I'm hearing that from, you know, just like you said a minute ago.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.160]   It's not just Trump's is everybody's website.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.160]   Have you ever tried to go to a website on your phone?
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.080]   Yeah, I do.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.760]   And it's a big pan of the ass, isn't it?
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.240]   Nobody wants to enter in.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.080]   You like type in an address.
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:02.960]   Oh, I was like, I was like, we go to a website.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.960]   Only because there was a link coming in from somewhere else.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.560]   Yeah, but I'm not going to.
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:15.040]   How often do you launch your browser and type in from the, oh, I already screwed it up.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.160]   No one.
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.080]   I do that on occasion, but yeah.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.200]   I'm the weirdo that has strict tabs right now.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.640]   No, but that's what's changed.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.000]   That's what's changed.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.720]   When it was on the desktop, it was an easy, it was commonplace.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.720]   But I'm of an opinion.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:31.520]   In fact, it's interesting because I've been thinking about this lately that webs,
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:33.600]   the web pages are almost dying out.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.640]   They're dead.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.440]   Seems like they are.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.040]   And that's thanks to mobile, in my opinion.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.800]   Mm hmm.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:39.280]   Mm hmm.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.160]   Don't give me your own.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:45.600]   I'm going to continue to put things on my website just because I, I like the signal.
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:51.600]   But I know that there's a lot more engagement elsewhere for me in my brand.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.720]   That's why mobile web apps mattered too, is that it would, it would maybe
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:58.960]   and, you know, when I go to the Washington Post, I'm basically going to a web version,
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:04.080]   but I think it's the app and I can get to it because it's the app and I, and I have the app.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.040]   And people didn't download their Donald Trump, you know,
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.040]   hairball to go there all the time.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.680]   No, they didn't know how to get there.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.480]   They weren't.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.600]   I just use, I just use my bookmarks on, because I use, well, when I was using .go,
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.520]   it was a little harder to go to a website.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.040]   I guess I only go to a few websites.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.560]   I don't have any, I don't download the apps.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.760]   On the desktop, we go to websites, but I would say.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.480]   Even on my phone, I don't, because I don't download the.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.960]   So does anybody have Facebook, any of you have Facebook?
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.160]   Yes.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.520]   Has Donald Trump's Facebook account been reinstated?
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.240]   I believe it has.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:36.720]   No.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.360]   No.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.880]   No, they haven't announced it.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.520]   If you get it, no.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.880]   Would you check it just to see?
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.000]   Okay.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:42.400]   Hold on.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.520]   Because I don't have Facebook.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.120]   I love that nobody on the show has Facebook.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.400]   So I have to be the one to go ahead.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.000]   Mikey, Mikey, you'll go.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:48.880]   Let Mikey go.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.320]   Mikey likes everything.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:53.760]   That was one of my tabs right now in my mobile browser.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:54.240]   What is it?
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.160]   I can't read it.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:56.720]   What is it?
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.600]   Twitter community.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.200]   I go there.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:05.120]   I go to my mobile browser and certain websites all the time.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.640]   But again, I guess I'm just.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.600]   You know what I did on that?
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.320]   You're on probably on Android, because what I did on that is on the,
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.240]   on the iPhone, I just made it an icon.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.280]   So I just hit the icon.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.880]   Yeah, I could do that too if I wanted to.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.480]   That way I don't have to go.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.320]   The last post was January 6th.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:18.720]   Yes.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.920]   But is the account active?
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.640]   Well, that has been there.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:22.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.000]   He can't post it.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:24.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.720]   I'm just looking at a tweet that says the last post,
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.040]   which is that on Trump's now reinstated Facebook account.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:34.080]   I don't think it was ever taken down fully in that sense.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.520]   No, this was.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.640]   Didn't they, didn't they punt?
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.280]   I thought the oversight committee punted.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.280]   Well, yes, they did.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.520]   But the question is when Facebook took it down,
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.640]   what do they take down?
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.840]   Now I'm not sure.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.000]   I thought they left it up, but he couldn't post.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:48.720]   He couldn't post.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:54.480]   So today is the day that Facebook is making the announcement.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.800]   I'm just, that's why I'm curious.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.600]   Or is it today?
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.480]   Well, they have six months to the oversight board.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.720]   There was a rumor that they were going to make an announcement.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.560]   But I haven't said, and I tend to get press releases from them about things.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:06.800]   Okay.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.360]   On their list.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.080]   Just curious.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.160]   I wouldn't want to miss that huge story.
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.920]   Yeah, we do it.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.800]   731, because Jeff made us leave at 730.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.920]   Then the story happened.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:21.360]   I have no idea what he's talking about, folks.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.440]   Let's take a really quick break so that Jeff can leave at 731, I guess.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.800]   730 actually.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.440]   730?
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.240]   Okay.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.440]   So that means I have one hour and 19 minutes left of you,
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:34.320]   and then you're going to just.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.320]   Well, me, but you can go on to Marryen.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.600]   No, I don't want to talk to the rest of them.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.240]   Just to not.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.440]   Click.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:44.880]   Torture Stacy and keep her around for an hour.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:45.680]   Stacy.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.320]   No, he can't.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:46.880]   No dinner.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:47.920]   Let's talk some more.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.520]   I O.T.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.880]   Stacey, stick around there.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:56.240]   Actually, I'm going to ask you when we come back about Microsoft's big IoT security announcement.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.720]   Oh, Reverb.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:58.880]   Okay.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:02:59.520]   I was like, Shh.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.080]   Reverb.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:04.000]   Because I, because well, Mary Jo said, who is, do you know anything by Reverb?
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   I said, I don't, but I know somebody who might.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.760]   So I will ask you about that in just a little bit.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:11.360]   Big acquisition for Microsoft in the world of IoT security.
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.280]   Our show today brought to you by Melissa.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.840]   A very nice lady.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.400]   No.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.040]   Melissa, they're a company.
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.720]   They're the address experts.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.960]   They've been in this business for over 35 years helping people in business.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:29.440]   Keep their address lists, their supplier lists, their customer lists clean and fresh.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.840]   It turns out about 30% of your customer data goes bad every year.
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:34.480]   People move.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:37.040]   Names change.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.640]   Email addresses change.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.840]   And it makes it hard to reach out to your customers.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.040]   Makes it hard to send bills.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.960]   It makes it hard to find suppliers.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.720]   Well, you can verify addresses, emails, phone numbers, and names with Melissa.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.600]   In fact, you can do it in real time with Melissa.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:58.800]   Melissa has a variety of very flexible ways to use it on-prem, web service.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.480]   They have secure FTP processing.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.880]   So you can upload a contact list and download the refreshed one.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.240]   You can use SAS.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.280]   There's an API.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:12.800]   Melissa's global address verification service verifies addresses in 240 plus countries and
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.600]   territories.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.560]   And they can do it, which is really cool at the point of entry.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:21.920]   You know, as a customer, sometimes I always very frequently flip the numbers on my
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:25.440]   address, which makes that address useless.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.960]   Packages are going to go somewhere else.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.280]   But with Melissa, you can validate the address, make it right.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.440]   And it happens instantly.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.960]   Same thing with a customer service rep.
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.080]   They're entering an address.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:39.280]   You could say, I can autocomplete this because I know that information.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:43.200]   If you have duplicate customer information in your database, Melissa can help there.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:48.160]   Their data matching can eliminate clutter and duplicates, increase the accuracy of the database,
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.440]   ultimately reduce postage and mailing costs.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.640]   Plus, you'll get the information that completes your customer profiles better and more thoroughly.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:01.920]   You can add demographic information like property data, marital status, and social media handles.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:07.360]   Melissa also has a new Lookups app that's on iOS or Google.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:11.600]   This is really cool that we'll do all of that for you for names, addresses, and more.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.200]   And it's right at your fingertips.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.200]   So there's another way to use it.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:20.320]   In the app, Melissa, of course, protects your data, protects your privacy.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:26.080]   They undergo independent security audits to reinforce their commitment to data security,
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.720]   privacy, and compliance requirements.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.760]   They're SOC2 HIPAA GDPR compliant.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:38.080]   They were just named a leader in address verification by G2 crowd in their spring 2021 report.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.080]   Congrats to you on that, Melissa.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:43.680]   And Melissa is still supporting communities and qualifying essential workers
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.880]   during COVID-19.

[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:21.680]   We thank Melissa so much for their support of this week in Google.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.680]   Microsoft, actually they spent almost $2 billion, I think, for this company.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.720]   So it must be good.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.720]   Refirm.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.080]   They're an IoT security company.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.960]   They're a firmware security company.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.480]   That's what's interesting.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:43.040]   They have a software that scans firmware for flaws.
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.200]   Yes.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.520]   So Microsoft, big picture.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:53.760]   Microsoft has been very much focused on IoT security because they have a lot of customers
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:59.680]   in the industrial manufacturing and enterprise world who are getting into IoT and are like,
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:04.080]   "Oh, we need to do this, but we really need to do this right."
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:11.200]   So earlier this year, it bought a company called CyberX, and that company does OT security.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:18.800]   So the security for the actual devices, and this is the next part of what I think of as Microsoft's
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:22.320]   beefing up of both the IT and OT security side.
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:30.480]   They were former NSA hackers who founded this company, which is kind of interesting.
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:37.120]   They grew out of the Binwalk open source project in 2010 that helped security analysts extract
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.680]   firmware images from devices.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:47.600]   And now you can extract it and I guess scan it to look for vulnerability.
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:53.040]   Yeah, because what happens is Microsoft has this cool IoT security project called Project
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:56.560]   Azure Sphere, but that is for new stuff.
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:02.160]   So when it bought CyberX, what it does is that does analysis for industrial networks and that
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:09.360]   sort of thing. That helps secure older stuff. Saying with this, this is both new and old because
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:14.720]   like Microsoft, when you're putting more stuff online, you're not going to take your old stuff
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:23.600]   offline. So this allows you to check for vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and I believe it also has updating.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.560]   Oh, interesting.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:32.240]   I don't know if it has update. This is part of the Azure Defender for IoT platform that
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:38.240]   Microsoft's been putting together. So you can upload your firmware to Azure Defender and have it scanned.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:44.720]   You can also fix vulnerabilities and update the firmware, which will help you ship more secure
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:49.600]   devices and then continue to update them through the Azure device update.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:56.320]   There's actually a bunch of startups out there in the firmware space for IoT because these are long
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:03.680]   lived and you've got to always be thinking about security. So there's companies like Foundries.io.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:10.320]   There's one that actually just launched today called Goliath. That's not exactly firmware security,
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.080]   but some of the things they're solving help with that. And the whole idea is,
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:20.080]   instead of having, I mean, because if you've got 20,000 different types of devices on your network,
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:30.080]   you can't manage or map 20,000 different firmware images. And this helps make that a scalable process.
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:36.880]   And so that's what this is really important because just one week link in your chain and boom,
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:45.040]   you're out. So we're coming after and we'll see lots of corporate IT shops buy things that are much
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:57.040]   more appropriate for these industrial and kind of deeper recesses of the gear that it needs to
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:02.560]   secure, physical recesses of the gear. So just a quick follow up. It looks like Facebook has
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:08.480]   reinstated both the Trump Facebook account and the Instagram account. They have both silently
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:17.520]   reinstated. So notice I can follow him now. And there, you know, I think somebody needs to tell
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.800]   the man from Mar-a-Lago because he's got to get posted again. But those are bad.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.520]   Oh, I'm so disappointed. I'm angry.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:31.120]   So that's interesting. They were told by what were they told by the oversight committee?
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:37.280]   That they had to come back in six months with a decision. And the decision couldn't be just
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.320]   indefinite. It had to be that there's a term that he's off forever, that he's back, whatever,
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:49.680]   but that indefinite was. I'm going to guess that's why the block cut suddenly acts as they must have
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:54.800]   been informed. Yeah, you're bringing you back on Facebook. Not I don't think ever on Twitter.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.720]   It's not a single story. I can find anywhere on it.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:02.640]   You know where I'm seeing it? Twitter. Imagine that.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:12.240]   Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Okay. Okay. Now here is something from Andy Stone,
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:18.160]   who is Facebook's communications. He is saying nothing about the status of Trump's presence on
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:25.760]   our platform has changed. He remains indefinitely suspended. So this must be one of them. Twitter
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:32.160]   stories that got a life of its own. I don't, you know, I guess all that means is the accounts
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:37.840]   are still there. You could still follow them. You can still comment, right? But he can't post.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.800]   Nobody can post on that. Because on both accounts, it's January 6th of the last post.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:49.440]   I'm asking somebody who works with the oversight board on the on the Facebook side.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.480]   Yeah. I'll see if I can answer. Google is getting an enthusiastic,
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:03.120]   according to CNBC, enthusiastic green light to build a new multi billion dollar mega campus
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.280]   in San Jose. It's been in the works for the last four years construction. Maybe again,
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:12.480]   as soon as next year, it will take 10 years to build. It is a mixed use.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:18.320]   Well, there still be a Google in 10 years. Well, you might be living in Googleville because
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:24.880]   it's it's called the downtown West project, 80 acres of land in downtown San Jose. It includes
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:30.880]   7.3 million square feet of office space for 20,000 workers, but it also has thousands of housing
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:36.720]   units. It's Google's first mixed use campus. It's really a town within a town.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:42.640]   I heard a rumor of. I think of those as company towns. Yeah.
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:48.720]   Coming to Nevada. Really? I don't know. Google's everywhere. I believe it was the
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:55.200]   the Birkenstock facility. Google's going to go over there. Oh, yeah. That's the old Birkenstock.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.440]   It's now I think I'm a Grohl book depot and then a Birkenstock was in there for a while.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:04.880]   It's a big old building just down the road. It's a big building. I heard a couple times that
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:09.520]   that's been kind of on the market for a while. Something with that. Interesting. That'd be fun.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:15.920]   Downtown West will include 300 hotel rooms, 800 residences for short term lodging for corporate
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:20.560]   guests. Google will own all 80 acres, but more than half of the projects will be allocated for
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:25.680]   residential and public space, parks, restaurants, retail space, and entertainment space,
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:33.280]   ecological viewing stations. It's going to be. This children is a tree. We used to have them
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:37.280]   until we killed everything. Come everybody. Let's go look at the grass.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:46.000]   That is it actually could. The other saying could take between 10 and 30 years to fully build it out.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.800]   Geez. I want to live in Google. San Jose has changed already. Thanks to Google so much
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:59.760]   when I lived in the Bay Area. Have you have you downloaded the new Chrome 91?
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:08.240]   OS or browser? Not OS, browser, but you'll get it in your Chrome OS, of course. It is now
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:18.400]   23% faster with JavaScript. Here's a fun. 91. Here's a fun stat only Google can deliver.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:26.720]   It's so much faster. It will save 17 years of user CPU time a day. Every day.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.640]   How many tabs do these people have open?
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:36.400]   So it's a new even faster. We were talking about yesterday with Steve Gibson,
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:39.920]   because they've been optimizing JavaScript again and again and again and again.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.800]   And it really tells you how much of the web now is JavaScript.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:50.240]   So they've beefed up the JavaScript compiler. It's even faster. It's called Spark plug.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:53.600]   Spark plug.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.320]   What's it eating now?
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:58.880]   Yay. It replaces ignition and turbo fan. What's that? Fan belt?
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:06.560]   Seems like camshaft. Camshaft. They're all engines.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:10.320]   You know what I just got? I'm so happy about this. They just got this.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:14.160]   What is that? It's beautiful. It says the lineotype manual.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.720]   Lineotype manual. Is that a republish manual?
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:19.920]   So it's not the original though. It looks like somebody reprinted it.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:25.120]   No, no, no. This was later. This was from some bread. This is how the justification occurred.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.840]   Wow. So this is what actually would have been read by a lineotype operator.
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:36.160]   Well, it's it's it's impressed from J.R. Jones in Bushly Hurts.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.640]   Oh, I love Bushly. Have you ever been there?
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:41.120]   Fabulous. Don't don't know cookies though.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:48.480]   No cookies. Not allowed. Google is about to. I hear somebody eating cookies. I may be wrong,
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:53.520]   but I think somebody just took a bite of cookies. Stacey.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.120]   No, I have no cookies.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.680]   Where? Who is crunching? I don't know.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.520]   Wasn't me. You heard the plastic wrap on the.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.520]   You may have heard. Yeah, you may have heard. No, no, it sounded like.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:12.080]   No cookies. I was contemplating it though. I like I was like, when you're like, who has the
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:16.160]   cookies? I was like, I was just thinking about it. I should have cookies. I do have popcorn
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:20.640]   here, but I haven't been eating. Oh, why do you put popcorn in a trash can like that? Star
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:25.360]   was trash. This is not a trash can. What is that? Is that your popcorn bucket?
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:33.040]   Oh, yes. My popcorn. I just got the notification official answer from Facebook. No change in status.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.920]   We think someone may have just realized that they can still see his old post.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:40.480]   Oh, we know that. Yeah, that's real locked. None of the violating content is back up.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:47.440]   Okay. Okay. All right. Yeah, it's interesting. It just it just stops January 6th. Boom.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:53.200]   Both Instagram and Facebook. Boom. Google is about to settle with the French.
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:17:03.280]   Google is it's an antitrust case, French investigation alleged that Google's ad server favored
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:08.800]   ad exchange. This is this is there've been a lot of people investigating this kind of self
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:15.840]   dealing that goes on in the in the Google because Google both sells the ads and buys the ads from
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:22.720]   itself. And it's a very odd thing. France's competition authority or as they say,
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.000]   competition authority, authority,
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:33.040]   authority alleged that the company's advertising server double click for publishers gave Google's
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:42.800]   online action auction ad house, ADX and advantage over other auction operators. Me, if I'm a business
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:48.800]   guy and I'm selling to myself, I'm going to get myself a deal. It just seems reasonable. But it's
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:54.480]   apparently a violation of antitrust. As part of the settlement, Google has neither accepted nor denied
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:18:03.600]   culpability or as they say, Koopa, be late day. The people the post changes would be binding only in
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:10.560]   La France, but it could be adopted more broadly by the company publishers and ad tech companies
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:17.680]   elsewhere in the world, including the US have raised similar concerns about the workings of Google's
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:23.760]   products. They didn't say how much money the settlement involved.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:32.400]   I'm just trying to get Google news in here. Just trying to it's called this week in Google for a
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:42.640]   reason. Google can do a change log. I could. All right. I mean, I'm not you don't have Oh, oh,
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:52.320]   Oh, I didn't see this quick. Yes, UDP is what a call to replace TCP. It's been published as a
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:59.040]   standard by the IETF. Is it because we can't do handshakes after COVID?
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:04.400]   I don't know what you're talking about. That was a very nerdy joke.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:11.760]   Oh geeky Kenya. Yeah. So quick is a protocol for transmitting data between computers.
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:17.280]   They have to do a little handshaking to work and improve speed and security and internet.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:24.080]   It replaces TCP, which has been around for a long time, which which also requires handshakes.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:31.440]   Yes. And TCP doesn't. That's the joke for the non-net fingers. And TCP was been served, right?
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:36.960]   And team. Yes. Yes. Quick has been in public development for eight years since Google first
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:43.840]   announced it as an experimental edition of the Chrome browser. But the IETF says, I like quick.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:49.840]   It is the new internet standard. So is it actually going to be a story?
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:57.680]   So excited. I need to talk to us right now. Talk to me, Stacey. Yeah.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:09.760]   Quick is designed to do the same things TCP does, but better. TCP, as you know, is resilient and has
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:19.680]   a whole ACK, NAC process that requires a conversation between servers. UDP does not. And it looks like
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:26.000]   quick is going to use UDP. But the problem, of course, with UDP is it can't recover lost packets.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:32.160]   It doesn't even know those packets are lost. It just goes on. Quick does have a recovery mechanism
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:39.040]   outside of UDP. It's supposedly faster than TCP. In fact, that's what quick stands for is quick
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:44.160]   UDP internet connection. But the IETF says quick is not an acronym.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:52.640]   So anyway, this is good. This will be faster. This gets the benefits of UDP, which is widely used
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:57.200]   for streaming because if you drop a packet, you drop a packet, you're not going to resend
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:03.840]   and do all that. But TCP is. You said a lot in robotics too. Believe it or not, because it's
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:08.960]   faster. And your robots that you're just like, do this, do this, do this. And then eventually you
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:12.960]   see it do it and you're like, it's done. All that acknowledgement takes time. All that resend and
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:20.240]   all that stuff. So I still don't understand who has to agree to make this work. So if Google
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:26.160]   Chrome can do it, companies have to start implementing it. So you have to see, how's that going to work?
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:32.960]   Well, you have to have a backup of TCP and quick. Because what if this is why I want to talk to
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:40.640]   people quick. Like we're not like the similar. Yeah, would it be like NATs for IPV4 versus IPV6?
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:45.200]   I don't know, but I want to know. And I can find all of this out. And I'm really excited too.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:51.360]   Oh my gosh. Here's the deal. Here's the deal. It does have to be implemented
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:58.320]   by internet communications devices. But now that it's an IETF standard, it's been approved.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:04.560]   That's the green light to go ahead implement it, make it work. Pretty much everybody's been
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:09.840]   playing with it, I'm sure. So this says cloud flare is going to be able to offer it to people.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:13.600]   Lots of people. So you'll see it from, yeah, lots of people are going to be doing this.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.520]   So you'll see, you'll see the benefits right away of a faster internet.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:26.560]   Oh, okay. And they're IPV4 still a problem. Yes, people are still using and hoarding IPV4
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:32.960]   addresses and we still have, my dog is even pissed about it. It's kind of less of a problem for
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:39.520]   them. We thought it would be because of Nat and especially because of Carrier Nat. But I guess,
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:44.000]   you know, we still would like to go to IPV6. It's amazing how many companies
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.920]   internet providers don't support it. It's kind of remarkable. It really is. It's frustrating.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:59.520]   It's like, I mean, by now, anyway, YouTube says it paid out for billion dollars to the music industry
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:06.800]   over the past year in royalties to artists, songwriters and rights holders. These numbers, you know,
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:12.240]   I remember Spotify had a similar number. And people point out, and I'm sure they'll point out,
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:16.240]   yeah, a lot of that doesn't actually go to artists. It goes to, you know,
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:24.160]   the labels who've made these rotten deals for artists. And so it's, it's good. It's good. But,
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:28.160]   but it's all you do the same as they did their part. We did our part.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.960]   Did their part. You got us got to make better deals. That's right.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:38.160]   But do, do, do, do, do, do, do Facebook, just looking through, if there's anything of interest,
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:43.600]   no, they did not reinstate Donald Trump. I didn't say 630. I said 730. You got play it.
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:47.760]   I'm Russian. I'm moving along here. You don't need to rush. You don't need to rush.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.160]   This is what happens when you tell them there's an out. Then he,
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:55.360]   then he thinks it's like two minutes from now. Did you see, we talked about it on Sunday,
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:24:01.040]   Amazon's solution. First of all, a couple of Amazon stories. One, the injury rate among
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:06.720]   warehouse workers at Amazon is twice that of the industry average. It's a dangerous job.
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:10.960]   But Amazon warehouse industry or what? Yeah, warehouse industry. Or is it retailing?
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:14.880]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, warehousing comparable jobs. Okay.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:23.520]   Two, Amazon's on it. They've introduced tiny Zen booths for stressed out warehouse workers.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:29.520]   If you get stressed here, let's just take a look at Amazon. I wanted to provide a place that's
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:38.000]   quite a little phone ghost. It's a coffin sized booth in the middle of the warehouse
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.920]   where you can go and view mental health and mindful practices in a, basically a padded
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:53.760]   medical practices to that itself. Plants sit on a shelf. There is a fan, but there is no urinal.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:25:01.120]   The skylight on top is tinted blue. The computer waits for the employee to load up a guided
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:07.680]   meditation video. The employee who invented it, I think she's a warehouse employee. So good for
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:14.640]   her. She's trying to do something calls it Amazon. Amazon.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:19.680]   You talked about it Sunday. I didn't quite know how to feel about it because of it being
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:25.600]   so small and sort of like right there in the middle of everything. But yet there's a lot of
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:31.680]   therapy out there, like the sensory deprivation. Yeah, maybe it's good. It might help. People do
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:36.080]   sure. I'm not saying it may work. Not a bad thing. I don't like the fact that it's right there in
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:42.160]   the middle of everything, but it's a tinted wood. Sometimes that's the last thing people want.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:47.600]   Well, I'd like to now. Really, you allowed to go in. The new Twit booths that we're going to
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:54.720]   spread around the studio. And if at any time you feel stressed or upset, just go on in.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:26:00.400]   There's a hat in everyone you could try on. Oh, gosh. And goodness for those.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:07.520]   And some whiskey and some whiskey. There is brown liquor in every one of our Twit booths.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:12.000]   Motherboard reached out to Amazon to find out when exactly its overworked staff is supposed to use
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:19.360]   the Amazon booth during their breaks. Lunch. Amazon. The important thing now is you can go in
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.760]   there and smoke something new and not get in trouble for. Oh, that's another Amazon story.
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:29.600]   Right. They're not caught test aim by for weed anymore. Go ahead. Smoke them if you got them.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:37.600]   And by the way, cannabis stocks rallied after Amazon said this. They're going to treat the same as
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:43.600]   alcohol. They don't test you for alcohol use, but they will, of course, if you have a problem,
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:50.640]   they're going to send you the booth. But other than that, you don't get tested. It will no longer
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:56.000]   screen prospective employees for marijuana for any positions. Now, obviously, drivers,
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.320]   that's different. So any position is not regulated by the Department of Transportation.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:06.400]   This is just the way the country's going. I'm not sure I like it. I'm not a big fan, frankly.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:11.760]   I don't know. I'm fairly conservative as well. It's fairly liberal, but I've always thought it
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.800]   was odd to see these drug tests at different corporations. Yeah, like, hook here as if you
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:20.640]   get high at night and you're working in a warehouse at Amazon. That seems to be like.
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:28.400]   Would go out boozing after work and it was no problem. Or when I worked at Time Inc, during work.
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:36.000]   Yeah, for sure. The three parts, I've had some of those myself. We'd have our lunch meeting, if you
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.080]   will, which lasted half of the day, the second half of the day. But there was never any testing
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:47.760]   for how much alcohol we may have consumed. But there was that test for other drugs.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:52.480]   Amazon has also changed its contracts with employees that used to, as many companies do,
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:58.080]   in fact, ours does, require in the contract that you resolve disputes
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:03.120]   outside the traditional court system using arbitration. Arbitration, right?
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:12.560]   Saves money, saves time. It's fair, I think. But it turns out, this is backfired on Amazon.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:20.240]   There are 75,000 outstanding arbitration demands. So they're saying, oh, screw it, just sue us.
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:29.120]   It didn't really cost you more. Yeah, fine. Get in for it.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:37.840]   Plaintives lawyers flooded Amazon with more than 75,000 individual arbitration demands
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:43.600]   on behalf of Echo users. I think Amazon decided to class section loss. It might be a lot easier.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:51.520]   The move, by the way, cost them tens of millions of dollars in filing fees payable by Amazon under
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:29:00.880]   its own policies. So they're just going to drop the arbitration. I think it's widely used, although
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:06.080]   State of California briefly considered making it illegal to require binding
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:11.120]   arbitration in employee contracts. This is an employee, of course, this is customer.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.680]   Right, customers. Yeah, that's actually interesting. Do most companies do that?
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:19.360]   They said, you can't sue us, but we'll go to our position. I think somewhere in the TOS,
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:22.800]   in terms of service. Yeah, I never read those. I should probably.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:27.360]   Exactly. Yeah. Can I just mention real quickly, I just found this fascinating.
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:33.280]   There's a coincidence of four stories this week that go back to my days when I was writing local
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:39.360]   sites. The biggest pain in the butt for us, the most subpoenas we got were about fights in police
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:48.240]   departments between officers and chiefs and cops get themselves in trouble on social media
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:52.960]   constantly. There's four stories here. One, a Pennsylvania police chief is charged after threatening
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:59.520]   a citizen over a critical Facebook post. Two, a fall river police officer was suspended
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:05.920]   for his Facebook post after the Derek Chauvin verdict. Three, however, a Philly police officer
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:12.160]   fired over a Facebook post got reinstated. And four, an Orange County deputy was suspended
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:16.960]   over TikTok videos, dancing while wearing too little. What is it about?
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:23.600]   Yes, our guardians of public. They're just like everybody else. This is the story of everybody else.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:34.000]   Now, I have to say, if you're the teenage girl who took on a mama bear, then you deserve a
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:40.240]   commendation. There's the mama bear and her two baby cubs walking on along the wall.
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:45.360]   A little memorial. I would be so pissed if I were the bomb of this. Here comes the dog. The
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:51.600]   bears defending the babies against the dog. But the owners apparently not happy. What she,
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:55.680]   what? No, don't. She just pushed the bear off the wall.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:59.920]   A mother bear. The bear is like, I'm getting out of here. I don't know. They use crazy. Yeah,
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:06.320]   that's crazy lady. These TikTok people are nuts. It's crazy. That's my first time seeing that video.
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:13.680]   Can you be mad if your kid like, did that? Oh, yeah. Do the dog have the bear or let the
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:16.000]   bear have the dog? Well, look, the bear is a dog. Yeah, whatever.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:23.120]   But yeah, teenagers are so dumb. Lisa came running into my office this morning as I'm playing
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:31.280]   Valheim, something very important and said, did you see this video? Said, honey, I'm busy mining.
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:34.560]   Just watch the bear video on twig.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:43.600]   Oh, you know, I just, I just want to say this is all about encroachment of human beings on
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:49.360]   wild animals territory. It's theirs, not ours. Try to live with the bears.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:52.880]   She's crazy. Ladies, Jesus.
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:32:00.960]   I don't know what's worst. Did the bear or all the turkey and deer that's in our yard every day?
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:06.240]   Turkeys can be deadly. Don't mess with turkeys. Yeah, I don't mess with them.
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:09.920]   You know, I did. They are quite annoying. I am so used to the turkeys because they're all,
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:13.120]   they're wild turkeys all over. We have many of them and they make, you know,
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:17.760]   they're gobbling all the time. And I don't know if you noticed, but I did that review of the,
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:22.720]   my new car, the Mach 3. And I wasn't paying attention. And I'm talking along and I'm holding
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:26.640]   the camera because we don't have, you know, because of COVID. And there's, and I'm watching
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:32.880]   the review. There's a turkey gobbling madly in the background. I don't know. You can't see it.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:39.520]   So I'm wondering if people think nobody said anything. Like Leo's stick a turkey gobble in that.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:45.360]   Is he making a, what does that mean? Editorial comment? No, it was just a turkey. I'm so used to
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:52.160]   it. I didn't even notice it. All right. Let's do the, play that little thing there. We're going to do
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:58.640]   the Google change log. The Google change log.
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:07.760]   Bum, bum, bum, bum, more Chrome 91 news. There's a nearby share feature. This, I'm sorry, Chrome OS
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:13.840]   91. This is for you, Jeff. There's a nearby share feature. Google's rolling that out to Android as
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:21.840]   well. App notification badges and more nearby share with the appears look under in your settings
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:31.120]   under connected devices. You can, you can enable visibility for five minutes. It shows you other
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:39.520]   only other Chrome OS and Android devices. You could send images, texts, URLs, and other files
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:44.960]   over Bluetooth, Bluetooth, low energy web RTC or peer to peer Wi-Fi. They announced this last
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:50.240]   August when they launched it on phones, but it finally has come now to Chrome OS.
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:58.480]   There's also a circular notification badge on app icons. I don't care. The files app is making
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:04.480]   it easier to save content offline. That's a big deal. I mean, Chrome OS is really designed for online
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:12.240]   document storage, but there is a new available offline toggle in the top bar and then content
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:16.720]   when saved offline. I share stuff offline all the time. Now you see it has this checkbox.
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:23.040]   And there's a dedicated offline folder in the sidebar. So that's rolling out later this month,
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:28.880]   the pinning feature. There's a new imaginary wallpaper collection. I don't know why it's
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:35.920]   imaginary, but that's what they're calling it. It's from artist Leo Natsumi, or as I call him,
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:42.800]   Leo don't sue me. He created these fun digitally sculpted designs. The bright cheerful scenes are
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:47.680]   great for kids or adults. Check them out, go to quick settings and personalization.
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:53.280]   And so I don't have upper blobs. I don't care. No, it's close. It looks blobby.
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:54.080]   Blobs.
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:35:01.920]   Look, there's a few other features, but that's basically it. Chrome for Android is adding a
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:10.000]   built-in screenshot tool and editor in the share menu. So when you go to the share menu, now you
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:16.880]   can share the picture of the page, which is, I think, a good idea. The screenshot app in Chrome
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:24.080]   now is very good, much better. Nice. Your entire screen, including the omnibox, the address bar,
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:30.720]   is captured with the bottom bar featuring tools to crop, add text, and draw so you can even annotate
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:42.160]   the text UI in the current field features corner shortcuts to crop, expand, tilt, and delete.
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:48.720]   And then you can doodle in 18 colors and six stroke sizes. Undo and redo also available.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:54.080]   When you're done, tap next, and then you can share it, save it, or delete it. So that's good.
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:58.400]   That should be, that's cool. That's built into Chrome. On Android,
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:04.560]   Apple TV is now available on all Android TV devices, including the Nvidia Shield.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:11.200]   I have to say, I've used Apple TV on non-Apple devices. It never seems to run quite as well as it
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:17.440]   does on Apple devices, but still... Why would that be? Yeah, I wonder why.
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:24.080]   Planned? I don't know. I've only used Apple TV on non-Apple devices, so I'm like, "Now, what is the
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:31.600]   experience I'm missing?" No, it's fine. I won't tell you. So if you watch Ted Lasso, you can watch it
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:36.960]   now on your shield or your Google Chrome device, your Android TV device. Sony,
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:44.640]   Sony, Bravia TVs. Actually, it's been on Chromecast with Google TV, the new Chromecast for some time.
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:55.760]   Google Search has adding a Pride month Easter egg. So go search, let's do it, google.com,
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:09.440]   search for Pride, or Pride month, and see what happens. Confetti! Woo! It's a party! Woo!
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:18.880]   Very nice. And the heart in the knowledge box is a beating rainbow. It's not pretty.
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:28.640]   Kudos, Google. Yay! Google is rolling out a weather frog. If you've got a nest hub or hub
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:42.400]   max, which I do, you will now have a new clock, the weather frog clock. I guess you could say,
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:48.640]   "Hey, you know who changed photo frame. You can do it in the app as well." The weather frog,
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:53.840]   I guess, tells you, oh, it's the same frog that's on the, if you go to the, in your Android phone,
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:59.760]   if you click on the weather. It's that frog? Yeah. It's that frog. Same guy. My frog today.
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:06.880]   Same frog. Yeah. Oh, he's enjoying a sunny day. Let me see what my frog's doing. I'm just curious.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:11.360]   I don't even know. I've been outside. He could be picnicking in an open field while gray clouds
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:16.640]   hang above. He could be splashing in puddles while wearing a yellow raincoat as it pours.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:23.440]   I don't get a frog. I spent a lot of time with this frog. I want to know a lot about the frog.
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:29.600]   Oh, you got the frog, too. I've got a frog. And it's wearing a mask below its mouth.
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:34.160]   It says it's in mouth. But it's outside. It's eating. Well, I don't care whether that's not good.
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:40.960]   No, he's been masked normally. I think he's within CDC. Basically, the frog listens to the CDC.
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:45.360]   Still pisses me off. Okay. He's outside in the mind. How do I get the frog? Yeah, like,
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:50.560]   I'm tapping the temperature at the top of the screen, right? That's what you got. Yeah. And then
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:55.840]   I get this stupid thing. There's no frog. Yeah. Swipe up. Oh, swipe up for the frog.
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:03.040]   Do you not get the frog at all? No, no, I get the frog. Oh, there's a frog. I swiped down.
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:10.480]   And he's he's he's he's picnicking in the picture. Yeah. So oh, I always thought the frog was via
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:14.560]   temperature, but we all have different temperatures. So maybe the frog is just via the day in the
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.520]   weather. It's really I really I want to know when the frog like is there a rhyme or reason to what
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:24.800]   frog people anything less than a monsoon. Oh, yeah. It's based on the temps, the weather. So
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:29.440]   froggy could be hiding under a pot splashing and puddles sunbathing while putting on sunscreen.
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:35.040]   No, he could be reading napping. Oh, but like today, if it were raining here, I would obviously
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:39.520]   have a different frog than y'all, but we all have the same frog. But my temperature is 81 and
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:46.880]   yours is 71. Yeah. So my father's by the way, my frog also is wearing his mask in proper ways.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:52.800]   You want your frog to be sweating? We know, but like sometimes I feel like the frog is doing things
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:57.440]   that are not like it'll be it's like 53 and the frogs out like sun tanning and I'm like, no,
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:01.280]   53 is too cold. No, that's too cold to be doing that. I'm on my deck.
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:09.360]   Google meet web design. The Google meet web design is rolling out now full availability
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:16.800]   for everyone by this month. I haven't noticed it yet, but streamline bottom bar controls
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:26.720]   because I don't care. Honestly, what do you just think of seeing? No, but when you get on me,
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:31.200]   you go, oh, because we use meat for our staff, many of them. When you get on me, you go, oh,
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:36.800]   I love the new redesign. No, you don't know. No, you don't. You go, Hey, did you turn your mic on?
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:45.440]   Yeah, you're muted. You're muted. You can notice there. I think we're starting to get to the new,
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:52.000]   new share features that Google and NASA Google IO. You can now present Google Doc sheets and slides
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.920]   into ongoing meat calls very easily. Oh boy. This is, I guess, part of that new smart canvas
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:08.160]   stuff. Cool. Okay. Woohoo. And that's the Google change.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:19.840]   You can now buy a dogecoin on Coinbase. You excited? And the price price was going up as a result.
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.560]   Sure. Every once in late to buy. It's the mean coin.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:30.720]   Substack. No, not sub stack. Stack.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:38.080]   I know. I thought the same thing. Stack exchange got sold. Stack exchange. Thank you.
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:45.840]   This is the site that everybody uses. Every programmer, it used to be you'd, you'd, you'd,
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:54.800]   research, you'd study, you'd, you'd very carefully craft your code. Now you just cut in paste
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:42:02.480]   from stack exchange. Did they just get bought? Is that what happened? I thought they did. Maybe I
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:09.360]   misread this. I thought I thought I saw that, but I can't find it now. Oh, well, never mind.
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:17.040]   It's spreading fake news again. This week in speculation. No, I saw it. I know I did. I know
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:24.960]   I did. It was sold for 1.8 billion. That's what I saw. Oh, stack overflow. Overflow. Which is
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:32.000]   by stack exchange. There's the. Is it? Yes. Oh, okay. So what is stack overflow?
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:39.120]   That was the dev site, right? Yeah. That's where that's a stack overflow.
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:46.160]   I remember seeing a lot of, if you mostly free and add like active directory.
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:54.080]   So I guess stack exchange continues, but a stack overflow is being divested out of it by,
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:43:03.360]   it bought by process process, process PROS US. They are buying, no, they're buying stack overflow
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:10.880]   for 1.8 billion. Okay. You know, I'm just, I'm Rummy. I'm getting Rummy.
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:17.760]   What does that mean? Is that our H E U M? That's Rummy. That's Rummy. Oh, okay. That's
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:23.120]   how I thought it was pronounced, but I was like, Oh, I'm Rummy. Have you ever heard that? I'm Rummy.
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:28.880]   I don't know. It's like, it's like punchy. Maybe, maybe I drank rum punch. I don't know.
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:30.640]   Got it. Just Rummy.
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:38.160]   Any other stories here? Yeah. If she market bubble has popped. Has it?
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:42.720]   Yeah. That's what the story says. Yeah. I think it's probably the story says. They say we've
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:48.720]   got the charts to prove it. That doesn't look like a chart that looks like an illustration. Let's see.
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:57.680]   Here's the chart. Well, that's not great. But you could probably correlate that to just the crypto
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:04.000]   market anyway in general. That's the point. Good point. Yeah. It just goes up because that,
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.600]   I know if you owned the Ethereum side of things, the gas fees tend to cost more than the actual
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:16.720]   right art, you know, somebody hit me up for one of mine and there's like, um, you might want to
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:21.440]   raise the price because the gas fees cost more. It might slow be slowing down, but they say that
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:26.800]   $3 million with the crypto art was sold last week. That sounds like it's still a thing. Yeah.
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:33.760]   Somebody's doing all right. Somebody's buying it. I think that is the end of this, uh,
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:40.640]   fabulous show. I think what we should do is you should prepare your picks of the week. And while I
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:48.400]   mention our fine sponsor of the day, cash fly actually, cash fly has been more than a sponsor for
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:53.760]   Twitch for the last decade. We've been using cash fly as our content delivery network. That's
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:59.120]   how we get to you. Whether you watch the audio or the video, you're getting it from a server near
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:06.000]   you thanks to cash flies global network. Now cash fly starting off for something very cool. I'm
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:12.640]   very interested called ultra low latency streaming. I'm not talking web RTC. No, no, no, they're
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:17.680]   latency is terrible. This is stream delays and ultra low latency streaming are less than one second.
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:26.000]   And they offer an HTML5 player that makes it easy to put these streams anywhere you want mobile
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:32.400]   websites application. There's an SDK for better mobile support. That's nice. And of course,
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:38.320]   because cash flies global, it will work anywhere in the world over 50 points of presence all over
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:42.880]   the world with their low latency network. Your visited video streams will be streaming quickly
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:48.640]   anywhere. You have viewers doesn't matter where they are. What continent doesn't matter. And man
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:55.200]   can it scale more than a million concurrent users? It can ingest thousands of synchronous streams.
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:00.480]   And when it's ingesting, it can ingest pretty much anything. It's designed to transmux thousands
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:10.080]   of streams simultaneously with live failover. I'm talking RTMP, RTMP S SRT and more to deliver
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:16.960]   ultra low latency SLDP and HLS streams at the same time. Plus cash fly will build it out for you.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:22.320]   You'll get a custom built solution based on your needs, not anybody else's, all on top of their
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:28.320]   reliable robust global network with ingest and delivery wherever you need it. And man, I know
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:35.360]   because I talk to them all the time, the best support 24, 7, 365 days a year priority support.
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:41.360]   They will fix it. They will fix it. Cash flies infrastructure can support more than a million
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:46.560]   concurrent streams right now. And they're up to five times faster than other CDNs. The most
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:54.960]   reliable CDN in the world backed by a 100% SLA. Nice people too. They've raised a whole bunch
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:47:00.800]   of money for world central kitchen. I think more than $50,000 cash like pioneered the first any
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:07.200]   cast CDN infrastructure way back in 2002. Their best hop technology automatically finds the fastest
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:12.800]   route to and from customer origin across their global network of pops for maximum performance
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:20.240]   and reliability and sub one second latency streaming. You want to know more, you want to find out

[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:53.680]   Thank you, cash fly. I used to hear it on every show. This podcast bandwidth for this week in
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:48:01.680]   Google provided by cash fly at CACAGFLY.com. Thank you, cash fly. How about Stacy?
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:03.920]   That's Cass, you trust from people you love.
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:09.040]   Yeah, we also used to say that now it's podcasts because I realized no one knew what the hell I
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:16.160]   was talking about. What's this? Netcams and social media, right? Yeah, yeah. I've, you know,
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:22.080]   I try to get people to call them netcams, not webcams. That was a failure as well. They're not
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:28.560]   webcams. They're netcams. They're on the net. That's a hard man. It is. Well, and you know what,
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:33.120]   I've realized you just got to go with what people know. If they understand it, that's all that matters.
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:40.320]   It's like, yeah. Stacy, what do you got for us this week? Oh, I have beach reading for y'all.
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:45.840]   Beach reading. Hey, I forgot to ask you what you want to do for your science fiction.
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:53.120]   Yeah. Science fiction, I realized because I was trying to figure this out, right?
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:58.240]   Science fiction is hard because everything's part of a series. Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:05.360]   So I was like, do I launch like the latest murderbot book is a series, but short.
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:13.680]   Hail Mary is not a series, but it's long. Not a series, but it is long. So I'm trying to think
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:20.560]   do you want shorter, but part of a series. Why don't you go into our discord? There's a science
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:24.880]   fiction. Actually, there's two sections. There's a books. I saw there's science fiction section.
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:29.200]   There's a books section and there's a science fiction section, so you could depict whichever
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:36.400]   one you want. Okay. I think books maybe because it's books because science fiction could also be
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:42.080]   movies and TV shows and things like that. So maybe go into the books. Go to the books section
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:47.280]   and just ask. You can even do polls in there. Oh, I'll do a poll. Okay. Yeah, because I was,
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:53.600]   I was picking like books that I'm like, well, we just, Stacy wants to do a kind of
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:50:00.960]   informal book club in the, you can set up a stage and like we have a stage open right now for the
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:05.600]   show, but you can. And this is for a club twit members. You have to be a member of club twit,
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:10.000]   but you know, that's just one more thing you get for seven bucks a month at a TV slash club
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:17.680]   twit. There, I snuck a plug in. So, so your book could be an appropriate one for the club,
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:23.200]   except it's a series. Well, this, this particular book, so this is a book called A
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:30.960]   Memory Called Empire. And y'all, I really enjoyed this. There is book one of, I don't know how many
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:39.920]   there's only two books out. Yeah. Yeah. But it's, it's probably not done. This is probably hardcore
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:47.280]   science fiction. Looks good. Hugo award winner, by the way. Yeah, it's a really good world building.
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:55.360]   It's basically, it's mostly political intrigue and drama. I feel like if you liked the expanse,
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:51:03.120]   you would like this science fiction part of it is less like it's not, there are some space
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:10.960]   opera aspects, but that's downplayed a lot by the politics of it. So, and there is a chunk about like,
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:16.000]   one of the cultures involved is really all about like epic poetry. So there's some weird
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.680]   digressions about it, but poetry could just ignore that. Or you could read it.
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:26.880]   Tell me how you liked my poems. It's, yeah, it's, it's a weird, it's kind of a little weird,
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:31.920]   but, but it's, it fits with the world and it doesn't really bother you. Are you reading it as a book
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:39.200]   or listening as an audiobook? So I listened to the first one as an audiobook and it was good.
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:44.240]   And then I read the second one, which would you recommend? Which did you like better?
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:53.360]   I want to, I like reading. Yeah, I want to do more Kindle books because I, I want to do more
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:58.640]   annotation and notation. It's easier. It's hard with an audiobook to do that. I read so much fat.
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:02.640]   I mean, like I read this book in like eight hours and an audiobook was like, I mean,
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:07.680]   the audiobook was 18 hours. Right. Even if you speed that up, it's still a commitment.
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:16.640]   So I mean, it's your call. The audiobook is nice though. The reader, reader. Yeah, the reader.
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:18.720]   I could play a little bit and see if you can hear her.
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:26.240]   Between a handy sun and its nearest useful planet. The largest of a string of mining stations
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:30.160]   that make up this small region of space. It does sound like the expanse. Wow.
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:37.360]   Mining stations. Yeah, but it's very different than the expanse. So it's not, you know, but, but
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:41.600]   yes, but I really enjoyed it. So I'm going to buy it right now. I'm just trying to
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:44.880]   try to, if it should be audio or Kindle, I don't think I'm going to do the Kindle.
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:50.240]   It's nice to have something on my Kindle. I will say the names as in all science fiction,
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:54.960]   maybe not all, but many science fiction books. I appreciated the audio simply because I was like,
[01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:58.320]   yeah, how do you pronounce this series? Take a lot. That is not what I thought that was.
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:05.440]   They call it Tex-Colon. Tex-Colon? They say Tex-Colon. T-E-I-X-C-A-L-A-A-N.
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:10.800]   Sometimes though, in sci-fi with the audiobooks, when they drop you right in, you're like,
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:14.400]   what's going on? Because there's so many made-up words and things. And you're like,
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:18.640]   ah, I got to orient. Yeah. Anyway. Yeah, I know what you mean. So that's,
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:23.440]   you know, both of these books range tremendously. They stand alone.
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:28.080]   So I love sci-fi and it sounds like something I'd really enjoy. So thank you.
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:37.600]   A memory called Empire by Arkady Martine. She's a Byzantine professor of like Byzantine history.
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:45.680]   Oh, even better. I love that about her. It is the first of two. The second is a desolation
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:51.520]   called Peace. So I like where we're going with this. She's a speculative fiction writer and as
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:58.880]   doctor Anna Linden Weller, a story of the Byzantine Empire and city planner. Oh, this isn't her real
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:04.560]   name. Under both names, she writes about border politics, rhetoric, propaganda, and the edges of
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:11.760]   the world. She grew up in New York City, Turkey, Canada, Sweden. She lives in Baltimore with her
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:19.600]   wife, Vivian Shaw. There you go. Oh, hey. Yeah. And for Pride Month, if this is important, this is a
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:31.040]   writer who is prideful. LGP. She's full of pride. A and the characters are two. So.
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:36.960]   Just in case you're worried. Yeah. I mean, I think it's important to read more diverse authors. So,
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:46.560]   yes, that's like a million yalls. Yes. This is. I can't wait. I like her pseudonym, Arkady Martine.
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:53.120]   That's good. Mr. Jeff Jarvis, your answer. I'm going to do a quick number that I went on.
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:56.960]   Another real quick thing. So, so time, New York Times story said that the
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:06.480]   rural urban broadband divide isn't what you think of it. That 81% of rural households are
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:11.760]   plugged into broadband. Wow. 86% of urban. That's kind of higher than I thought.
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:21.440]   But what it also says in raw numbers, 4.6 million rural households are not connected, but 13.6
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:28.080]   urban households are not connected. So, it's really about a poverty gap, not a geographic difference.
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:34.880]   All right. I think in that case, and it's fixable. It must be fixed after the pandemic. How can we
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:39.600]   not have everyone connected? Yeah. I want to mention just one of the things, and often to his
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:46.480]   break credit talks about brings up issues of mental health on the show. After the Naomi
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:52.160]   Osaka pulling out of the French Open and the media result, the New York Times and the telegraph
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:57.360]   go after her. But I think smart media like the Guardian realized that media have a role here.
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:01.280]   So, a friend of mine online, I've never met her in person, but I've known him for years online,
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:08.080]   and Thomas Bechdel. His Twitter is B-A-E-K-D-A-L. He's a Danish media expert.
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:15.360]   Did a really generous thread. It's the same word I would use for Ant when he talks about these
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:20.320]   things. I think there's a generosity in sharing, where he explains what it's like to have
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:26.720]   this kind of debilitating social anxiety. And I don't think we should call it a mental illness.
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:30.240]   I don't think we should call it a matter of necessarily a mental health. We should recognize
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:34.880]   that people are different. And for some people, some people aren't like us coming out here and
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:38.960]   talking to the whole world every day and having fun and doing that. And that's not
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:53.240]   to call this normal and to call that abnormal. K
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:57:00.040]   So, Thomas talks here about going through where he was told you've got to be an extrovert and
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:06.840]   he forces himself to be an extrovert and it nearly tears him apart bodily. And when he has to give
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:11.480]   a presentation, he puts up a video of a presentation and says, "I look a normal, don't you think?"
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:19.240]   But he puts up his heart rate, is going to 151 during that. It's made him collapse sometimes.
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:26.360]   It has real effect on him. And I thought it was a really generous thread to explain. I've got
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:30.360]   members of my family who have social anxiety who aren't like, "Me, who's out here all the time."
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:35.640]   And I think it's important to recognize that people are different and they have different
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:42.040]   expectations of what they do and why they do it. And to force Deoie Asaka, who is brilliant
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:48.680]   and talented, to say that you must do this or else you're abnormal, is she's not the one who's
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:51.560]   wrong. Everybody who says that as well. So, thank you for that little story.
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:56.680]   Yes. And you know what? There is a kind of throughline. We need to celebrate our differences.
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:03.240]   Exactly. That's what makes the world interesting. You wouldn't want the world to be filled with
[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:09.800]   people like you, well, maybe some people would, but not me. But if it were like me, that's different.
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:13.560]   If they were all like Jeff Jarvis. No, you don't want that. No, we want the differences.
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:21.960]   It makes life amazing. Jeff, I love you, but man, by the end of the show, I'm like, "Oh, God,
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:28.360]   I've got to be on my toes. It's ready." And, Pruitt, what do you got for us?
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:36.520]   I have two series. First one is called High on the Hog. I got a glimpse of it during my vacation
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:44.360]   time. And it really just opened my eyes, but it also sort of pissed me off because this is a series
[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:52.200]   by Netflix. And it's dealing with the American cuisine and how a lot of it is started based on
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:59:00.520]   African cuisine and why things are so popular today and going beyond saying that southern food
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:07.800]   is just fried chicken and collard greens. There's other things out there. But it dove into, in one
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:15.480]   episode, George Washington's chef named Hercules. Never heard of the guy. Why hadn't I heard of this?
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:22.200]   But supposedly he was just an amazing chef, world renowned. Everybody loved them, but yet he was
[01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:28.200]   still just another black slave in the country here. And just doing what he needed to do.
[01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:32.600]   Another slave who invented macaroni and cheese. I got to point out.
[01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:36.680]   Where is the statue? Single greatest food of all time.
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:44.200]   And speaking of macaroni and cheese, it's funny you bring it up because I watched that episode
[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:50.440]   Sunday. But Saturday afternoon, I was on Twitter and our friend Matteo Donny,
[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:58.760]   and I was over in Scotland. He sent me a picture of macaroni pie. And I saw it and I said, you know,
[01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:06.520]   that's all I've ever known it as in my life was macaroni pie. Later on, it came out as mac and cheese.
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:13.480]   And when this show came on Sunday, they talked about it being macaroni pie. That's what he called
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:21.000]   it. It wasn't called mac and cheese because it was in a casserole dish and sometimes had a crust
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.520]   and this is how this is what my mom made. Macaroni pie.
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:29.480]   Yeah, she didn't call it macaroni pie. But that's exactly what she made. And it has that
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:34.360]   delicious crust because of it. It's so good. When I make macaroni, that's what I make here.
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:40.520]   But it was just little stuff like that that I wish I had known back when I was in school,
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:46.440]   but nobody ever taught it. Nobody ever brought this stuff up. I appreciate Netflix doing this.
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:52.600]   And any other series is Halston. Shout out to the month of June.
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:58.360]   I loved Halston. CQ Plus. Oh my god. Halston, that was a great series. I've always been interested
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:06.040]   in designers, whether it's fashion or artists. I love the relationship that he had with Elsa
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:11.240]   Peretti. I love Elsa Peretti and her jewelry and what she did with Tiffany. But if you watch that
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:18.920]   show, it is really a man of many talents. I had never heard of Elsa Peretti till I watched this.
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:22.840]   Then I became very interested in her. She decided she was. She just had an Elsa Peretti necklace.
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:26.360]   Mike, I was like, that's why I married my husband because he gave me one. And I was like,
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:34.440]   I got some from my wife. Yes. All of the curves, most jewelry was sort of edgy and
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:40.200]   sort of blocked off. She focused a lot on nature and how things in nature are curvy.
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:43.320]   And just she created the famous Halston perfume bottle.
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:45.160]   Yep. That's a great moment.
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:51.640]   And the C14 is a high schooler. Wow. Did you slather it all over?
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:58.440]   Yeah, it didn't matter. You're still doing like it. But I'm wearing Z14.
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:06.840]   But yeah, those are my two picks. But I definitely have to shout out the champ here in the household
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:11.640]   once again. All right, let's do it. Last week was just super proud for me and the family
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:17.400]   with our senior graduate in high school. My mom came flew over to the graduation and was able to see
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:23.880]   her grandson graduate. And then the track meet the next day was that boy right there in the red.
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:29.240]   Oh, look at him go. Always fast. Look at him go. Yeah, baby.
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:33.320]   Wow. Listen to the background, by the way.
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:43.400]   Yeah, dash he had a PR of 11 one. He had an unofficial PR of 10 nine, but his unofficial,
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:50.440]   but the 11 one was quite proud of him. But he also won the 200 meters, which is the next link
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:52.520]   and got a PR in that.
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:03:00.520]   Super dad. You shouting get him. But who is it exactly you're getting in an event like that?
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:09.640]   Hey, you all the opposition. And this is this is the 200 meter. Yeah, and he got stuck in a bad
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:12.920]   lane. He got stuck in the lane eight, which is the worst. The outside lane.
[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:22.600]   We got to get you some new slogans. Yeah, we are. I want and shouting that for me when I'm like,
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:26.680]   working. I'm like, get him. Get him. I'm just gonna. I'm gonna pretend like, okay, Stacy,
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:31.400]   he's got this. You can do it. Good. Given 200 meters. He just leading them leading the pack.
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:38.760]   He's just going up. Wait out. Look at that. And he also won the I love the Brad Jad in the background.
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:48.120]   I just love it. That's really great. He really, he really took off, man. That's awesome. And that is
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:54.760]   the he also won the long jump. He had a personal best of 20 inches. Look at that.
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:00.680]   You know, another parent was there to take photos and got this photo. And I wanted to share it,
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:05.080]   but I don't want to say his name. And he also took pictures of the 100 meter dash.
[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:13.400]   They're really, really father of hard heads. Ladies, gentlemen, Mr. Ant, proud dad. That's right.
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:15.400]   Awesome. It's awesome.
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:18.040]   Basel tough. Thank you.

[02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:12.200]   And if that podcast client of yours supports reviews, please leave us a five star review. We'd
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:19.160]   sure appreciate that. For offline conversations, asynchronous conversations, they are online,
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:23.720]   but they're just not at the same time as we do the show. We have a forum at twit.community,
[02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:30.600]   and we have a mastinon instance at twit.social. And don't forget club twit, which helps keep this
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:35.800]   show and all of our other shows on the air, keeps the staff employed, and keeps me playing
[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:44.440]   Valheim. That's twit.tv/clubtwit to find out more. Thank you, Stacey Higginbotham. Stacey on
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:51.480]   IOT.com. That's where her newsletter is. It's free and she doesn't track. So there she also has a
[02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:57.480]   great podcast. But she comes down and irritates you like a duck coming down in Rauchow Marks
[02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:03.240]   Constantly. But okay, everything has its price. Andrew is going to... The newsletter, it doesn't
[02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:09.320]   happen. The newsletter, if you subscribe, I just gently pop into your email with like 3000 words
[02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:15.720]   on the IOT. It's pretty impressive, really. It's like dropping a book on someone's desk.
[02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:22.920]   Pretty impressive. Thank you, Stacey. It's great to have you. Jeff Jarvis is also here. He's the
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:27.640]   director of the Town Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School
[02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:35.320]   of Generalizing Craig Newmark at the City University of New York. Frank Sinatra called him a bum
[02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:43.720]   former TV guide critic. And he is not paid by Google. Just want you to know, I am not paid by
[02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:49.320]   Google. And Pruitt at Hands On Photography. He's also on Hands On Tech. He's on this show
[02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:55.320]   every week. And he's a great person to have around. I highly recommend it. If you get a chance,
[02:06:55.320 --> 02:07:01.880]   ask him to shout, "Get him at you and see it." Get it, baby. Get it. I want to get some macaroni
[02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:08.440]   pie. That's what I want to get. Let me know. Next time you make some, we'll invite you over.
[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:14.120]   Brisk gets on me if you bring the macaroni pie. Now that's a marriage-made heaven.
[02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:24.920]   We thank you all for being here. We'll see you next time on this week in Google. Bye-bye.
[02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:34.920]   Get him. Get him. You know what's fun, Android. You know what's even more fun though? All about
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:40.360]   Android. That's my show, Jason Howell, along with my co-host Ron Richards, Florence Ion. And we welcome
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:46.360]   guests on each and every week from throughout the Android ecosystem, developers, Googlers,
[02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:51.480]   journalists, people who are all geeked out about the Android operating system. We tell you everything
[02:07:51.480 --> 02:08:02.280]   you need to know, twit.tv/aa every Tuesday. We'll see you there.
