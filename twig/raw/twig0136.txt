[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.440]   Gina Spani is here from smarter where
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.940]   Dot org and the author of think up app at think up app dot com great to have you Gina
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.920]   Happy leap day happy leap day the 29th. I'm not wearing blue and yellow today, but where did that come from?
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.200]   Lee day Williams 30 rock. Yeah. Yes
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.760]   So that show aired a few days ago and already blue and yellow is
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:45.000]   It it's like become like it's in stone and any minute. I'm gonna sprout gills and you know and ten years from now
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.780]   People wear blue and yellow and they won't know why actually it'll be 12 years from now
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.820]   They won't know why it was actual is an excellent cultural commentary on absurd holiday figures and rituals and customs
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.780]   I missed it. I didn't see it and I still know about it. It's it's really fascinating. Yeah, it's true. Yeah
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.980]   Jeff Jarvis is also here the author of what would Google do is no his book is called public parts
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:15.980]   He blogs at Buzz machine calm and teaches journalism at the City University of New York. Hello, Jeff and I have a new venture
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.060]   Downloaded mine, but I haven't had chance to read it. This is a little bitty book
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.840]   It's a Kindle single only a buck folks
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.020]   I want I'm number 12 on the Kindle single with you guys got me up higher in
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.620]   The debate over privacy come on twig nation. Come on. It's only 99 cents
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.740]   So what's in this book?
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.420]   It argues that it's not a book. It's just me book. It's just six thousand words
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.820]   It argues that Gutenberg was the original technology entrepreneur that he went through all the same challenges that a technology entrepreneur goes through today
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.260]   solving technology problems
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.140]   developing in secret and then later he became more open source
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:05.940]   putting together a team finding capital finding customers and and he was done in in the end by his cash flow and his cap table
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.180]   but even so he obviously disrupted the world in a way that we all hope to do today and
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.340]   I think he's the patron state of Silicon Valley and that's what I argued
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.300]   Wow, that sounds great six thousand words
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.820]   And it's selling all right. It sounds like no more than a typical twig rant for me. So you know
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.540]   Is so easy to is it a profit deal?
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.380]   Well, yeah, I mean, I'll make you know, it's all profit. I guess isn't it doesn't cost you anything. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.620]   You know Kindle single was actually very easy to be worth
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.980]   They said last week. Okay, we'll go with it within a week. It was copy. Oh, so you have to get them. Who is they Amazon
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:53.220]   Get Amazon Amazon. Yeah, so do they do the copy copy? Oh, okay, and do they do the copy editing and they created the cover and
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:03.420]   Like a very easy very pleasant and they take what what percentage they take 30% just like Apple. Yeah
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.220]   Yeah, you know
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.180]   Well, you sent me a coupon so I can't say I bought it
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.300]   But may I'll just buy another one. Oh, I can't though because I've turned off third-party cookies and I can't
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.180]   Sorry, Jeff
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.100]   Yeah, I wanted to learn how it also says whenever people say well, you're against paywalls, Germans
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.740]   You think kind of those values well, I'll sell you this too, you know
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.860]   Look we're all gonna have payroll soon and I hope you enjoy them
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.380]   That's all I could say I'm referring to an earlier conversation
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.460]   Which was not recorded and had nothing to do with coffee. So don't get all excited
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.860]   It's a world of first parties only I am sad that I did not go to Barcelona for many reasons
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.300]   Yes, but mobile world Congress has been amazing
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.620]   Including a keynote from our fearless leader Eric Schmidt. I
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.420]   Don't I can't remember him. He doesn't usually do keynotes
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.700]   He does mobile he did a mobile event in our technology and mobile event in Germany some time ago
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.780]   He does them on these kinds of industry events which would surprise you but he does do them occasionally
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.220]   It was good. I thought it was very good now according to Stephen Shanklin running writing for CNET
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.900]   He says the summary of Eric's speeches with the internet the week will be made strong
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.700]   Unless dictators try to keep too much control. Is that a fair? I didn't watch it. Is that a fair?
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.580]   Synopsis, oh it's not synopsis. He obviously showed off Android and everything else, but yeah, I think I think morally
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.660]   It's a synopsis that says beware people. It's the same discussion
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.860]   We don't want to have again that we were just having about regulation of things like goodness
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.860]   And we can you can talk. I'm just not gonna say a word
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.460]   My my my bottom is still sore
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.420]   I do not want to hear my more spanking
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:06.020]   but what so he was warning against regulation today that you think has this impact that in fact has another impact and
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:14.060]   So yeah, I think that that was the moral message here, but he was really also being terrible
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.900]   You know, it's it's he's he's a technology optimist even more than I am
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:26.140]   Talking about self-driving cars and how it's gonna save unbelievable numbers of lives and how robotics will make a difference and how more data will be helpful in our lives
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:32.180]   And and this goes to the conversation we were having before the show started that it is up to
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.580]   Generous saying up to media and advertising to show the benefit of
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:44.620]   It's up to I think technology companies like Google to show the benefit of what they do
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.700]   Encreating new technology and if they don't people are going to continue to be scared of it. I'm not sure that
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.260]   Extolling a highly optimistic some would say utopian futures necessarily going to be credible with everybody who's scared
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:04.700]   But I still think it's worthwhile saying if you if you tamp down here folks, this is what you may give up
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.340]   You know, it's funny. I used to be afraid
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.500]   For the net because of big
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:17.460]   companies net neutrality and companies like Comcast and other stakeholders trying to give the record industry the movie industry trying to
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.420]   Kill the net because they saw it as a threat to their business model now
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.900]   I realize what's gonna kill them that it's its users
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.820]   Wow
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:36.540]   I am stunned no, I mean really I truly believe that this knee jerk terror over tracking is
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:42.420]   It's gonna yeah, no, I think it's gonna really be a problem because it just makes it impossible to
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.340]   Create the free stuff that we create
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.940]   And you must you brought it up. We all that we clear here. Yes, I agree. Absolutely
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.580]   I think that's the danger is that we're getting into a moral panic over
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:00.180]   Technology and we're acting as if it's big companies doing it and yes some of them are yes
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:05.220]   They do bone-headed things but we have to be concerned about the unintended
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:11.580]   consequences of the impact on the tools that we so love and depend upon and the freedom that that brings
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.060]   I think my issue is I don't think people understand technology
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:21.780]   pretty much at all, you know most people people watch this show do but most people do not understand technology at all and
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:30.140]   so this is so complicated of a subject that even we who do have a difficult time explaining it and
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.220]   Understanding it I despair of normal people
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.980]   Getting it and the easy headline the easy takeaway is
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.780]   Google tracked you on the iPhone and
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.620]   That's it done. That's all you need to say and that's forever in people's minds and it's over
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.700]   Leo one of the most amazing
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.700]   Well, I think I think that not amazing one of the things that really fits in with that argument and what
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:58.140]   Eric Schmidt said was that he basically said I'm trying to find it here because I'm before some other earlier
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.100]   Technology will disappear. It will just be there
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:06.300]   Right, which is part of the view so so we don't have to know about it. It's underneath everything
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.860]   But when you're afraid of technology when it seems mysterious when you don't know what it does
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.160]   That's perhaps the wrong way to go
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.340]   Because then people get more frightened of what they don't know, right?
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:22.640]   Now Gina's of the opinion that the media companies is like this is what Eric Schmidt did
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.300]   But you know he's preaching to the converted when he's standing on a stage of mobile world Congress
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:34.200]   But it you think Gina that if that Eric needs to do more of this that everybody needs to explain this and is that gonna solve it?
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:40.540]   I mean, I think being clear about what you're doing what the what the benefits you can't be shared and aggregate data
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:46.240]   Is you can't be because it's too tough. It's too complicated technical subject people don't get Jeff's book public parts
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:53.100]   I'm just straight up plug. I mean he's doing the good work of saying hey with these are these are the benefits of living publicly putting your data out there sharing data
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:59.260]   I think things like flicker, you know defaulting to public it tools the default to public and the benefit that we get out of those things
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:04.660]   I think it's important to tell those stories to counteract the the moral panic stories
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:11.180]   I think Google with their privacy policy consolidation, which goes into effect tomorrow is in a really good position to say
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.700]   Look at this huge suite of products that we have and now that we can share data
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:21.900]   You've agreed to let us share behavioral data between them. Look at the value. We can provide you right?
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.020]   So they're in a really good position to show that
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:30.540]   And you know, I do think I do think it's about telling telling a better story
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.380]   I think that it's in the media company's best interests to just be
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:39.340]   Transparent and upfront about the fact that if they're offering free content, you know, you're the product
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:46.660]   Not them, you know, this this idea that if you're using free service, then you're handing over your information and we're providing value
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.660]   It's a fair trade
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.940]   I mean, I think that there there are a lot of people who aren't technologists who look at free services look at like Facebook and think
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.580]   How is this free? How does this company worth so much money and it's free?
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:02.220]   You know, why do I get to use this thing for free? We have to stop telling the free story and just be honest
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.220]   What it isn't free
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:10.260]   If your information and they provide a communication service and that and that is a and it's a really it's a fair trade
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260]   And it's a beneficial in a lot of ways
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.700]   So I just and you know, this is what we do on the show
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.100]   This is what Jeff did with his book and I have more hope about it Leo. It sounds like you've had a rough week
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:26.420]   We can turn this around and that we can tell the story and in in a way
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:32.260]   That's not overly technical, but just be be more upfront about the idea that if you're not paying for a service
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260]   Then you are then you are the product
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.900]   Maybe that's not such a great way to put it
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.500]   But just just get people used to the idea that sharing your information if you share your information
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.420]   Then you get these benefits and then you get to use these tools if you don't want to show you
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.740]   Then you don't get to use the tools. That's not gonna work. No
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.900]   People want Facebook. They want it for free. They have no idea that it costs money
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.940]   They don't understand the server cost money. They have no idea
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.380]   But I think there's some uneasiness about it
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:07.340]   I think this is where the moral panic comes from, you know, like there's some uneasiness with people who don't understand technology or like
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.340]   They love Facebook. They don't really understand why it's free
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.380]   You know, they're gonna see these stories about the IPO and because billions of dollars
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.460]   It's gonna involve and it's sort of I think it's just this like big mystery to folks
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:23.460]   Well, and then what happens because of the moral panic is the thing that Google did which I agree with
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:28.260]   Wrong on iOS is because of the moral panic because Google considered saying well
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.860]   We want this information and realized that people would
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.060]   Say, you know, they would be freaked out
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.820]   So the engineer and him said well, we're really not doing anything bad
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:44.420]   We're just gonna set this plus one button. So let's just do it and I think what you're gonna see is two things will happen
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.580]   So there's gonna be this moral panic
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:53.060]   Companies will try to sneak more because you can't I'm telling you you can't say
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.780]   Hey, we just want to track you for advertising purposes to give you a free service people go what the hell with that?
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:03.220]   It's like if you know, I look at this doesn't affect us to it doesn't use third party tracking cookies
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:09.520]   It literally does not affect us, but if somebody started if everybody started using ad blockers that would affect us, right?
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.780]   so I
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.220]   Could think in the in my head of that people just everybody uses ad blockers
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.900]   You said but wait a minute it's a free service use ad blockers
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:22.180]   We can't do it and people say well, you know figure out a way because we're gonna use it and we're gonna use ad blockers
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.460]   And then the companies do figure out a way they sneak around
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:30.120]   Then government gets into it and now we're really in trouble
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.500]   Right and I think that's exactly what's happening kind of right now
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:40.020]   Yep, anyway moving on at one point Google considered having its own currency
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:45.380]   By the way Facebook's already doing this. Yeah, is it Facebook doing this? Yes
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.380]   They've got those kind of those cards
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:53.820]   I've not the same way Google was Google was gonna do a like a Bitcoin appear to appear money system
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:14:01.300]   And they said the reason that the reason the reason they chose not to was not because of technology or logistics
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:06.580]   It was because it's illegal and governments fear it because they wouldn't have control
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:14.820]   And and people could just have exchange on their own and governments don't like that and oh government hate that idea. Oh, yeah
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:22.500]   Can we just take a moment and say how cool would a good about Bitcoin be how cool would a good go back but Bitcoin be
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.540]   They were gonna call on Google bucks
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:32.820]   Your Google box. I think they should have called googes or something else, but uh, now I should warn everybody that if Google did that it would be to make money
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.340]   Just so you understand
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:42.340]   They didn't do it. They didn't they didn't they wanted to do it not because they were nice people but because they wanted to make some money
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.700]   Damn you need the vacation damn them
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:51.620]   Can I show you a nice video from Barcelona? Please cheer me up. Here's this here's
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:56.340]   Mobile look at this is they do it outside, which is kind of cool or just the android
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:03.140]   So some of it's outside some of it's inside. I guess there's a robot cheery little robot. How could that be bad?
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:10.820]   But it gets better. They're making they're making all fleshy androids. Yeah, oh we want we want these
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:16.980]   There's ice cream sandwiches too. You see this is exactly how they subvert you. I just want to warn you
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:23.300]   This is how I get you think they're nice people with fuzzy little robots and then they make money off of you
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.420]   Oh
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.420]   Man
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.380]   Let's start singing the international
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.700]   I gotta find the ice cream sandwich
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.900]   Commies
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:39.300]   No, no, there's ice cream sandwiches in here. Wow. Where about jelly beans?
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.580]   Well, there was a jelly bean photo in a private meeting
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:49.060]   I really regret not going this year because this this is this is clearly where this is where the rubber meets the road and technology is
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.620]   And I think next year will have to be at my mobile world congress
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.620]   That was eric's main point too is that we're just at the point where
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.820]   uh, you know
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.060]   Two billion people are on our connected to the internet. There's seven big people in the world
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.820]   There's so much growth to go. They're going to come on through what we now would call smartphones
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:11.860]   We'll call something else and you know an android in every pocket and that's where he's headed
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:18.980]   And it's about connectivity. Yes, and then making money as a result. Well, of course, it's uh, Jason sparrow who's head of mobile sales
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.860]   sales folks
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.060]   Who said that I cannot take you to this
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:29.780]   Is that that a billion people will be using mobile as their number one way to get online by 2012?
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.620]   primary method this year a billion people
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.780]   No
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:41.380]   It's just a chain is mobile. Mobile's just mobile. We're always gonna be mobile. It's the future. It's connecting
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.100]   Problem it's going to know where you
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:49.540]   Well, that's and I think that that really is a big issue with mobile is that these things really are spy devices
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:55.060]   They've got gps built in I mean tracking cookies is like so 1990
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:01.460]   This stuff this stuff really knows exactly where you are and people like nowhere you ate pizza
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.460]   Dennis Crowley had on it
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.460]   Did you know dens is talking mobile world congress the guy who started four square
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:12.180]   He wants to do a new four square that lights up a map wherever you are you look at this map
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.340]   And it shows all the things that four square recommends all the places your friends have been in fact
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:21.620]   They've got an NFC chip now that instead of checking in and this actually is going to be critical to the success of four square
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.300]   You just tap your phone against the NFC thing and it says I'm here
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.820]   And uh, and if we could just get everybody to do that
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.740]   Then we could really make some money
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:40.420]   Seriously, this is the benefit you get from all that tracking is that now you know where your friends have been what places they like
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:45.940]   Um, but there's tracking involved. So I I wonder if this uh sudden
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.900]   Uh, uh, uh, it's feels like puritanism this sudden sudden
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.500]   Puritanical privacy uh concern
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:59.780]   Is going to just kind of make all this stuff shrivel up. I mean you need there's a trade you get some
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.540]   benefits from this
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:08.660]   And mobile is absolutely critical in all of this. I hate I hate to plug and make money because of it
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.420]   But that's exactly why I wrote the book. That's exactly what I feared
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.940]   That it's not about the privacy is important
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.100]   And it's worthy and it needs protection and we all have it and there's nothing wrong with it
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:27.620]   But it is being used as a guise to come in and regulate the technology same as piracy security
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.220]   Decency civilization in the case of sarco z
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:37.380]   These are all guys is of why governments are trying to come in and regulate the net and we're falling into a trap people
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.100]   We're falling into a terrible trap
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:45.300]   Uh
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.980]   I'm on a show with two crazy
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.980]   No, it's funny
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:00.260]   Jeff and I have have different you know jeff really is like he's slowly changing my mind from week to week
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.340]   I just I feel that I need to represent
[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:07.620]   At the the the technologist and these aren't people that don't understand what's going on. I mean, this is our audience
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.780]   If you look what's going on in the chat room. This is our audience. Oh, yeah
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.900]   No, what's up?
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:17.060]   Yeah, that feel really wary about these things and I my default setting is to feel wary about these things
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:22.980]   And I think that comes from two things. I'm a woman and I've had a crazy guy sending me crazy emails for three three or four years
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.980]   So google's not a person
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.780]   Right now. I understand. I understand this is a human using tools
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.700]   I'm just saying that before I broadcast where I am. I think of this crazy guy
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.060]   I understand that and I think that that's part of this is that
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.460]   biologically we conflate
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:43.780]   A reader that's scanning your email with a human being reading your email. It isn't really reading your email
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.820]   What google right right but we conflate that because biologically that's the all we understand
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.740]   Right and even technologists conflate that. I mean you're a technologist
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:56.260]   Yes, that's true. Can you use the word read my email? I'm not reading your email
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:01.860]   But people there are people who run those servers and there are people who set up the security around those servers
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.100]   So there's always the issue of not not only unintentional data leaks
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:12.660]   So I opt into google latitude and it's kind of automatically, you know, and I opt into it automatically broadcasting my location
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:17.140]   You know, that's something that why didn't you worry about that when you were using email for the last 10 years
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.900]   Sending it through a not multiple anonymous servers un unencrypted
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:25.620]   I think about email like sending a postcard any any server that it goes through
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.860]   I just assume that it can be you know that there's a copy made and that it can be published
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.340]   I mean, that's is not new you
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.140]   Use the internet and you're in effect in public
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:39.060]   Yes
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.860]   If what you're worried about is malicious spying
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:47.860]   And actually google's done the work of the angels by putting hg tps on all of that traffic. So
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.540]   Uh, in fact, only google can read your email not anybody in the middle
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.220]   Only that that engineer only that guy
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.780]   Code monkey at google can read it
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.620]   When I feel victimized on the net, it's because of people
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.700]   it's because of
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.380]   dorks
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.380]   Idiots a holes
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.180]   people
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:14.420]   Right, but did you guys saw the the new yar times article about how target can can build up a profile of consumers?
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:20.740]   And so so I heal I'm comfortable with the idea that target knows that I'm pregnant before my parents do
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:27.700]   By the way fascinating story there because that was not the headline that the New York Times used on its very well thought out
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.460]   I think he was nine months writing that piece and it got very little traffic
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:36.500]   But when the was it the washington post jeff who was it that republished it with that headline?
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.060]   Are it was four forms
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.060]   They got all the traffic
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:48.820]   They got all the traffic this guy did this really wonderful article and all the traffic went to the sensational headline not the actual article
[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.060]   Well, I mean, that's just an unfortunate
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.860]   But but it underscores no there's a reason I brought that up it underscores that there's a sensationalism there
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:00.260]   The truth is that that people like target to do it all the time and they do it without the internet
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.740]   Um, they do it in a variety of ways
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.420]   Well through your club card right?
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.140]   Club card they track when you call them for help
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:11.940]   They because you have a target id and they're aggregating every bit of information every time you
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:19.380]   Identify yourself to them of every kind of activity and it's it has been happening long before the internet marketers have always done this
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.620]   I can remember very well
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.620]   25 years ago
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:28.420]   Um a guy there was a great book. In fact, I should try to find this book where they just showed everything
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.420]   They know about you from where you live
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.500]   You know from your zip code I could tell you what magazines you subscribe to because people flock in the same
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:40.100]   Group it's it's not hard to get all this information without tracking cookies or anything else
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.500]   And it's been done for years
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:47.060]   Have I told on axiom if I told this in the show before if I have stopped me you can go to axiom today
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:54.100]   And you can request and pay for the names and addresses of it all really creep you out here
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.100]   You know, I can find women
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.140]   um single
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:05.460]   20 to 35 within two miles of my house who are college educated who earn at least this much
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:12.820]   I can get their names and addresses not because of the internet but because of pre internet databases that exist
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.700]   Right, right
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:21.940]   And and we go back to use and harm versus technology and gathering right the use
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.180]   Here is if you use that to become a masher. Well, that's the problem
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.980]   Um, the harm is what could go wrong, but the fact that this data exists
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:37.780]   Has been there for ages. Why why are we suddenly in this moral panic because we're scared of technology as a society
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.660]   Which is the only because we just we want we want control
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.900]   So so when you got your your diagnosis, you said you were public about it
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.820]   Right, but you said that you were not public about it until you had spoken a jake about it your son, right?
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.660]   Yes
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.660]   How would you have felt I mean
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.980]   So your doctor knew
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.460]   I mean there were there were certain you know your mal-corrector
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.100]   I wanted that control. Yes, absolutely
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:06.580]   And no one should lose that control. I don't think anyone should be forced out of the cancer closet. Absolutely not
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.020]   Right, what I argue instead is a
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:17.060]   If one is generous enough and I believe it is an act of generosity to be open about it benefits come
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.700]   B I already agree
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:25.940]   that apart from the obvious cases that are legislative of our societal behavior of
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:32.100]   Employment and insurance and apart from our own stigmas. There's no actual harm
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.020]   There shouldn't be a harm in society of saying you're sick. There shouldn't be
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.900]   There shouldn't be there shouldn't be right?
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.900]   So what I'm arguing is if we're gonna examine ourselves as a society and if we're gonna fear things
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:46.900]   I think we should fear the fact that we have a stigma against people who are sick
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.980]   It's medieval and that's what we should be examining and changing in society
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.500]   That's true. That's true
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:57.060]   But right now if you're if you're a woman who has a career and you're trying to get pregnant
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.940]   You know that's something you try to hide because you don't want people to know that
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.460]   Because I can affect your career
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.020]   If you're high school and you're you know gay
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.700]   That's something you want to try to hide because there's a stigma. Oh
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.780]   I mean, so we do have to separate technology from society
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:16.740]   What I'm saying is that there are totally legitimate reasons why you want to keep things private
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.300]   And I think that the idea that there's technology that people don't really quite understand
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:25.940]   That that could mean that they don't have control of protecting those things about their lives
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.380]   You know that can affect them in a bad way is what freaks people out
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.900]   But but I I understand it's important to separate those things
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.460]   I think it's really I'm really grateful that you wrote the book
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.580]   I am out of the closet because I believe that it benefits people to be
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:42.500]   Public about things that are are pretty I mean to me is private
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.300]   but
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.140]   But I but I think you have to acknowledge like the fear around this
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:53.140]   I do I think it data sharing and what the where that comes from
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:57.540]   But it's not saying I think jina is that is that we also have to
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.940]   Not be carried away with that fear when it is a fear that is
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:09.780]   That it says i'm uncomfortable or i'm creeped or things like that that we have to deal with the specific harm and the balance that we are making
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.940]   Especially when that balance affects technologies in more ways than we will admit right now
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:18.740]   And this is what eric spent was saying watch out folks. You're going down the road and he said in a few years
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.740]   You're gonna regret it
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:26.900]   You're gonna regret that you let government come in and control the technology the actual technology and how it operates because of the present fear
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.460]   That's the issue
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:33.780]   I'm trying to find here. I've quoted a blog today that was a guy named
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.180]   Panta
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.180]   And I'm gonna not gonna fight regularly
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:44.740]   Be safe. I get the bad dad dad dad dad dad dad dad. He talked about how yeah, here it is that that we we are
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:51.380]   That we have a weird view of privacy now and that we've got to look
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.140]   Differently at it. We've a broken idea of privacy. He argues
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:02.260]   And it's gay bar gay dog hyphen gay hyphen bar dot com and and there's a wonderful post about this and at the end
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:08.500]   Um, you know, he says that if if Galileo had kept his ideas secret then you know because he had fear what would have happened
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.100]   Where would it be if no homosexual ever out of themselves stepping into the public light
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:21.220]   In endangering not only their social status, but also drawing a lot of hate rejection their way people would probably still claim that being gay was a normal or abnormal
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:26.580]   Um privacy is not your brave protector. It is it's an invisibility potion
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.420]   He says it means that nobody can see you your ideas your thoughts your feelings
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:35.460]   It not only means that you could not be heard it also means that your voice your words your actions cannot give courage
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:41.300]   Inspiration and hope to so many people on this planet who might need it you have every right to privacy
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.100]   Nobody should be forced to say something that they want to keep secret
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:49.220]   But the privacy based on hidden by default approach is a danger to us as a society
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:53.220]   I think it's very well said and that's the moral of what i'm trying to say
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.740]   Privacy is important. I will not force you up
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:03.460]   But let's also recognize the benefit of having the courage and the benefit not to be and the main reason we choose to be so scared and hold
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.460]   In is because we're scared of the unknown
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:10.660]   Well, gallelujah was right to be scared. He was almost burned at the state. He was
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.940]   A lot more than it seems
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.700]   uh, but
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:20.420]   But this these conversations are always extremely very useful to me to help as i said i said i'm sorry
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:25.380]   Obviously, i'm not doing a good job of getting you know
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.180]   I'm serious of getting into
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.620]   This conversation and places like policy centers and places like that
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:37.940]   That that there's a steamroller going on here and I haven't figured out how to stand in front of it in a way that doesn't just say
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.980]   After
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:44.660]   Um because i because i'm not grappling with the kinds of fears and concerns you're talking about very well and i and i know that
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:50.500]   And i'm and i'm somewhat with and try to find that bridge that says but hold on folks
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:54.100]   Yeah, I understand this but there's also that and I haven't done the job of us
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.100]   It's very useful for me too to have these conversations
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.420]   I think you've done a pretty done a good job in the book. I think more people have to read the book
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.580]   I think that's the moral story
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:08.900]   Listen, i'm a full-on capitalist. I have apps in the app store. I charge money
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:14.980]   I used to be a hippie commie now complete capitalist. So i'm all for it by jeff's book
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:20.180]   Uh, jeff i'm sorry not jeff
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:27.620]   Andy rubin writing in the gobo google mobile blog or the gobo mobile blog
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.940]   says
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:36.500]   The 850 000 new android devices are activated every single day
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:44.180]   The total number of android devices. I don't know if i buy this but this is what he says in the world are 300 million
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.540]   holy cow
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.900]   450 000 apps
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:57.620]   A billion app downloads happening every month now remember apple's about to cross 25 billion
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.140]   But I think androids pretty darn close
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.820]   And growing very very quickly
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:11.460]   There are 100 plus android devices on display of mobile world congress. Oh is that good or bad?
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:17.780]   Isn't that interesting that he says there are 800 plus devices have launched since android came out
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.940]   100 of them are new and then and then mobile world congress today
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.620]   uh
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.620]   Wow
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:29.220]   Yet and it's doing well andro's doing okay. He's doing well
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:33.540]   I that's a good question though whether or not all those devices is is a is a good thing
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:40.660]   Uh, it's like google must google must feel so they want to they're now going to release their own tablet as if we didn't have enough
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:45.700]   Well, we don't have the right one yet. I was well, we don't we don't have the right one
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.740]   Well, we look google isn't a good android tablet will a google tablet
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.860]   Change that
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:56.900]   I I don't think the galaxy nexus for instance is the best google phone out there right now is it
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.260]   No, and it's a pure google experience
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:05.940]   I don't think it's even close. I lean. I leave that's your cue. Come on in. Oh, no. She agrees with me. There's
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.380]   I yeah, she doesn't even use the nexus. No
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:14.100]   If I would get a phone right now, it might be htc1
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.980]   Well, that's not available yet that in april. Awesome
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:23.380]   But if I were to get a phone today, I would probably go with the droid razormax because you want battery life
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:28.340]   I want battery life. It's awesome. That's what's different between her and me. She is all about battery life
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:34.500]   I'm all about screen size and the point is we have a choice. That's right and I can you get old young lady
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.900]   You'll have the same problem. We don't want a big screen
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:42.100]   But see I don't care about battery life because I have five now count them five batteries for this thing
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.020]   And I keep them all charged. I keep them in my pocket. I keep in my glove compartment
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.540]   I keep them in my desk and if I need more juice, I just put it a new battery and I got it
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:53.300]   They all get about eight hours or nine hours. So it's not like them. Have you talked to your shrink about this?
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:59.300]   He said it. Yes, I did as a matter of this morning. He said can I borrow one because my phone is
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:04.500]   That I do wish they'd standardize on the battery. So that would be that would save me money
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.700]   We actually had a really good conversation about the word choice
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.500]   In the android apple calls of fragmentation
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:15.780]   Right and it versus somebody wrote us a letter saying please stop using the word fragmentation
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.980]   Please start using the word choice. Maybe that's the dichotomy
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:25.860]   About this on our last episode which I'm calling companies like media companies call it fragmentation consumers call it choice
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.260]   Interesting
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:32.100]   Interesting there really needs to be a website though like a single serving website. That's like
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:38.740]   What is the best android phone right now calm and it's like I want better battery life and then just gives the answer
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:43.460]   I want a bigger screen, you know because honestly, I couldn't answer that question. I mean, I'm so
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.620]   Checkboxes. Well, that's what all about androids all about right
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:51.860]   We show the the video from the best by Saturday live video
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.580]   The Verizon one we did show this
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.100]   Yeah
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:02.020]   So
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.460]   Action
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.980]   Anybody who thinks I'm a google shill
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:14.660]   Just talk to him about youtube well or a bunch of other things anyway
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.980]   Uh, I don't think I to be honest. I don't know why google's making a tablet
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:25.940]   I guess they feel that just as with the phone they make need to make reference implementations. Yeah, um show the way. Yeah
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.420]   Uh, there are
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:33.700]   According to Andy Rubin 12 million android tablets sold I find that extraordinarily hard to believe in it's the case
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.100]   8 million of them must be kindle fires
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:40.180]   But he's not I don't think he's counting kindle fires in that because it's not an android branded
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.460]   I can't you guys think of the of the aces pad phone
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:47.220]   I didn't see that one. Oh, that is one of my kicks
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:54.900]   Easy. Oh, oh is that okay? No, go for it. Jeff. You talk about it. I love this. It's phenomenal. It's a it's an amazing video. Yeah
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.060]   Um
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:03.700]   I'll go to the it's a 4.3 inch smartphone. Yes, so not super big. It's that's on the biggest side
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.340]   um, however
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:10.020]   It converts to a 10.1 inch pad phone station
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.860]   So you dock it you dock it now. How is this different from the atrix?
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:20.180]   Well, you dock it into the tablet it powers the tablet and then you can actually dock the tablet into a
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.820]   A keyboard so you've got all three
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:27.780]   So it's a like running ice cream sandwich and it's actually got a pretty vanilla skin
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.780]   On the phone itself. So really it's like a babushka though
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:37.940]   But even better the stylus that comes with it becomes your your hands that becomes your receiver
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:43.940]   So, oh, so you are so you get a you could buy a stylus and then you could use the stylus to say hello
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:48.500]   Stick the stylus in your ear. Yes. You do it. You use it. It's like the world's thinnest
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:53.140]   Uh little phone. Yes. It's hard to feel very masculine when talking with it, but
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:55.940]   So you do wait a minute. Oh, oh
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:01.860]   Sounds insane. So you're saying the stylus this thing. It's a bigger stylus. Hello. Yes
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.420]   When it's docked into the tablet because you can't answer the phone, right? Oh, if it's docked in the tablet
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:10.420]   So, well, but we got a stylus for you. Can I get a little rubber band or something to strap it to my head
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.620]   Is like a Bluetooth like ear thing?
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.100]   That's a real stylus. I gotta find a picture
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.860]   You're holding the phone
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:21.300]   But you know what this is exactly what we're talking about that asus
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.860]   Because androids free
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:30.660]   And it's open can develop the craziest wackiest stuff and this is good for everybody. This is wonderful
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.020]   I wish steve jobs a lot just to hear what he would have to say about this thing
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.580]   He'd hate it. It's got everything he doesn't want
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.580]   This thing
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.180]   But that's fine. You know what?
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.620]   There's this is a we live in a world where there's room for steve jobs
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:48.740]   And and andi roobin and I think that that's what we want. That's called choice. Not fragmentation
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.060]   No matter what apple wants us to call it
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.780]   I would just love to know what word he would choose
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:36:00.340]   What what I love what I love about this is that we also saw there's the there's the
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.580]   thumb drive sized
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.380]   Lidix box, right? Yeah, the raspberry pie
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:09.060]   Right a lot of interest in that five to two with all this stuff, right?
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:13.460]   Yeah, so so there's a new view here that you carry the computer power. Oh, that's a big style
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.460]   Plug it into lots of different things, right?
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:16.740]   Yeah
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.060]   Well, I think what what it's saying there's really
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.100]   And he's using the stylus now what it's saying really is
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:26.020]   That all the innovation all the excitement is happening in mobile
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.460]   Uh that your mobile phone is your computer
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:35.060]   And so it makes perfect sense if your mobile phones your computer to give give you ways to make it, you know
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:38.820]   Work with a keyboard and a bigger screen and all that stuff
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:44.420]   You know there were a number of people have done kind of just random experimentation using a bluetooth keyboard
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.900]   HDMI out of uh
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:50.420]   Almost any uh android phone into a 27 inch screen
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:56.420]   And you're you know so I think where google really needs to go is with android and make it more
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:01.220]   Of a compatible desktop operating system and I is that what ice cream sandwich?
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.100]   Is that what jelly bean is that where they're going is it?
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:09.140]   Is it something that where windows eight is going it is where it is where microsoft's going?
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.620]   Absolutely brought to the desktop before googled it
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:16.900]   That was that was of course the big story this morning as microsoft put out its consumer preview of windows eight
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.340]   Uh, I did not get up at six in the morning to watch
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:26.020]   Uh, but if anybody watched stevenson off ski well, you know, we'll talk about tomorrow windows weekly, but uh
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:30.740]   Um, I think this is I think this is all exciting. This is this is what you want
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.740]   You want let a million flowers bloom some many will be failures as the uh
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:40.580]   Who was it the samson guy at mobile word congress a couple of days ago said well? Yeah, the tablet sets not been so good
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.900]   They didn't sell so well
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.260]   That's great
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:49.860]   That's fine and samson's a big enough company that they can take the hit and try something else that I think the note
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:54.260]   Uh and all and all indications are the notes gonna be a big runaway hit for them, right?
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:58.260]   I think that's where they're trying to focus at this point because it's a tablet
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:04.500]   Well, yeah, and they also introduced a 10.1 version of that as well that I don't get I don't know how is that different than a
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:08.900]   In a galaxy note to uh, I mean a galaxy talent
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:13.220]   Well, there it does it does a few things different. There's gonna be split screen
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:19.620]   So you could uh see browse and then also take some notes. I mean they're they're positioning a little bit different
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.420]   3.7
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.220]   Okay moving on. I don't want to do any numbers no more numbers
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.820]   Just in case jeff has dibs did
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:38.500]   No, they're fine and actually uh, I guess Andy took down the tweet that you wanted
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.380]   Yeah, it's not there anymore
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:47.540]   Let me see because uh it says sorry that page doesn't exist, but maybe that's just a bad link
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:51.940]   Oh, no, well, yeah, because you how can you kill a tweak you can't kill a tweet? Yeah, you can
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:57.460]   Are you kidding just ask rupert fun android party and barcelona last night?
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:02.900]   Thanks to everyone who joined into team. Oh, moss calvin Harris and goldie rocks for the grooves
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:09.140]   What's wrong with that? I thought it was gonna be something more salacious. No, I just wanted to say he was having fun
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:12.500]   It's good. He's having fun
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:16.180]   Hey, you know what you go to barcelona and you don't have fun. There's something wrong with you
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:21.380]   Uh barcelona the parties though started like three in the morning
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:27.300]   You're supposed to you're supposed to go home after a long day take a nap eat it 10
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:33.460]   And go out at midnight, right? That's how it works. Oh man. I'm too old for that
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:41.780]   Like part of me that sounds really fun and what most of me is like, oh no, that's why they live on paella
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:50.020]   Uh, I am excited about this htc one. They have three models the xs and r. It's a uh quad core
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.300]   1.5 gig. I'm sorry
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:57.860]   There's two of them. So if you get the at and t forget I said quad core
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:03.620]   Unfortunately the the at and t will be merely dual 1.5 gigahertz snapdragons
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:08.180]   But that's because of the teg the uh lte chip set and the tegra don't go together
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.900]   But the tegra three will be in the you uh the universal version
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:15.940]   So you probably want to get that unless you want at and t lte. This is right. You need a spreadsheet
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:19.540]   Because if you want at tt lte you can't get quad core because
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.100]   Nah, man. This will be a
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:27.220]   720p 4.7 inch screen. So it's kind of somewhere in between a fablet and a phone
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.180]   It's a fun ablet
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:33.140]   You need a glaucyry in this sort of
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:34.580]   Um
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.780]   It will have uh sense 4.0, which looks pretty sweet
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:43.060]   So this is this is going to be an ice cream sandwich phone with with a new htc sense on top of it
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.020]   Uh, looks pretty good from what I saw
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.340]   Looked great
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.980]   We've got the aces just these a fat pop and it's got the beats
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:55.540]   We got the beats can somebody get me my ting phone is there anybody around?
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:41:01.620]   I want to show off this ting phone. Is there and there's nobody here. Oh, it's it's in the drawer. I keep my phones
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:05.060]   A little ticket hour to find it
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:11.780]   Is just bring me all the phones. It's in the drawer in the left. It's uh, I don't even know how you're gonna know which is which
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:15.940]   Anyway, oh my god. This is a new actually new advertiser
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:22.340]   Doing android phones. They're very excited. We'll talk about that in a second. It let's see what else uh the the uh, uh,
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:26.020]   Wau Wau that's how you say it right? Wau Wau
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:32.180]   That's correct ascend d quad the fastest phone in the world
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:39.700]   I put it in here because it seemed impressive and quad core. That's it is the buzz quad quad quad quad core
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.340]   um
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:47.300]   But see this is uh also 720p everything 720p except now we're gonna see 1080p is next
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.740]   You're gonna there are phones are gonna be 1080p get ready for that
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:54.020]   Um, so but what it's the d quad is the internal
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.860]   Processing power a lot of the first impressions. I've read have been pretty
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:04.260]   Look how ugly it is. It's too sick. It looks like the fastest phone in the world. Doesn't it?
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:07.060]   It looks like it was painted with beige paint
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:14.500]   People seem people who saw it seem to be impressed. That's what I mean anybody who's impressed by speed will be impressed
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:19.220]   But the point is there are hundred new handsets android handsets at mobile world congress
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:26.100]   What was the projector built in even yeah the sam san pico projector built into the top so you do your powerpoint from your phone
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:29.860]   uh and of course
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:36.100]   And this is where I think they made a mistake no key announced a phone with 41 megapixels in its camera
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:42.500]   But it's it's 41. It's 41. I didn't make a mistake there. That's the actual
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.820]   41
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:45.940]   And it's running symbion
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.900]   But it's running symbion not even symbion not even symbion 60
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.260]   It's running an old version of simi and I think that what they said is well
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.300]   We've been developing this for five years. That's what we had
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:43:00.500]   Uh five years ago. So it's not gonna be it's gonna be a very strange phone. It's also thick
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.900]   It's got big it's clumsy and when you take the picture
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:08.100]   It it shrinks it down to eight megapixels or five megapixels in order to get it not looking good
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.140]   So in order for it to fit on the phones
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:15.860]   Yeah, right memory. It's actually, you know, it's a bigger chip than a most point and shoot cameras
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.940]   So it is you know and there's some merit to the
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.900]   It should be a nice camera. I don't know who would buy it
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.060]   But I guess somebody's serious about camera phones
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:28.820]   Isn't there some sort of point with megapixels where the more that you have it doesn't matter as much
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.540]   I thought it was around 10 or 12. It is
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:36.100]   Um, well, it's a it's a that's a complicated long conversation
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.460]   Yeah, probably not for twig, but I I thought that at the point at which
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.580]   It's a really chip size is what really matters
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.340]   So you have two choices as a chip gets bigger
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:49.860]   You can either get the pixels bigger and have them receive more light and be more accurate or you could
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.340]   Increase the resolution, which is what?
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:57.220]   No, kid did but the problem is now you're beyond the refraction limit of the lens especially a little lens like that
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:59.140]   So you're not gonna have a very crisp image
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:03.860]   So they knew that you know you would never take a 41 megapixel besides the size would be huge
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:09.700]   So what they do is they shoot 41 megapixels and then they squeeze it down and that handles all the refraction issues and so forth
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:13.940]   And so you get a good eight megapixel. It's very very crazy
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.580]   So
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.580]   AT&T
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:22.420]   Decided
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.420]   That uh
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.500]   They're gonna have let's see
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:31.620]   This is this is this is a little bit complicated, but but did you explain this because I I read it
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.180]   Here's the deal. Here's the deal, right?
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.740]   Basically, they're double dipping is the deal. Yeah, they are
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.820]   So what what happens is
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:42.740]   Google is paying for the bandwidth to get the internet you're paying for the bandwidth to get from the internet, right?
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:46.260]   Right and now AT&T says well, we're gonna create this new thing
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.140]   It's like an 800 number call so we can convince you it's free
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:54.660]   And what it really is is the worst violation net neutrality you can imagine because what it says is you can
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.140]   be a app maker developer can buy the privilege
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:07.860]   Of your app spanned with not counting toward the users banned with cap so you can use this product
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.300]   Uh with impunity
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.100]   Right. So what what at AT&T gets paid a third time
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:20.580]   So you didn't just pay to the right by the developer right or the developer control right whoever controls the app
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:26.340]   Right and and so it's fairly evil because they're trying to convince you. Oh, this just makes it free
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.580]   Now you don't have to worry when you're using that app
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:34.420]   You're not worrying about your cap that we don't really admit to you that we have but isn't that good for consumers
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:40.580]   No, because what it says is now. This is this is the exact violation of neutrality
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:44.580]   That means that only apps that have the money to pay for this privilege
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:48.820]   Will get this kind of coverage and the rest of the apps will more and more and more
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.300]   Will be discriminated against
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.900]   As they say oh, sorry, you're not using one of the special apps
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:58.180]   You're using one of the crappy apps so for instance, we couldn't afford to do this
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:01.700]   So right and we wouldn't want to do this is stupid. So, uh
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:09.700]   Toy will be distributed sorry if you watch twit, it's going to go against your you know, 100 kilobyte bandwidth cap or whatever it is
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:14.660]   Right, but you could watch you could watch if you'd prefer AOL
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.380]   They they wouldn't charge you
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:24.180]   That's horrible. Isn't it horrible. I'm telling you the world's going to hell and I got there was a fight with somebody
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:31.060]   One
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:39.140]   You know what if you had one I would take it all right. I'll go buy one that would cheer me up
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.780]   Eat one leo need one
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.500]   I have those at google. Oh
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:51.220]   Uh, yeah, maybe they will and and what else were they gonna have all those glasses that we can wear and see what's going on for?
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.540]   Yes, they might have some jelly beans
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:56.740]   Android glasses and ice cream sandwiches. I am so there
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:03.860]   I would love to see some research on how much this iOS debacle has hurt google's reputation and I wonder if
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:07.300]   Do you know google has been historically a very good brand?
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:12.260]   But I wonder if that brand is being tarnished by all of this information, you know
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.740]   Do you think real people in other words are paying attention?
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:22.660]   I don't think real people know about this. They don't care about the third party cookie thing about the the i-frame. Yeah
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:28.900]   Yeah, I think it's starting to spread. I think you see it on tv. I see I see these supposed tech reports on
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:33.300]   Supposed at tv news and you know, well, watch out. They're tracking you
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:38.740]   Um, and and then you know the anchor comes back and says well, that's mighty creepy. Uh, sally. Yes
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:43.700]   You know, it's it's happy. It's at the level of happy talk now and this becomes the accepted
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.460]   narrative and you have a place like the wall street effing journal
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.940]   Um doing this and you know, I
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:54.340]   Listen the actual reporters were doing this. I'm not I'm not
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:48:02.340]   The smurching their ethics in this whatsoever, but I think that they're falling into a company line here where rupert maroc hates google
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:08.740]   And it comes out with his arguments that google is a pirate as kara swisher pointed out
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.300]   Julia angwin is not
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:15.780]   Doing rupert marocs bidding. That's what i'm saying. No, she's not but but but
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:21.380]   The higher ups are happy to promote this. I watched a scene in davos. I wrote about it
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:22.660]   I didn't put it up
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:29.620]   But because it just seemed kind of old and and inside baseball, but but it's relevant where uh the top digital editor from
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:34.260]   Wall Street journal was at the google briefing at davos
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:39.140]   And he just started channeling mordock about piracy
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:43.780]   Well go look up a movie and and eric smith just went into it. So well what yeah, why don't we look up
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:49.300]   mission impossible since that's what rupert had complained about and it was just parotying
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:56.740]   Exactly what mordock was saying in twitter and elsewhere and it was a top editor of the paper doing it. So yes, the attitude does
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:00.420]   Seep through now. I'm not even questioning that he doesn't actually believe it
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:04.100]   But it there is a company line there and it's a company that
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:07.540]   There's the report is out today that we're chase kerry
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.540]   See
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:17.220]   Oh, oh, I think it is of a news corp floated the idea today. I've been saying this since last july of news corp spinning off its newspapers
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:21.940]   Only 20 percent of their I think it's profit
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:26.100]   Maybe it's revenue is revenue. I think is newspaper oriented
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:30.500]   Uh, it is an entertainment company. It is a paid content company
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:34.900]   That's what news corp is and so he doesn't really care about the ad business anymore
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:39.300]   And that's part of the reason these shooting spitballs at it. Sorry. I absolutely agree
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:44.660]   I I joy is a wonderful person. I respect her. She's smart. She's not by any means doing this
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:47.700]   But I think it's falling into you know out of out of
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:53.140]   Orders from on top it's too subtle for that it does seem happening instead somewhat self-serving
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:57.540]   Oh very very and and the path here is
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:02.420]   Murdock himself trying to slam google in every opportunity. So back to your question Leo
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:05.380]   You get enough of that happening from companies like this
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:10.500]   Being read and repeated by happy talk bozos at tv and newspapers
[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:18.420]   Then it does have an impact right on the brand and on discourse around large technology companies being after you
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.060]   Right and that's going to affect all of us geeks
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:27.940]   Well already has because uh the wall street journal no longer lets you read the entire story from google
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.620]   The first click free program has moved on
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:39.700]   I noticed this too. This is an article by danny sellevin in search engine land that when you look up or try to read that wall street journal
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:41.300]   story about the
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:44.900]   Google workaround on the safari privacy settings you didn't get the whole story
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:49.140]   And uh it used to be if you get it through google news you click and we get the whole story no
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:52.820]   You have to you have to pay for it. You have to log in and pay for it
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.460]   um and apparently
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:01.460]   Uh, this is something that's been going on for a while vice president corporate communications for the wall street journal says
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:04.100]   As a strategy
[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:07.780]   We hold back a few of our top stories by not having the full story crawled
[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:12.740]   Which limits selected articles from being available via first click free?
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:18.020]   We've been doing this since last summer. I did kind of notice it as a strategy to encourage subscriptions
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:20.340]   I couldn't figure it out because sometimes it would work
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:23.460]   sometimes not now I have a wall street journal subscription so
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:26.420]   I was forced to remember my password and log in
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:28.660]   but um
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:30.500]   I just click away
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:31.460]   What do you do?
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:36.500]   I just click away. Michael. Oh, I guess I won't read that. I'll read somebody else's paraphrase of it
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.820]   Yep. I mean
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.340]   Yeah
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.980]   I think the london sunday time still has my two pounds
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:45.540]   Oh
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:52.340]   I was such a it was such a nightmare process to buy because I was trying to read the story that they wrote that really now you you want to
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.500]   You want a good example of this
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:59.380]   Uh, jeff the London sending times was just owned by rupert murdock published a story on sunday
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:05.860]   Which made me very suspicious saying that uh, everybody facebook google
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:08.820]   Uh twitter everybody
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:16.180]   All the apps on your on your android phone were uploading everything that you knew to their servers
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:18.820]   Or your texts all your texts
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:22.820]   Texts they were listening to your youtube was turning the camera on and watching you
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.860]   Uh
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:30.420]   Yeah, and face boobius about leo your right is that it got quoted but you couldn't read the story
[00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:34.340]   Couldn't read and I tried to pay the two pounds and I couldn't figure out I had a feeling
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:40.740]   When I read it. Oh, you know what? This is not any research or this is them looking at the permissions
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:44.260]   Yes in the app saying well they ask for permission youtube
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:47.540]   Ask for permission to use your camera so they must be using your camera
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:54.820]   And that's the story I think but I couldn't fight and I tried to pay the two pounds and they I couldn't and I never
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:58.500]   If so finally facebook send these people the oatmeal comic
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:02.900]   Uh the game of throw if you use game of thrones as the example, but it works for everything
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:06.900]   Someone in the chat room asked if I click away from the new york time after the first 20 freebies
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:11.540]   I actually pay for the times I have a subscription of the time so uh, I don't have a subscription to the journal
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:16.260]   So I I not only pay for the times in the journal apparently I now pay for the london sunday times
[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:20.100]   I don't know how long this two pound charge is going to continue
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:24.420]   um facebook had a response which essentially confirmed what I thought
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.300]   Which is no
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:34.340]   We were we were doing a test with some people, but we do ask for these permissions the facebook andra dapp does not
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:41.860]   Read your text messages except in in a very limited case where the people were informed ahead of time
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:45.860]   This is a beta test of some software. We were trying in the messenger
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:50.020]   Was news corp again, and it was and that one was really uh
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:54.820]   Well the the best case you could say well that was just trawling for clicks
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:57.700]   Yeah, uh
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:00.740]   Worst case it was part of the city here's here's how I know this happens
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:02.740]   The city is part about a mobile company
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:08.580]   Is not that the mogul ever tells anyone what to do he doesn't have to the underlings try to please the local
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:10.660]   We always knew what ball allen wanted
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:14.180]   I mean the only time when I when I worked in his core tom marrot knows
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:17.220]   Oh where his bread is buttered let me tell you
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:24.340]   I was you know here a kind word about apple in this show. I'm sorry
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:30.980]   See now people believe that they are there. Yes and tom is going to confirm it because you can't say that
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:36.020]   Now tom will say
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:40.100]   Intentionally say the opposite of what I think just to get my boat which is good
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:43.140]   Yeah, when I was tv critic a tv guide owned by news corp
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:47.460]   Uh, I actually was never told anything. I was I was given far more interference at timing
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:53.300]   And I actually used this as an anecdote to defend him or not when he bought the wall's returnl and defend his lack of editorial control
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:59.540]   The one time I was told anything was that uh leah that um, or rupert was a big fan of mowie shot
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:06.740]   Honest to god and and if you don't like mowie shajef, it's okay, but you better be prepared to defend that decision
[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:10.100]   Really?
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:11.780]   I'm serious really
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:19.860]   That is the best story. I that makes me really happy and jeff if there's anyone who could defend his his dislike for mowieisha
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:22.260]   You are the guy. I think you
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:26.660]   Was fine. It was when I shoot mowieisha's okay
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:30.100]   Wow
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:33.460]   Well, I can't log into the new york times so i'm just gonna skip this next story
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:36.340]   They use cookies they use cookies
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:41.380]   Apparently forgotten my password. I was gonna read a story from the new york times about googles
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:46.740]   New privacy policy, which is you mentioned jina goes into effect tomorrow and maybe a violation of vu rules, but
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:52.820]   Apparently, I don't have my password. I must have exceeded the number of clicks because i've never had this before they won't let me in
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:58.740]   I hate paywalls, but kids get ready because that's all you're gonna get. That's all you're gonna get soon
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:01.300]   You brought it on yourselves people
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:06.020]   Let me let me take a break and make some money because god knows we're not we only have a limited amount of time to do that
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:08.020]   And then it's gonna be all over
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:10.260]   I
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:18.420]   Go ahead skip this ad I don't care damn kids if you skip this ad you might miss the baby polar bear later
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.660]   Just want to lighten things up here we go
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:28.180]   Do not skip this ad there's baby polar bears ahead
[00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:35.540]   They actually did this on live with kelly today they did they they said stay tuned coming up leaping animals
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:38.580]   Stay tuned coming up baby polar bear digging
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:42.660]   Where'd you get that that's good? Well, you got to think Veronica Belmont for the
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:47.780]   Now it gets even better later on right after this ad
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:55.700]   Actually, we talk we pitch all the time about how cell phone companies work
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:58.900]   And uh, and you know
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.620]   There i keep saying if somebody would do it right
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.260]   They would they would kill
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:08.740]   Well, it makes sense the folks from two cows same folks at do hover and uh
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:15.620]   Elliott nasa great guy had the same thought he thought we could do a new mobile service what we're going to do it's based on sprint
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:21.140]   They offer 4g phones android phones through sprints called ting
[00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:26.340]   This sounds like i'm joking, but i'm not ting.com/twig
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:28.900]   ting.com/twig
[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:29.860]   twig
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:30.900]   uh uh uh
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.500]   Bing bang willowana ting ting
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:39.700]   This is an amazing new way to get your cell phone service because it's sprint now of course
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.580]   You're gonna have the same coverage map as sprint does same 4g
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:45.940]   But they have a pricing model that is unique
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:49.060]   so uh
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:52.020]   What they've got is they've got let me show you the the whole thing here
[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:54.100]   They've got this account dashboard
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:58:00.100]   That at any time you log into your ting account and you could see exactly how much data
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:06.340]   How many minutes and how many texts you're using they bill megabytes minutes and texts separately
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:10.900]   You when you sign up you say i want this plan i'm gonna have this many phones
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:15.700]   Actually, I could show you this let me let me go here you can say i could say i want this many phones
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:21.780]   So i'm gonna say let's say i have a family plan for phones. That's the base price of $24 a month
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:27.620]   And then um, oh this is for you to enter in your own. Um, let me let me go to the plans here
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:30.500]   This you could this is also a nice pricing um
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:35.300]   Pricing thing where you enter in your current price so then you say how many phones you want
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:41.300]   And you say do you want extra small small medium or large or extra large xxl plan
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:44.340]   Choose whatever plan you think you're gonna use for minutes
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:47.620]   for messages and for megabytes, you know any just
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:50.340]   But here's the beauty part
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:52.580]   If you don't use it all
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:54.580]   They give you a refund
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:59.460]   Yeah, they don't give you rollover minutes. They give you your money back
[00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:02.180]   every month
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:05.620]   You're automatically credited the difference at the end of the month
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:10.180]   If you use more you're billed at this rate not some inflated crazy rate
[00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:16.500]   So really this is just a suggestion, you know pick what you think you're gonna use because that way you can figure out what it's gonna cost
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:19.700]   This would be $69 for a thousand minutes a hundred messages
[00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:23.860]   Uh, uh, gigabyte is but let's say oh no i'm gonna use a gigabyte
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:26.980]   And i'm gonna do a thousand messages, but i'm not gonna do that many minutes
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:29.860]   There you go $92 a month for four phones
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:31.940]   Four phones
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:35.380]   Oh, and if i use less i i get a credit back
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:38.340]   That's pretty crazy
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:40.820]   It's crazy
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.660]   They're canadian does that help do this?
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:47.460]   This is a us this is a us company, but they're from canada and i think that's the issue there
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:50.340]   They're just don't get that profit thing
[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:54.100]   There are no penalties
[00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:56.500]   There are no premium prices for extra data
[00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:00.180]   Forg phones. This is the ting phone i'm using as a nice htc phone
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.460]   Slider this is a slider, but you don't have to they have all kinds of phones
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:09.940]   Um, they're there this if you've been looking for a better data plan a better plan on your phone
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.860]   um
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:15.780]   In fact, this is so cool. Like here's a tweet from somebody a couple of days ago my ting
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:21.860]   Phone bill was $22 last month. That's a hundred dollars less than 18 t was
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:24.420]   a new a new customer
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:29.140]   Family of four actual usage across the four phones 2,387 minutes

[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:32.660]   He said no, we're all we're already up and running. This is this is awesome. Great. Um, this

[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:43.540]   If you worry about what big corporations are gonna do with the internet and we should worry about that
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:45.540]   You shouldn't there's a few answers. Yes
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:50.660]   To have open source competitors, right? So so the fact that firefox exists
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.700]   Is what enables chrome to resist by pressure?
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:56.020]   But also means that ie didn't take over the world
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:01.700]   And the fact that ting can come along and say, you know, you can do a phone company right bozos
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:08.900]   That puts the pressure on otherwise and that's what we have to do the entrepreneurial technologists have to create this counterbailing pressure to the idiots
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:13.460]   By the way, yeah, agreed no early termination fee or month to month
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:19.300]   You cancel at any time. Wow no additional charge for tethering or hot spotting all the phones do it
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:26.660]   So that's great three way calling free call her id free tethering picture and visual video messaging free voicemail free
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:32.580]   So this is a really this is a remarkable server and for businesses would be a really good choice to have multiple

[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:31.620]   Here is a depressing video
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:34.180]   Of google installing high speed
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:38.820]   Fiber optic actually this is an ad skip that how we skipping ad
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:41.780]   You know, there's too many ads on the internet
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:52.500]   Do as I say not as I do okay
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:58.420]   See the face now. Oh it's cute. Oh pull up
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:06.500]   It's gonna turn around. We're gonna see a coke ad on the side of the service will offer download speeds up to 100 times faster than those
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:10.500]   This is from the bbc news. That's why there was a little ad because they really got to monetize
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:14.580]   Living online in kansas city
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:19.540]   Gigabit per second anyway, you can go to watch this at bbc.co.uk
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:23.620]   Wouldn't that be nice to have something like that? I don't know why they're making modem sounds
[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:28.980]   That's crazy. I wondered that too
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.100]   What the what modem no
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:34.980]   No, this is the big maybe that's it
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:39.060]   Don't you
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:44.660]   All right, we're not gonna watch this because we didn't watch the ad and we don't want to be pirates
[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:51.540]   Eric smith said the people people have actually kind of them say they want to move to kansas city just because of this and somebody in the audience said
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.540]   I want to of course
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:56.260]   This is the best thing that we've tried you know
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:07:01.700]   We lobbied to peddle him a lobby to every town in in the country try to get this because they knew if you get it
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:03.700]   You suddenly like the place to live
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:10.260]   All right, so what do you think this has been a little little battle going on on the internet over google plus
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:16.980]   Commscore and others say that google plus visitors are
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:23.780]   It's not it's been calm score said an average of three minutes a month on the site
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:30.100]   That's isn't that bogus statistically because that's that's all the lucky you lose who came in the proper statistical should be how many
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:34.340]   It may be a bad number how many people come back regularly and for those
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:41.140]   How many how much time do they spend well their averaging in is dead accounts who came in and said i'll try this leo said to
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.700]   A lot of them. I'm sure yeah
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:47.620]   Facebook has the on the average about seven hours
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:50.980]   Six to seven hours every month
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:57.940]   But it was another wall free journal story going after all right i'm just saying there's there been a lot of them haven't there
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.420]   tons tons
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:07.780]   Now when you sign up for a google account now as a fresh brand new user you automatically get a google plus account
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:11.940]   No, sort of you do not the first thing they do is they push you to google plus
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:16.900]   They push you google plus i'd say make a profile be a plus or it's very it's a very hard sell
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:26.020]   It's a very hard sell so okay. So it's so these numbers are cut could be bad just because they're pushing you know if i want a gmail account
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:31.540]   Uh, and but i wind up with a google plus account, but i just use gmail i mean i'm you know essentially considered
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:37.620]   A google plus user who abandoned my account when that's not you know google kind of did this themselves a little bit and that
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:41.460]   You're right you should make a google plus account, you know because they have such high signups
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:46.740]   They're gonna have a lot of dead users. Well, let me let me create an account. Okay
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:53.060]   Create a new google account your google account is more than just gmail take it all with you share a little work in the future
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.980]   so
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.980]   You know they push their products
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:59.540]   Yeah, so
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:04.580]   So google plus visitors spend it out so visitor i guess is someone who has been to plus that google.com
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:09.300]   I mean there's no doubt the facebook has higher usage
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:15.860]   But my my view on google plus is kind of skewed i mean to me it's still a very active and delightful like nerd salon
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.980]   But i don't you know i think for regular people
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:22.580]   You know they're not seeing their friends and family on google plus yet
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:28.580]   I'm spending though a lot more time on google plus than i do on facebook i have more conversations there really
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:34.260]   Seeing jeff you've been a lot more active i google plus i get kind of hot and cold about it i do too
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:34.980]   Yeah
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:37.780]   I get i get really hot about it i'm like this is great the conversations are great
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:42.900]   But it feels like compared to twitter it feels like a lot of work because the posts are so much
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:49.140]   You know media and because the conversation is going so much longer. I just feel like it's much more of a time commitment where with twitter i just
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:51.380]   Can kind of quickly scan
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:53.380]   And kind of get more out of it look at this
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:10:01.620]   This is when you sign up you check they have a box to check google may use my account information to personalize plus ones on contents and ads on non google websites
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:07.780]   So that's what they were doing on ios but so maybe you agreed to it and you just didn't remember it
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:15.140]   Well, but the but jita would say i'll speak for jineer they still they should be clear. They should be out of here effect. Yeah, yeah, i was like, right?
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.140]   I can't i screwed up on the
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:23.620]   I hate captures. Oh the capture. I can't read that. What is that? Would you guys help me? What is that?
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:26.420]   cure cure i got
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:28.420]   Oh
[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:36.260]   Oh, you're good. No. Yeah, I said an iron l. Hey, these are an n or an r and r and i are at l
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:39.300]   Place place sound again you listen
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:47.940]   Oh, scull way
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:52.020]   Prove you're not a robot. That sounded like this omen
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:11:01.940]   Is the devil google you prove you're not a robot you are a robot you're a python script and you're asking me to prove i human
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:10.740]   Trying out loud when now my browser's functionality's turned off. Please turn it on polar bear. Look at this. Look at this
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:15.380]   Google's just doing a constant terrain test on the whole world
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:22.500]   Well, anyway, you don't have to go sign up for a whole guy. I was just wondering if by the way
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:28.420]   This is interesting look at what google recommends as a setting under accept cookie select only from sites you navigate to
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:34.180]   They're recommending turning off recommending first party cookies only yeah
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.700]   Isn't that interesting huh?
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.940]   Well, I mean they own all their properties
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:40.740]   So
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:45.380]   Well, that's somebody pointed out, you know, all they had to do is make that double the thing was it came from double click
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:47.620]   if they had merely made it come from
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:50.820]   Google they wouldn't have had to do any work around at all
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:53.860]   It's very strange. It's all
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:59.060]   Well, but in the new york times it has new york times cookies and it has double cookies a double cookies
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:03.460]   I assume mark consider third party cookies. I'm very confused. Yes, they are
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:10.740]   We go again. Those are third party. They're both frozen and so I've got cookies turned on and it still won't let me do the
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:13.060]   tip number and tool
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:16.340]   Eileen is our savior this week. Thank god
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:21.060]   So depressed here we go. Gina. Gina. What's your tip of the week?
[01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:26.100]   Tip of the week is a really simple one a new change in gmail
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:32.980]   Thanks to html 5 and chrome gmail you can set gmail to be your default email handler
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:36.580]   Which means that next time you go to gmail. I just got it a couple of days ago
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:41.300]   It'll say across the top. Do you want gmail to be the default your default email handler?
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:43.700]   If you say yes anytime you see
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:50.980]   Uh an email address linked on any web page you'll click on it and it'll launch gmail instead of launching mail or you know
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.820]   You're a crazy windows
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:56.900]   Client so basically lets you use gmail as kind of your default default client
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:13:01.460]   It amazes me that it's 2012 and this is like a really exciting new thing
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.860]   But it is it's it's always been a pain
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:06.660]   I've kind of trained myself to copy and paste links into gmail
[01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:13.700]   But now you just click them and and you can do the same and there's instructions for setting gmail to be your mail handler in firefox and
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.300]   internet explorer as well
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:18.740]   But it works kind of right out very smoothly out of the box in chrome
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:20.980]   cool
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.980]   cool, cool
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.980]   Jeff your number of the week
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:30.820]   My number of the week well erich mitt said miss beach. I'm glad we didn't get to this earlier, but i'll get leo fired up again
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:32.340]   um
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:34.580]   More than more stuff smit says
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:40.900]   Uh google products are blocked in 25 of the 125 countries in which google does business
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:41.380]   Wow
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:47.060]   Miskarrier one that he said that now 40 nations censor the nut up from four a decade ago
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:51.620]   Holy cow, this is the trajectory. We're on I wrote a post this week
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:55.940]   uh that you should read to the tune of um pink floyd
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:14:01.300]   Saying to leave our net alone and and the basic thing that's going wrong here
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:06.660]   The basic thing going wrong here is that there is a growing presumption
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:09.620]   In all this talk of regulation that the internet's broken
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:15.860]   It ain't broken. It's what erich mitt said to it's not broken. So don't fix it, please leave our net alone
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.900]   We don't need no regulation
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:23.700]   Hmm. Yes
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:31.460]   Internet is not broken and that's the fundamental thing we've got to get across to people is that that's what is allowing this push to regulate
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.540]   Under the guise is a piracy privacy
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:37.220]   Security decency indecency pedophilia
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:40.580]   uh and citizen and and and civilization
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:43.940]   Yes, a breeze all around the world and
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:48.180]   Upward governmental organizations like the EU and the UN
[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:53.700]   A wall street journal. Uh, I think we've been shan last week is this this this talk about about well
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:58.980]   Maybe we should go ahead and start regulating so we don't have the UN do it. No, it ain't broken. Don't fix it
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:03.380]   Cool. That was an excuse a number as an excuse for a rant
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:07.220]   from a strange pink man
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:11.620]   He's lavender now that is weird
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:17.620]   The camera keeps on readjusting every time. Yeah, so I'll see sometimes it'll see the background is is anyway
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:25.460]   Yeah, I'm strange pink refixed him and now he's weirder looking than he was. I'm fixed in more ways than you know. Yes, you are
[01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:29.700]   Is maps GL something new?
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:36.340]   Do you know gniff that's something new? I don't I don't think so. I thought I've been around for a while so
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:40.900]   Uh, it's using web GL to turn your google maps into these incredible 3d
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:46.340]   45 degree fly-ins and stuff like that and uh john came and said have you seen this?
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:51.460]   It's really cool. So I thought in honor of john. I think we've seen it before yeah, it's been a rough for a while
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.700]   It's still neat. That's new. Well, anyway
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:16:03.220]   In that case, forget it forget. I even mentioned it. I like web GL. Yeah, I'm really let me show you how to so you can avoid all these ads on the internet
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:09.140]   Let me show you how to block them. This is so confusion is what you should show. Should I show collusion? All that all right
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.220]   It's a firefox set tool, right?
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.220]   Yeah
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:17.940]   We want to recommend it though based on our earlier conversation. No, I'm just going to show you how
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.020]   set leo off how
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:23.060]   Open-minded I am. This is a life hacker article
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:28.020]   Collusion for firefox shows you who's josie, but now google won't let me see this either
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:34.900]   Who's tracking you on the web in real time? Chrome says no, I'm sorry. The oh you can't read that
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:37.460]   Here's a polar bear
