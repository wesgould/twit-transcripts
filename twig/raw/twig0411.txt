[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.840]   Well, I think today we'll be talking about Google a little bit and other things Jeff Jarvis is here
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.240]   Actually, he's at his office. You're at work. You're back to work
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.640]   At work. So I'm in New York because tonight I go and tape the deal the grass Tyson's podcast. Oh
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.280]   Timing you excuse me
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.880]   Pardon me doing hanging out with us Jeff. Yes, lemon, huh?
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.400]   That's a lot of fun. That'll be great. He's a professor journalism the CUNY. That's where his office is. That's why he's got newspapers
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.040]   in the office
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.440]   also with us
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.400]   our good friend and co-host Stacy Higginbotham from the Stacy on IOT show at IOT podcast.com and
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.800]   Her blog where she writes all about IOT Stacy on IOT
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.520]   What does that mean? It's a signal what did she do never open? What's open? Oh?
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.600]   Open. I'm so I didn't even think about that. It's only open. My daughter's not here
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:38.040]   It does kind of like poltergeist in that room behind you. It's so bright. It's it's because it's my hallway and it's
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.280]   Would you like it?
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.640]   Inside the house
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.840]   So as we speak there's a massive
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.440]   malware epidemic spreading throughout Europe and elsewhere a new
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.960]   quasi-ransomware
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.160]   called petya
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.000]   Do you know there's also something called not petya? Yes and sorta petya. There's three
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.200]   Too much for me
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.000]   This is get ready because this is the new world order and well, I just want to say we're aware of it
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.840]   We're gonna talk about in a little bit
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.000]   But I think since Jeff's here and he hasn't been here and I haven't been here. I think we need to get a little rant going
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.240]   So we're gonna start with the largest find the EU has ever
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.480]   levied 4.2.42 billion euros
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.880]   2.7 billion dollars to Google because it
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.800]   Pushed it according to the EU search results towards frugal. It's shopping engine
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.560]   Was a thing formerly known as frugal frugal doesn't even exist anymore. No, it doesn't exist and
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.820]   I you know, I'm not as you know
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:06.520]   I've criticized Google for getting into businesses that you know a search giant shouldn't get into like YouTube like content
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.840]   But I never felt like they preferred their shopping engine
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.040]   Well, they they do with a sense of those are ads and they sell those ads those ads appear atop the page
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.040]   And that's the way the business works
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.040]   How your article in political.eu
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:32.360]   Going right into the lion's den is has exactly the right headline 2.4 billion euros for Google shopping really
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.320]   That was down. They did that was a good headline
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.840]   I like it
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   But then you point out that this really probably has less to do with shopping and more to do
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.080]   With European companies that compete with Google like axles Springer in advertising
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.480]   right
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.880]   Well, you know I start here so I
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.840]   Use every possible Google product there is
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.720]   except for this Macintosh which doesn't work and
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.760]   If Google would only make a computer
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.280]   Yeah, well one the Microsoft would respect to put Skype on but this is also I use every Google product
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.380]   There is but I have no sense of ever using Google shopping. I used to use frugal frugal died
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:16.260]   I I don't use it frugal wasn't a shopping site. It was a search engine. It's a search engine for shopping comparison, right?
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:23.960]   But there is Google shopping now, and I've never used it either fact I type in shoes if you type in shoes on Google shopping
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.360]   I'm just in general. Let's just do it in general. I've been shoes
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.240]   You will get ads atop the page that are Google Play's dads like every possible other kind
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.440]   Oh, you don't even get that weird. Let me log out. Let me do an incognito window because you know when you're logged in
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.760]   It knows you don't wear shoes
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.720]   That's a good question
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.080]   Why would I give you shoes Stacy? Does it give you a shoes bar if you if you if I type shoes into Google?
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:57.000]   Yeah, I'm sure it does hold on no I don't get it. Oh, yeah, I do it. Wait wait. Here's the ad. It's not a bar though
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.920]   I get it either I didn't get it. I get the free zappos
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.900]   Which is Amazon. Oh, no, I get that today. No, so what you normally get is a little maybe they took it down
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:12.160]   What if I click the shopping tab? Let's make click the shocking. Here's the shopping tab, but this is good
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.680]   They've been phones. Okay, oh, okay. I'm gonna tell you my shoes work. Oh
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.440]   Dead, okay, because you got a bar. Oh, here's the bar you're talking about. Yeah, yeah
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.700]   So you got a little bit of high type and phones. I don't get a bar. Oh, that's so sexist
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:37.040]   She gets shoes, but no phones. So this says sponsored. I mean it says sponsored. It's ads. Yes, they point to that
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:45.120]   Yes, and and no they don't point to competitors as much as the competitors wish and yes, he helped complaints
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:55.240]   but I don't see any problem with this and and in any case, it's probably worth more than the shopping service is worth the fine is and
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:03.640]   But as I say in the piece, it's not really about that the publishers went used all their political clout to go after and this is Springer and
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.880]   News Corp and others and to go after
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.960]   regulators to go after Google and it's been a seven year process. I think three or four
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.720]   aborted efforts to settle
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.800]   And Google was ready to settle and ready to change behavior, but then the politicians kept getting more pressure
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.760]   No, make them hurt make them hurt more don't settle and the politicians did and so now we have the same
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.760]   This huge
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.960]   find
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.960]   to be levied against Google and
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:38.960]   and and no matter what it ends up being it means that the regulators are going to be up Google's rear end for years
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.640]   And all over this shopping thing
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:49.240]   Which makes no sense as ironic shopping. There is a lot of competition from a company called
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.200]   Amazon which Stacy will be getting to litter
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.960]   Right and and and so you know, I use Amazon to shop. I don't use Google shop Google is not paramount in shopping
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.520]   But that's the way it is
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.120]   So so yeah, Google says we're gonna appeal we disagree with the result
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.680]   But where does it appeal they appeal to the courts in the EU, right? It's yeah, huh?
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.560]   Same same folks who gave us the right to be forgotten
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:21.640]   Yes, it's been some bad decisions today is one in Canada - we'll get to later
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:27.660]   This is this is you know, Eric Schmidt has always said when you're when you represent you're the biggest thing on this disruptive
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:34.360]   Behemoth called the internet. Yeah, you're gonna be the target, but boy are they the target of this one. So that what this?
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.800]   This is the story that is continuous in
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:43.820]   Technology and and we've always known that the incumbents would fight tooth and nail against
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:51.380]   This intermediation by internet the internet in general and internet companies specifically and so that's what you say
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.380]   This is really
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:09:02.080]   But does there is a legitimate point to be made and I've made it about YouTube that when Google is in a business like content
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.540]   That muddies the waters with their search. I've always said Google should be above the fray
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.340]   They should I know they have the right as a business to pursue profit in any way. They see fit
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:19.180]   but I feel like if you're kind of that you should be like almost a priesthood if you're in charge of search and
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.760]   Completely completely agnostic and independent and having properties
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.700]   Having properties like content properties muddies the waters unnecessarily. Yeah, yes
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:34.640]   And I can agree with that let me make two points one Google's not just a search company anymore
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.800]   It is though a lot of advertising comes their advertising comes that revenue comes from all kinds of other
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.500]   I know and I guess it's foolish for me to say but I wish they were just a search company
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.820]   But this is like but this is like the EU going after Microsoft. They're fighting yesterday's war
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.460]   What was my session Google is not a monopoly here in the US people are pointing out there is competition in the US
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:10:00.140]   But in Germany in Europe, they're about 80% 90% market share. They're very they are effectively a monopoly in search
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.420]   But again and they're arguing this is a search thing
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:09.140]   The truth is if you're not to give them any ideas
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:16.300]   But if I were an antitrust person and I wanted to go after Google the one area where they are vulnerable is advertising
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.080]   Yeah, they have a huge market share and advertising. There's another thing
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.080]   I'll give up a number right now
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:28.580]   There's another thing on the rundown that says that Google and Facebook together now have more ads that every newspaper and magazine combined in the world
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.720]   So there's it's a duopoly and
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:39.000]   There's huge press there and I've long said that where Google where Google is most vulnerable
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.540]   And this is perhaps what's coming to back to bite them in a slightly indirect way where they're most vulnerable is that they have the power of
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.160]   God over businesses and if a if a link farm comes in and
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.520]   And Google says you're a bad link farm and next to it is a good directory and Google
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:01.680]   Gets rid of both of them because they look similar and one actually has editorial value and one doesn't
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:08.400]   Google makes that decision solely and I've argued for years that Google ought to appoint a jury of advertising peers
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:15.060]   To take some of the pressure off of them. Well in a sense what happened here is Yelp has been yelping about Google for years
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:21.220]   and other small shopping search engines that just don't compete with Google because it's not as good and
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.680]   They don't have the reach and they're not gonna rise up and they're not gonna get the same money
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.020]   but they they they are complaining and
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:32.120]   Google has power over them and no cover to hide behind
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:38.380]   Well, that's by the way and as I said with content I have the same problem because I'm a competitor with Google's YouTube and
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:44.500]   If if you search for tech news and you get a lot of YouTube links, but you don't get Twit links
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.460]   That's also Google using its power
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:54.180]   And to harm me of course their answer would be unlike unlike the shop in their answer would be you can be on YouTube for free
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.980]   And we'll give you money, but that's not the answer. I want that means yeah, you live on our farm and
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:04.980]   Give us your proceeds and we'll give you a share of those is not this is not the right answer
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.940]   So Stacy, I'm sympathetic to the EU. I feel like
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.440]   This is a case where they're just wrong the what they're complaining about is the ad bar
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.980]   Google sells ads. I mean, that's the
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:23.460]   And they yeah, and they favor the ads favor the people who pay for the ads. That's the way
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.660]   Or if you go to actual spring is built the largest paper in Europe and you search for shoes there
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.620]   You get the built shoe shop and you get built shoe
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.820]   Advertide so they're not so get built competitors
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.340]   The EU is not complaining that search results are my could tell me if this is the case
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.260]   They're not complaining search results are modified. They're complaining about the ad bar
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.580]   Well, no, I think they are complaining
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.660]   People correct like if I search for shoes on Google
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:54.100]   It is possible that I would not see the word sponsored and I might not understand the relationship there
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.860]   I think that's a good war. No more allegations. I read the stories. I didn't get to read the the
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:04.260]   Full complaint those there. No, I think there's other allegations that they they nephariously
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:11.780]   Don't but it's not it's not it's a negative you're proving a negative they don't promote
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.620]   The competitors as much as they otherwise should or would it's a real hard thing to prove I think
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.980]   Stacy, what do you think I'm?
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.900]   monopolized
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:27.420]   Speak no and on this on this yes, I have very I have no opinions. I mean my opinions are the common
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.300]   I really don't know. I really don't this is this is that advertising
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:37.260]   I have I have opinions about monopoly power in other industries, but this is not an industry
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260]   I know a lot of I think we'd all agree
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:44.420]   Antitrust laws are a good thing. They you know, I'm I think we're in this country
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.020]   We're in favor of free markets
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.140]   We don't perhaps have the suspicion of big companies they have in Europe
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:56.860]   But we're in favor of free markets and private enterprise and the one play one of the places where free markets fail is when one company
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:01.260]   Gains so much dominance that they can use their dominance in one market to
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:10.420]   block competitors and other markets and and it effect expand their dominance and we've it's always been held in this country that that is
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:16.540]   Illegal that is monot that is misusing. It's not illegal to be a monopoly. It's it's illegal to misuse your monopoly power
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.740]   We've all we've for a long time had any trust regulations
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.860]   So I think we all agree on that the question is is Google using its?
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.620]   effective monopoly in search in Europe to
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.220]   establish a foothold in another business. This is what
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.220]   Margarete Vestaya the
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.260]   Commissioner in charge of privacy
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:44.860]   This is her quote in charge of competition policy said Google has come up with many innovative products
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.500]   Services that have made a difference to our lives. That's a good thing
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.180]   But Google's strategy for its comparison shopping service
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:57.460]   Wasn't just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals instead
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:05.180]   Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results and
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:10.660]   demoting those of competitors what Google's done is illegal under EU antitrust rules
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.540]   It did not and this is this is where you know
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:22.060]   I can't disagree with this sentiment it denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate and most importantly
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:27.860]   It denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.860]   That's what any trust is about
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:36.300]   And if it's her opinion and the opinion of the EU that that's what Google did then I understand this this decision
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:40.660]   I guess the goal now is whether Google did that right so
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:47.860]   Listening to that it seems actually kind of interesting because it's it's talking about some of the issues that we have
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:53.940]   It's the same issues people have with things like data aggregation and how in today's world
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.100]   the more
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:02.780]   Both networks affects you network effects the greater your network effects the greater the amount of data you can bring in from your users
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.780]   That's gonna have a real competitive
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:13.860]   Differentiator an advantage over competitors over time and that gap is only gonna get wider and that actually we've talked about this before
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:18.500]   With kind of like how do you think about antitrust in an era where?
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.700]   Everything is oh
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.020]   Digital and maybe a lot of things are free so I
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:32.740]   Don't know that I mean and it's global markets and that's so this Canadian decision is interesting because
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:39.940]   Well, but I'm just saying Google is a difficult challenge because very difficult. It's a monopoly in Germany
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.940]   It's not a monopoly in the US
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:48.220]   And yet Google by this Canadian decision will be required to change the search results globally
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.300]   Which is horrendous to free speech horrendous so
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:17:01.940]   This is you know, I think that you can moderate a moderate of a staier would say this is very difficult challenging to decide what to do
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.980]   But this is what we've decided to do. I'm sure what she would say
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.700]   Let me make a couple points about about the EU decision one
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:15.380]   We need to point out that antitrust law is different in the US than Europe here. It's about protecting consumers there
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:20.700]   It's more about I'll get complaints about saying this wrong but more about protecting companies particularly the market
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:26.540]   Yeah, that's kind of what her statement said. We want to make sure bigger than the artist from the but so but I don't I see no consumer
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:34.220]   Harm here the problem becomes I don't know how to say this well. It's a tonological problem is basically she's saying that
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.820]   They can't compete on their merits
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.540]   Well, you've got to prove the negative that if Google didn't have a shopping service
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.900]   What would they be but of course Google is gonna have shopping ads?
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:49.780]   So what does the world look like without Google and is that once the definition of fair is but with Google?
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:56.020]   Well Google has better services, you know, and this is the irony of the Microsoft case a Microsoft is gonna force its browser down
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.460]   Everybody well no somebody came along with a better browser and it didn't happen that way
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:04.340]   And if Google has a better shopping service and better listings for shoes and better advertising
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:10.140]   Opportunities for those advertisers then it does deserve to win in the market and with the consumer
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.500]   Wait, okay, how do you stop that it's undue?
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:18.100]   Influence on that if that's the tonological problem. Go ahead Stacy
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:24.420]   So this actually gets kind of to some of the arguments we make about network neutrality and don't hate me for saying this
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:32.900]   But there you're also trying to prove a negative in the sense that if ISPs get involved, they're going to cause harm and I would say that
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.900]   Focus on the consumer isn't actually the right way to go necessarily
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:44.860]   Because consumers in some cases can win like if you think about I'm not even going to bring that up because that's super controversial
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.100]   but
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.100]   you really should be
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.420]   Optimizing as a government for
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:55.140]   Competition because the understanding is competition is going to be inherently better
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:01.500]   But if you go that route then you have to look at the nature of competition and how it changes based on technology
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.020]   based on user habits based on all of this stuff and I
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.180]   Think it is a tautologic tauta. I can never say these words
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:15.140]   tautological tautological argument epidemiology
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.740]   Epistemology
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:25.940]   But I think there's that's just a philosophical difference people are just gonna have it
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.940]   I think that's a fine argument to be happening
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.740]   It's really
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.820]   So so that notion of if it's just about you must have competition
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.900]   Well, no, but I get them and opley's aren't illegal if you have the best product and everybody loves it
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.020]   Not illegal just using that
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:50.580]   It's not in the US although I think we should it's a good point that the European rules are different so but culturally
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:56.340]   We have a competitive impact though. That's that's what's really interesting today because the more people
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.260]   That's why the US standard I think is a better standard because you have to look at harm
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:06.260]   Right, but well and and I don't think anybody's suggested that the google should be
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:11.300]   Prosecuted in the US for this right this is not no nobody's investigating Google
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.700]   There was there was an investigation there the FCC was
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.860]   We're leaked right but I think it was a proper decision in the US not to do it
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.100]   Now this is where this is where then people pull out look at how often google
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:30.180]   People went into the White House during the Obama administration. Ah, see right? I think that that pales given current Russian activities
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.140]   Um, I can be political. I'm just comparing
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:37.140]   Uh, but but but but yeah this notion that competition for it
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.380]   So I was like then then this tasty water also leads to is and this is what I get all the time from Europeans
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.140]   I I got
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.940]   Flustered with a BBC interview earlier today because I just
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.900]   Well, isn't it time that somebody just does something?
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.660]   So show me the statute that defines too big
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:58.180]   And in essence what you get to here is you say I if you get too big that alone is a sin
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.860]   We're not going to tell you what too big is well. That's your assertion. That's not what their law says
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.300]   I think we're getting think it means. I mean the you would say
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.900]   Say about this shouldn't somebody go after them because they're yeah
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.660]   But really what the EU rules are is monopolistic behavior
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.300]   I'm reading from ben Thompson's very art good article in stratecary
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:21.780]   Monoch ballistic behavior is presumed to be illegal if it restricts competitors
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:28.020]   Which in the long run theoretically hurts consumers, but as you point out it's really about other businesses
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.660]   dominant companies
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:36.020]   Have a special responsibility in the EU not to abuse their market position by restricting competition
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:42.100]   Either in the market in which they're dominant. That's a different by the way from the us or in separate markets
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:46.020]   Otherwise, there'd be a risk that a company wants dominant in one market
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:54.260]   Even if this resulted from competing on the merits would be able to use this market power to further expand its dominance or leverage it into separate markets
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:59.780]   Ben points out that part of the problem is what is a monopoly in the digital era?
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:03.060]   Yeah, um, right. That's where I think we
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:09.060]   That's where I think this is actually good because we're having a conversation about what it means to be too big
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:17.060]   Right now. Yeah, because you could is is it a monopoly when you can just say instead of typing google.com Bing.com
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.820]   admittedly most or duck to go admittedly most people don't but that but they're making a
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:29.140]   Economic choice and have the right to make that choice. So in other words google goes winning on its merits
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.580]   It's not like there's a barrier to entry or is there?
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.620]   So I think where this gets interesting
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.940]   I'm sorry Stacy
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.220]   I was just I
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.580]   I think this gets interesting when we start looking at companies like we'll say I don't know if Jeff is going this way
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:49.700]   But amazon or google with like machine learning and improving their services. So when you
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:54.980]   Now welcome to do that, right? You shouldn't hold on you don't want to create a chilling effect
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.220]   Yeah, I know but I'm just saying you don't want to create a chilling effect where they don't want to innovate
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.500]   Because they would come up against the shoals of any competitive
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:09.700]   Right. Well, and that's true. And that's why this this is a good conversation because we have to talk about that and we have to understand
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.700]   I think that's what
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.100]   in the way regulators do this
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:19.380]   Through laws and through the courts and through these kind of conversations and we're going to see how
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.660]   Badly this works out or what happens?
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.700]   Say this is the first beginning of the conversation
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:32.260]   Well, I think that's what this is. Yeah, and I think that's worse. Stacy. Let's let's let me let me let me stipulate your honor
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:37.700]   That the conversation is a finding they have okay. We're gonna call this show judge stacey from now on. Yes
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.660]   Yeah, I like that. I'm like stacey gets yelled at by jeff good lord
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:45.380]   No, he's not yelling. Yeah, like I know I feel like I feel like a student in the classroom
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:51.620]   No, it's just I'm I'm stipulating agree with you right so let's see the conversation is good. However
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.380]   um
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.980]   2.7 billion dollars for this ficakta little shopping thing
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.460]   the the political effort to try to do a huge boom
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:07.860]   On google for what is a minor part of google where there is minor harm if any
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.900]   um, that's not the way to have the conversation
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.780]   uh, this is a political act
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:21.860]   Not a regular act say political act and it was started by publishers who are acting politically who are using in my mind
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.660]   journalistic value
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.660]   perhaps improperly to
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:32.580]   You to get the force government to to to regulate against to protect against
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.420]   Their new competitors. All right. I'm gonna channel. It's not being done here
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.940]   I'm gonna channel margaritvista here even though I can't pronounce her name
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:45.540]   I'm gonna channel her. This is what the uh european commission's fact sheet says in this regard
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.260]   Uh, we mentioned
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.980]   Yeah, you may have been monopoly, but that's because consumers choose you
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.820]   They could easily there's very little barrier to them using duck duck go
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:25:00.980]   Uh, they say there are also high barrier centuries in these markets in part because of network effects
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:06.420]   The more consumers use a search engine the more attractive it becomes to advertisers
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:14.100]   So they're kind of I think admitting jeff what you are suggesting the profits generated can then be used to attract even more consumers
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.700]   similarly the data search engine gathers about consumers
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:22.740]   Can in in turn be used to improve results? They're saying there's a virtuous
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:30.900]   Circle here that google's taking advantage of to make it even more strong and more power for those consumers those consumers get even
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:36.980]   Very free get a free a very good service for google and it's not quite so virtuous if you're a
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.980]   Springer a Rupert Murdoch well
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.020]   Then change your damn business don't keep on track
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.700]   I think your point is that they don't that it's mordock and Alex
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:50.900]   Springer that don't want to compete on the merits googles winning on the merits. Yes
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.380]   Let's change this a little bit though because
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.740]   This is about advertising which strong feelings
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:04.820]   um publishers strong feelings, but the same virtuous cycles the based on network effects is going to happen in
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:11.700]   Services based on artificial intelligence. So the more data you have so like think about car companies and
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:17.380]   But even you're like photo services on google. So when you start to look at it that way
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.500]   then you're
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:26.260]   Oh my gosh guys. I'm on this new medication and it's making my brain stupid. Oh, can I have some of that? I'll have what she's having
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:31.060]   Okay, I'm gonna have to come back to that but that idea here
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:37.700]   Is that you're going to be better as a business the more information you suck in
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:43.940]   And that's exactly why this clause is problematic in the internet era
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.500]   because
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:52.820]   You know from the point of view of creating great companies and by the way a great company like google benefits consumers
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.540]   you want to encourage this virtuous circle
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:01.780]   And for the EU to say well, we can't allow that to happen because it becomes a flywheel
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.740]   That you can't stop we've got to stick a stick into it
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.980]   So that other people get a chance to create their own virtuous cycle
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.580]   I remember my point
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:16.900]   Negative drugs have kicked in. Okay. Yes, the drugs kicked in
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.140]   Think about something like facial recognition
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:25.220]   If your facebook right now you have the data to do amazing facial recognition amazing people recognition
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.700]   now imagine that being used for
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.820]   Something nefarious and everyone's still on facebook. There's no
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.420]   When those things start happening
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:44.420]   Consumers will want to move but they won't necessarily have that choice because the network effects and benefits will have crude too much to those main companies
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:49.620]   We're seeing that now. Yeah, you see this one. That's that's the flip side of
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:54.980]   This argument when it's not something nice that we've this is the graph that the
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:00.420]   The EU decided to include in their pdf of this decision by the way
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.980]   immediately
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.860]   Discredited because it comes from stat counter
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:12.260]   Jesus, uh, which shows what morons they are but it does show almost 100 percent the red line
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:16.580]   At the top here. Let me tell us straight is this is google
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:23.780]   This is everybody else at the bottom. Well, you know what that that's really a symbol for just just change the label in this to advertising
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:29.220]   Yeah, but they even admit that because it attracts advertisers the profits generated attract more consumers
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.860]   They admit that that's the part of the virtuous circle
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:37.460]   But what they're saying is google is completely completely dominant based on stat counter
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.940]   But again, there's nothing wrong with that
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:46.820]   The question is what do they do wrong? Let me make two points. They are dominant company says the you have a
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:53.460]   Special responsibility not to abuse their market position and and prove the abuse. I don't see the abuse
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:59.300]   Two points one you said earlier that that they want to put the put the stick in the flywheel
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:04.180]   To enable others to create that's not what's happening here. They're putting the stick in the file
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:13.220]   In the flywheel to protect existing companies against google's creation. It's protection
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:17.940]   I don't think motivations. I know we can argue about if motivations matter
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.340]   But in general, it's the results that matter in these things
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.100]   And so I will agree with you that their motivations may stink
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:29.620]   But the results are is we're gonna start having this conversation also that fine. Hopefully we'll be whittled down
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.100]   I don't know. I'm like
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.060]   Don't you worry that this is gonna have a chilling effect on
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.380]   companies because
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.860]   Look at this is what a company's trying to create is this
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:47.940]   Flywheel effect where there's benefit to the company and the company grows bigger because of the benefit to the company that flywheel scares a lot of people
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.260]   I mean if you think about how we're
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.700]   It's the market we're saying google's getting too big. That's what we're saying is
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:58.180]   And amazon same thing they've got the data which the data helps them do this which uh
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:03.380]   But uh at the same time don't we there is a market benefit there is it it bothers me in two ways
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.500]   It bothers me for europe which is the one I make in the in the op-ed
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:11.940]   That this is no way to attract investment and innovation to europe
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.900]   This is no way to say that we're gonna work in europe. It's gonna create
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.780]   It's gonna create a chill and and they keep on saying we want our own google
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:22.020]   The only way you're gonna get your own damn google is if you invest and risk second point
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:28.340]   Even outside of google so I got an argument on twitter as often happens in these cases with a guy named jason kint
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:34.260]   Who's the head of the horribly named digital content next which is a trade association for major publishers in the us
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.820]   and um
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:43.460]   You know he you're defending drivers. You're defending google and facebook and you know and and he's he's echoing the EU line
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.620]   The problem I have with that with publishers echo the EU line
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.860]   And it's gonna happen the same thing when we get to gdpr and privacy is
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:59.460]   To my mind the salvation of the mass media of the next generation of mass media publishing and journalism is relevance and value as knowing people as individuals is having
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.940]   data on them. Uh oh
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:08.660]   Data on them. So now data is being knowledge about people to build relationships of relevance and value is being demonized
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:14.180]   in this decision and across and if the publishers take too strong a stance that
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.180]   To have any data to know anybody as an individual is bad
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:22.900]   They're cutting off their nose and other appendages. They're cutting off their future
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:28.900]   And they're and and they're doing themselves much like the music industry in the face of napster
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:34.260]   Their goal is to preserve as incumbents the the status quo
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:40.340]   And there's no bigger threat to the status quo than the internet and google and this new way of doing things
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.180]   But now you have regulators and corporations getting in the clock back they
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.140]   Regulators could do every trying to do it. They can do every time they want the clock
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:51.380]   But they're gonna but they're trying to say we're not going to allow this progress to happen
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:55.940]   And it is my i've said this on the show a million times. It is too soon to define
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:00.100]   And limit and regulate the internet. We don't know what it is yet
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.540]   We don't know how it operates yet
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:05.380]   And for the EU the ultimate hubris here is for the EU to come in and decide
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:10.340]   We know how the internet should operate. We're gonna say we don't know yet it you're too you're too old
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:18.020]   Well again in this in this document in this complaint from the EU as proof that google has been is helping itself
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:25.780]   They show that google's comparison shopping services has gained in traffic while rival shopping services have decreased
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.420]   It's a success
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.900]   How dare they
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:35.300]   That's the proof that they offer. Well, look how successful google is you know
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:42.260]   45 yeah chills success. Look how successful google is we can't have we can't have that
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:51.540]   So uh now let me just ask is is 2.4 2 billion euros can google just pay that and move on
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.380]   Because it's going to change their business and how they operate. It's not the money
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.100]   It's the consent decree that they're worried about
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.140]   That's why i say it's such a political decision
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.940]   This is political in every way. This is not so stacy
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.220]   I would buy what you're saying about the need for the conversation
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.740]   If it happened in a more sane
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:17.140]   Structural no subsidies don't have no because we don't have these conversations insane structures because we're all people
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:21.220]   We have these conversations only when there's like self-interest at play
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:24.900]   So up until now everyone's like hey, we're gonna be good. We'll self-regulate
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:29.380]   We'll talk about these things and until someone establishes a line though
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.860]   We don't know when someone's going over it
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.180]   And so we'll try to settle three or four times
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:40.020]   They were the last and then her her prior successor to ago was ready to settle
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.860]   The decision was done
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.860]   And then the publishers
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.940]   Cried bloody murder and went after the politicians of the eu and stopped the settlement
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:54.580]   I'm just thanking god that big business has no impact here in the united states on what our legislators do because yes
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.660]   That clearly is a bad system
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:57.940]   It's terrible
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:03.540]   By the way, it's not over because when we'll talk about canada too, but the eu also has
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:09.300]   Already come to a similar conclusion about google's android operating system
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.860]   And ad sense
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.500]   So the other reason google doesn't want to set settle
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.300]   Is because this is the beginning
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.980]   This is not the end
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.380]   Watch out android is going to be so part of what's going on here too is that they demonize
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:27.620]   Relevance and data and value and knowledge about people they're also going to demonize free
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:33.700]   That's what the publishers hate most that's our mordock and springer hate most and they're smart people especially a springer
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:38.580]   Um, and and they believe in this notion of creating a product called content
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:45.220]   You must pay us for it and free is what most threatens them and so android in its core business model
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:51.140]   Is going to be seen I guarantee you it's going to be seen as virtual as a digital version of dumping
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:55.540]   Ooh, that's so controversial
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.660]   I want to talk about that
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:04.980]   Okay, Jeff. I would like you to write the idea about digital dumping. That's a fun concept
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:14.180]   It is fun. I'm right now so because Stacy, you know, I don't need to take your meds to forget things. I have something called a pencil
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.900]   Like i'm getting there. I think that
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.420]   In addition to the medicine, I just think i'm getting older. It's not the first time that's happened
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:24.500]   I mean, that's what microsoft did to compete against netscape remember netscape was charging
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:30.820]   Right, it's browser and microsoft moved in by the way got in trouble with not only the uh, you but the department of justice
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:38.740]   Uh because they moved in and gave away their browser. I remember when the internet explorer 3.0 came out back in 1995 or 6
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:42.820]   It was immediately saw this is that's all over for netscape
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:48.500]   What about things like zero rating though on data plans which I know can be controversial look at like
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:53.300]   Facebook and what happened in india. I know those are net neutrality things, but they're also kind of digital dumping
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:59.700]   Oh, this is such a fun area. Oh my god next on judge stacey
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:06.900]   Like I just want to assign jeff like jeff that's your new book. That's your new article do it. It is that would be a good book
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.660]   Sorry digital dump just like someone else should write it
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:17.220]   Our show today brought to you by oh, I had such a nice meal last night. I made a blue apron meal
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.580]   We just got our new blue apron box. So we're we get three meals
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.380]   Uh, we get the blue apron for a couple
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:28.020]   So that means it's for two people although we always split it three ways and there's plenty
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.620]   um
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:35.620]   Blue apron delivers you all the ingredients fresh that you need to make an amazing meal plus the recipe
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:43.380]   Right to your door. There's a number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service in the country last night. We had a delicious steak
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:48.900]   I made uh, it had fingerling potatoes, which I roasted they came out perfectly
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.100]   They they uh, we had a nice butter lettuce
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:58.020]   Salad and and I made a dressing again all of the ingredients I got from blue apron
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.660]   And a little thing of creme fresh
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.260]   Uh, a little thing of blue cheese crumb blue cheese crumbles
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:09.060]   Was such a good dressing was this creamy blue cheese dressing a little thing i'd never
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.780]   Used before
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:16.660]   Uh called uh verge verjuice have you ever used ver jus?
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:22.740]   Oh, we've talked about this before this is the wine sweet vinegar. It's incredible
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.060]   It's the fresh juice of unripe and grapes. It's not vinegar, but it's acidic
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:31.060]   It's delicious anyway. So verju and creme fresh
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:36.340]   And uh blue cheese crumbles. It was the most amazing dressing and I oh
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:42.580]   But the nice thing is only take about half an hour to make an amazing dinner. I told you the couple of nights before I made this cannelloni
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.620]   Is it so great? So let's take a look. Let's go to the menu and see what's on the menu this week
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:51.060]   We've been uh, I should log into my account because we've been going crazy
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:55.140]   I think we've got our our blue aprons through august now the nice thing about blue apron
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.660]   Is it it's not a subscription in the sense that you have a weekly commitment?
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.620]   You just you get it when you when you order it you don't get it if you don't
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:05.140]   So when we went on vacation for instance, we we didn't get any blue apron boxes
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.540]   You customize the recipes you pick from the menus
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:12.340]   They don't repeat more than once a year. So you're always going to try new delicious meals
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:18.900]   Uh, I think we've already ordered for this week. I'm trying to remember there those that's the family friendly
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:24.180]   Fontina cheeseburgers or red and white that's those are for a family of four with kid friendly ingredients
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.300]   I can't remember I was it's fun. This is something we do
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:33.860]   Every week or so lee, son. I'll sit down and look at the menus and pick our our meals. Well. Oh, I love this
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:38.980]   I hope we ordered it. I can't remember bulgogi beef and soba noodle stir fry with marinade of vegetables
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:46.260]   You can you my mouth is just watering. So what you're doing these earlier in the show
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:53.860]   So this is what you get in the box. I'm gonna get hungry the whole show now even the meat is fresh. Nothing's frozen
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:58.260]   So you get 10 ounces of thinly sliced beef you get one carrot
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:03.700]   Because you don't want there's no waste you need one carrot you get one carrot one cucumber one scallion
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:08.980]   One bunch of cilantro and mint two tablespoons of rice vinegar they come in little bottles
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:14.540]   Two sable tablespoons of this new sauce that I I love that the yak a nook yak yak
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:19.140]   Yakiniku sauce I bought some because I liked it so much as kind of a japanese barbecue
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:24.580]   Uh, I don't know what a gochoo. Jung is but you get a tablespoon of that and then sesame oil
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:29.140]   So this is what is so cool. You do this. Those are fresh soba noodles
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:34.900]   You'll flip your lid the ingredients of the best as if you were going to the best grocery store except it costs you less
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.540]   less than $10 a meal
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.700]   Uh because they don't have the overhead
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:46.020]   seared chicken and creamy pasta salad with summer squash and sweet peppers vegetarians will love blue apron too
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:50.340]   How about fresh basil fettuccine pasta with sweet corn and cubanel pepper?
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:57.300]   I can just go on potato crushed a catfish. Oh, oh doesn't that sound catfish is so good
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.580]   Isn't that good red white and blue pizza. What's the blue?
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:07.060]   All right, you must be looking at the family plan. Let me look here. I'm looking at your screen. Yeah right there right there
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.060]   Yeah, yeah, uh
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.740]   No, the blue it's purple potato
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.740]   Okay, purple potato. Yeah, you don't mind
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.300]   So it comes with fresh pizza dough
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:26.580]   It comes with tomato sauce mozzarella cheese garlic arugula peach peach purple potatoes basil asiago cheese a shallot
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:32.020]   By the way, least and I both decided we're gonna use shallots more often shallots are so
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:37.060]   They're they're sweet. They're delicious. I always forget to get shallots
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:40.180]   And I have a tuna recipe with shallow friendly
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:44.740]   Delicious and blue apron is all about onion. They have wine choices now too
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:49.700]   By the way and then wines are fun. They're not quite full bottles. They're not quite splits
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:54.420]   So they make a wine recommendation and you can order those so we've been ordering wine too to go with our meals
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:59.380]   You're kidding. No, it's so freaking awesome. So all I got to say is

[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.460]   Yeah, but uh
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:35.540]   You know was a grocery.com. What was the one that wasted the huge hot remember peep hot and
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.420]   Van
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:39.460]   Do groceries

[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.540]   Feel weird
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:46.500]   And it was a guy
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.140]   Order
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:52.340]   I used to order stuff on web van all the time because I lived in New York City and they didn't have like basic stuff back then
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:58.020]   So though I'd be like what no New York store stocks Rotel what how am I gonna make queso?
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.740]   So exactly who I want your queso recipe. Yeah
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:10.820]   Case okay that that queso recipe is a can of Rotel in a block of elvita cheese. It's no no no
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:15.620]   I'm just telling you I have lots of great recipes, but the queso recipe is just like straight up
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:20.020]   All american and terrible for you. Oh, but but delicious
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:24.980]   Oh, it's very delicious. Rotel is tomatoes and diced green chilies, right?
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:31.940]   Yeah, and you can use it to anything. I mean you can add it to your chicken all a king or whatever and you can make like a delicious
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:36.020]   Rotel out here. I don't know we can't know that sounds like a texas treat
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.860]   No, so really you just add a can of Rotel
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:43.700]   To a block of elvita and that's queso for you
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:48.900]   Uh-huh well it used to be yes, you don't need it anymore because it's because it's poison
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:58.580]   It's not poison, but now I usually go out now. I don't I don't have parties you have an Austin the best queso in the world
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.940]   Right, that's what I go out and get my cheese miss fancy pants now
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:07.380]   Yeah, oh you know the best thing so take all your cheese rinds and like old chunks of cheese
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:12.420]   Just as much as you have if you save it all and you throw it in with a bunch of garlic into like a
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:18.900]   Little pot to melt it all down with the garlic and some wine and then you get some crusty bread and you just dip it in and people are like
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.540]   Oh my god. This is delicious. You're like I just cleaned out the fridge
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:26.500]   No, I always save parmesan rinds because they're using sauces and stuff in soup
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:31.540]   Us it in your veggies. Yeah, that's how you make uh miss droni. You have to have parmesan rind
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:36.740]   Well now I'm really disappointed. I thought you would have like some gourmet queso recipe
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:43.380]   It's queso. I have many gourmet recipes but queso is not oh I think of you as like this great gourmet cook. Oh, so funny
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:46.020]   But you know what I bet it's delicious
[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:50.340]   We used to have a producer at tech tv who had a super bowl dip. It was basically
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.900]   a can of chili
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:56.820]   And a block of velveeta and you put them in or no maybe it's some cream cheese
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.780]   You put it all in in a crock pot and you heat it till it's melted and that's it
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.980]   Yep, and it was the best thing ever
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:07.860]   Yes, the queso is not bad. It's just you're like, oh, it sounds great putting in my body. Yeah
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.740]   It's not really cheese
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.740]   No, uh
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.740]   It's like government cheese
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.740]   So uh actually government cheese
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.980]   Yeah
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:25.380]   So uh, what is this Canadian decision this uh, google must alter
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.020]   worldwide search results
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:34.260]   See it was there was a van kuver tech company small Canadian firm which got an injunction against google
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.940]   This is even more dangerous. This is a worse decision
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.580]   Equist tech they make network devices
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:48.020]   And they suit another company of illegally relabeling their products and uh and selling its own products under their brand name
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.260]   another kind of selling knockoffs basically
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.500]   uh
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.540]   They they left the province the competitor data link
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:58.180]   But they continue to do business
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:02.260]   And you can google them find them and and order products from them even though
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.780]   You know, they're illegal according to equis tech
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:11.540]   So equis tech went to court and they got an injunction from the supreme court of canada
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:17.460]   That google may not link to these data link web this competitors web pages
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.420]   And not only must do so in canada
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:27.300]   But now a court in british columbia says they've got to do it everywhere in the world and that's it
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.380]   Today the supreme court upheld that order
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:33.860]   It's the first global de-indexing order
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.420]   according to uh, from
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:39.700]   Canada we'd like to canada you were the nice guys
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:46.020]   7 to 2 the Canadian supreme court rejected the idea that this was a threat to free speech
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:50.580]   They say hey google already does this to d-list child pornography hate speech
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.700]   To comply with dmca copyright
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:59.060]   The judge wrote just rosally a bellow wrote this is not an order to remove speech
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:06.100]   That on its face engages freedom of expression values. It's an order to de-index websites that are in violation of several court orders
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.700]   Not until it gets to a rans china russia
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.340]   Well, wait a minute though. We've not to date
[00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:16.620]   He says accepted the freedom of expression requires a facilitation of
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:22.420]   Structure and and the court decision in Iran could be this
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:30.100]   Or or pick your country. I don't want to pick on Iran, but but you know this let's say or or doyans attain courts in turkey
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:35.220]   decides that erdawan any a cartoon about erdawan
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.780]   Exactly that is
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:44.580]   Insulting should never be seen again on the internet anywhere and forces google says by the way, not this isn't just turkey
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:48.100]   This is everywhere or the door the Danish Muhammad cartoons, right?
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:54.420]   Or you know pick it right and now there is a precedent in the structure that we will be at the lowest common denominator
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:47:01.700]   A free speech on the internet if this happens. Here's a tweet from john bergmeyer. He's an attorney for uh senior council of public knowledge
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:08.020]   He says canada joins list of countries asserting job global juristic global jurisdiction of the internet
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:10.900]   He says copyright
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:15.380]   Maybe rtbf people might cheer this but there's not does need to be some limiting principle for instance
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:21.060]   I don't want the uk's crappy libel laws to defect to apply worldwide
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:26.580]   Most company countries don't have fair use for instance. We have fair use in the united states
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:29.060]   But that wouldn't be a defense in another country
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:33.220]   So fair use would end in the united states at least as far as google's concerned
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.740]   I can't what is the enforcement structure here
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.460]   Well, that's a good question
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:43.940]   I mean because that's really what this hinges on because usually we just say how do they have a enforce this?
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.780]   Yeah, and we ignore probably 2.7 billion dollar fines
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:54.180]   Okay, well in that's I mean like if you look at like the freak out over gdpr, that's those are significant fines
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:56.980]   So yeah, they are for quite significant and proportional
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:02.100]   So we gave in to of course the right to be forgotten, which is similar
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:05.940]   But the right to be forgotten is only in the EU, right?
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:12.260]   Yes, and indeed they were doing a country by country and that got them and the EU wasn't crazy about it, but they didn't
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:15.300]   They didn't push back. They pushed back a little bit
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:22.580]   Where if you are I think I think what happens is this if you're in i'm picking a country the french the french right now are
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:26.820]   Want it to be worldwide in fact, it's in front of the french supreme court right now
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:30.740]   So what I think happened though, I think I could be wrong here. I'm sure my chat room will correct me
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:36.500]   I think what happened was at first google said we're gonna do early in any country that that if you search google in france
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.140]   You search search google france in france. You won't find it
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:44.740]   But if you search google uk you'll find it then I think the french got it so no anybody in france
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.380]   Can't find it
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:52.340]   That was the next step of this now. This is the further step that no one in the world can find it
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:55.140]   and that's just
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.140]   You talk about a higher responsibility
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:03.060]   The judge in canada should have seen the further implications of this and for her to say oh, but the speech is fine
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.060]   Doesn't matter
[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:10.340]   Because it sets a precedent the definition of free speech varies tremendously judge across the world
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:16.660]   So the world sadly is not canada right? I wish it was so what is google's choice?
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:19.540]   They either do that or they get out of canada?
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.900]   They can't they can't appeal this because the supreme supreme court
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.860]   But they can appeal to the local court
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:31.540]   About certain structures or certain things about it. So there is there is some wiggle room in this
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:35.140]   Um, you know what does google go to the world
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:39.300]   You know court in the hag
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.300]   I don't know
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:45.460]   I don't know if that gets better. Why does it go to Vladimir Putin and ask kim says he's gonna be our boss
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.940]   You don't know what's the upshot of all this do we um
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:53.380]   I mean does google has selectively pull out of countries do they
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:57.140]   Go they have to go along with it. Are they're out of canada, right?
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:59.940]   Was it well?
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:08.900]   Yeah, so so you're asking two questions one is one of the do about canada and two is where they do about the next country that demands the same thing
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:10.020]   Right
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:13.220]   Right. They so look at what happened with the the link tax in spain
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:16.260]   Google said spain
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.260]   No google news for you
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:19.780]   No soup for you
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:23.220]   Pulled out right when germany went crazy over and by the way
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:28.020]   We know that that had a very negative impact on the amount of traffic driven to spanish news sites
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:31.860]   Yes, it did cut enough your nose. It's about your face and cost them all online
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:35.700]   All the problems with street view and germany they finally said effet
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:41.380]   And pulled that out. Is there a minor effet they could they can do here, but no, this is search
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:44.900]   Let's cheer up
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:50.500]   I guess I have in my hands and stacy has in her hands
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.620]   And echo show
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:58.980]   You know what though? It takes forever to download the software so plug that puppy in and just get it going
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:03.220]   This is not mine, but uh, oh here's those tabs that you were talking about. I love that
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:09.220]   Oh see in that nice. Yeah, it's the easy opening ease an opening package actually amazon's always done this with their echoes
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.220]   They've been very easy to get into
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:14.420]   Very hard to stop you start buying stuff
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:20.180]   We don't want to get in the way so this is megan maronies. It will be associated with her account
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:25.140]   Just defi eyes. So you'll be calling yeah, you'll be friends with megan. Not me good news
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:31.620]   You don't have to love megan. You don't have to worry about leo dropping in at all hours
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:36.820]   This is what it looks like so we've already seen reviews on on gadget at elsewhere
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:40.420]   It's essentially a kind of junky amazon fire tablet
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.300]   You know, it's like 980
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:48.900]   1024 by 980 or something seven inch tablet attached to an echo device
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:55.060]   It sounds good. You'll hear it in a second actually when it pops up. Somebody was saying it sounds better than the old echo
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:57.860]   It does. It's it's much more resonant
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:04.100]   Okay, if I had a resonant voice like does it sound like there you go. Hey baby
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:08.020]   I was like I cannot do that one when a man and a woman
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:13.300]   Decided. Oh here we go. But it's time
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:22.740]   To spend 230 dollars on a connected let jeff basil's into the bedroom. Yeah, I didn't return this when I canceled it
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:27.700]   You canceled it I canceled it because i just said i'm not gonna
[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:31.300]   I'm not gonna use this. I ordered them all
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:34.100]   We order everything from amazon because
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.260]   Well, it's time
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:40.420]   I think it's a good thing for the kitchen. I was i'm trying to convince my mom that she wants one
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:44.580]   Yes, I ordered two and i'm sending my mom one. I don't have to convince her i'm just sending it to her
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:46.900]   Well, see my mom wouldn't put it anywhere
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.820]   Otherwise, it would just sit in a box on her
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:52.820]   It wouldn't even she's my mom and I FaceTime all the time and I just thought well this will be easier for her
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:53:00.180]   Well, so my mom and I Skype but Skyping with my mom is just a nightmare because you know, she's like oh, I've got a who am I?
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.180]   I'm Skype. What's my face time?
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.220]   But we started with I set her up with Skype and then we ended up doing Facebook
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:12.660]   All right, why did you get our into it? Oh, you listen to it. Oh, is it gonna say something? It goes. Oh, no, can you show?
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.420]   Oh
[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:17.460]   I love that sound the idea. I do too. I'm alive sound
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:20.100]   In fact sometimes I yes, I turned off my wife
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.740]   I
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.740]   Ready for setup
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:29.300]   Okay echo device. Oh first i have to put it on our our on our Wi-Fi
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:35.380]   I guess I'll put it on this one. Oh, and your Wi-Fi password is automatically shown or it was in my case
[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.620]   So just know that let me not show it
[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:42.580]   Did it a monkey
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:49.220]   One you know what we really should use monkey one two three is our Wi-Fi password
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:53.060]   Nobody would know nobody would ever think we'd actually do that
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:54:01.380]   Oh, it says welcome Jerry wagley. Oh, it's not Megan's. I'm I'm now Jerry wagley
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:05.300]   Thank you, Jerry for sacrificing this. We're gonna get another one apparently
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:12.500]   So I can receive you can wipe it can't yeah, it says it's registered to Jerry if that's you type yes
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:19.540]   Because it's got Jerry's current billing information. Yes. Yes. Don't type no to use a different account. Yeah. No, that's me
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:24.260]   We're in north america
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:28.260]   It doesn't confirm or ask for your password. That was kind of what was stunning to me
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.540]   Well, they said they've always done this they've set them up at the factory, right?
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:34.020]   And now it's gonna do the update which takes forever
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:38.660]   Someone stole my box. Exactly. Thank you. Jeff. Oh, that's a good point
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:46.260]   Oh, yeah. Yeah, i'm Jerry wagley. Yeah, that's me. I think i'm gonna order a Corvette
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:52.820]   How would you say that's a good point? It doesn't ask for your password and maybe it does so let's see
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:57.700]   Which should i buy so it's gonna update so it has three buttons on the top it's got
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:04.740]   Plus and minus for volume and then the mute button so these are the effectively the same buttons that they're on the top of the
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:11.060]   Of the of the regular echo cylinder on the back totally by stuff on the back though
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:14.420]   There's no connector for anything else. It's just power
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:21.380]   So you can't connect this as you can with the echo to anything else. So it's gonna update the device. Let's install those
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:26.260]   Device updates. I'm sorry the screen so bright your device will restart twice
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:29.140]   It's gonna restart twice
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:31.380]   Powering off all right. Well, i'm just gonna put this over here
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:38.420]   And we'll uh, we'll let it. Thank you. Uh, I really appreciate Anthony. Nielsen came running in with a can handheld camera so that
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:41.380]   We've got we've got more who's that for
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:49.540]   Here's Megan. So if we want to open another one, no, no, we we'll save this so that you can get another unboxing later
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:57.780]   You can have a minor coming too. All right. So uh while it's updating while it's updating
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.460]   Uh
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:05.460]   We'll uh, we'll do some other stuff and then what we what we want to do is uh is do a call between you and me, right?
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:12.500]   Well, that's what I would want to do. But yeah, so you don't want to do things like echo call dad show the front door camera
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:17.620]   Playtop song show my calendar set a timer for three minutes show my phone
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:25.300]   I like the show so I have nest cams would it show the nest cam on this? I think it would I don't it might if nest integrates with the ring
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:32.180]   Yeah, nest may not have integrated with them yet. Yes, because it's google. Yeah, it does. It works with uh, uh,
[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:35.300]   ring honey well
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.900]   Uh
[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:38.900]   Arlo
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:40.900]   Logitech cameras
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.620]   Okay, so I can see my august doorbell that I hate
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:47.940]   So but I can't say I go to the ring doorbell. So that's good. So it'll go to my ring
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.420]   Rings the sponsor. I should mention
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:54.100]   Um, I would like it to use those nest cams. I just bought uh some nest cams
[00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:59.060]   I started talking about this way you were setting up because I thought there was gonna be like a long pause
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:01.620]   Um, I should have known better
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:05.780]   But they were talking on the chat room about wiring ring doorbells
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:09.860]   sponsor alert to um old houses and old wiring
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:13.140]   Yeah, we're just gonna say this because I did this so don't do this
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:19.140]   I blew out my doorbell transformer because I'm older. Oh, so if you're gonna wire these video doorbells
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:22.020]   spring for the 24 volt
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:24.660]   Transformer because the 16 volt
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:30.420]   Is what most houses says that somewhere in the manual, but who reads the manual?
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:35.460]   Exactly. So that's my pro tip to you guys installing doorbell
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:40.660]   And I by the way, I own apology the ring because I made a snarky comment a few weeks ago about them
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:44.420]   Not you know, not being a sponsor. Oh, yeah, and I got a call
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:48.740]   From uh the founder of ring. I said, what are you talking about of course?
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:51.860]   And they bought a whole bunch more ads. So I apologize
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:55.460]   Is it all from gb?
[00:57:55.460 --> 00:58:00.820]   Yeah, yeah, jayme call jayme literally I talked to jayme jayme said first of all you don't remember me do you?
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:02.100]   I said no
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:09.060]   He said I've been on twit because jayson kalakanis. I didn't remember this for years ago auctioned off a twit ad
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:11.620]   And jayme one
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:16.500]   For like his first product which I don't even remember it was an app or something doorbought
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:20.020]   It was terrible, but jayme will admit that you learned a lot
[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:22.020]   Yeah, and then he went on shark tank, right?
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:27.780]   And then uh, but anyway, and then he founded ring later. So I said, oh, yeah, I kind of remember that
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:31.140]   So I said, I'm a huge fan of course. We love you you're we're
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:35.460]   Anyway, so I apologize. I was snarky for no good reason
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:38.100]   Did you get in trouble with your wife? Yeah
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:43.620]   Of course I did because she's so like he was probably in trouble at lisa a lot too much all the time
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:46.420]   I mean no lisa's really you know what?
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:52.980]   I should be it's great. I should be in trouble all the time and she's she's an extortonary patient
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:57.780]   Person for instance, you know when when you marry somebody who's on the air
[00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:00.500]   Every day all day
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:06.500]   It's probably you know, you don't sign up for this but inevitably i'm gonna talk about her as I am right now
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:12.020]   And she's not crazy about that, but uh, she taught she tolerates it. She's very kind
[00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:14.820]   She says do you always have to use me as an example
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:20.900]   Well, you're she's your earl or she's your life. Yeah, she said well at least tell the truth
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:23.780]   So will I I exaggerate for?
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:26.900]   purposes of humor
[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:31.860]   Anyway, I don't you don't need to get an armarital cheese so
[00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:36.820]   That's like that's a queso dip you don't need to put your chip in
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:43.620]   Oh, so so before we went to the amazon break there, um the uh, so so the canada case
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:46.660]   I added to the rundown. There's now one in arizona
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:49.540]   Where a judge ordered?
[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:53.460]   Articles taken down in the u.s. At least it just blows me a kiss. I love you sweetheart
[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:58.740]   So yeah, so this is just this is a snowball. We're gonna see it is yeah
[00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:03.780]   Oh, by the way, amazon is announcing a smart home camera control with seskella
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:08.180]   So I guess uh, thank you scooter x for developers
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:12.580]   You will be able to I don't know my machine just turned itself off for some reason. Oh, yeah, no
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:15.700]   They've launched this last week. Okay. This is what everybody is using
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:20.980]   Well, I don't they have nest has to make the decision to integrate because they're google, you know
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:26.740]   They want to work with google home, but you can use the nest on the echo that was a big deal when that happened last year
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:30.100]   Okay, we're still updating. Yeah, and it's gonna be a five minute video
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:33.780]   After that it's gonna play. I have to watch a five minute video
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.820]   So let me ask you are you gonna turn on drop in?
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:41.940]   Is there anyone you know well enough to allow them to turn in turn on your camera?
[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:45.700]   If I if it's in the kitchen, I would let my parents
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:50.900]   Do it you don't never have it drop in in my bedroom though. That's just crazy
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:55.300]   Well, and I I don't know I guess you don't use your kitchen the same way we do
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:59.380]   I don't want I think I think we're heads of gmi
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:03.220]   Right in what's a big kitchen? There's a lot of room
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:09.380]   Now is in my office right now and I would let like a colleague drop in on my office
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:12.500]   Drop in so for those who don't know is the weirdest feature in fact
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.820]   I was said we were talking about this the other day in our editorial meeting
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:19.140]   I said amazon turns this stuff on just to see if somebody wants to use it
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.380]   They're taking the metrics. It's all about data gathering
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:26.740]   They don't know if somebody's gonna want this but the idea is that you can turn on the camera on this thing without warning
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:30.660]   Oh here if you let's see if this works
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:39.220]   Okay, I just realized this. I'm sorry. I just got too excited. I want which I'll have what she's having
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:46.020]   Okay, hold on. I'm gonna see if I can drop in from my phone app under the show that's here in my office
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:50.500]   You have to obviously open it up and give permission and uh
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:55.380]   What i'm curious about is is there any could you as they're warning
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:02:01.460]   To you as the drop in it can you say yeah, can you say oh no no don't know
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:06.020]   So what you can do is okay. Here's what it looks like on my app
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:10.020]   You get this little bar in the conversation saying oh is my screen too bright. Yeah, hold on
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:16.740]   I was I was shooting videos. So I needed a bright screen for that. Okay. See the drop in bar. Yeah drop in bar. Okay
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.300]   So let's drop in on somebody
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:24.420]   I get the choice of dotty, which is the bedroom by echo that's downstairs and my echo show
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:28.180]   These two how would you drop in on an audio only device?
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:32.900]   Let me tell you because this is a cool feature they announced two days ago. Oh, this is the intercom
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:35.220]   Intercom
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:38.260]   So then so we were my husband and I were actually using this to be like
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:45.700]   What's up? Come down. It's dinner time. We're definitely gonna use that we have we have echoes in every single room
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:50.340]   And the light turns green when you drop in on somebody and it chimes
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:54.580]   So if I drop in and no one's I I can try to see what happens on the show
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:56.020]   I
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:01.140]   Like a lease of dinners ready come on in and it would go and oh that's be so cool
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.900]   All right, here we go
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:08.900]   Let's see what happens when I was a kid my mom got so tired of yelling upstairs dinner's ready that she bought a bell
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:12.020]   Oh see here see you're being in on my show. Oh
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:14.580]   There I am
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:18.020]   Now
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.020]   I could sit on myself
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.780]   greatest
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:24.340]   I ended that for audio quality purposes, but
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:27.860]   What it did is it
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:30.420]   It showed me a blurry version
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:36.740]   And then I would have had to touch it and if I touched it then the camera turns on but that does see the blurry version
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:41.620]   I think I could have also verbally said that's not so bad. So you have to give permission. There's no
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:44.180]   uh drop in without your knowledge
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:48.980]   So if someone else wants to drop in on me, um, and let's see how I can
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:54.980]   I don't know what I don't know is how to add drop in had other people to drop in yet
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:04:00.740]   That's that's how do you lie about not being at the device when you don't want to talk to somebody
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:03.300]   You just say I can't talk right now
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.220]   Uh
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:07.220]   Oh, remember those days
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:11.380]   I can't talk right now. Wow or like
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:14.260]   I mean, it's not like a jerk being it's just like
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:17.540]   I don't know
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:20.020]   Your daughter says that to you are you gonna accept that answer?
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:25.300]   Uh, well, it's my daughter if if like there's an echo in her room and she's got a boy up there
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.700]   I would be like well, excuse me coming on up
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:31.620]   This changes this changes the dynamic considerably
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:34.260]   Does your daughter have an echo in her room?
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:40.100]   She's going to because she wants ours and she has a sonos, but since the echo
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:44.900]   It's it's a much better UI for her because she doesn't even like having a smartphone
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:48.340]   This is really interesting y'all. She hates charging have charging a phone
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:49.220]   Yeah
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:52.020]   So she just like hangs out and takes people on her computer
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.660]   This is going to change when she moves around more but right now
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:05:01.300]   She just echoes and does everything that way and I think it would be really interesting if you could text and access people through these devices
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.780]   She may be like
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:08.180]   Oh, and schmone. I just want to talk to something in my room and then take something on the go with me
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.580]   I don't know
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:13.140]   Did you ever see the dick van dyke
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:16.340]   Intercom episode?
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.340]   Oh, no
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:18.900]   Did not
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:23.620]   It's called all about eavesdropping. Let me see if I can get it to play here
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.820]   This is uh
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:32.900]   So there's apparently the neighbors intercom starts
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:36.100]   Oh, there it is
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.860]   the neighbors
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:43.300]   Intercom starts playing back in the van dyke household
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:46.900]   And they start listening in. Oh, I can't find it
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:51.140]   Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:53.220]   Echo wants me
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:56.180]   Introducing here it is you want to watch a short video. It says brief
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:59.300]   It's five minutes
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:02.340]   I'd rather watch the defense night
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:03.940]   Amazon echo show
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:09.780]   It's everything you love about a scholar, but now she can show you things play movies from amazon video
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:14.180]   View your photos or see what's on your calendar and to-do lists. It's a too bright
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:15.940]   And now there's a new way to be together
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:19.620]   Make hands-free video calls to friends and family like this
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:22.500]   Hello cultina. Oh, dear
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:26.100]   I apologize for everybody at home
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:29.780]   I'm there supported echo device or the smell up on their phone
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:33.140]   Ready for some music echoes very sweet
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:38.180]   With a bowl and stairs that looks like a mary tunnel or show today's most popular songs
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:43.700]   Here are popular. Oh, see there's a new word show now you can show because you've got a screen
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:49.860]   And Amazon music you can follow. Oh, this is great. I'm now going to replace all my echoes and dots
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.980]   Hope really I would wait
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:58.020]   Why live with it just for a little yeah, all right. It's also a lot more expensive, right? It's like 200 something
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:02.660]   230 I think you can buy two if you buy two you get a hundred bucks off
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:04.580]   I did that because I bought one for my mom
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:08.100]   I think she'll like this and you know what you're right the speaker is much better
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:10.820]   Is it actually very good
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:16.660]   And I just shows you how much we're all in here cherry bought one Megan bought one. I bought a couple
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:19.460]   Here's the thing I don't know
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:21.620]   You're gonna watch a movie on your base or no
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:27.620]   What it really is is what you saw with the I think the songs and like you weather reports and stuff like that, right?
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:33.540]   Well, she actually just did a skill where you can show the news like again think about those kitchen
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:36.180]   You haven't used that or you haven't in the bathroom or
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:41.140]   Used to used to I'm sorry the kitchen TVs people apparently
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:46.500]   Jerry do you want me to start a 30-day free trial of echo on a music unlimited?
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:49.540]   Just remember to cancel it still
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:53.380]   Okay, I'm loading it. Please wait. Now. What is it doing?
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:59.140]   So here's the question. How do we get how do we connect for?
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:01.780]   Call
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:06.020]   Jerry so there you go. This is the interface that you see all the time
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:15.300]   Wait a minute what somebody's already calling me. It's jerry. Hey, jerry. How do I what do I have a very confused?
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:20.660]   You have jerry's device, but jerry's calling jerry's device. I'm so confused. I can't I can't buy jerry
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:25.300]   from the echo at that I'm great. You know the quality on this is fantastic
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:30.580]   It is and you see that this is my picture. So it's kind of a wide-angle picture
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:37.780]   Yes, Anthony. Yeah, Anthony's the camera guy taking it on the other way. The you know what that looks pretty good
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:46.180]   Yeah, it does. Oh, who's that Lisa? We're gonna put this in the bedroom in the kitchen in the closet in the bathroom
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.180]   We're putting this in every
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:52.900]   Yes, no, this is a call. This is not a drop-in or is it a drop-in?
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:59.380]   Is it a drop-in or a call? I think jerry's thing is a drop-in. So that's just like a call. I don't have to
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:02.100]   Know you have to answer a call
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:06.580]   If you tell someone to call you have to actually answer it
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:14.260]   All right, this is this is so cool. All right, bye jerry
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:20.500]   You get a busy signal. I had to touch my screen. So they don't think this is it. He says he did a drop-in though
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:26.340]   Right. So when you drop in he gets a blurry vision. Yeah, we saw the blurry of him too
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:32.820]   But when you call someone and you can actually call people in your own house, although i'm not sure why you want to actually
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:35.140]   How would I call you?
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.140]   You would say call stacy
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:40.340]   If I were your friend
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:42.340]   Yeah, well, I don't know um
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:47.780]   Kevin and I and I care I'm gonna say show this I don't remember how it's happening. I have the default screen just sits there
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:52.500]   And it shows the the fingerprint Wow, that's an ad
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:58.740]   Yeah, so this is really interesting. This is what I wanted you to see. There's no
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:01.540]   It's news
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:06.340]   You get these notifications and you can set it up in settings if you pull down from the top screen
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:14.980]   You'll so yeah pull down in c settings. Yeah, if you go to settings you can change
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:19.220]   The home screen is what that is now. I know how ginger rogers film
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:24.100]   So I can tie this to bluetooth. That's nice and then I can see what my home screen can do
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:27.380]   home card preferences
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:32.980]   So rotate continuously, that's the default you can just rotate once
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:36.900]   And then I can have notifications from other services is left
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:42.660]   It's right is that on or off? That's not communicative at all, but I presume that's on
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:45.620]   That's not dark. I'll bet
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:47.620]   Yeah, boy. Yeah, that's a big difference
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:49.860]   um
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:54.340]   Upcoming events yet drop-ins see who's available from your context list
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.900]   Uh, is safe in your contact list?
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.740]   No, and I don't know how to add people to my context list. This is what
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:07.380]   I didn't know I had an Amazon context list. Oh, oh you go to your okay. You go to your echo app go to your echo app. And then you go
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:10.420]   to the little people sign go to the
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.260]   That's your contacts. Okay
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:18.740]   So and it uses your phone's address book to find people you know who have an echo device or the escalate app
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:23.300]   These are the people I can reach so I don't actually have anyone from twit in my phone. Well, we'll yeah
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:28.260]   I don't have your phone number either for obvious reasons. I think that was part of the court order, but yes, yes
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.780]   We shouldn't be doing this show at all. Yeah, yeah
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:34.660]   I'm not allowed to be within five feet of you will move the screen
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:39.460]   So I can like karstin should have it or I can send it to karstin if jerry
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:44.260]   Is contact information or how oh jerry did it?
[01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:50.500]   Oh, no, he sent me his gmail. Yeah, jerry. So add jerry. So we want to call you. I want to call you
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.300]   All right, hold up. Hold up
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:59.220]   This this requires like dexterity. I don't usually I'm looking at the new really redesigned google news
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:05.380]   That kind of strange a google would redesign a product like google news that I don't even think like they even anybody knows they still do it
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:09.700]   And it is a real problem here for us real problem. Why?
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.060]   Search for google. Okay in in this
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:16.660]   I'll be up in search bar. The search bar right there search google google. Okay
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:20.980]   All right, and you'll see oh, this is pretty is google stories
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:23.780]   eventually. Yeah, now scroll down
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:26.420]   Tech crunch fortune
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:31.780]   Scroll scroll scroll CNN CNBC go all the way to the bottom all the bottom. Yeah
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:36.900]   The selection and placement of stories in this page are determined automatically. There's no more
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.940]   That's it. You get one screen load. Oh, that's not good
[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:42.260]   That's not good at all for us
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:44.900]   And I went to big because we're not on the front page you're saying
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:47.700]   No, it's just how if you do a search
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:51.860]   You only get so many results. I already tweeted about it begging them. I need more
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:54.580]   I use that every week
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:58.660]   I go through like 15 screen loads to prep for the show
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:02.820]   Wait, I'm missing exactly it ends
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.260]   It ends
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.580]   So it used to be an endless scroll and now it's a
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:11.540]   Page of page of her page. This is a problem carston is probably
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:15.380]   Upset now. Are you carston?
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:20.420]   Here's this we don't use in google. Yeah, I haven't used google news readers
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:25.140]   Oh, that's how I do it every week. Whatever it was called google reader
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:32.660]   Yeah, here's a story. I missed see we ought to use it pregnant 19 year old phailey shoots boyfriend and youtube stunt gone wrong
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:38.180]   Okay, that's terrifying
[01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:42.900]   Uh, so you see that but that's what we missed by not using google news
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:48.020]   All right, so jerry is endeavoring to contact
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:52.260]   To add you to his scallows. I mean he's so I

[01:14:56.180 --> 01:15:01.780]   I couldn't find a contact matching stacy higgin bottom to see I may need
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:04.340]   That doesn't pronounce your name right either
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:06.660]   and well that

[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:19.380]   I've been working on the railroad by cedar monk kids
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:23.300]   Oh dear lord
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:27.460]   Stacy's gonna start marching down the aisle like it's a recessional time
[01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:32.740]   Oh dear

[01:15:55.060 --> 01:16:03.220]   I think we can play this without violating any rights
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:10.980]   I don't know. There's some civil rights that are being violated. Well, this is seriously. Well, let's do carry okey
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:15.940]   Well, it kind of is isn't it well, but you're saying along with the voice

[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:25.940]   Listen to bohemian rhapsody karaoke
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:34.180]   Bohemian rhapsody isn't included with prime. It is available with amazon music unlimited. Would you like to learn more?
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:38.100]   Here at the time I want you flow
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:43.060]   It stopped on a very good lyric
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:46.420]   Um
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:51.860]   Listen to the star spangled banner karaoke
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:59.220]   The star spangled banner united states national anthem by the united states marina band
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:03.300]   But it's not playing the lyrics
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:05.940]   Well here. I'm sorry. Alexa stop
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:12.900]   I used to work in radio and whenever the star spangled banner started playing at an event you couldn't interrupt it
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:17.620]   Are you serious? So we would always try to get out of the event. That's why the baseball games
[01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:20.020]   You never hear the star spangled banner because once it starts
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:23.540]   Uh, we had a respect you got to keep going
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:26.340]   So try show my audiobooks
[01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:32.020]   Just gotta show my audiobooks. Well, we show mine, but I don't know if you have audiobooks cherry
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:34.340]   Oh, right cherry just gotta show my audio
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:38.340]   I don't see a book title, but I don't know if you have audio your book library is empty
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:41.380]   Buy audiobooks visit audible.com
[01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:48.100]   Man if european union ever gets ahold of amazon they're dead. Yeah. Well. Yeah. Yeah house traffic
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:52.580]   The fastest route takes about 15 minutes. Oh
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:58.740]   So I'm not I'm not getting a map. That's what I was hoping for. Oh, okay, but I just got
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:01.780]   A picture of people on the road
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:04.340]   You got clip art nice
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:07.620]   So what will show you what will show you?
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:11.620]   What's the news?
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:17.060]   Here's Stacy's flash briefing. That's just a normal flash briefing. Oh, but what do you get in it? You might get more
[01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:19.460]   On the screen. Yeah
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:25.140]   I'm just getting in here, but cnbc just announced something today where they're gonna put eclipse actual content
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:27.940]   Does this hell stop?
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:30.740]   Schiller show me a photo of a hot dog
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.540]   I
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:38.100]   Got the reference. Oh, but wait a minute
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:42.660]   There's oh, yes, I can have prime photos in here
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:46.900]   So it says to set up prime photos download the app
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:52.580]   That's interesting. So you could use this as a as a picture frame
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:54.980]   because
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:19:00.180]   I could it would if I had prime photos and I have photos in it. I could ask for specific photos
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:02.260]   That's kind of neat
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:07.060]   So I was trying to figure out because there's an option to use your personal photos
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:09.540]   Even if they're not stored
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:12.020]   On Amazon poor dr
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:16.180]   I can't figure out how to get that her her amazon echo is going off every time we say
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:22.100]   Hit that microphone. I don't yeah, just mute it for the time being and I apologize
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:24.740]   It will show you your calendar
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:28.500]   Who can I call gerry? Do you know anybody I can call?
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:31.780]   But do they have their set up no
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:36.900]   I'm saying gerry. Do you want to be like my friend when tell me I won't ring your phone
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:41.860]   It'll only ring your echo echo doesn't have echo to phone calling. I has echo to echo calling
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:47.220]   No, I know but it's not recognizing him in my context as someone who has an echo device
[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:52.260]   Ah, I wonder how oh gerry. Did you send her the address you use for your amazon account? You did
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:59.940]   And so somehow amazon has a way of recognizing whether you have an echo or not
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:02.580]   And apparently it's not doing that
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:08.900]   And maybe it just does it like once a day. So maybe it's not continually running that call
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:11.140]   Yeah
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:14.820]   Okay, but hey, we get the idea. I was able to call gerry that worked that worked great
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:17.780]   And it is a fairly wide angle camera. I have to say I
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:21.540]   I was worried because I read the reviews that said this is a terrible screen
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:27.780]   Um, but it's not a terrible screen. It's so it's actually for what for where it is and how it how it's positioned
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:33.540]   It's it looks great. I am I'm I'm actually more stoked about this than I was
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:38.500]   Oh, it is through the phone number that you use for your echo account. I'm reading the instructions
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:44.580]   Hey, he gave you the same phone number he uses for his echo. He gave me his email. I didn't get a phone number
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:46.420]   Oh, you didn't get a phone number
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:49.460]   So that may be she's she's gonna send you he's gonna send you his phone number
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:53.620]   I guess because you have to add that she has to add your phone number to her context list
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:57.860]   Yes, and there's a way. Oh, look in your look in his email. It's in the signature
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:00.900]   Oh, he's one of those people who doesn't mind if people call him
[01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:09.620]   Wow, by the way, am I stealing a number if I say that if facebook went to two billion mentally active users this
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:12.340]   week, that's fun
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:17.540]   Oh, it is one of your numbers. I'm sorry. I'm not gonna touch the other ones
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:20.420]   You're a swag
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:26.740]   2 billion a hair in the crack and in fast company did a very good article about the growth team
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:29.540]   and how they have worked
[01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:34.420]   To get to 2 billion what I didn't know is they stalled out
[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:38.500]   At 70 million they thought for a while
[01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:41.540]   That's all we're gonna get
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:45.620]   Uh, remember facebook started a 13 years ago
[01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:48.820]   and uh
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:52.900]   It's grown to two billion users in that 13 years, but it wasn't a steady growth
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:57.060]   So in fact the growth team was created when they hit that plateau
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:22:04.500]   Of 70 million users and it was those guys who came up with all these interesting ways of
[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:07.940]   creating
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:10.500]   Uh growth, I guess
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.580]   some smart people
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:18.740]   How facebook used science and empathy to reach two billion users
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:21.860]   Really nice long run
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:24.020]   they'll get accused of course of
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:26.980]   Manipulating people's brains
[01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:29.060]   Oh, yeah, until the EU gets all of them
[01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:34.180]   You know what I liked uh one of the the head of the growth team today said we don't consider big data
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:38.020]   Uh, you know, we don't think it's all the growth is all about big data
[01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:40.500]   He says growth's all about empathy and the data gives us
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:44.740]   More empathy more understanding of people and that's how we grow
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:48.740]   So there's some other numbers and and the uh
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:55.700]   Next web story that 175 million people use the love reaction every day 800 million people like something every day
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:58.740]   I really wanted to use the pride flag
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:03.700]   It was there okay jerry and i are connected. Oh, I heard a being
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:06.660]   Okay, so should should uh
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:12.820]   Oh, there's a message. Oh, there was a message for jerry from stacy. So I can now can I call you?
[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:16.580]   How do I call you just say drop in on stacy this girl drop in on stacy
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:21.460]   Stacey higgin bottom right right
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:35.300]   Can you see what I see see I see twig and you should see blurry me. I see I don't see any nudity at all. I'm very disappointed
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:38.260]   Is my
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:40.100]   And then oh, it's cool how you come in
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:45.780]   That's cool. It kind of doesn't just pop in you's you slowly fade in
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:51.060]   Oh, I guess I guess you're time to stop picking your nose or to grab shirt. Yeah. Yeah, here. We go. Here we go. Here we go
[01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:53.700]   Um
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:56.180]   I think this is a good camera. I think it's a good view
[01:23:56.180 --> 01:24:03.460]   It's at least as good as it's not quite as good as a skype view is but it's like can you can you compare that flip back and forth between our view
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:10.020]   via skype and and our view not used as a carsten so it's I think skipes obviously a lot better better camera
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:12.820]   Um, but I think for a video call this is usable
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:16.340]   It's roughly the same. It's roughly the same
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:20.340]   World's fair quality. Yeah, world's fair call. Yeah, it is isn't this
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:23.620]   1964 world's New York world's fair
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:28.420]   There we are 18 t demonstrated the camera phone finally here. We are
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:31.220]   50 years later
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:33.220]   We actually have a camera phone
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:37.780]   Stacy looks more dubious on this than she does on the show. It's my profile
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:43.780]   All right, i'm gonna turn around so Stacy so you can see me just so you can see what it looks like
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:45.620]   Um
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:48.500]   Now i'm well lit remember where i'm in a lit studio
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:52.660]   So I have good quality and actually when I turn it around you look pretty good. This is good
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:57.220]   Yeah, this is very good. This would be a great and the nice thing is you're not holding something
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:04.420]   You just relaxed you go. So anyway, Stacy. I got this pitch i'd like to give you for my new iot business
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:07.940]   I think this is good. I might I would i'm
[01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:11.460]   All right. I don't mean to do an ad for the amazon show
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:15.700]   But i'm impressed. What do you think Stacy? Are you?
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:18.420]   I think the video calling is good
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:22.500]   And here can I hang up now or should we keep doing this? Yeah, I can hang up
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.180]   Okay
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:25.940]   So that's gonna let
[01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:31.060]   Hang up the quality is very good too. I have to say and uh, we'll have to see over a longer period of time
[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:34.100]   Oh gives you the time of uh the call
[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:36.180]   Ooh
[01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:38.180]   Let's get pretty sweetie picture
[01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:44.660]   I think I would want this everywhere in my what's the little notification there? Stacy or earlier? That's probably a message from Stacy
[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:48.260]   Oh, well you've got a lot of notifications now Stacy's home
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:53.060]   Well, I'm not why am I not getting that. Oh, I think I turned to turn that off. Hold on
[01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:58.340]   I said yeah, I like that. Oh and you can put do not disturb on now. It's not a physical shutter. Oh
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:02.020]   Are you
[01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:07.620]   Hi Stacy are you there?
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:13.540]   I think it turns the volume up at the beginning of the calls because I had turned the volume all the way down
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:16.500]   Oh, so you can hear that i'm going Stacy
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:20.260]   Yep, yeah, that's good here. I am turning it back down again. Yeah
[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:25.380]   Okay, this is cool. All right. All right. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to I didn't mean to call you again
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.380]   I don't really want to talk to you. So goodbye
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:29.060]   Oh
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:35.060]   Turn the video off and you can end the call so two options there. I just tap that video off or end call
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:41.300]   All right. This is cool. This is cool. Now the intercom. How does the intercom work? That's not the intercom
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:43.540]   That's drop in or is it right here. Let me let me
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:45.620]   That's drop in
[01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:51.620]   That's the same technology, but I could also if I drop in on intercom if I have to accept though
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:55.060]   Jeff do you want to be you've got an echo right with you, right?
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:56.500]   No
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.020]   No, he's not at home. Oh because you're at your office
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:03.540]   I can go and run and grab a dot and then plug it in and show you the green light goes around
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:09.940]   And it starts listening so I can drop in on my kitchen. Uh jerry's gonna go in the other office and intercom me, right?
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:12.500]   Okay, there you go. All right
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.500]   Try he says i'm gonna try
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.580]   You can do it. Can you do it from the echo app?
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:19.460]   He's got an echo in his office
[01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:21.460]   Don't need that. No, no
[01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:25.540]   Don't eat that that's her echo. Oh my god. The dog just ate the echo
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:33.380]   I presume and we'll have to go deeper into this and we're gonna do a full review on the new screensavers
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.380]   But I presume there's a way to say
[01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:40.580]   Uh, these are off hours. Don't call me in 2 a.m. Dr. mom, please. I beg of you
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:43.380]   I think it's oh, oh, oh, oh
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:46.900]   That's gonna
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:51.060]   Drop in on Stacy. Oh, somebody's calling me. You see this is but is this intercom?
[01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:53.940]   This is not good because I don't say yes
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:59.460]   That's jerry's home. So that's jerry calling you right, but let's put it. I have to press you gotta say answer
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:05.700]   You gotta click you gotta say answer. Oh, so it's not an intercom that it's not draw echo
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:08.660]   I mean, hey
[01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:12.580]   That's gonna drop in on Stacy
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:16.980]   Stacy Higginbottom right right
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:23.860]   Make bacon, but this is the same thing we did before. This is no different than calling you
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:28.580]   Well, no if you call me, I have to answer it if you drop it right now
[01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:31.780]   Hearing your audio though without you doing anything. So this is the
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:33.620]   In a calm
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:36.340]   Yes, well this intercom and drop in are kind of the same thing
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:42.500]   The difference is you only let certain echoes into your drop-in list and drop in without it
[01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:46.740]   So you don't have to accept to hear the audio you have to accept to hear it to see the video
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:50.340]   But we don't have to so so that's why it's an intercom
[01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:54.180]   I could just say drop in on Stacy and then you'll hear my voice and we can talk
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:29:01.140]   Right except for after this show. I'm gonna not let jerry have drop-in privileges. Yes. I would it looks like this
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:07.300]   Okay, can you see my swag to it? Yeah. Yeah, so you can call oh jerry. That was your phone number. I'm so sorry
[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:09.540]   That's all right. Nobody saw it
[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:14.340]   And if they did jerry just say hi jerry. I'm sorry. Okay
[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.460]   There it looks like this
[01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:23.860]   Yeah, okay
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:29.620]   All right, well, I'm just uh, you know, on first glance. I think this is a pretty compelling
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:31.620]   It's too bad it's so expensive because
[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:36.420]   One of the reasons I do have echoes in every rooms because the dot was so inexpensive and I could put dots, you know
[01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:40.500]   I could if 40 bucks I could buy five dots or whatever not that many
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.140]   three dots
[01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:45.700]   Um now all of our echoes are in voice stuff
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.700]   Sagan
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:51.540]   So can I mention this voice is rather topic of voice? Can I miss other voice stuff? Yeah move on
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:58.180]   So yesterday john borthwicks beta works, you know the beta works folks, right? Sure, uh held a voice summit showing off
[01:29:58.180 --> 01:30:04.340]   Uh, they had an incubator a beta camp as they call it being beta works with eight voice
[01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:09.460]   Companies just in this one this field and just a few other dimension, which were really interesting
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:16.500]   Uh, one is called john done two folks left the company that does uh, what was it the AI company?
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:19.620]   Uh, he is coming here
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:23.460]   Whatever they had any company is right and so there was there they did they did a demo
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:26.180]   Where you give your?
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:31.300]   Agent in instruction and it calls and uses voice with human beings
[01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:36.260]   So they demoed you want to find out whether this this certain florist has peonies
[01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:39.460]   so ask the so-and-so florist whether it has peonies and
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:44.740]   It called off we listened to it and it says hello. I am calling you have yanese
[01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:50.100]   And they say no we don't thank you very much and then it reports back to you. No
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:56.580]   Then they said find the peonies and so it could call, you know 20 florists in new york
[01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:59.780]   Then it comes back with the answer. I found peonies at this address
[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:03.300]   Really interesting so you have the sense that
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:08.980]   The two agents will start because the you know the the company has its phone mail jail and you have your own agent
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:11.380]   And they're just kind of negotiate with each other until they come to peace
[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:15.220]   That was facebook M's initial idea remember that
[01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:23.140]   Yes, right so this is that actually happening is really two smart people another company. I found really fascinating
[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:25.780]   called neurallex.ai
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:29.780]   Brilliant guys, uh, jim schwaibold
[01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:36.820]   Uh founder they have found this there's there's scientific research to this effect and they're and they're and they're commercializing this
[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:39.380]   that voice samples are
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:45.620]   effective devices to help the diagnosis of especially psychiatric conditions
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:49.460]   Wow, so imagine if they took the show
[01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:55.700]   They finally know what drug stasis on and it's all kind
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:58.020]   Yes
[01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:02.740]   And it's my great time. Okay, how many words you use what kinds of words you use
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:07.220]   Uh, how how fast you talk and so on so forth just fascinating data in there
[01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:11.460]   So I of course the doctors they stuck up my hand and I asked the founder
[01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:16.740]   Have you used voice samples from the president of the united states? Oh, well, he didn't want to answer
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:22.020]   Uh, which means he has yes, of course. He has and he doesn't want to share the result with you
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:26.900]   So you can imagine what the result must have been there's another company called earplay which you can use today
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:32.820]   Where it's the old stick of doing the story that that you then have a place and it gives you choices
[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:36.500]   It's like the like the old um, what was the game we used to play where you were the wizard
[01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:42.820]   I'm a jungle with oh, yeah, that's the dragons. Oh, no. No. No. No the simpler one. Oh, uh, uh
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:47.060]   It just came out open source and you play you got all excited about it a few
[01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:51.060]   They're really useful wasn't so so
[01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:54.100]   adventure
[01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:56.100]   It gives you an adventure. It gives you a choice
[01:32:56.100 --> 01:33:01.140]   And how does this do stories or how does this do I think what joristically is interesting? How does it do?
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:05.460]   Uh, well, don't skip that. I know that give me this instead because you're a choice
[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:07.300]   um
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:10.820]   Real quickly a cup of spoken layer, which is a company I like a lot of like for a long time
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:13.700]   They're a structure to add human voice
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:19.780]   Towards so they've got there there's just tons of stuff a third of the news on google home news
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:25.860]   They do and so you can get the new yorker human voice and they have a structure to sell out and do that
[01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:28.900]   So there were some other companies there, but I just wanted to mention that that this whole
[01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:30.820]   um
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:35.780]   Voice things fascinating Dennis Crowley from four square was there four square, which we talked about the story a few weeks ago
[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:40.820]   Uh has really become a tremendous data company. So Dennis was there and he confessed
[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:46.500]   Um, I don't think it was chat him house rule. I was stream. So I hope this is okay. That is his young child
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:50.180]   Uh first four words the fourth word the child learned was
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:51.780]   a scholar
[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:53.300]   Oh boy
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:55.860]   And then somebody else said oh, yeah, I'm hearing that all the time
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:58.500]   That's just quite common. No kidding
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:02.020]   Amazing. I don't know if that's good or bad. I think it's kind of
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:08.740]   Enjoy that that cool. Wow, you know at the end of this year. We'll know from the social security database research
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:10.820]   I don't know if it comes out immediately
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:13.460]   So we'll be able to track the popularity of that name
[01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:20.180]   Oh, you wouldn't name your kid that in fact, I would think it would be the opposite the popularity would plummet to zero
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:23.060]   Well, that's what i'm saying, but you'll be able to see that data
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:27.620]   Because it came out just don't name your kid echo or computer either because that those are the alternative
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:29.140]   Uh
[01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:33.700]   Thanks. So I am I'm very excited now. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm feeling kind of bad
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:36.580]   I think I might I got two one for my mom. I think I might keep it
[01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:44.420]   Why just just give one your well. So this is the same thing the nucleus. I want one by my bedside. This is what
[01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:50.180]   This is what um, don't drop in I got I know don't let anyone drop in on that one
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:54.580]   Well, no family can drop in on that one. They can't see anything. They can only talk to me
[01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:58.820]   Well, even then can they listen do they not hear until you say okay
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:02.740]   No, they can listen. I can like if you wanted to hear my kitchen right now
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:06.980]   I would drop in on it and you can hear whatever's happening down there. See yeah, you don't want that
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:09.780]   mom and dad are fighting or
[01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:13.620]   Or alternative, you know, I really feel like
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:19.940]   We are entering maybe it's maybe I think I need you have any zanax because i'm getting
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:22.660]   I feel like we're entering a very
[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:26.900]   I'm worried about two things
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:30.820]   One all those things to just describe jeff. Yeah, they sound really cool
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:37.540]   But I also feel like we're going to be in this very rapid period of innovation where there's lots of stuff
[01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:41.220]   That we don't really know how to incorporate into our human
[01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:46.180]   So the founder of of of shaville from uh neural x
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:52.740]   So because I asked about the privacy implications here and he said, you know what when if I call you and leave a message on your phone
[01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:55.300]   You will in the copyright to that
[01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:59.540]   Oh, this neural x thing let's ask about this because this is a big deal
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:08.020]   When you have these sorts of things, how are they approaching fda approval if they need it or be even peer reviewed because like
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:11.300]   A lot of these things are clean nuts without any
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:14.820]   Yes, so here's here's right. So here's the thing
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:18.100]   So, uh, yes, they're gonna go for fda. He said
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:19.700]   Um
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:22.820]   And and jim if I get anything wrong, please let me know and we'll correct it next week
[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:28.980]   Um, uh, he said they're gonna plan to go after fda, but for the earliest stage product. They'll just go for um anxiety
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:31.940]   and and um
[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:37.220]   And I can see hello leo. This is your echo, right? You're sounding very nervous
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:41.940]   It could trigger your fitbit to do the breathing exercise. Well, it could it could happen
[01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:44.900]   You know a rayana huffie that comes on and tells you to go to sleep
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:49.620]   Um, but it couldn't could have an impact on your medication. So it's on a consumer level. It tells you about you
[01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:56.740]   It probably will not ever diagnose you it will be a b2b to the doctor and the doctor gets
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:37:00.340]   The ability to that's not the only thing that's making me nervous
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:02.660]   No, I agree. It's take that
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:09.700]   And then what is apparently happening right now with which is massive cyber warfare and the sudden
[01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:12.820]   rise of the amoral
[01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:15.860]   Hacker whether it's a state
[01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:19.700]   Or sponsored organization or an individual and this is what we're seeing in the ukraine
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:22.820]   And you have those two together suddenly
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:28.180]   I am a little worried. I have all these devices that are listening and talking to me and yeah
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:33.620]   Then I have all these bad guys and there seem to be there seems to be no check on these guys
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:40.180]   And I feel like we live in of we're we're heading towards a classic kind of dystopia
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:46.180]   And they're going to know things about you. This is where we we've discussed this many times, you know, I argued that
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:53.060]   You can't control knowledge. You can't control the gathering of information, but you have to control the use of it
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:38:00.980]   And so does it become illegal to do a psychiatric analysis of us on this show? Well, the chat room's been doing that for years
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:05.700]   Yes, so this is nothing new to us. Dr. mom has certified us. Oh my god
[01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:14.740]   Wait, she has not certified me. No, it is me. No, no, no. No, she loves you. It's me. It's all about me and a little bit about jeff
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:17.620]   I just I
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:24.100]   I mean, of course there's a solution to it. It's to not buy these devices and it's to maybe move somewhere with a snow internet
[01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:33.460]   Um, but I'm just very I feel like wait. There's you're missing an obvious solution. Hey, we set rules about how we can use this and that's what i'm saying
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:38.180]   You use the days. Yeah, dr. mom says it's not illegal just unethical and that's right
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:44.660]   Uh, and and and it is ethics. You've saved. Believe me ethics have gone out the window. That's why this
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:46.900]   this growing group of
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:48.900]   Amoral hackers
[01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:55.380]   See what's what's it turns out the only thing that's really prevented people from being completely malicious to one another is
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:39:02.660]   Society and norms and there we've raised a generation. I think of people who don't have anything to hold them back anymore
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:07.460]   No, they feel so there they they suffer from extreme anomy and misogyny
[01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:12.260]   They don't feel like a part of society and not the whole generation. No, but enough
[01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:18.340]   Goes within it. Yes. So leo I recommend highly highly run time for this. I don't think we're going to follow detail this week
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:19.780]   But I I wrote a piece
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:29.700]   Well, well I was gone on media manipulation data and society, which is I think taken New York run by data boy released a spectacular report going exactly where you're going
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:31.300]   um
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:35.940]   The catalogs the bad guys and who it is and how they're doing it and why they're doing it
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:40.260]   So it's everything from gamer gators to the so-called bens right movement to the alt right to
[01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:43.220]   terrorist to trolls
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:45.380]   So I read that then I read
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:52.740]   And and and you should read this but you're gonna get really paranoid. I linked to it in my post the nato handbook on Russian
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:55.140]   information warfare
[01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:58.340]   It is the script for what we're going through i'm not saying the Russians are doing it all
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:03.860]   But i'm saying that the techniques are they're learning from each other then I read a random report on Russian information warfare
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:06.020]   And you're right leo these
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:10.660]   These these nefarious actors are out there and they will be able to exploit certain things
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:15.300]   You don't need the whole society you the norm is society may indeed find a repugnant
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:19.460]   That doesn't mean it doesn't happen and then and then you get in the mode of oh my god
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:22.820]   Something bad could happen kill the elexes first
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:27.620]   Well read the cover story in the june
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:30.900]   wired magazine
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:35.380]   How an entire nation became russia's testbed for cyber war
[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:38.020]   That was a great story handy greenberg
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:42.580]   This is essentially the story of what's going on in the ukraine
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:45.700]   And russia's
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:50.580]   russian state hackers have cut the electricity in some cases they have
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:54.100]   faked election results
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:57.620]   They have sewed fake news they have perfected
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:02.820]   cyber war a wide ranging variety of cyber warfare
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:05.940]   techniques and
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:10.660]   Ukraine is the testbed a because they're already in a war with the ukraine
[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:18.180]   I'm sorry ukraine not the ukraine. I'm there aren't any war with ukraine, but b because they want to see it's an experiment
[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:23.140]   To see how well these things can work well we're the experiment too. So let me give you a couple
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:30.180]   Well, this is in for instance in greenberg's article he points out that they did something in the ukraine election
[01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:34.820]   Which they then duplicated in our election shortly thereafter, right?
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:41.060]   But we're also seeing this week the petya ransome where which comes out of as far as we can tell
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:43.700]   an accounting firm in ukraine
[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:46.420]   which was either hacked
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:52.260]   Or uh, which I think is the most likely case or themselves or bad guys we know that a lot of ransome
[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:54.100]   Wasn't ransnapped a target of it?
[01:41:54.100 --> 01:42:00.100]   Well, that's what's interesting a lot of ransome wars coming out of the ukraine to fund their cyber warfare against russia
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:05.620]   In any event this is a this it's a lot it seems likely that petya is
[01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:09.300]   Not created by an individual but created by a state
[01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:14.020]   sponsored group, but it's hard to say and it's brought down some very big
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:19.140]   Uh like merk yes very merk merk and merk
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:22.980]   um in hospitals and this is and this is uh
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:25.860]   Wanna cry times 10?
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:29.300]   And I think this is going to be the year we look back and say
[01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:33.140]   Oh crap. This is when it all started go downhill
[01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:37.940]   And by the way, this one also takes advantage of a number of nsa discovered
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:43.460]   Exocia the nsa what's your opinion and steves opinion should the nsa
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:47.300]   Just go ahead and reveal how all the stuff works immediately
[01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:51.860]   Reveal all the explicit so should of the fbi so should the cia
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:56.500]   Uh because at this point everybody has to have a chance to patch the problem is
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:04.500]   That people don't patch so for instance this petra if you patched and you're all of your version all of your windows machines
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:09.220]   If you patched them in march you wouldn't be vulnerable to it, but people don't update on all takes is one
[01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:16.180]   Computer that hasn't been updated in a hospital for instance where they can't update all the computers to infect the rest of the network
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:20.420]   And so there's a risk revealing these because as soon as it's revealed
[01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:25.460]   It will be exploited the problem is much of it has been revealed. This is a this is a mess
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:28.740]   Well, and this is
[01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:32.660]   It's one thing to tell people to patch. It's another thing to talk about how
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:37.460]   How to implement patches and I was actually at an industrial iot event
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:41.780]   um for honeywell in the to their plants that refine oil and
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:46.820]   Make drugs and all these other things and there was a conversation about
[01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:51.300]   Patching because all of these people realize it's a big deal, but they're all
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:53.140]   They're like
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:56.020]   If I patch something a machine on my line
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:58.820]   And I do it without the vendors say so
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:04.580]   I avoid my warranty. I can also break things further down the line by having other partners
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:10.900]   Stuff go down because it'll suddenly not work with other equipment on the line or sensors and for them
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:13.700]   it's not just
[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:17.140]   For up until about now their risk analysis has always been
[01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:23.700]   Well, I can't patch because I can't afford the potential downtime without support from my vendors
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:26.260]   you know and now they're like
[01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:28.820]   Do I take the downtime?
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:33.540]   Do I run the risk of having downtime because of petra or do I win the risk of downtime because of patches?
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:38.260]   So it's it's not as simple in every situation as saying patch or crap
[01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:43.300]   Yeah, I know there are companies that are stockpiling bitcoin
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:46.260]   So that when they do get bit
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:49.860]   They have something to pay the ransom with now. I have to point out
[01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:52.420]   that petcha
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:55.940]   At least the main variant of petcha in order to pay the ransom
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:59.940]   You had to use an email address to a german email company
[01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:03.860]   And then the hacker would then send you the thing the german email company
[01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:09.380]   Close that account. So pay all you want you're never going to get unencrypted
[01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:12.340]   so
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:16.020]   I don't know Stacy you tell me out of business or patch your machines
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:22.180]   Well, I mean like but literally up until probably last year for a lot of companies
[01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:25.860]   Their risk analysis was very different
[01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:30.820]   Right, so his famous Sony's famous for that. So see Sony said oh yeah, it's too expensive
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:36.820]   We understand we're just going to absorb the and and I have a feeling that they might change their tune after what happened
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:43.140]   And then the next thing is not all of these places like hospitals. I talked to hospital sizeos and
[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:45.860]   most hospitals one
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:50.420]   HIPAA requires you have some sort of IT administrator. I know they can't do it. No, I know they can't do it
[01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:52.980]   They're IT administrators like a nurse
[01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:56.980]   Well, and they even small little faces if they update they have to recertify
[01:45:56.980 --> 01:45:59.780]   And so they can't just update all the time
[01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:02.900]   So there's that and then there's also
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:07.460]   Equipment is still being built in specked out for like 15 years. I I
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:14.500]   Oh, it's it's really scary. I mean like no. No, it's just there's no obvious answer to this. That's why I'm feeling so dystopian today
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:20.820]   But we can do it. Okay. I know that I am super positive, but I it's Stacy the riveter
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:25.380]   But Stacy here's the here's the optimist
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:28.500]   Here's the problem. You can solve the technical problems
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:34.340]   You can't solve the psych psychological so you can and this is what was exciting about the industrial thing
[01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:37.220]   And this is where I think it gets really interesting. So
[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:42.660]   Their mindset is very different than the IT world. I talked to this guy and he he was like
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:48.500]   If your guys on the factory floor see a faulty ladder, they know what to do
[01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:50.900]   But do they know what to do?
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:55.940]   In the case of you know in that case it was a u.s. Uh empty usb drive
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:58.500]   We have to train people. I agree. That's good
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:01.300]   I'm going to be in psychology
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:03.220]   Well, and I know that
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:09.460]   You know, yes people are always going to be con and people are always your weakest link, but there are actually once you
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:13.540]   Recognize that and start thinking that you can train against it
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:20.100]   And that you can build kind of some sort of wall around people and I don't mean an actual wall or even a software wall, but
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:28.100]   Right now we think about cyber security and it vulnerabilities almost entirely as
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:30.340]   technical
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:34.340]   And we need to be thinking of them as humans and we'll google doing this a little bit
[01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:36.740]   But and that's one narrow slice of it
[01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:42.660]   But remember that these attacks also attack the power grid. They also distribute fake news
[01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:48.740]   They also attack election results. So it's more than just say train the the worker to understand what to do
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:54.980]   This is the problem is that these state actors are willing to act in a scale unprecedented
[01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:58.500]   Here's an article from bleeping computer quoting a trend micro story
[01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:01.140]   Uh, this is a website
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:07.780]   Uh, and there are a number of these there underground fake news marketplaces. This one's in russian
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:10.020]   and
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:14.260]   At these websites customers can purchase services ranging from discrediting journalists
[01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:22.900]   To promoting street protests from stuffing online polls to main manipulating a decisive course of action such as election
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:25.940]   For a mere 400 000
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:28.820]   Which is nothing
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:35.540]   To a country let alone I mean a billion like a billion george sorrows could do this you can completely
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:38.180]   undermine
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:44.500]   An election so please allow me to read from the nato from a russian paper quoted in the nato
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:46.420]   handbook
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:53.700]   Quote the main aim of information psychological conflict is regime changed by the means of influence on mass consciousness of the population
[01:48:53.700 --> 01:49:01.060]   Directing people so that the population of the victim country is induced to support the aggressor acting against its own interests
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:03.540]   Subsound familiar. Oh
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:05.700]   It says here too. Another paper says
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:11.300]   Information has become the same kind of weapon as a missile a bomb and so on
[01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:17.620]   But it allows you to use a very small amount of energy or matter to begin monitoring control processes
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:22.020]   Whose matter and energy parameters are many orders of magnitude larger?
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:27.140]   So that's kind of my point which is yes, it's it's attacking a hospital with malware and ransomware
[01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:29.780]   But it's also a lot of other activities
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:36.580]   And if you look at the ukraine read this article, I know you both did i'm saying to the audience read this article in a cover story of wired
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:41.460]   Because it's kind of not this one the cover story of wired by greenburg
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:43.940]   um, it's kind of
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:46.660]   Well, it's chilling
[01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:52.980]   It's it's all about how this russian stuff is chilling. Yes. Yeah, andy greenberg and so you have a state actor
[01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:55.860]   And there's probably more than one but we can at least pinpoint russia
[01:49:55.860 --> 01:49:58.500]   that has the will and the means
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:49:59.940]   to
[01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:02.100]   Destroy a country in this case ukraine
[01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:10.180]   Uh, and and and frankly, I don't even I think they're holding holding back. I think they're pulling their punches because a lot of this is just a test tube
[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:15.780]   For something they don't want to they don't want to reveal all everything they can do because what they're really interested
[01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:19.220]   It is is making sure all these weapons work and at some point
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:21.940]   I suspect
[01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:23.940]   They will apply these for real
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:28.580]   On mass and we are very we are completely unprepared for this
[01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:34.100]   Yeah, and the furthermore we have an administration that is terrified of
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:37.300]   Making its own election
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:39.940]   Uh
[01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:41.460]   You know
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:47.220]   Suspect and so they don't want to they don't want to confront this well this whole this whole fake news house of mirrors
[01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:54.900]   One last quote at the highest level I say in my post they attack truth quote multiple untruths not necessarily consistent
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:51:02.980]   Are in part designed to undermine trust in the existence of objective truth says may can I say we knew this was happening six months ago
[01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:04.740]   Yes, we did
[01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:11.060]   We knew this was happening everybody knew this was happening the obama administration knew it was happening and they were caught between a rock and a hard place because
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:14.260]   They didn't want to look like they were influencing the election
[01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:18.020]   So they didn't really do anything
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:20.660]   Even though we knew it was happening
[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:22.900]   so are the fundamental beliefs in
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:28.020]   Truth democracy the american way are being undermined and so stacey
[01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:33.940]   That's my only point about psychology that even if you if you make everybody clean about how to deal with usb drives
[01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:36.500]   they go home and watch the
[01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:38.740]   news or the twitter feed of
[01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:41.700]   leaders or whatever or or bots
[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:43.220]   um
[01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:48.340]   Influencing media the other thing about the the data society showed is how something starts in hn and bubbles up
[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:52.660]   to info wars and bubbles up to bright part and bubbles up to fox news then cnn
[01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:56.340]   n-fline says oh well everybody's talking about so we have to cover this and the bad guys
[01:51:56.340 --> 01:52:02.740]   Have one in setting the agenda the rander report says the bad guys have a huge advantage because it's a lot faster
[01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:09.060]   To make up stuff that is true report stuff. So they set the agenda. They get out there faster. Get more volume
[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:15.460]   That same fear that you have that you're talking about on the fake news front and i'm not saying that it's not
[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:22.580]   It is a legitimate concern, but and it's faster now, but I don't think it's different. We've had that same
[01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:24.900]   I mean in a sense. That's how we've gotten to
[01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:30.420]   Great acceptance of like gay marriage for example or even civil rights. Although
[01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:34.980]   Apparently a lot of people apparently aren't really big on that but
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:39.300]   These sorts of things
[01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:42.500]   Happen both for positive and for negative things and right now
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:46.100]   We're very focused on this because it's been used to detract a lot
[01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:48.420]   And I think the key
[01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:53.620]   Isn't to say holy cow we're living in a dystopia. It's to say holy cow. This is happening
[01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:56.180]   We have made the world better before
[01:52:56.180 --> 01:53:03.940]   Let's change the conversation and do that again because that's we basically maybe we don't use the tool of fake news if we can but
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:09.220]   I I guess that's that's what I'm okay. Can I vote for you for senate please?
[01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:13.460]   I would like I've considered running for office. I don't think I would win
[01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:16.260]   You'd be great. I mean well
[01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:20.580]   I but I don't know if I want to do it. You might have to service reasons. You might have to leave texas
[01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:28.020]   I think it would be more and more telling to start the conversation in texas. That's exactly right. I agree
[01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:31.860]   And I know who's here's the good news
[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:35.860]   Google's youtube party app is available now without an invitation
[01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:42.580]   Everything's fine pay no attention to those negative nannies on that twig show
[01:53:42.580 --> 01:53:47.620]   Have a party with uptime the youtube social viewing app
[01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:51.780]   I feel like that's this show is schizophrenic in this regard
[01:53:51.780 --> 01:54:02.820]   But that's but you know what this is the world we're in and this and this network not just this show
[01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:05.060]   but this whole network kind of
[01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:09.300]   Is that's what this network has become about somehow a twit has become about?
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:15.060]   Technology at first it was isn't it great. Look how it's changing the world for the better then it was like oh crap
[01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:21.300]   Something actually that's cool for using technology for transparency
[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:24.020]   In changing the world possibly for the better
[01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:25.460]   um
[01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:29.220]   iOS 11 if you're playing with the beta versions they they're
[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:34.500]   It's showing you when apps are using your location. Yeah, well, it's done
[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:37.380]   For a while. No, no, it's oh it does. I don't have an iPhone so I did yeah
[01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:41.300]   In fact, Apple's been really at least Apple pays lip service
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:46.900]   And I would say that probably sincere in it and very good about privacy and for a long time when a application
[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:53.220]   Uses your location. It will periodically iOS will say hey just so you know Facebook's in using your
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:56.580]   Location information. Do you want it to continue to do so?
[01:54:56.580 --> 01:55:01.220]   Now most people are going to say yes because there's a benefit to that
[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:05.780]   But it's but if we're an app, you know that you didn't think needed that you know snapchat now
[01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:07.780]   We'll show you where your friends are at all times
[01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:10.820]   Yeah
[01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:14.820]   That was that was the famous gawker the gawker stalker map right
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:21.780]   Right or or uber's god mode god view well in that case it was just uber knowing where you wasn't your friends
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:23.780]   It was just uber. Yeah
[01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:30.980]   Well, this says it's it's actively using your location is what the bar says. Yeah, not just when it's using like do they may I have to look at on
[01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:32.580]   My iOS 11 device here
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:36.500]   But they may now give you a list of apps that are actively using it right now
[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:43.220]   But they've always warned you and there is a setting that's you can retract permissions. So uh, I have to say
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:49.460]   My here's my it's pretty clear that apple would be a better choice if you're worried about security and privacy
[01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:57.300]   It is recommended for journalists. Yeah, I'd be better. I've an iPhone but I also think it's not immediately it's what we don't know is
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:02.020]   It's not perfect either. We know there are hacks and exploits
[01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:07.140]   We also know that apple has a lot of the information that you know apple doesn't play this up
[01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:12.980]   But they can see everything if if they were required to submit it for instance by a government on your iCloud
[01:56:12.980 --> 01:56:15.620]   They can see the content of your messages. So
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:23.940]   I mean, I don't I think I think there's a major risk in carrying a smartphone of any
[01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:26.740]   brand
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:31.060]   But again then a risk of what happened to this is where the harm discussion has to occur
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:34.500]   No, and I'm not worried about companies. I'm not worried about google or facebook at this point
[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:38.420]   I'm worried about governments, but even then why are they gonna target?
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:44.980]   Joe schmoe with a with an Android phone on the street. That's so that's just a version of what jeff of the if you're not doing anything wrong
[01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:50.900]   Why would you care? Yeah? No, no, no, I don't think no, I think it's it's it's it's no. It's this is risk management
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:53.780]   If you if you are
[01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:58.740]   A politician you have a high risk if you're a bus driver. What's your risk?
[01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:03.380]   That's the bus driver. It's important. So keep your head down and everything will be fine
[01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:06.020]   But whatever you do don't appear on a podcast about it
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:10.900]   Yeah, that's what people tell women. They're like just keep your head down and don't don't
[01:57:10.900 --> 01:57:16.260]   I'm digging myself a hole here, which I don't think I should sorry
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:21.060]   I don't know what it sounds like, but I'm trying to say something different
[01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:23.860]   I think that we have to because because here's the risk
[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:27.780]   We could damn near shut down the whole internet because all the bad things that could happen
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:34.180]   Companies and governments go through risk management. So will individuals need to go through some level of risk management
[01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:36.020]   um
[01:57:36.020 --> 01:57:41.860]   As they make decisions about who to share what with and why and what could happen and the risks vary it's all in front of
[01:57:41.860 --> 01:57:48.500]   Okay. Yes, and I think and that's true and I think people don't understand those trade-offs as well as they should
[01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:50.980]   but I also think they're driven by
[01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:55.940]   uh, they're they're they don't have the same information that a government or
[01:57:55.940 --> 01:58:00.420]   a more sophisticated person like that's why I'm pro transparency
[01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:05.940]   Agree agree and I also agree with you very much. They see that that we need a conversation
[01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:09.380]   And we should be talking about this in a positive way to say what can we do about it?
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:11.060]   And we will figure it out
[01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:14.100]   There's gonna be some damage between and some bad lessons between here and there
[01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:18.180]   By the way, Stacy, I think you're right. I think there is in fact a new feature in iOS 11
[01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:24.340]   This blue bar. That's what you were talking about. Uh-huh. That says this is using your application or using your location right now
[01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:25.620]   Okay
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:29.620]   But I'm I'm always willing to be wrong and apple stuff because I do not use it day to day
[01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:32.580]   Yeah, so apple has done all the things I mentioned
[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:37.780]   But now they're going to put a blue status bar when an app is using your location while running in the background
[01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:41.620]   Which is kind of cool because then you can be like
[01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:45.780]   Wait, why why is this maybe you'll start deleting more apps? I don't know
[01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:53.780]   Yeah, well, it's certainly be nice to know if you know, uh, an app that doesn't for any obvious reason need to know where you are does that
[01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:56.900]   Mm-hmm. Here's an interesting use of twitter
[01:58:56.900 --> 01:59:05.060]   Petja payments somebody set up a twitter bot that watches payments to the bitcoin account tied to the petja malware
[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:08.180]   Jeez the depressing thing is erancy
[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:12.980]   The pressing thing it's only received 45 payments totaling $10,000 so far
[01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:16.820]   So why is that depressing because it's causing a?
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:22.500]   Untold millions of dollars if not going to dollars and damage and the in the hackers are
[01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:28.020]   Making any money, but this happened this happened with one a cry as well
[01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:30.820]   If you're maybe
[01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:35.620]   Your valuable data not on your machines, but at aws or at google
[01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:39.060]   How much at risk
[01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:42.260]   You know and you had and you had to rebuild everybody's pc
[01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:49.540]   But if you had if you got a discipline about storing the data off those machines and elsewhere, how much at risk are you for an attack like this?
[01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:55.940]   Well your service providers could become the risk specter
[01:59:55.940 --> 02:00:03.300]   Well, let's say, you know, you use carbon either. I have a I have a synology NAS and I back up everything separately there and I mean
[02:00:03.300 --> 02:00:09.060]   The problem is that petja and others don't merely delete your data or encrypt your data
[02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:12.900]   They also bring your whole network to its knee. It can't you can't continue to use the computers
[02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:16.980]   So it's not the individual machines. It's the whole network the whole network and that's why merce
[02:00:16.980 --> 02:00:20.740]   I mean merce is the is it massive Danish?
[02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:23.780]   containers shipping company
[02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:26.340]   uh, they
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:30.420]   Literally shut down their operations all over the world
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:33.460]   Because their terminals
[02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:37.860]   Were infected and they could not do anything now. I'm sure they have i'm sure
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:40.660]   backup skalor
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:45.220]   But they I mean that this is a this has been three or four days now
[02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:48.820]   This is can you imagine by the way this echoes
[02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:55.540]   Not just to the company merce but all the companies who are waiting for deliveries from merce containers and all the companies that use
[02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:59.700]   You know merce all the just in time supply chains are gonna be
[02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:02.900]   Yeah
[02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:05.220]   This is why the nintendo switch is hard to get no
[02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:08.100]   well, yeah, yeah
[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:10.580]   so um
[02:01:10.580 --> 02:01:13.220]   And yeah, and they're all of this for ten thousand dollars
[02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:20.740]   But it is in a sense that's I mean if if they're doing it for profit this shows that it's a crappy profit maker
[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:28.180]   Yay, if you're doing it though to just piss people off and show how stupid everyone is which is kind of i'm of the opinion now that most of the
[02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:30.340]   The wanna cry and pet you were government
[02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:37.140]   Spont state hacking and that the economic motivations a lot easier deal with the goal is disruption
[02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:44.100]   Not Bitcoin and the bitcoin is just uh, you know a mcguffin however. I have no evidence for that but
[02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:47.860]   Uh, these are really these are very well written
[02:01:47.860 --> 02:01:56.020]   Tools, I mean they're they're quite impressive in there in their scope. They look a lot like the tools written by state sponsored hacking
[02:01:56.020 --> 02:02:00.020]   Uh, we think wanna cry was north korea
[02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:04.740]   And we don't know I would guess this was russia
[02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:10.900]   Because it came out of the ukraine out of ukraine. I keep seeing the ukraine. Hey, you were at vidcon jeff
[02:02:10.900 --> 02:02:13.620]   We're gonna wrap it up. We've been going on for a long time, but I just wanted it
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:18.580]   It looked like a another you last year you came back all energized. Yeah, and I am again
[02:02:18.580 --> 02:02:20.580]   It's such a good conference
[02:02:20.580 --> 02:02:24.260]   And and and the brothers the green brothers are just the best
[02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:32.100]   uh, you have to spend a little time with them and uh, they just put on the culture that that matters so there was a lot of discussion about politics
[02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:34.100]   um
[02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:36.980]   the youtube uh keynote which is usually a big deal
[02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:41.700]   This time Susan wajiski was interviewed on stage and there are a few things to reveal there
[02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:43.540]   um
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:46.420]   Facebook was much more of a presence than before
[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:52.580]   Um, straight out sponsor and doing a lot of things and they care about video and fidget emo was interviewed yet again on stage
[02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:55.220]   Uh jack konty
[02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:57.620]   Uh did some proper victory laps for how well?
[02:02:57.620 --> 02:03:00.100]   patreon is doing
[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:02.660]   Um, talked with hank green on stage. Uh, so you guys
[02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:07.380]   Jack's the greatest there's a lot of fun. I finally got to meet natalie and tell her over the fan
[02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:12.980]   Oh man. I love they've been we've had them play perform for us. Yeah, because they're they're from the area
[02:03:12.980 --> 02:03:15.460]   Yeah, they're just they're just great people
[02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:18.020]   Pomplamoose was the was the band
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:24.180]   Yeah, but then jack realized how hard it was to make money as a youtube sensation. He created patreon to support and foster
[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:26.740]   Uh creators and it's been a huge success
[02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:31.140]   They were thinking about jack startup versus other kinds of startups is he did it to solve a problem. He did it
[02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:39.140]   It's own problem and that a fellow creators. Yeah, um, so yeah, the come was great and and uh hats off to them
[02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:41.780]   Another good program. I think I think there was
[02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:48.500]   28 000 people this this year something like that. Did you go to the um try guys evolution of viral video?
[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:52.100]   So no I just get to well you can watch it on youtube
[02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:58.500]   It's actually pretty funny. I'll just play a little bit, but it's it's kind of all the biggest viral videos
[02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:01.860]   Over the last 20 years starting
[02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:06.100]   It's really fun starting with the dancing baby, but this is
[02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:09.060]   This is like a rocha
[02:04:09.060 --> 02:04:17.860]   YouTube stars will do anything just use right
[02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:24.340]   I thought this was this is pretty fun. I watched it
[02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:29.300]   But listen to the crowd war. This is like a rocha. Oh, yeah, this is
[02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:34.100]   It's their childhood man and the other thing that's showing up is
[02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:37.060]   when you see the audience
[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:39.060]   every single person in the audience
[02:04:39.060 --> 02:04:44.740]   Is videoing this on their camera phone as if I don't know what they're gonna create their own youtube
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:47.060]   watch this
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:50.500]   Peanut by the jelly time
[02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:52.500]   I
[02:04:52.500 --> 02:05:01.540]   This is actually
[02:05:01.540 --> 02:05:04.180]   Pretty impressive
[02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:09.940]   I'll show this to my daughter so she can see what she missed. Well, yeah, I think you'd have to be like this is probably for the
[02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:12.420]   Late 20 something. I don't know
[02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:16.340]   I certainly recognize all of it, but uh, although
[02:05:16.900 --> 02:05:20.580]   I will say my daughter knew about VidCon and the scary jealous Jeff
[02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:28.900]   What is the age group? What is the age group at VidCon? It feels like it's uh predominantly teenage girls
[02:05:28.900 --> 02:05:33.220]   It is predominantly teenage girls. My daughter is 20. She still enjoys it. The problem was she
[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:38.340]   They needed a way to get my college age to people together, but I'd say it goes from
[02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:41.060]   Listen, there were 10 year olds who want to be there
[02:05:41.060 --> 02:05:43.620]   I'd say it goes from teenage
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:49.380]   1314 up through about 24 and this screaming audience though is screaming for videos
[02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:51.300]   that were
[02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:53.300]   that were big
[02:05:53.300 --> 02:05:58.580]   Like 10 15 years ago, so they've got to
[02:05:58.580 --> 02:06:03.380]   I ran into one couple than I am
[02:06:03.380 --> 02:06:06.980]   That's what they said. Yeah, we started coming three years ago because you brought our kid
[02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:10.100]   But it doesn't come anymore, but we do. Isn't that funny
[02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:13.700]   there's um
[02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:15.220]   I like photos
[02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:19.300]   You know and then I look at uh what apple did with uh planet of the apps
[02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:24.580]   Which is the most I think critics agree and you must have to put on your tv critic hat once again Jeff Darvus
[02:06:24.580 --> 02:06:28.100]   the most god awful television show ever created
[02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:31.060]   unfortunately, they're nine more still to come
[02:06:31.060 --> 02:06:36.660]   And I look at facebook say we're going to spend hundreds of millions of the dollars on uh
[02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:40.740]   Fiction and nonfiction short form and long form
[02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:43.940]   I look at what the hundreds of millions youtube has spent
[02:06:43.940 --> 02:06:45.300]   Yep
[02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:48.100]   And they all want to be netflix they all want to be amazon
[02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:51.060]   apple has hired some sony
[02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:53.140]   But that's not the power of well
[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:57.700]   So so I I am on others urged the industry track to do one of those great panels
[02:06:57.700 --> 02:07:00.980]   They used to do a webtoon over they have a panel of teenagers just talking about their media
[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:04.340]   And so that's a great idea just to know what the young
[02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:07.540]   It's a great. It's always always a good panel always fascinating
[02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:10.740]   And if you're willing to listen to them enough and shut up as adults
[02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:14.340]   Um, what was interesting was they all youtube youtube youtube
[02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:16.260]   um
[02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:18.660]   But uh not so much snapchat
[02:07:18.660 --> 02:07:20.020]   Netflix
[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:21.540]   And amazon didn't youtube
[02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:27.860]   Did you learn though that it was a mistake to put a lot of like make pewdiepie be a hollywood style celebrity
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:32.980]   That these that these youtube videos succeed because of their kind of underground nature
[02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:35.540]   I think so. Yes
[02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:39.220]   Yes, and yet now you see apple and facebook going down that same path
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:45.300]   I think it's I don't I think they don't understand they're trying to recreate mass media and listen if you get a hit in mass media
[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:50.020]   It's a great business thing, but the risk is high you get a virus hit on youtube. There's nothing
[02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:55.060]   What's so great about walking around vidcon is you walking around the the first floor, which is the fan floor
[02:07:55.060 --> 02:07:57.860]   In the expo and some you know geeky
[02:07:57.860 --> 02:08:03.460]   15 year old comes walking along you have no idea who that is and suddenly that person is just mobbed by screaming people
[02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:06.420]   When i told i explained to my daughter what it was like for me
[02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:11.300]   I go to a dld conference in munich every year when it's the same time as the german oscars
[02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:17.060]   That's in the same hotel and so I see all these people who are wildly famous in germany and I have no fenite who they are
[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:19.540]   That's what it is for me at vidcon
[02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:27.140]   Right and there's all these people who are stars complete stars to a to a small but rabid people and by the way leo
[02:08:27.140 --> 02:08:32.500]   You've got a recognition I get on the floor of vidcon because of this show and because of your network
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:38.340]   And the adoration to you and the adoration to the twitter network is is wonderful. Oh, I should go next time
[02:08:38.340 --> 02:08:42.900]   I could use some adoration you should go send send me i'll bring my daughter
[02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:47.220]   Well, sir, so do you're is your daughter would love to go wouldn't she?
[02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:53.620]   Oh god. Yes. Yeah, why don't we why don't we do a panel next year? Why don't we do a panel next year that says god dammit?
[02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:55.700]   Podcasts were not invented yesterday
[02:08:55.700 --> 02:09:01.140]   And go to some of the revenue growth in podcast. Did you see that stat? I think I tweeted it
[02:09:01.140 --> 02:09:03.380]   I feel like I feel like um
[02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:09.220]   Old media when I go to places like that. I don't get it at all. I just feel old
[02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:11.620]   I was because they're you sure you don't just feel old
[02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:15.700]   Let's talk about the revenue growth in podcasts
[02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:19.060]   Uh, this was podcast breakthrough year
[02:09:19.060 --> 02:09:21.700]   whoa
[02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:26.340]   Podcast breakthrough year. I don't know. Where did you find that stat? I would like to see that stat
[02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:28.900]   Let me find it
[02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:31.940]   revenue growth for podcasting
[02:09:31.940 --> 02:09:34.660]   Oh, here's the iab study
[02:09:34.660 --> 02:09:38.660]   podcast. Maybe it was i don't like the iab by the way because they're trying to impose
[02:09:38.660 --> 02:09:40.340]   This is iab
[02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:42.180]   All media rules
[02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:48.020]   On new media advertising we have to advertisers all many advertisers now come to us
[02:09:48.020 --> 02:09:53.860]   Trying to get a iab generated contract and we have to explain to them. No, that's not how we do business
[02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:55.940]   That's how the iab thinks we should do business
[02:09:56.980 --> 02:10:00.900]   Yes, this is an iab study. Oh, and it was actually from june of last year
[02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:03.060]   Yeah, so let's see if their predictions measured up
[02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:09.700]   Forecast for this year 220 million dollars. This doesn't seem like much given the billions that are spent in mainstream media
[02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:15.780]   Yeah, this was purely like hey podcasts. You can make money's. I don't know where they get their numbers
[02:10:15.780 --> 02:10:17.220]   I don't know. You know
[02:10:17.220 --> 02:10:21.860]   We finally realized oh we really need to become members very expensive to become a member of the iab
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:23.060]   No
[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:26.980]   Normal podcaster can become a member right what it was at 50 000 and
[02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:28.900]   10 000
[02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:31.860]   And a fraction of your did they did they want a percentage?
[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:35.060]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, did they want a percentage of our revenue as well
[02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:38.420]   That's if you get bigger
[02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:43.860]   But we did but we decided at least to her credit decided we but we need to be heard with these with this group
[02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:47.780]   So she participated in uh some feedback to them in this in this survey
[02:10:49.380 --> 02:10:55.140]   Oh, you participate in this advertising revenue study. So this includes our numbers. Well, no wonder those numbers are so good
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:11:03.460]   I was gonna say I started my show in 2016. So clearly there you clearly are adding to this big pile of
[02:11:03.460 --> 02:11:09.780]   Dollars I need to go to my other podcast boyfriend in about five minutes. You have another podcast
[02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:14.660]   He has a better date. He has nilled across the test. Oh that guy. Well, let's do our picks of the week after this word
[02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:19.940]   From rocket mortgage rocket mortgage is the future of mortgage lending
[02:11:19.940 --> 02:11:25.940]   They were you know the rocket mortgage realized quick and loans realized that the mortgage experience wasn't keeping up with the times
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:30.340]   It was old fashioned. So they created a product just for you and me the modern
[02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:32.980]   Internet user you could do the whole thing online
[02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:40.500]   They created partnerships with financial institutions. So you don't even have to go get your paperwork. You can submit it with a touch of a finger
[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:48.900]   And because it's all computerized they can they can based on your income your assets or credit analyze all the home loan options for you in seconds
[02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:54.500]   And find the run that's just right for you. So it literally the turnaround on a loan approval is minutes minutes
[02:11:54.500 --> 02:12:00.260]   I compare that to what I do at least and I when we bought our house three years ago. It took more than a month
[02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:06.020]   This is so much better rocket mortgage by quick and loans apply simply
[02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:09.300]   Understand fully mortgage confidently
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:18.100]   Rocket mortgage comm slash twig equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access dot org number 30
[02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:21.460]   30 from quick and loans rocket mortgage comm
[02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:25.780]   Slash twig and we thank them for making this show
[02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:31.700]   Possible jeff Jarvis give us a number then i'll let you go to talk to that niel degrasse tyson guy
[02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:33.620]   him
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:34.500]   path
[02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:35.940]   um
[02:12:35.940 --> 02:12:37.940]   So my number is 180
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:45.540]   At the vidcon youtube announced the support of a new format of vr 180 which is basically half of vr
[02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:48.260]   And they're going to have some new cameras coming out
[02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:54.900]   Uh, which are more stereoscopic in the old sense of two lenses and that's why i wondered whether when i saw all about android
[02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:59.060]   i wondered about the two two cameras on the back of the um
[02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:02.820]   No, five not the no five the whenever what's the new one?
[02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:10.900]   Anyway, the pixel xl no no the no no no the the the one plus five one plus five thank you and
[02:13:10.900 --> 02:13:16.660]   Uh, but i've long said that 360 doesn't make as much sense as 180 because 180 is like
[02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:19.700]   You know watching a stage or watching a show or watching in tennis
[02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:24.580]   You know you can look back and forth and put your attention in multiple places without having to absolutely turn around
[02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:27.220]   And not face who you're talking to which is kind of ridiculous
[02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:29.700]   Right
[02:13:29.700 --> 02:13:36.820]   And and so i think the 180 for it's i think this whole notion of 360 vr is starting to be brought down to reality
[02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:42.020]   First by ar first by what facebook did at f8 and then google followed saying now, you know, i've always got a camera
[02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:44.900]   We can add a art of that it's a lot easier than all this stuff on your face
[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:49.300]   And same with 180. Yeah, we can show you something and you can move around in it
[02:13:49.300 --> 02:13:55.460]   But you don't have to do this whole immersive thing and turn around and and and and and get on a swivel chair in life
[02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:58.980]   So i found that that interesting that and one other number from
[02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:06.340]   Susan wojcis talk is that they now serve 1.5 billion logged in viewers on youtube every month
[02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:09.220]   And the world thought they were fools to buy it
[02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:13.380]   On air i guess it's hard to believe on average
[02:14:13.380 --> 02:14:20.100]   Our viewers spend over an hour of day watching youtube on mobile devices alone one hour a day
[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:24.740]   That's just average that's incredible to me. Yeah, it's hard to imagine how that's true
[02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:31.300]   But i did make when i was on my vacation i had one of those gear 360 cameras and i made a bunch of 360 degree videos
[02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:32.660]   This is a
[02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:37.860]   Tour of the galapagos you're on the zodiac boat with me and i watch this one this is fun
[02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:41.460]   So i do think that there i mean i agree with you that 360 that's me
[02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:46.820]   360 you know has some it's unique challenges but for experiential
[02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:52.340]   Yes, i mean this is pretty amazing that you can you know before a concert a show a one eight
[02:14:53.060 --> 02:14:57.940]   Is one eight he's gonna be plenty for for seeing what you see which is giving you some more choice
[02:14:57.940 --> 02:15:00.260]   180 is gonna be pretty amazing
[02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:04.180]   Yeah, and so i think it's a very smart kind of down to earth way to look at this
[02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:09.220]   So those are my numbers very good jeff go speak to your buddy i'm gonna go and see my new friend all right
[02:15:09.220 --> 02:15:12.100]   All right, jeff is good to be back i'm so i remember
[02:15:12.100 --> 02:15:15.220]   We love everyone with all of them are you gonna be here next week?
[02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:18.020]   Yes, yes. Yes, see you then see you then
[02:15:18.420 --> 02:15:21.780]   Stacey you're pick of the week. I think we should both pick the amazon
[02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:26.580]   Show i'm picking the show because this is pretty oppressive
[02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:28.980]   Yeah, well it's fun
[02:15:28.980 --> 02:15:33.140]   i'm gonna talk to me next week after i've used it and people have called me and i'll see
[02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:40.420]   I like look first of all. I like the the screens on it are really pretty these images. It's like a um
[02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:43.300]   You know, I what was that chubby?
[02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:49.940]   Oh, it is like chubby so wait i want to do something because i pulled in a an image from what's app to this thing
[02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:54.100]   um i pulled in an image that was taken on my camera phone
[02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:58.820]   And so and it didn't go all the way across so i actually wanted to pull in a new image
[02:15:58.820 --> 02:16:01.780]   Because I thought it was weird and if I wanted to use it as a camera
[02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:07.140]   It was not gonna work well so interesting so you are able to take images from the the echo
[02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:12.340]   And put it on other thing. How do you how do you do a screen shaser? There's you do it by voice
[02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:15.700]   I did not find a screenshot. I guess you try screen shooting it. I
[02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:19.220]   all tried this but
[02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:21.300]   This is uh, this is
[02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:25.300]   Qualitatively a different device. I mean this is kind of amazing
[02:16:25.300 --> 02:16:28.820]   Well, there's things you can do. I mean like being able to look at your
[02:16:28.820 --> 02:16:33.380]   Security camera and I haven't done the august i haven't done the skill yet
[02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:36.100]   But I could be able to show you from this right now
[02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:39.700]   Outside my door from my doorbell. It's kind of a right here
[02:16:41.380 --> 02:16:45.220]   Um, so that's pretty cool. We'll review it in more detail on
