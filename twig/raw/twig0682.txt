[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.500]   The show we cover the latest news from the Google first and everywhere else.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.500]   Stacey, love to see Stacey Igabotham in her black jumpsuit.
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.500]   Or is it maybe?
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.500]   Is it maybe?
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.500]   It's black.
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.500]   Yeah, and you've got a little Marcel Herdu going.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.500]   You look like you should be working in a factory in 1943, France.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500]   That's me.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   Welcome.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.500]   I bet she's in the Resistance, kids.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.500]   Stacey is at Stacey at IoT on IoT.com.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500]   Stacey on IoT.com.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   She also hosts the IoT podcast.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.500]   And I have some questions for her about helium.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.500]   We'll get to that in just a little bit.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.500]   Can you have that helium router?
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.500]   Yes, I do.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.500]   I've got possible answers.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500]   Keep going.
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   When we were in Seattle, I thought, gosh, if I were to sail by Bainbridge Island, I could
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   use Stacey's helium.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   If you were on a cruise ship, you could have used my helium.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   I know.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   I watched those ships go by and they're within range.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.500]   I know.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.500]   I was trying, but it wasn't labeled like Stacey's helium or anything.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   So next time.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.500]   No, it has a fancy name.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   It's like Foktra, adobo.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.500]   I should have found out ahead of time.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   All right.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   Oh, well, next time.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.500]   And there will be a next time.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.500]   I'm sailing by Bainbridge Island.
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   Also with us, ladies and gentlemen, somebody Pat Sejak hates.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   We're going to add that.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.500]   I have to write that.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   Write that in on the list here.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.500]   I put that on the list.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:28.620]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, the Leonard Tower Professor for journalistic innovation at the New Mark Graduate
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.500]   School of Journalism at the City University of New York, hello, Mr. J.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.500]   Hello, hello, hello.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.500]   Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, also Anthony.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.500]   What is here from Hop Hands on Photography.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.500]   Hello.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.500]   Did you just give me up your nose of the rubber hose salute?
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.500]   No, I think you did.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   What is that?
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.500]   Is that what this means?
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.500]   Well, all I remember is in the darkest hour, which is a wonderful movie with, uh, is it
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.500]   Gary Sinise as a Winston Churchill, whoever it is, uh, is Winston Churchill.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.500]   Initially Churchill does this as the V for victory sign with his, with his fist facing
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.500]   out and my, and his secretary says, Mr. Churchill.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.500]   Oh, wow.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.500]   That doesn't mean what you think it does.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.500]   And, uh, that's why he turned it around, uh, and, and made it his own.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   Um, anyway, I just like this salute.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.500]   The two fingers salute.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.500]   I just like this salute.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.500]   People I respect.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.500]   That's all.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.500]   I just salute the people I respect.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.500]   It's fine to do what you did.
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.500]   Like the Cub Scouts salute.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   Just don't do this.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.500]   Just don't go all the way around.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.500]   It's used in Poland.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.500]   Do you have like a, uh, like a hand salute dictionary?
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.500]   You just look that up and I'm with the media.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.500]   Oh, it's all.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.500]   This is the call the internet.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   I'm sure you, by this point you probably turned it off because you discussed it with.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.500]   I hate the internet, but I am happy.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.500]   This stuff I learned on twig.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.500]   It's a brief.
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   As a framework owner to hear that Google, so last week we had the bad news that Google,
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   and this was still a rumor from the words, but a rumor only.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.500]   That the Google was abandoning the pixel book that had been moving quite far along with.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.500]   But now news from framework that they're going to make a Chromebook in partnership with Google,
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.500]   the framework laptop Chromebook edition.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.500]   I framework I am a fan of very much so.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.500]   I have a framework laptop that I really like.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.500]   The whole proposition, the value prop framework is it's completely upgradable.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.500]   In fact, they lived up to their promise.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.500]   I have a 11th gen Intel processor in mind, but I could buy the upgrade.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.500]   Do it yourself to a 12th gen.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.500]   What does that cost?
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.500]   819 bucks.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.500]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.500]   So you're doing.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   Well, you get a whole new motherboard, but the fact that you could even buy a motherboard
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.500]   with an laptop with an upgradeable motherboard is mind-bogging.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.500]   You can upgrade everything in this laptop.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.500]   And that's why I like them.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   They are right to repair times 10 and surprisingly a very good lightweight, very nice laptop.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.500]   8 pounds the Chromebook.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.500]   So for them to offer a Chromebook, I think is fascinating.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.500]   There is Kevin Tofel wrote it up and about Chromebooks.com.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:15.500]   You brought that to my attention and said, and it's true if you order it, that they say
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.500]   at this time we have no plans for motherboard upgrades.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.500]   It comes with an i5, not cheap.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.500]   It's a thousand bucks.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.500]   8 gigs of memory, 250 gigs of storage, Wi-Fi 6E.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.500]   You can though add not only external customizations as with all framework laptops, but you could
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.500]   put more storage in it because you use standard storage.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.500]   You can even put more RAM in it because you use a standard RAM.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:44.500]   But can I upgrade my CPU later on the FAQ says we haven't announced any plans for a newer
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   Chrome OS compatible main board at this time.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.500]   It doesn't mean they're not going to do it, but that's something to be.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.500]   It seems like there'd be no point in doing a framework Chromebook if you couldn't upgrade
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.500]   it.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.500]   So this would be the first time you've ever been able to buy a Chromebook that you could put
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.500]   more horsepower on and down the road.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.500]   Not on the rear, at least.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.500]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   Now Intel, of course, you can change bezels.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.500]   I don't get that.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.500]   Yeah, that's all frameworks.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.500]   The front bezel, you can get it in orange.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.500]   Oh, no, that's it.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   I would like it in orange.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.500]   Yeah, see?
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.500]   I love orange.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.500]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.500]   So I'm very happy with my framework.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.900]   If you go to the marketplace, I've bought a number of different modules for it and so
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.900]   forth.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.980]   You can also, when people complained that the hinge was a little loose by an upgraded
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.340]   hinge, you can get these little expansion cards ranging in price.
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.500]   I got the terabyte expansion card because it's got USB-C.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.340]   You can see they do have quite a few upgrades, not just for the motherboard.
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:50.380]   If you go to i5, 12th gen, it's 538, the one I quoted was 12th gen i7.
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.780]   But you can also upgrade the existing capacity.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.780]   It uses standard memory cards.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.340]   Yeah, it uses standard memory cards.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.900]   It's got 8 gigs on.
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.180]   Yeah, but you can put for 80 bucks, you could put 16 in.
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.340]   So that's not bad.
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.420]   And by the way, you don't have to buy it from framework.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.700]   These are standard SO DIMMs.
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.180]   So you can same thing with M.2 storage.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.940]   So it's very, I love these framework.
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.460]   I'm very, very happy with it.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.460]   These little t-shirts?
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.460]   Problems to report.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.460]   Yes.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.460]   Do they sell them in orange?
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.260]   Let me find you a bezel.
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.940]   I did say I would bezel it.
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:26.940]   Yeah, there's the orange.
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.460]   They have great black gray and orange.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.100]   And this is magnetic.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.300]   So it's actually really easy to snap.
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.260]   They're so fun.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.260]   I'm a...
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.180]   It is kind of a Clemson orange, not a UT orange.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.180]   Yes.
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.180]   Look at that.
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.180]   That's all right.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.420]   I'm down for the Clemson orange.
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.420]   That's the best orange.
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.260]   I'm at Orsster on the framework.
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.380]   And yes, they do have merch.
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.620]   I'm sorry, Ant.
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.620]   You had a real question.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.620]   You had a question.
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.620]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:59.260]   Mr. Lefor, is it safe to say that already additional horsepower that's being offered
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.580]   up for these Chromebooks is pretty much just for the developer community?
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.100]   Because I thought Chrome OS was pretty efficient as an operating system.
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:11.500]   Why would it need all of this extra horsepower for the average person?
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.500]   Ask Mr. Jarvis.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.500]   What am I?
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.500]   Chop Lefor?
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.500]   What?
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.500]   But again, I do a work here.
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.500]   Dr. Ruhuut, I need the best.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.380]   What, you're opening up a text editor in what?
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.340]   You probably opened a huge...
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.380]   All you're running ever is Chrome.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.380]   It's a...
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.380]   Right, I want to run it's Chrome, but I'm...
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.660]   Which is by the way, Chrome is no lightweight.
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.380]   No, it's not.
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.460]   Chrome is a pretty big power in like energy, or memory.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.260]   Google has always sold i7s for its Pixelbooks, right?
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.900]   We have i7s.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.260]   This is an i5 from framework at $9.99.
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.980]   That's certainly more than enough.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:54.340]   Most Chromebooks, as you mentioned, have scant RAM, and they usually have crap processors.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.020]   Well, two RAM is too little.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.020]   Definitely.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.020]   I know.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.020]   They sell them with four.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.020]   Yeah, they sell them with four.
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.020]   They sell them with four.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.020]   I think it's an eight as I was like some little.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.020]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.020]   Eight's plenty, I would say.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.020]   Yeah.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.020]   But you could put more in.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.460]   This means you can do more tabs open or something like that.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.460]   Chrome is not like...
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.980]   I know people who have literally hundreds of tabs open.
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.940]   And you can put Linux on this.
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:16.940]   So...
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.300]   That's why Kevin loves it.
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.300]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.300]   And so you can absolutely...
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.940]   Yeah, but even with that, that's...
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:22.940]   Lean OS, lean...
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.740]   Well, I mean, again, you can put Linux and run caden live and do video editing.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.980]   So there's a lot of...
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.980]   You could...
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.980]   Okay.
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:31.980]   Yeah, it depends what you want.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.980]   You're right.
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.260]   That's more developer-y focused than his normal person.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.380]   You probably...probably nobody needs a $1000 Chromebook.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.380]   But if you want one...
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.380]   That's been my...
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.380]   That's been my point all these days.
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:47.980]   Yes, I would love to have the ideal $500, $600 Chromebook.
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.380]   But I've never found it.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.700]   And by buying the high end, I get an excellent machine.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.260]   They get an excellent keyboard.
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.180]   I get an excellent screen.
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.780]   I get the whole Macgilla.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.780]   That's what I'm buying is...
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.620]   Don't forget the build here as well.
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.620]   Right.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.780]   I just think this is really a smart move on Google's part.
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:13.900]   If they're not going to offer a high-end Chromebook, go with a company that can and make it upgradeable.
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.900]   That's pretty cool.
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.780]   What's unclear, and I'm sure Kevin will do some research on this and we'll find out, is
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.020]   what it takes to make this motherboard Chrome OS certified.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.620]   I don't know.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.180]   I think you have to have the developer switch, right?
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.500]   That you can put it in developer mode?
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.100]   I don't know.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.100]   It doesn't mention any specific modifications.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:39.860]   It's interesting they offer an i5, not an i7, but i5 is certainly more than anything.
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:44.580]   For a Chromebook, even though Ant is going to look down his nose at me, I will say that
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.580]   at an i5 display.
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:50.460]   I'm just saying, if you've been in $1,000, put it on a better machine.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.460]   Put that toward the better machine.
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.460]   What?
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.460]   Get windows with it?
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.460]   No thank you very much.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.460]   I just said a better machine.
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.220]   You'll get stuck with the Apple prison?
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.220]   No thank you very much.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.220]   You can put Linux.
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:05.360]   In fact, I run a manjaro Linux and my framework runs great fingerprint reader works, track
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.420]   pad works, everything works, cameras work.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.060]   It's a good choice for Windows or Linux or now Chrome OS.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.140]   It's to you for mentioning Kaiden lives, sir.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.140]   It's a good program, isn't it?
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.820]   It's a for your video editing ever.
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.300]   I've played with it over to you.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.300]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.340]   That's our top story just for you, Jeff.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.340]   Yes, thank you.
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.460]   It makes me feel better after my morning last week.
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.900]   I can blow out my candle.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.900]   Oh, happy birthday.
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.180]   By the way, happy birthday.
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.180]   No, happy birthday.
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.780]   No, no, okay.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.780]   Never mind.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.260]   Where did that come from?
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.660]   I thought it was your birthday because you had a good time.
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.220]   I'm having old enough as is.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.380]   You're trying to make me get older?
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.900]   No, birthday was a while ago.
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:45.900]   That's right.
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.900]   Okay.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:47.900]   Never mind.
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.020]   What are you doing to me?
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.540]   They will have I believe they will be talking about this tomorrow on Tech News Weekly with
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:03.100]   Micah and Jason, a big study from Mozilla found that YouTube's dislike and not interested
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:07.460]   buttons barely do anything.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:12.660]   You're still going to get recommended, Nazi porn, no matter what, right?
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:18.220]   Using video recommendations data from more than 20,000 YouTube users, Mozilla researchers
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:26.220]   found buttons like not interested, thumbs down, dislike, stop recommending channel,
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:33.420]   remove from watch history are largely ineffective at preventing similar content from being
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.420]   recommended.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.780]   It sounds like the crosswalk button.
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.380]   It's placebo button.
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.380]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:46.540]   Even at their best, these buttons still allow through more than half the recommendations similar
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.260]   to what a user said they didn't want.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.260]   At their worst, the buttons hardly made a dent.
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:58.980]   Well, we don't know how these services are using it in their own general recommendation
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.980]   algorithms.
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.580]   It may not affect you personally, but it may be better data for them at a higher level.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.220]   So this is like do not show this again.
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.220]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.220]   Like, can I just say that doesn't work?
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:15.620]   Like Google really thinks that I care about Leonardo DiCaprio and I do not.
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.620]   You really should.
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.380]   Can I just say you really, really should?
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.660]   I have told Google so many times I have stopped clicking.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:28.020]   Like Leonardo DiCaprio could invent a brand new semiconductor or like discover a whole
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.820]   new band of spectrum.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.980]   And I would not click on that article just to avoid confusing.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.980]   Wow.
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.980]   All right.
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:35.980]   I'm going to go to Casey Neistat's.
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.180]   We're moving back to New York City.
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.180]   I am going to say.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.820]   Two weeks in a row of Casey.
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:41.820]   Dislike.
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:42.820]   Nice that making.
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.820]   What do you mean to him?
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.100]   I wanted to pick something that I didn't mind.
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.100]   What else can I do besides this thumbs down?
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.500]   I can say that's all I've ever done.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.180]   Can you say don't don't don't recommend this anymore?
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.940]   Don't apparently there are ways to do that.
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.460]   Unfortunately, I'm already subscribed to the channel.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.460]   So that would explain.
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.540]   It's not going to work.
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.540]   Never mind.
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.100]   Forget I said anything.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.100]   Sorry.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.100]   I see.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.860]   All I see is report show transcripts.
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.620]   No, I love Casey.
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.620]   I'm just.
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.780]   You know, I don't see any way to say don't show me this anymore.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:20.940]   Let's see what Google is going to try to show me on basic YouTube.
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:21.940]   I'm trying.
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:22.940]   Best by the way.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:23.940]   It's by a slot.
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.740]   Do you do you of course it's that time of year autumn begins tomorrow.
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.020]   Stacy, do you pay for YouTube premium?
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.580]   No, I wish I would stop asking me.
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.580]   I do.
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.660]   So how many pre-roll videos do you get?
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:45.900]   I have heard from people that is as many as five to 10 unskippable ads.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.740]   No, it's painful.
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.300]   No, I don't get that many.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.260]   Maybe they just have given up on you.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:59.580]   I know because I get sometimes I get to, but it has to be like I get to if I have like
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:05.580]   a SNL clip or something that's like, I think hot ones if I if I watch hot ones sometimes
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.580]   I get.
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.260]   But like I'm on a rowing workout right now.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.260]   I don't have any ads.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.100]   Yeah, I mean, you have to be something that's monetized.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.180]   Try a you can try one of the two.
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:18.340]   Try hot ones or you want to be good or try one of the two ones.
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.660]   I mean, I'm in hearing I know I've been reading on Reddit and other places.
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.140]   It really has gone out of control five to 10 on.
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.140]   All right.
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.140]   Okay, count the point.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.180]   Well, I just went to say I'm on premium.
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.180]   So I don't know.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.700]   Yeah, but I went to to incognito and you can do the same thing.
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.820]   I got one of two.
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.820]   I'm not too bad.
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.820]   And the one is skippable.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:41.820]   Oh, okay.
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.420]   I just got it one skippable.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.420]   Okay.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.340]   So you got up to two ads on one of them skippable.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.340]   Huh?
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.700]   Let me try something I could try to it.
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.220]   I don't think I've ever watched.
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.660]   So apparently you now thank you scooter X in our chat room.
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.100]   YouTube says it was an experiment.
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.420]   Yeah, I got two.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.100]   So YouTube says it has concluded.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.100]   It explains it.
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:16.140]   A nice statement to 95 Google YouTube says it has concluded this test over the past month
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.140]   or two.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.380]   Some YouTube viewers have noted advertisements on the platform have been expanding greatly
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:28.420]   in length and quantity, especially in unskippable formats.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:34.140]   And they confirm the same that I saw, which is threads on Reddit show ads with as many
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.860]   as 10 ads in a row that can't be skipped.
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.900]   It isn't happening to everybody or to all videos.
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.020]   The good news, the ads aren't super long.
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:48.020]   YouTube spokesman has confirmed these are expanded quote ad pods.
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:53.900]   That was an ad pod you were watching was part of a small experiment that has since concluded.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:58.580]   At YouTube, we're focused on helping brands connect with audiences around the world.
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:04.860]   We're always testing new ways to surface ads that enhance the viewer experience.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.700]   How does an ad ever enhance the user experience?
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:16.140]   We were at a small, expereable globally that sometimes I really need insurance products
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.180]   and howdy.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:23.380]   We were at a small experiment globally that served multiple ads in an ad pod when viewers
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.300]   watched longer videos on connected TVs.
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.140]   Oh, you'd have to watch in the TV.
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:33.260]   The goal was to build a better experience for viewers by reducing ad breaks.
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.620]   We're going to put them all up front, make you watch them.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.380]   And then you did that for some of their shows.
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:45.220]   They do not all of them, but in they asked you, you could be like, do you want to watch
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.580]   one long ad or like have it up?
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.780]   And I'd be like, Oh, one log ad.
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.580]   Then you go get snacks.
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.180]   So here's my question.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.740]   Are they cynical or stupid?
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.980]   The ones on YouTube are pretty show category.
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:07.260]   So they really think that this is about improving the viewer experience.
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:14.220]   No, they say you know, YouTube reiterates that a user experience is about a creator's
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.220]   to be a top priority.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:21.900]   I mean, if you're going to give someone ads, maybe you care about how they're done.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.380]   I mean, it's yes, that's what they're saying.
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.140]   Instead of interrupting the show, we're just going to force you to watch all the ads at
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.140]   the beginning.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.180]   Now, if I'm the creator, I don't like that because don't you think that drives people
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.180]   away?
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.180]   They go, right.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.660]   They're not going to consume your content because they're like, well, good grief.
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.460]   You haven't gotten to the content yet with my show me all of these ads.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:45.260]   They say, Hey, some, some viewers say that about just the intros to videos.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.900]   They say the intros too long.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.900]   So if you want to know, God, you're so long hit the button.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:51.900]   I know, I know.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.900]   I know.
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:53.900]   I'm like, Oh, a little bit.
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.780]   We're going to tell you something you wanted to know.
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.540]   But first let me talk some more about other stuff.
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.660]   Of course, we do that too.
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.940]   But we know you're stuck here for three hours.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.420]   So just.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.380]   I mean, we do ads.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.420]   Look, I'm not against ads.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.180]   I'm not against ads.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.860]   We do give people the right to pay for no ads as does YouTube.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.860]   Yeah.
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.380]   But I don't kid myself that this, that the ads are in some way.
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.100]   You benefit to the user experience.
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.980]   I mean, that's just it's the price you pay for content.
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.260]   You have to pay for content.
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.020]   The price you pay for free content.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.020]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.020]   Yeah.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.460]   It is, it would be cynical of me to say.
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:40.020]   So maybe I'm cynical, not stupid, but I just feel like that for them to lay it on.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.940]   Oh, we're trying to improve your experience.
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.340]   I find that a little disingenuous.
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:52.660]   I wonder what their results were when they rolled this test out to people like, I don't
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.100]   know if they stopped this spot.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.660]   As soon as anybody noticed, they stopped it.
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.180]   And remember, because you said it was just on connected TV.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.060]   So it wouldn't have been on your mobile device.
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.340]   It was watching YouTube on a TV, which I do a lot more and more.
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:05.340]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.340]   Well, right now, ideally you'll see two pre roll ads.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.900]   Ideally, that's livable.
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.300]   That's not that's usable.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.500]   So what are I guarantee you what they were doing is testing.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.300]   Well, how many can we get away with?
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.300]   Right.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.300]   How long were they?
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.300]   Yes.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.300]   Were they 10 second ads?
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.300]   They say they were short.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.300]   I don't know how short.
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.860]   That's what that's what they're experimenting with is would be if you take the same two minutes
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:30.140]   and cram in more advertisers, will that affect people?
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.700]   And also let's face it.
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.580]   How many how often do you see come ons for YouTube premium Stacy?
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.260]   That's their real goal, right?
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.420]   Like every time.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.420]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.420]   That's a point.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.420]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.420]   Irritate you so much.
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.420]   Please.
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.420]   Just please.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:49.420]   I need to have a Jeff Jarvis moment.
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.820]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.820]   You said irritation and Jeff Jarvis in the same sense.
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:54.820]   It's coming.
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:55.820]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:56.820]   I'm worried.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:01.620]   Let me slide back here and I can join these two monitors together.
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:06.420]   I guess that's too much trouble.
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.420]   Go ahead.
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.420]   Jeff Jarvis moment.
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.420]   Here we go.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:14.620]   Speaking of like constantly inundating you with do you want this?
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:15.620]   Okay.
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:21.060]   The New York Times, a subscription which I pay for is constantly asking me, hey, this is
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.060]   better than the app.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.060]   Wouldn't you like to download the app?
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.340]   And I'm like, no, I hate that.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.340]   I hate that.
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.300]   It is constant.
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.340]   There are ad blockers that will prevent that.
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.340]   It's hard on mobile, I think.
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.500]   Yeah, I've got it.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.420]   It's only on mobile that I'm doing this, but it's driving me bonkers and I do.
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.420]   I feel very Jeff.
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.900]   I'm like, how many times can we really annoy people, especially paying customers?
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.900]   It's rude.
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:50.900]   I've not seen it yet, but Mr. Michael Sargent has said something similar about Zoom.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.140]   He pays forward the service.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:56.620]   I pay for a service, but he says he's getting an ad every time he opens it up.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.620]   I'm like, what?
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.780]   I'm not paying your $15 a month.
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.700]   What's the point of an ad showing up on that?
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.860]   But Stacy's talking about the far more annoying thing and I see it all the time when you open
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.020]   something in a web page, it says, you know, you really should be using our app and that
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.620]   takes over the top and says, you should be using the red ad app.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.420]   You should be using the Zoom app.
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.180]   I find that I agree with you, Stacy.
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.380]   That's almost as that's probably worse than an ad.
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.940]   It's like, no, I don't.
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:23.940]   Yeah.
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:24.940]   I'm trying to look at you.
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.220]   There's the only reason they want that is more data from me.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.220]   That's the only reason.
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.220]   Very good point.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.380]   That's a good reason to be mad.
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:31.380]   Yes.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.380]   Because they already got your subscription.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.340]   Yeah, I'm giving you money.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.340]   Stop.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.460]   And you're already getting my IP data.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.380]   You're getting plenty of data, New York Times.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.980]   You know who I am.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:41.980]   You know, got my login.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:42.980]   Twitter doesn't do it.
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:47.260]   We got to let people know there's a, I think this really needs, the word needs to go forth.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:53.020]   That the most valuable thing for companies to be an app on your front page of your phone.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:58.620]   That is just by itself hugely valuable to the point where they don't mind annoying you
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.300]   endlessly to get you to do it.
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.420]   People just install apps willy nilly.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.620]   Leave them on, let them run, give them permissions.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.020]   You're handing over tons of stuff.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.620]   Anyway, back to it.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.660]   You just put the tweet from Michael Sargent out about Zoom.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.900]   See, I haven't seen this.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.900]   He put it in the app.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:21.900]   I just went to Zoom and I didn't see it.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.900]   But.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.620]   Does he see it in the app or does he see it on the web?
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.620]   It says, Hey, Zoom.
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.060]   I pay you every month for Zoom Pro.
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.820]   Why am I getting these from you after every single?
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.540]   Don't zoom alone.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.700]   Invite friends to save 30.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.100]   Don't try to give you money, Mike.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.180]   Don't zoom alone.
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.580]   That's actually kind of like, Oh, you poor thing.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:41.580]   Yeah, Mike.
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.300]   Are you making calls to yourself?
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.300]   Is that why?
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.220]   You the only person with the fax machine and your friend group.
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.620]   Actually, it's a good deal though.
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:55.300]   They get 30% off their first year and you get a $20 Amazon gift card.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.420]   Oh my God, I'm not giving them any free money.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.860]   Although if you want to go to Micah and refer a friend.
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.140]   I have never seen this.
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.540]   I've never seen that either.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.420]   We have a Twitter account.
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.220]   So everybody it twits using.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.740]   Micah, if you're using your personal Zoom account, why don't you start using our Twitter
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:14.740]   account?
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:15.740]   You can have this.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.700]   Why don't we get all the viewers to line up and make Micah money.
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.460]   Make Micah money.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.300]   Micah, everybody sign up with Micah.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.300]   Oh, they also say, here's another one he gets.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.340]   First of all, don't zoom alone.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.900]   Then broaden your reach for a limited time.
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.060]   Save 50% off your first four months of a large meaning 500 out of that plan.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.540]   We already know he's zooming alone.
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.540]   Why would you ask?
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.540]   That just hurts.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.540]   You narrow minded Micah.
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.540]   That's just hurtful.
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:49.540]   If you only had 500 friends, we could get you a deal.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:50.540]   Just hurt.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.540]   That's just hurtful.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.460]   Oh, there's a whole bunch of them.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.740]   Micah's got just a range of these.
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.900]   Just with your audience for a limited time, save 50% on your first four months.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:01.900]   He's alone.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:02.900]   No, he has an audience.
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:08.380]   Oh, then he's getting the magical automatic support from Zoom.
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:14.860]   Oh, thanks for the info, Micah.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:15.940]   Are you there, Zoom?
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:16.940]   It's me, Micah.
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.220]   Oh, you're funny, Micah.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.660]   You Micah, just be used.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.180]   We have a few extra seats, I think, on our Zoom account.
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.180]   You could use alerts.
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.460]   There's your own email and all that stuff.
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.340]   Do you pay for slack, by the way?
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.340]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.340]   I used to.
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.740]   I don't pay for that one.
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.180]   I just pay for that.
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.180]   You don't have to.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.180]   We pay for yours.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.180]   No, it's fine.
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.180]   I can...
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.180]   Hey, I'll write it off, Dean.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.180]   No, but we...
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.180]   No, no, no, no.
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.180]   No, no, no.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.180]   You're not actually not spending anybody.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.180]   Yeah, well, I guess you might be slacking with other companies.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.180]   But they...
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.180]   No, I'm slacking with strips.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:54.660]   I think you said your family has a slack.
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.660]   Yeah, my slack is the family's slack.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.660]   Oh.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.660]   Yeah, but you can...
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:02.460]   We used to have a giga-ohm slack, and we all chipped in to keep our slack go in, like,
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.820]   the former giga-ohm reporters.
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:08.540]   We stopped after a while, but it was...
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.620]   So, can you use the free tier for your family?
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.620]   You probably can.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.620]   For slack?
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.620]   Yeah.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.620]   It's perfectly fine.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.220]   It's not going to keep everything, but I don't need it to keep everything.
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.700]   I just need it to pay one out.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.420]   That's what you give up is somebody to make sure to keep the dogs.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.660]   They see it, you know?
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.660]   Discord's free.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:26.660]   Right?
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.660]   Oh, boy.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.220]   There's a lot of free solutions, but it's hard to get a family to move once you've got
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.900]   them using something, right?
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:33.900]   I like slack.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:39.660]   I thought about Discord, but I thought Discord would be a bit much for this family.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:40.660]   You should be able to...
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.100]   How old was the oldest member of your family on the slack?
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.260]   Say again?
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.900]   How old was the oldest member of your family on the slack?
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.900]   That would be me.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.140]   Oh, so it's not like grandpa level.
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.140]   Okay.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.140]   I said...
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.140]   No.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.740]   But everybody's not necessarily technically savvy.
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:59.740]   Grandpa level.
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:00.740]   In the Pruitt house.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.740]   It's grandpa level, you know?
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.140]   Well, the one that was Leo and Jeff level, yeah.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.980]   Who's grandpa here?
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:07.980]   Really?
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.340]   Let's be frank.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.340]   Let's be...
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.620]   Oh, is Frank your grandpa?
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.780]   Yeah.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:15.780]   Grandpa Frank.
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.780]   Grandpa Frank.
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.780]   So, by the way, slack.
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.780]   So this is an interest.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:21.780]   We kind of...
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.060]   We're starting to talk about this on Windows Weekly.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.220]   But in their brothers, adding an office suite.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.380]   Slack is adding an office suite.
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:32.060]   Canva is adding an office suite.
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.060]   Everybody is...
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.700]   So Google's got one.
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.700]   There's Zoho office.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.780]   Of course, Microsoft office.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.660]   And now a slack wants to...
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.460]   So you don't ever have to leave.
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.300]   What?
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.660]   I think this...
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.060]   You know what's really going on?
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.380]   Is this goes back to the...
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.460]   Did we talk about Figma on last week?
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.460]   I guess it did...
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.460]   No, it just happened.
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.460]   It just happened.
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.460]   Yeah, we talked about it on...
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.460]   Twit.
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:01.460]   So, I think this is...
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:06.460]   So the story with Figma, Figma, which is a collaborative design tool.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.460]   Really cool.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.460]   Invented by a guy who took the Peter Teal money.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.460]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.460]   Remember that?
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.460]   Peter Teal about five, six years ago.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.460]   Said, "I don't like college.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.460]   You should drop out of college.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.460]   In fact, I'll give you $100,000 to drop out of college."
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.460]   I don't know why I make him sound like Colonel Sanders.
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.460]   He's stronger.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.460]   He's stronger.
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.460]   And get...
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.460]   It's too much fun.
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.460]   I'm more like this, I guess.
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:32.460]   Yeah, and give me a...
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.460]   Anyway, so this...
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.460]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.460]   I have never heard him speak.
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.460]   I have never heard him speak.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.460]   I have neither, but my mind.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.460]   He's more like a bar.
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:46.460]   Remember in the very pilot episode of Silicon Valley, there's a...
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:51.460]   I think a Peter Teal style startup guy.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.460]   He's driving a car that's so thin.
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.460]   It's a one person car and he can get through.
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:59.460]   He can get through cars.
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.460]   Oh man, that's very funny.
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.460]   It's very funny.
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:06.460]   Anyway, worth watching episode one, Silicon Valley season one.
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.460]   Where were we?
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.460]   Oh yeah, so...
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.460]   Actually, it's a really great...
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.460]   Big love.
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.460]   It's a really great story.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:17.460]   This kid grew up here in Sonoma County.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.460]   His name is Dylan...
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.460]   Oh, what's his name?
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.460]   I can't remember.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.460]   Dylan Beyer?
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.460]   Anyway, cute young guy.
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.460]   Field.
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.460]   Field.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.460]   Dylan Field.
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.460]   Took...
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.460]   Went to...
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.460]   Couldn't get into Berkeley.
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:36.460]   But he was in the computers when he was three years old, lived up the road a piece.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.460]   His parents got a computer, really got into it.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.460]   In high school, he was part of the first robotics project, where Mike...
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.460]   Right, really got into that.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.460]   So he started to love technology, but his grades weren't so good.
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.460]   Couldn't get into Cal.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.460]   Somehow he got into Brown.
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.460]   I don't know how...
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.460]   Which is...
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.460]   Which is...
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.460]   It's really hard.
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.460]   Even harder.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.460]   I don't know.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.460]   But he couldn't get into UC Berkeley, but he got into Brown.
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.460]   Went to Brown for three years.
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.460]   Peter Thiel says...
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:02.460]   I give you $100,000 to stop going to college.
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.460]   So he does.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:07.460]   His first dream, his first startup...
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:14.460]   ...was a drone company designed to spot reckless drivers, so they could give him a ticket.
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.460]   Kind of flopped.
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.460]   So then Dylan says...
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.460]   Different.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:20.460]   What else?
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.460]   A good effort.
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:25.460]   He and his buddy decided to start a collaborative design company.
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:30.460]   This is in 2012.
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.460]   They kind of struggled along for a while.
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.460]   Eventually they did raise money.
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:39.460]   I think they raised a little bit of money four years ago.
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:45.660]   Wall Street Journal talked about the fact that he was still living in the mission buying
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:51.860]   dollar coffee on his way to work for a Wall Street Journal-ing kind of detail.
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.580]   The company itself was above a bar.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:59.300]   And it got so noisy after 3 p.m. on Fridays they all just went home early because they
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.300]   couldn't get any work done.
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.460]   So it's just a typical little startup.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:10.740]   Raised some money, then raised a little bit more money, finally got up to evaluation of
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.580]   about $10 billion, which is not bad.
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:18.740]   Adobe announced this week they're going to buy Figma for $20 billion.
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.540]   Biggest deal in Adobe history.
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:26.940]   One of the biggest internet deals of all time, $20 billion.
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:33.540]   A lot of money for a company that only has annual recurring revenue of $400 million.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.980]   It's due to the mass.
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:39.940]   That means it will take about 20 years.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.020]   No, not that long.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.580]   They're making $1 billion every four years.
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:49.580]   So it'll take them 80 years to make all the money back.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.860]   No, that's not right.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.540]   That's at that current rate.
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.540]   Well, you have to assume they're going to do more.
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.540]   But more importantly Adobe, I think felt like their lunch was getting eaten.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.660]   Adobe has a competing product at Adobe XD that wasn't competing.
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.020]   And I think it was, they were, there was a threat, right?
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:12.060]   So Adobe, which only has income of around $4 or $5 billion a year, is going to give them
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.220]   half cash, half stock with regulatory approval.
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.100]   Mr. Dylan Field will join the three comma.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.300]   Describe Figma's more.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.940]   Well, let's go there.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.580]   We can look at it and they can describe it for themselves.
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:31.220]   The collaborative interface design tool.
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:38.260]   When this news dropped, I was surprised because I was like, who is the competition in Canva
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.260]   Club Twit?
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.260]   Sketch, Lucid Charts.
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.260]   Lucid Charts.
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.260]   Or competitor.
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:49.060]   Canva, by the way, just announced they're going to add, as I go in complete full circle,
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.460]   the same things likes doing.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.140]   They're going to add docs.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.380]   They're going to become office suite.
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:34:01.140]   Basically, we're all trying to figure out how to collaborate best remotely and using
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.420]   the internet without just using words.
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:05.460]   And that's because we're a visual.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.340]   I mean, this all makes sense.
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.460]   You've got to make it.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.820]   You've got to have everything, right?
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:17.500]   You've got to have words, video, instant feedback, a way to produce something that looks slick.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.740]   AI, 5G, quantum.
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:23.260]   But yeah, I-
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.660]   Blockchain, you got to have the blockchain.
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:26.660]   Oh my God.
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:27.660]   You got to complete.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:28.660]   All stored on the blockchain.
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:29.660]   NFTs.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:34.460]   So, Adobe stock, of course, tumbled as soon as they made this announcement.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.180]   But the folks at Figma are pretty happy.
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:42.300]   Yeah, I think, and of course, because some of this is COVID, right?
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.420]   Because suddenly we're not working at the office anymore.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.740]   Is it just office or is it a wider sense of my machine?
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.140]   I think it's a lot of gig workers.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.540]   I think gig workers really like.
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.540]   Okay.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.020]   My child actually used Figma and Kean.
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.020]   Really?
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:03.420]   I prefer Canva over -- no, they prefer Figma over Canva.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.420]   They hate Canva.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.520]   Everyone's kind of solidified on Canva at their school.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.520]   So.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.980]   I think all these companies use a core group project, Stacey.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:20.980]   Group projects, they actually laid out an entire magazine in Canva, which ugh.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.500]   But yeah.
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.500]   How old is --
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.500]   It is --
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.500]   It is part of you by daughter.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.500]   No, no, like I am.
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.500]   Don't you know how to do it?
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.500]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.900]   I was just like, oh my gosh.
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.860]   I had some horrifying CMSs in my life, but tiered lord.
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:34.860]   Did you play with it?
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.300]   Is it terrible?
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.060]   It's not for magazine layout.
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.060]   Yeah.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.140]   I mean, it's fine.
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.220]   Like I've made a slideshow of presentation.
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:49.500]   Is it like a whiteboard maybe more or -- oh, it's like a presentation manager more.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.500]   Yeah.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:54.020]   I think of it as for presentations, but you can do lots of stuff with it.
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:59.620]   I mean, my child is now using it to make Instagram posts of like inspirational quotes
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:00.620]   for a job.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.620]   Right.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.620]   I think that's my real question.
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.620]   That's not my question.
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:04.620]   It's a huge job.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.620]   Yeah.
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:06.620]   But that's the thing.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.620]   Adobe already has a product beyond XD called Adobe Express.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:15.220]   That does a lot of the same stuff that Canva is doing.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.420]   And it's pretty good.
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.220]   It's -- well, that's the problem.
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:20.220]   Pretty good.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.620]   XD, on the other hand, I believe that's where they were falling apart.
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.820]   And getting their lunch eaten, in my opinion.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:27.820]   Yeah.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.820]   Well, look at that.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.820]   I just made a diagram.
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.020]   I was just that easy.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.020]   Let's see.
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.140]   But let's change it to the twig diagram.
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.340]   And they give you fonts and everything.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.340]   This is Canva.
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.820]   Ooh, do the Stacy and Jeff overlap.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.820]   Yeah, let's do it.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:44.820]   Irritation.
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.820]   Stacy.
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.820]   Hey!
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:47.820]   Hey!
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:48.820]   Jeff.
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.220]   I would like Jeff to have on his side, Morl Panick.
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:54.420]   My side should be nuance, and we should talk about this.
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.820]   In the middle, Irrit came to ask.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.620]   Yeah, you got it Stacy.
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.620]   Very self-aware.
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:04.620]   Chickenhead21 in the chat says, "Adobias like Autodesk.
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.620]   They buy up all of their competition."
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:07.620]   There.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:08.620]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.620]   Or like Facebook.
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:11.620]   And what is Jeff's?
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:12.620]   Morl Panick.
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.700]   You had to ask.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.620]   And what's the overlap?
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:19.620]   Irritated about apps.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.620]   You, Leo.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:21.620]   There you go.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.620]   That's it.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.620]   I have made the twig diagram.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:26.620]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:27.620]   Where's Ant?
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.620]   We got an Ant?
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:29.620]   I don't know how to.
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:30.620]   Oh, it's your diagram, I don't know how to.
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:34.620]   It can be off on the side looking at all of us.
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:35.620]   I need to see.
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.620]   I need to see.
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:37.620]   I need to see.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.620]   I need to see that circle.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:49.620]   And then, okay, you're also irritated about me.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:53.620]   Well, then Ants Circle should also be big.
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.220]   Making bigger.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.620]   Anyway, you get the idea.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.620]   This is pretty cool.
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:03.620]   Yeah, it is nice.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.380]   And then, oh yeah, we met this.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.380]   Here we go.
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.620]   Yeah, we got it.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:12.660]   Look at that.
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:18.620]   All of our Twitter graphic design listeners are just...
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:23.620]   Who needs designers?
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:28.620]   All we need is to get our stock art from Dolly and then Poof.
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:33.620]   You won't be getting it on Getty.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.620]   Page two.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:41.620]   Getty has decided to prohibit all AI generated content.
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.620]   Why, you might ask?
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:47.620]   Because it's unclear who owns the rights to that content.
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:54.620]   Remember, stable diffusion, Dolly II and the meta, what is it?
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.620]   Metafusion.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:56.620]   Mid-journey.
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.620]   Mid-journey are all based on scraping art.
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.620]   The latter two, I don't know about Dolly.
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.620]   Goo Dolly, I think probably not, but certainly stable diffusion
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:10.620]   and mid-journey, scraping kind of public domain stuff, stuff on
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.620]   pinboard.
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:15.620]   So there's going to be some question when you generate some art.
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:19.620]   Like, well, who really owns that picture?
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.620]   So Getty says it's not worth it.
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.620]   The presence of copyrighted imagery in the training data of AI
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:29.620]   art generators is obvious from their tendency to reproduce the
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.620]   Getty Images' watermark.
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:36.620]   Here's an example from a lexica search of Donald Trump behind bars,
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:40.620]   but look, Getty Images is clearly visible.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.620]   There's the Getty watermark.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:46.620]   So Getty, I think rightly so, says, yeah.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.620]   A little dicey.
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:48.620]   A little dicey.
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:52.620]   Maybe draw it yourself.
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:56.620]   You can build it in Canva, y'all, or sorry, Figma.
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.620]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.620]   Do you own the rights to all the little doohickeys that you get
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.620]   from those design tools?
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:08.620]   Can you only do it for non-commercial?
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:11.620]   I bet you have to buy it.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.620]   If you use it commercially, you've got to buy it, right?
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.620]   Somebody's got to get paid.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.620]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.620]   Commercial purposes.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:21.620]   Well, I mean, yeah, you, I mean, we pay for, you pay for Figma
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:27.620]   and stuff based on, I think isn't it, access to certain tools?
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.620]   Oh, right.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:33.620]   Like you pay for the super editor tools, if you will.
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:34.620]   Exactly.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.620]   I was like, you can't access gifts if you don't pay $5 a month
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:39.620]   or whatever.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:44.620]   So I don't know the actual rules.
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.620]   And diagrams can only have three circles.
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.620]   That's it.
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:54.620]   Yeah, notice there was no Leo on there except for the, you know,
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.620]   the universal hate.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:56.620]   So.
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.620]   Irritation Leo, irritation.
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:02.620]   No, I was going to say, we have no comment as we love Leo,
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.620]   but you with your poor self image.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:09.620]   Oh, I said irritation over ads.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.620]   I turned it into hate.
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:15.620]   Well, I am going to irritate you a little bit more because it's time
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.620]   to talk about one of our sponsors.
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.620]   This week in Google continues with the pro at Jeff Jarvis
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:25.620]   and Stacey Iganbotham and a visit from IT Pro TV.
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.620]   These are the folks who, Lisa and I went out to see in Gainesville
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.620]   a few years ago to visit their beautiful new studios.
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:35.620]   The best possible place to get your IT training, whether you want
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:39.620]   to get your first job in IT or accelerate your career in IT.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:44.620]   IT Pro TV is not dry, dull classroom activities, not boring
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.620]   books.
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:49.620]   It's learning from experts in the field who are so passionate,
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.620]   so knowledgeable, they get you excited about what you're learning.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.620]   They call them edutators because they're fun.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.620]   They make learning engaging and fun.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:04.620]   With IT Pro TV, you're doing it on your own schedule in your own way.
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.620]   More than 5,800 hours of up-to-date IT training.
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.620]   That's why they've got those studios running Monday through
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.620]   Friday, seven studios running Monday through Friday,
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.620]   creating new content all the time because the test change,
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.620]   the questions change, the software changes, the search change,
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.620]   and so they need to keep up.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.620]   That's nice because it's super fresh, always up-to-date with the most
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:25.620]   current content.
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.620]   The episodes are 20 to 30 minutes long, which means you can watch
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.620]   them whenever it's convenient for you.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:34.620]   You can watch them wherever it's convenient for you on your desktop,
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.620]   your tablet, your mobile device.
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.620]   They support Apple TV.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.620]   They've got a Roku app too.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:43.620]   It is so easy to learn, so much fun to learn that before you know it,
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:47.620]   you will have the skills to get that cert, to get that job.
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:50.620]   It's just a great idea for IT training.
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:56.620]   It's like watching, you know, to it, only you're watching IT training
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:57.620]   the whole time.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.620]   One reviewer says it's easy to understand what they're saying.
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.620]   It's well explained.
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.620]   The classes are very smooth along with the notes and transcriptions
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:06.620]   given.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.620]   That's right, every class has a transcription so you can read along.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.620]   Great for studying, right?
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:11.620]   They give you study notes too.
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.620]   By wrapping the instructors, by wrapping their own experience in
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:18.620]   with the course, make it easier to comprehend the hardest topics,
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:19.620]   this reviewer says.
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.620]   They also make sure you feel confident enough to pass the exams.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.620]   One way they do that is with practice tests.
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.620]   So you can take the test before you take the test, know that you're
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.620]   ready, you know, or not ready and keep studying.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:31.620]   They also have virtual labs.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.620]   You don't have to have a Windows server or Windows clients to
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.620]   learn how to run a Windows network, for example.
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:41.620]   You can do it all in your HTML5 browser, which makes it really easy.
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:45.620]   Another reviewer says IT Pro TV is the best website to study IT
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:47.620]   and cybersecurity-related courses.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:51.620]   I like the part where they make a few courses free for a weekend.
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.620]   Every month they do that.
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.620]   Every month they offer multiple free webinars you can watch,
[00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.620]   you can join into, you can ask questions.
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.620]   And of course, since there are a whole bunch of them now that
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:04.620]   you haven't seen, you can see them all on demand.
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:08.620]   In fact, there's a few of them right there on the website.
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.620]   Now, IT Pro TV is great for individuals, but if you're a
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:15.620]   company with an IT team, they're great for that to check out IT Pro's
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.620]   TV's business plan.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.620]   They have some great deals and really great training.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:22.620]   Your team will love.

[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:44.620]   Thank you IT Pro TV for supporting this week and Google.

[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.620]   that way they'll know you saw it here.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:59.620]   IT Pro TV/twit and the offer code TWIT30 for 30% off.
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:03.620]   Tomorrow night, game two Thursday night football, Ant.
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:04.620]   Yes.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.620]   What do you think?
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:09.620]   It was for the first time ever, you couldn't watch it on TV.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:13.620]   You had to watch it on Amazon Prime.
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:19.620]   Amazon says it drew a record number of prime sign ups for a
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.620]   hour period.
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:22.620]   Of course.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:23.620]   I'll sign up.
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.620]   I'll just see you now.
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.620]   They paid a billion dollars a yield for this, right?
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.620]   They did a good job.
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:35.620]   I mean, they've already had NFL football before, but it was
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.620]   always on CBS at the same time, right?
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.620]   So, or NFL network.
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.620]   This is for blackout rules.
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:46.620]   So, it's like the whole rules, like if you have to pay to get it,
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.620]   I have a lot of questions about this.
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.620]   So, let me explain how the arcane blackout rules work.
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.620]   Okay.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:57.620]   You can only watch a marketing game, like, so I can watch the
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:58.620]   Niners games.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.620]   So, if the Niners game is on a Thursday night football, I will be
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:02.620]   able to watch it on broadcast.
[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:05.620]   But last week, it wasn't a Lions game.
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:08.620]   It would have been local in Detroit, but not anywhere else in
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:09.620]   the country.
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:11.620]   So, that's where you had to watch it on Amazon Prime.
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.620]   It's the same thing as Monday night football, which is still on
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.620]   TV networks.
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.620]   You can watch it everywhere.
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.620]   The only, the blackout only applies if they don't sell out all
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:22.620]   the tickets, I think.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:23.620]   Yeah.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:24.620]   Maybe that's even old school.
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:25.620]   I don't know what they do.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.620]   That's old school.
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:27.620]   They're all sold out.
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:28.620]   I'm so confused.
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.620]   So, when can I watch these games on my local?
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:33.620]   So, can I watch my local games on my local broadcast?
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:34.620]   Yes.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.620]   When the Seahawks play.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:36.620]   Correct.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:37.620]   When the Seahawks, and this is only Thursday night.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:38.620]   There's still Sunday and Monday.
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:39.620]   Right.
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:42.620]   But Thursday night football, if the Seahawks are on Thursday night
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.620]   football, you'll be able to watch it on broadcast.
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:48.620]   The rest of the country has to use Amazon Prime to get it.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:50.620]   And that's what I thought was very bold.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:54.620]   I mean, do you have Amazon Prime?
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.620]   I do.
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.620]   Does everybody have it?
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:58.620]   Is that why?
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.620]   That's the thing.
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:02.620]   It seems to be more common than we would think.
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:05.620]   Well, because they have way more than just television.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:06.620]   Right.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:10.620]   I'd be pissed though, if I were, you know, wanted to watch the
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:13.620]   game and I'm turning around on the dial and it's not on the
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.620]   phone.
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:15.620]   And I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:16.620]   I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.620]   I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:18.620]   I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:19.620]   I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:20.620]   I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:21.620]   I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.620]   I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.620]   I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.620]   I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:25.620]   I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:26.620]   I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:27.620]   I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:28.620]   I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:47.620]   I'm not sure if I'm going to watch the game.
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:49.680]   - Yeah, the game's gonna be awesome.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.620]   - So it was the Kansas City Chiefs of the Chargers.
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:53.160]   So if you were in LA or Kansas City,
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.380]   you'd watch it on broadcast.
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.600]   Scooter X says he was able to watch on TV.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:00.400]   If you're in the appropriate broadcast area.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.260]   - Right. - So 15 games.
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.080]   - He said, "Bellion dollars are game.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:06.780]   Apparently a success according to Jamory and Global Head
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.480]   of Amazon's Sport division,
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.560]   because so many people signed--
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.020]   - What the hell's it gonna say?
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.480]   - Well, I know.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.820]   This is an internal memo.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.320]   - He can say it could've been a box--
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.480]   - It's a little okay. - To what happened
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:21.680]   with direct TV over the last two weekends.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:22.840]   But no, they did a good job.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.960]   They've always done a good job with covering football.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.680]   - They got Al Michaels and Kirk Kirby
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.680]   streaming down to Evan-- - Kirk Kirby.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.520]   - Kirk Kirby. - Kirk Kirby.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.880]   - Kirk Kirby. - Kirk Kirby.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.240]   - Kirk Kirby. - Kirk Kirby.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.920]   - He did an amazing job with all of his work
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.400]   that he has to do for college football.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.560]   - It was good play by playing it.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.520]   - And it was just as prepared for the NFL side of things.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.360]   It was great.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.280]   - No, and my only beef is,
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.640]   remember I was trying to switch back to Hulu Live
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.960]   versus YouTube TV and I decided to go with YouTube TV.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.240]   - Is it on?
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.840]   - Well, YouTube TV gets a leg up in my opinion
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:59.680]   because they offer live stats while you're watching the game.
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:02.520]   You can literally just pull them up and see--
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:04.840]   - Well, Fox, I mean, Amazon says they're gonna do that too,
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.680]   right? - I do so.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.520]   - They're gonna have X-ray.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.600]   They say they're gonna have X-ray.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:08.800]   - Sure. - So X-ray.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.500]   - So you got all of that analytics.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.240]   They do ads for Amazon and other games
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.680]   talking about here, we're gonna break down this play
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.680]   using the Amazon, blah, blah, blah, whatever it's called.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.800]   It would be nice to have those additional stats in the game.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:28.920]   - Nielsen has not yet released the ratings,
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.520]   but Jay Marine in the memo said they're gonna be good.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.560]   That's when, that'll be the test, right?
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:35.480]   - To find good.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:39.120]   I wonder what it'd be like versus broadcast.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.480]   - Yeah, I just--
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.800]   - I guess I was just so different.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.080]   - It's a sign of the time.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.400]   - That's all it is. - Well, it is.
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.720]   - So he says the ratings show,
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:49.840]   Amazon's measurement shows that the audience numbers
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.680]   exceeded all of our expectations for viewership again.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.240]   - Well, that's what it's on all these sets.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.720]   - Yeah, what is that?
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.440]   - So Leo, I got a physical letter, like an old--
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.120]   The mailman, for the first time in six months,
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.040]   came and put something in our mailbox
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:03.880]   and it was from Amazon.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.440]   - That was a full of anthrax?
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.880]   (laughing)
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.840]   - That's so nice.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.600]   - I opened the strange thing from the past.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.680]   It was a physical letter from Amazon saying,
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.800]   "We noticed you haven't used your wonderful prime video
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.680]   features lately, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.160]   You might wanna recognize all the wonderful things
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.000]   on the prime video."
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.080]   - So you pay for prime video, but you have never turned it on.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.240]   - I pay for prime.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.840]   - Or they pay for prime videos.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.080]   - And they're saying to me, "Hey, Schmuck, don't forget,
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:34.240]   you wanna stay, I must be a heavy retention tool, I guess."
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.760]   - Absolutely, 'cause they keep raising their rates
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.240]   for Amazon prime, what is it, 125 bucks now?
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.320]   - I hear something like that.
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.720]   - And it used to be just second day postage.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.240]   I think that price, it wouldn't be worth it,
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.760]   but if you get all this other cool stuff maybe.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:53.080]   Lord of the Rings, which they spent half a billion dollars.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:56.520]   - One of my friends declared, I was like,
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.440]   "Hey, if you watch it, he's like,
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:01.680]   I got so sick of the finest acting that Canada can provide."
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.940]   (laughing)
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:09.320]   It's like, "Why does every town look like Vancouver?"
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:15.200]   I actually think, I have mixed feelings about it.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:19.440]   It's, anyway, 25 million people watched the first day.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:24.240]   That's a good, I think that's a good number for streaming.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.320]   It's not a great number for broadcast though.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.320]   I mean, and it's heyday.
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:28.160]   - Is it?
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:31.560]   - And Seinfeld used to get 40 million in there heyday, right?
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.280]   - I don't know.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.120]   - But that was broad.
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.760]   - Besides Jeff Jarvis.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.800]   - So I just was doing some research on this,
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:42.360]   now I gotta freaking find it on these numbers
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.240]   'cause the numbers are so far down.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.400]   It could be a minute here though, I'll find it.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.040]   - Eee.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:49.880]   - Put it dry.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.080]   - In the days when you had three networks.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.440]   - And we were even imprisoned.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:56.040]   - Yeah, and you didn't, you know,
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.000]   you had to watch what was on pretty much.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   It wasn't unheard of, I think,
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.240]   for those shows to have 40 or 50 million viewers
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.560]   back when the United States was only, you know,
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.640]   200, 250 million people.
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.480]   - Exactly.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.160]   - When cable wasn't as prominent
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:15.920]   or internet wasn't as prominent as it is now.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:20.920]   - Season five, which was the prime time of Seinfeld
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:26.400]   had a rating of 19.6, that means 19.6 of the available,
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:29.000]   percent of the available households were watching.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.160]   So that's, I mean, I'll--
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.000]   - So that's--
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.720]   - You're never gonna see that in streaming ever again,
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.560]   I don't think.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:39.160]   Oh, I think, well, also I think there has to be
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:44.160]   a different way to measure too with the binge culture nowadays.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:48.840]   - Well, it would be, yeah, 'cause like,
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:53.600]   what was it, Neil Gaiman was tweeting a lot about,
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:54.800]   like, how to get people to,
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:59.800]   how to get Netflix to re-up for the Sandman second season.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.880]   And it wasn't enough, he said, for like,
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.960]   everybody to watch it to be number one,
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.360]   for however amount of time it was,
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.240]   is like, you know, you've gotta watch it again,
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.440]   you've gotta make sure, like, it keeps growing, you can't,
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:15.160]   like, so it was kind of interesting to see kind of
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.880]   behind the scenes on how they rate things
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:20.320]   and think about re-doing things.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:22.440]   - So, Neil, I have the numbers for you.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.280]   - Yes.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.880]   - What was the number that you quoted?
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.400]   - 25 million on day one.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:31.400]   Of which, of the football of the--
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.640]   - No, that word of the rings.
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.800]   - The word of the rings, we don't have--
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:36.400]   - Okay, so here's-- - Okay, and that's global
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:37.240]   by the way-- - Right, the way,
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.480]   the US.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:43.480]   - Variety, the four major broadcast networks
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:47.000]   averaged around 20 million viewers in total across
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.640]   eight to 10 prime time or same day viewing.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.560]   But that's average. - This has fallen,
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:56.000]   this has fallen by 10 million viewers since 2015.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.040]   So it's variety. - Oh.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.160]   - So 25 is then very good.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.920]   - Is very good.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:03.480]   - Mass ain't mass no more, mate.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:07.080]   - Ryan Seacrest-- - The bestestest--
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.600]   - Rockin' either.
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.480]   - Ryan Seacrest, Rockin' Eve,
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:15.720]   19.6 million viewers last New Year's Eve.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.800]   - Well, that's because you have to watch it when it's on,
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.600]   'cause like, we talk about it like,
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.960]   but one of the issues is if you have,
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.160]   if you don't have to watch something when it's on,
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.640]   you basically, you have infinite opportunities
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.840]   so you may not watch it ever in some ways or, you know.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:35.400]   But yeah.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.760]   I think we also do more-- - Hey, how's the script for this?
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.400]   - Well, that's, yes, yes, we'll be also,
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:44.360]   so pay TV subscriptions have also fallen by 10.2 million
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.680]   cable cutters.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:48.160]   Competition for Time is getting stronger, says Variety,
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:49.520]   among not just streaming services,
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:52.640]   but also video games and social media, people.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.680]   So-- - Yeah, I mean, like tonight,
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:59.000]   instead of watching Prime Time,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.680]   I'm gonna be hanging out with my friends
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.800]   doing a gin tasting way better.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.160]   - Wow, you know what would be good--
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:05.000]   - I know you would. - When--
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.560]   - Combine that with Seinfeld,
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.000]   'cause you'll be a little tipsy.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.160]   - I find Seinfeld really annoying.
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.520]   - Yeah, the ring him.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.840]   You would.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.840]   - I would. - You would.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.360]   - How do you feel about moonlighting,
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.920]   starring the fabulous--
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:22.480]   - Former television critic.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:26.360]   - Former television critic, Jeff, something or other.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.960]   - So I wasn't old enough to watch moonlighting.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.480]   - Oh, God, moonlighting was good.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.040]   - I'm sure it was.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.160]   I just--
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.760]   - Will the-- - Gemma Crochet and Sibyl Shepherd?
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:36.680]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:37.720]   Who doesn't know that?
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.960]   - Where does jammer be with the memory sound effect?
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.220]   (laughing)
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:45.640]   ♪ The nostalgia ♪
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:50.480]   - So there's good news and bad news in the stock market.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.880]   As you know, it's been not great,
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.040]   especially for tech stocks of late.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.800]   Mark Zuckerberg, what did they say?
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:00.920]   He lost $71 billion in net worth this year.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:02.000]   - Yeah, wow.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.160]   - $71 billion.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:08.200]   - Metas market value down by more than 60%
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.560]   since the spring, but (laughing)
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.760]   during a hearing Monday on the future of a lawsuit
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.320]   brought against Meta by a group of states,
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:18.240]   Aaron Pan or the attorney representing Facebook,
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:21.440]   said sometimes facts that are good
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:24.260]   for an antitrust defense are bad for business.
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:30.320]   In other words, we're not a monopoly anymore.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.840]   Go, you know, pound sand.
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.480]   - Kick somebody else's down.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.320]   - Yeah.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:40.640]   So, you know, there's a silver lining
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.720]   to losing $71 billion.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:45.920]   Federal Trade Commission, you can just,
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.160]   it does kind of stick a pin in antitrust legislation.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.160]   - Yeah.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.000]   - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google,
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.520]   each worth more than a trillion,
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:56.000]   in Apple's case, almost double that.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.300]   Meta worth half a trillion, 500 billion.
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:02.120]   - Well, here's the other thing I wrote a post
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.720]   about the newspaper antitrust thing,
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.880]   allowing them to negotiate with the platforms.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:12.320]   And it was aimed, the legislation was written
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:14.440]   by companies that served this many people
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:15.800]   with this much market cap.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:20.800]   So, news publishers will be able to negotiate with Google
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:24.120]   and Amazon and Microsoft and Apple,
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.000]   but now Facebook, the one they all hated,
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.820]   is too small to fit under the description.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:34.960]   - I'm not, I can't say I'm sad.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:39.200]   There's still worth half a trillion dollars.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.320]   I mean, it's not like, you know,
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.800]   - But, Mark's a lighter.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.720]   - Mark's not gonna have to hunt his own meat or anything.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:47.040]   (laughs)
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.720]   - I mean, he might hunt his own meat.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.200]   (laughs)
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.040]   - He used to.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:54.040]   - I was waiting for this Mike Masnick piece
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.640]   that came out last Friday.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:01.760]   You remember the Texas social media bill,
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:05.080]   which essentially said platforms should not be able
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:08.000]   to kick anybody off.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.800]   They shouldn't be allowed to,
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:14.840]   they shouldn't be allowed to moderate that content
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.320]   for political reasons.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:20.440]   Of course, it was immediately challenged
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:22.080]   by internet service providers and others,
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:25.920]   net choice, which is a trade group in CCIA,
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:30.680]   immediately challenged it and the lower court said,
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:35.240]   "Yeah, you know, HB 20 is unconstitutional.
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:38.120]   "You can't, the government shall pass no law
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:39.200]   "bridging the freedom of speech,
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:42.720]   "including the freedom of a company to moderate its site."
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:48.360]   The judge tossed out the entire law's unconstitutional.
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:54.360]   Mike Masnick wrote a thoughtful, thorough ruling
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:58.520]   that explained why every bit of the law violated
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:00.880]   the website's First Amendment rights
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:04.800]   to put in place their own editorial policies, okay?
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.840]   So then the state of Texas appealed to the Fifth Circuit,
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.680]   which said, "Oh, no!"
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.320]   (laughs)
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.000]   - True!
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:13.880]   That's not true.
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:15.320]   And they reinstated the law.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:18.760]   First Amendment, Schmerst Amendment promised a ruling
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:21.160]   at some future date.
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.160]   And now of course,
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:26.360]   the net choice in CCIA have gone to the Supreme Court.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:29.680]   - Hell yeah.
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:32.920]   - Florida's law was found unconstitutional by the 11th Circuit.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:36.320]   So Florida's also going to the Supreme Court.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:40.080]   So it's all gonna come to the Supreme Court at some point.
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:43.840]   It'll be, "Jeff, will it be multiple cases or a single case?"
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.280]   - I don't know how that'll work.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.560]   - I think it's right now in one circuit
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:50.120]   versus another, things are enforceable in different ways.
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:50.960]   - Yeah.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.840]   - So if you wanna go be mean, go be mean in Florida,
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.680]   but or not, go be mean in Texas.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:59.160]   - In Texas and it'll have to stay up.
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.000]   - Right.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.720]   - Obviously--
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.880]   - For people who are reading it in Texas
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.440]   or just if you post it in Texas
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.480]   or if your site hosts it in Texas.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.320]   - Post?
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.280]   - See, you wanna have laws that you can actually read
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.120]   and follow?
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:13.960]   Oh, how silly.
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:16.120]   - Well, by the way, this is another law that's--
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:16.960]   - This is the theory.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:20.720]   - Facebook might have just skated under the line
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.800]   because you have to have 50 million in revenue.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.520]   I can't remember what the rule is, but Facebook--
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.360]   - Yeah.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:29.280]   - Is somewhat below that threshold.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.480]   - It's a strategy, Leo.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.560]   It's all a secret strategy. - It's strategy.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.800]   He's playing five- - Zuckerberg did all of this
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:35.960]   to get out of this regulation.
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.680]   It's very clever of him, I think.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:38.760]   - Smart.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:42.400]   - Clearly, we want social networks,
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.600]   IRC channels, forums, to be able to moderate,
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.680]   to have rules, to say this shall not pass.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.720]   We don't want this kind of speech.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.960]   I understand that for some people,
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:56.080]   if it's politically motivated,
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.720]   then they go, "Well, I should have the right to say it."
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:04.120]   In our forums, the Twitch forums,
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.040]   for a long time we had a couple of people
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.640]   that kept coming in and saying things
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.800]   that I deemed to be untrue about COVID-19,
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.000]   so I would kick them out.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.320]   Or actually, I don't think we kicked anybody out.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.560]   I think we just deleted the thread or locked the thread down.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.240]   - You always say you locked it if I remember.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.480]   - Yeah, you were in locked the thread.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.320]   - Yeah.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.000]   And a lot of that's Paul Holder,
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.560]   who spends a lot of time moderating it, thank you, Paul.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.920]   But I agreed with him, it was the right thing to do.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.160]   We have the right to do that.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.440]   We should have the right to do that.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.640]   - Absolutely.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.560]   - In Texas, we would not.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.400]   So the good news is we don't make
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.160]   50 million dollars a year.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:44.200]   So we can, the small ones can skate by.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.280]   It's really aimed at Twitter and Facebook, frankly.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.360]   And Facebook may even skate by on--
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.800]   - It's incredibly stupid, incredibly dangerous.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.840]   I worry so much about speech.
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.440]   You know, I was thinking about this the other day.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.800]   If you were, I was gonna say
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.480]   we don't burn books in this country, but we are.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.800]   That'll come soon.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.560]   People are banning them and so on.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:06.880]   - I already banned it.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:07.720]   - If you were a-- - None of the work
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.760]   that I learned.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.440]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.680]   - My fear is that nobody cares.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:15.200]   You know, we talk about it.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.320]   Mike Masnick obviously has an ulcer over it.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.440]   But I don't, have you seen this?
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:24.720]   I've never seen this in the newspaper or on the TV or--
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.880]   - The newspapers should be standing
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.680]   of all places should be standing up for speech.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.520]   - I agree. - And they're not.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.120]   Yes, you're right.
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.000]   Because they're because of the tech lash,
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.280]   because oh, the internet is as kudos
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.960]   and we're gonna be against the internet
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.080]   as opposed to saying, see the trees for the forest,
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.120]   see the millions and millions of people on the internet,
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.040]   hear their speech, understand, but those are the people,
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:50.680]   mass media always ignored and never put in their pages
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.120]   and didn't respect.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:56.400]   See, the basic theory about the internet is
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.720]   it brought out all these bad ugly people.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.000]   My theory is the opposite of this.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.360]   The internet enabled people who were never heard
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.880]   in mass media to be heard.
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.960]   And then it's the old bad ugly people
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:08.120]   who used to control speech
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.400]   who are now launching their counter-reformation.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.920]   And that's what we saw in January 6th
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.600]   and that's what we see in all this.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.720]   And it's a reaction to the speech on the internet
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.840]   not previously heard.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.320]   - I don't think that's true.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.480]   I think it's done both.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.800]   I think it gives people who haven't had a voice,
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.760]   a voice, but it definitely has given a voice
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.320]   to a lot of creepy colleagues.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:30.160]   - Of course it does.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.800]   Of course it does, it does it as well.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.440]   But I'm saying that the internet didn't create that,
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.960]   that the reaction was, it's reformation counter-reformation.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:42.000]   And we have a lot of Martin Luther's out there today
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.160]   who are saying things that people could control before
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.960]   and now that they can't be controlled,
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:50.280]   the old white male forces in the country
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.040]   are going overboard to say
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.920]   I'm gonna burn everything down rather than share it.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.360]   - Mm, I mean, I think that's some of it,
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.760]   but I think basically you just opened up,
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.000]   like you had a public square,
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.640]   but everybody who's in the public square
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.440]   knew how to dress.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.720]   And then everyone's like, you know what?
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.200]   We don't need everybody to know how to dress
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200]   to come into the public square.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.880]   We don't need a dress code.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.520]   And then you got people who couldn't afford the dress code,
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.240]   which was great, right?
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.400]   But who wanted to play by rules,
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.280]   but you also got people who were like,
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.040]   "Yeah, screw the dress code."
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:25.240]   - Stacey's fashion analysis of the First Amendment.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.080]   (laughs)
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:26.920]   - Yeah, well.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.600]   (laughs)
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.360]   - I'm trying to give people to care about it.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.480]   Maybe people who care,
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.720]   I don't want the people who care about dress codes to care.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.200]   - Let's not forget that the people who set
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:40.480]   these standards that were called civility or objectivity
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:43.840]   or civility were the old white people.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.680]   - Some of them?
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.240]   - Yes, some of them, yes.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.320]   Like I can't, like, I will not,
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.560]   I mean, there are lots of people who still ask me
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.800]   why I'm so angry when, truly not.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:57.520]   But it's because I'm a woman who is speaking my mind,
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.320]   but I will also say--
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.160]   - Oh, that must not have been that bad.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.000]   - We gotta spoof.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.080]   (laughs)
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.960]   - I can't stop that in its tracks.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.760]   So in some ways you're right,
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.000]   but there are still, like, I think both are true, Jeff.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:11.840]   Let me just--
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.200]   - Of course, of course, always the case.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.200]   But I think what's happening is that when you ask
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.920]   why aren't newspapers standing up
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.760]   for freedom of expression,
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:24.480]   the trope that they follow is the internet is bad,
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.240]   and what we hear on the internet is bad,
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:29.080]   rather than seeing that we need to defend the internet
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.320]   because it allows voices who've always been there,
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.360]   but just weren't heard.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.360]   Well, why weren't they heard?
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.200]   Because mass media didn't include them,
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.200]   so it's part of the guilt of mass media as well.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.800]   I'm ashamed of our field.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.640]   - One of the, I think the reason that you don't see
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.400]   a lot of this in mainstream media is 'cause it's so hard
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.240]   to cover, it's so complicated.
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.080]   We're even having a hard time.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.360]   - And someone's always gonna,
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.840]   someone's always gonna come out after you and say,
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.360]   like, really crappy things.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.760]   - Yeah, there's gonna be a lot of truthiness going on,
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.160]   and it's very easy to--
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.000]   - That thought it just wasn't sexy enough
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.160]   'cause that's what sales--
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.080]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.680]   - Actually, it's incredibly sexy.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.200]   - It's hard to explain.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.000]   That's really what's hard.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.280]   - People will buy into it if you are the aggrieved party.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.320]   I mean, what is it, grievances?
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.360]   They sell.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.520]   - Yeah.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:22.520]   So the Texas Attorney General, our great friend Ken Paxton,
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.800]   said big tech--
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.640]   - He's gonna say attorney general.
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.640]   I thought he was the lieutenant governor.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.800]   - He's a G now.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.360]   - Big tech's reign of endless censorship,
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.720]   and their suppression of conservative viewpoints
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:35.640]   is coming to an end.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.440]   These massive corporate entities cannot continue
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.400]   to go unchecked as they silence the voice
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.560]   of millions of Americans.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.400]   - Wow, that--
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.720]   - Their aim is-- - His accent.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.040]   - Really nice work.
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.080]   - Oh, you got it, you got it.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.520]   - But, so, and one of the ways that they're kind of trying
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:55.120]   to make this okay is saying, well, they're a common carrier.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.640]   They're like the phone company.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.760]   The phone company's not allowed to censor what you see--
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.120]   - The phone company doesn't even wanna be
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.160]   a common carrier.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:02.240]   - I know.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.640]   Well, and of course the irony is the FCC
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.240]   was able to overturn net neutrality
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.200]   by saying they're not common carriers.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.520]   - Exactly.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.600]   - It's situational ethics.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.000]   - But their aim is to be as shocking as possible
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.200]   and to not be the iron,
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:22.360]   is to not have that shocking content pull down.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:23.440]   'Cause they want a shock--
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.680]   - According to the post, all of the appeals court justices
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:31.680]   both in the 5th and the 11th in Florida and Texas
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.280]   have noted the difficulty of applying
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.960]   Supreme Court precedents.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:42.320]   We're in a new arena, wrote the judge,
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.720]   Leslie Southwick on the 5th,
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:47.440]   who descended from Friday's decision, by the way.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.640]   We're in a new arena, very extensive one for speakers
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.440]   and for those who would moderate this speech,
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.000]   none of the precedents fit seamlessly.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.680]   The closest match I see is case law
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.880]   establishing the right of newspapers
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:01.240]   to control what they do and do not print.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.640]   And that's the law that guides me.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.840]   That's why I'm not sure if it's a he or she,
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.720]   the judge dissented.
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.840]   He or she said, no, no, no,
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.760]   we gotta wait until the Supreme Court gives us more
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.880]   guidance on this.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:17.840]   But then of course the people who approve of the Florida
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:20.320]   and Texas laws are the ones who say,
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:22.320]   well, no, they're common carriers, they should not.
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:25.720]   But it doesn't take a lot of thinking to say,
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.000]   okay, let's say they are common carriers
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.840]   that Twitter and Facebook can in no way weigh in
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.000]   on the content, everything goes on their sites.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.280]   They don't want this, I don't think you want this,
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.720]   nobody who use it wants it,
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.600]   because suddenly it becomes an instant cesspool.
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.760]   That's what they want because that they want to be outrageous.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.240]   They want to cause January 6th.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.080]   They want to say that liberals are pedophiles
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.400]   in pizza parlors.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.960]   That's the, and what do they get on it?
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.280]   They get votes on their so-called base.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:59.720]   They get money, look how much Trump raises
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.480]   when all his truth social stuff.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.680]   They get, they get the power.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:08.960]   But you're gonna create a useless platform.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.360]   - Right, yeah, they don't care.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:13.000]   - They don't use platform, but don't they also not want,
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.320]   like you could also have the truth there though.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.600]   You can also have like--
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.120]   - But look at truth social, Trump's platform.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.400]   It's failing because nobody really wants to hang out there.
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:27.320]   - Well, because the libs aren't there to be irritated.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.840]   - Oh, maybe that's it.
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:29.840]   - Yeah.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.400]   - But the libs won't be, I can guarantee you,
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:34.440]   the libs won't be on Twitter if it's completely unmoderated.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:35.280]   - Nobody would be on a--
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.120]   - But they want destroy education.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.840]   - Nobody would be in our chat room.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.920]   - No one would be in our chat room
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.200]   if we're completely unmoderated.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.040]   - Exactly.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:41.920]   - No one would use our forums
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.480]   if they were completely unmoderated.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:45.480]   Unmoderated.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.900]   - So then the-- - It has nothing to do with
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:47.740]   the right or left.
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:48.580]   Unmoderated. - Unmoderated.
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:49.420]   - Unmoderated. - Unmoderated.
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:50.840]   - Truth and education won't have a voice.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.440]   Hallelujah, they say.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:53.440]   We'll chase them all away.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.440]   - They'll have a voice.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.960]   They just have a voice elsewhere.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.000]   You'll just find them in other places.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.480]   I mean, we've seen like nobody wants to be on Facebook
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.200]   anymore, everybody's going over to other--
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.600]   So you'll find other places.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.040]   - It's the height of the border.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.040]   - It's the height of the border.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:09.880]   - It can't moderate that other place.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.200]   - It's the height of absurdity to say
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.400]   that the president of the United States has been de-platformed.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.240]   What are you talking about?
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.400]   The guy's got a bully pulpit to say
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.000]   that a senator is de-platformed.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:22.840]   So okay, so-- - You could be
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:27.600]   journalism more valuable or the role of a journalist more--
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.160]   - Well, I just think it kills social media.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.760]   Justice Alito, who will be weighing in on this
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.680]   on the Supreme Court, says social media platforms
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.640]   have transformed the way people communicate
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:41.120]   with each other and obtain news.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.720]   At issue is a groundbreaking Texas law
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:47.880]   that addresses the power of dominant social media corporations
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:52.040]   to shape public discussion of the important issues of the day.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.320]   That's not untrue.
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.920]   Just as a newspaper does.
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.320]   And there are conservative newspapers
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.640]   and there are liberal newspapers
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:04.200]   and certainly editorial slant can make one way or the other,
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.040]   right? - Right.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.720]   - I don't think that's-- - No, screw back on that
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.560]   on that shaping line. - The government
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.640]   is not allowed to come into the newspaper and say--
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.480]   - No, they should.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.200]   - You have to slant it one way or the other.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.120]   - Exactly. - That's up
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.160]   to the editorial board of the newspaper.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:20.800]   Is the premise here that there's so few social networks
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:23.560]   that they can't be allowed to be run into differently?
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.840]   - Well, here's the thing Leo.
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.080]   So I was reading, in case you're gonna roll your eyes,
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.440]   I was reading a German newspaper about
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:32.280]   Jürgen Habermas' new book.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.800]   Ooh, the excitement.
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:40.160]   And his argument is, according to the story I tried to read,
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.240]   that yes, we used to have this many media players,
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:44.760]   no, we have this many technology players.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.280]   But what that misses once again,
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:48.720]   it doesn't see the trees for the forest.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.600]   It doesn't see that there are three billion voices
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:52.840]   who weren't there before.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.240]   If you don't look at it in the corporate,
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.800]   you look at it in the total voices,
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.640]   it's a hugely more diverse world of speech.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.720]   But that's not how it's being analyzed in those cases.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.800]   It says, oh my God, we only have so many platforms
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:04.640]   and they're controlling.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.600]   Well, okay, let's talk about how they're controlling.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:09.400]   They may be seeking attention just like old media,
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.920]   but they're scared to death of making political judgments.
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.640]   They're not pushing an agenda,
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.000]   but the right has to say, no, no, no,
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.280]   everybody's against us and the platforms are too,
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.760]   and they're taking down, the muffin says,
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.320]   take down hate speech, and then the right says,
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.760]   that was why hate speech, you're talking down,
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.400]   how dare you?
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:28.120]   - My question is, is there a difference between Twitter?
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.000]   Let's say this show.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.480]   If the government said, oh, you have to have this person
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.040]   on or that person on or you can't decide
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.280]   if somebody says they wanna be on twig,
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.920]   you can't say no to that.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.360]   They should be forced to be a law.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.800]   They're not gonna, they're clearly,
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.440]   they believe that traditional media,
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.120]   and I guess this is closer to traditional media
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.200]   than social media, the government's not allowed to do that.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.440]   They can't say no, I wouldn't say that Leo,
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.400]   there are in some states they're now going
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.720]   after the bookstore is Barnes and Noble saying,
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:56.880]   you gotta carry a certain book,
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.360]   so you can't carry a certain book.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.360]   That's so against the First Amendment,
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.240]   but they're proposing laws to do that.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.360]   They're going to libraries and say,
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.560]   you can't have any book that's nice to gay people.
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:06.560]   - Right.
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.800]   - The Constitution's being thrown, the irony
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.200]   is there's being thrown away by the supposed constructionists.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.040]   - Right.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:15.160]   Okay, so it's not the contention
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.880]   that there's something special about social,
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.400]   well, I mean, I think that's what Alito's saying,
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.960]   there's something different about social media
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.200]   are existing-- - That's what they'll try to argue,
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.080]   but they're doing it across the board.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.000]   - As Ant just said,
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.520]   ban a book, burn a book, there's not a lot of difference.
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:29.520]   - Right, nope.
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:33.840]   - All right, let's take a little break.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.920]   A theory about why spam filtering on Gmail
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:39.200]   has stopped working so well.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.280]   Coming up next,
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:45.280]   Stacy Higginbotham's here, StacyOnIOT.com.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.440]   Is it a, oh, nevermind.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.840]   (laughs)
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:51.840]   Nevermind.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.920]   I retract-- - Is it a jumpsuit question?
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.400]   'Cause I can answer the jumpsuit question.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.240]   - I retract the jumpsuit question.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:03.120]   Unless, if you choose to bring it up, I can't stop you,
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.040]   but I will not say anything.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.280]   Also, Jeff Jarvis, who is wearing
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.560]   a lovely black turtleneck sweater, mock turtleneck.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.400]   Not even a real turtleneck. - It's Uniqlo Large.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:18.240]   - Uniqlo Large, and I like that.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.960]   That's my rap name.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.520]   And MC Uniqlo Large to you.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:28.440]   And Mr. Hunt Pruitt of Hands on Photography.
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:31.520]   I have no questions for you, Ant.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.440]   - Not at all.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.440]   (laughs)
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:34.280]   - Not at all.
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.120]   Good.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.320]   Yes, I thought so.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.720]   I showed it a rot-- - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:38.720]   - Yes, thank you.
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:41.320]   (laughs)
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:42.320]   I showed it a--
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:48.400]   It reminds me of the TikTok video
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.400]   where the guys training his roommate not to be racist
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.920]   and he has a little squirt bottle.
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.200]   And every time he starts to say something racist,
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.360]   he squirts him like a cat.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:58.800]   Maybe that's what we should get you, Stacy.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.000]   Just a little squirt bottle.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.240]   Just little pops.
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.960]   - It's the punch Leo button.
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:04.240]   I can't believe I've been on the show
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.120]   for like five or six years now and I still don't have it.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.600]   - Where's Mr. Bird?
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.840]   - It's a technically difficult.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.040]   - It's a challenging thing.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:12.880]   - Penundrum.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.840]   - Well, we don't want,
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.000]   see the problem is latency.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.040]   We want the punch to actually hit right at the right time.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.640]   Otherwise, the cat doesn't know what you're punishing him.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.800]   - Right, it's like clicker training, exactly.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.040]   (laughs)
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:26.880]   - Click, click.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.480]   - I like it the wrong message at a given time.
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:31.360]   Our show today brought to you by Melissa,
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.640]   the leading provider of global data quality
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.280]   and address management solutions.
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.440]   Did you know poor data quality
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:42.840]   can cost organizations an average of $15 million a year?
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:45.880]   Yikes, if you're a small to medium sized business.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.560]   We know you need every last cent,
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:50.440]   the longer poor quality data stays in your system,
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.200]   the more losses you can accumulate.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:55.720]   Melissa will never cost you more than you're gonna save.
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.600]   To ensure your business is successful,

[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.280]   There's another side to inaccurate data.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:11.440]   Customer service, if you address someone with a wrong name
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:13.400]   or verify the wrong address when dealing
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.280]   with an already frustrated customer,
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.360]   things can go from bad to worse.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:20.120]   Check out Melissa's cloud based data cleansing
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.120]   and enrichment tool.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:24.000]   So easy to use, step one, upload your file like cells,
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.840]   CSV works great, you put that in the first tab,
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:30.280]   copy and paste your data, if it's CSV, into the second tab,
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.760]   then select a data quality service, click next,
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.880]   map the input fields, select output fields
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:37.680]   and data append process your list,
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.640]   Bob's your uncle you're done.

[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:47.520]   She also gets batch address cleansing,
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:50.840]   which processes an entire list for accuracy and completeness.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.920]   Name verification so you can parse
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.000]   and standardize first and last names for personalization.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.360]   Profiling, which lets you analyze your data
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:01.760]   to improve its quality over time and email verification,
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:05.120]   which removes up to 95% of bad email addresses
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.680]   from your database.

[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.640]   Melissa continually undergoes independent security audits

[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.360]   and compliance requirements,
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:35.080]   there's SOC2, HIPAA and GDPR compliant.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.520]   Melissa's data quality suite and clean suite
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.360]   speaks for itself.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:42.840]   It was once again, I have to say named a leader by G2,
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.560]   not a surprise.

[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:25.160]   Thank you, Melissa, for supporting this week in Google.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:28.800]   Interesting hacker news thread this morning.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.280]   What's happening with Gmail spam filtering?
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.640]   Have you noticed this?
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.000]   Is there more spam?
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.760]   The poster said in the last two weeks,
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:39.040]   my Gmail inbox went from zero spam
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:42.480]   to at least two-thirds spam and phishing emails per day.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.280]   I'm not sure if they're just compromised.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:49.040]   So the theory is, this is really interesting.
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.160]   Google's mail servers have been compromised
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.920]   for a couple of weeks.
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:55.320]   It's being used for infected cryptospam.
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:58.360]   That's, are you getting trader bought emails
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.800]   with attached PDFs, for example?
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.520]   He says, I'm not sure if they're just compromised.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.880]   Gmail accounts or if the mail servers themselves
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.160]   have been compromised.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.960]   There seem to be some reports on abuse,
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.400]   IPDB of intrusion attempts coming directly
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.760]   from Google's mail servers.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:14.600]   Whoops.
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:19.320]   Google, unfortunately, has declined to receive reports
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.440]   from spam cop.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:23.920]   He's been reporting it through abuse IPDB.
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:28.480]   Here's one Google mail server that has over 300 abuse
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.080]   reports there many more.
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:36.080]   The thinking is perhaps,
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:40.440]   it's coming from Google's selling this.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.440]   It's not clear.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:45.800]   And maybe that even if Google is making money on it,
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:47.280]   but why isn't Google solving it?
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.960]   So apparently this is not uncommon.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:55.240]   Compromised to cancer not uncommon.
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:58.600]   I just thought I'd bring it up.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.040]   It's not a news story.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.080]   It's a hacker news grid.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.120]   - Have you seen this on your email?
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.040]   - Honestly, stop using Google.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.160]   I used to use good Gmail.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:08.040]   I used to put my mail through Gmail
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.880]   just for the spam filtering.
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.720]   And then I noticed it wasn't doing a very good job,
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:14.080]   but this was years ago, five years, six years ago.
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:14.920]   So I just stopped.
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:18.280]   I just started using a spam assassin and other technologies
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.840]   to do my spam filtering.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:23.960]   Honestly, at this point for me for spam,
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:28.360]   I just assume it's, I have the zero trust model for spam.
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:30.120]   I assume that everybody's spam.
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.680]   - You know you get it.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:35.360]   And so you have to kind of, instead of me trying to block spam,
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:38.240]   I try to find stuff in the spam that's okay.
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.800]   And so for instance, if you're in my contact list,
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.360]   you get through things like that,
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.160]   because otherwise it's,
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.840]   it's spam has gotten worse.
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:49.360]   - Ants, Stacy, have you seen any change?
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.160]   - I haven't seen anything.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:52.080]   - I have a lot of.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.800]   - How about the Dick's Sporting Goods email?
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.240]   You get a lot of those?
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.080]   - No.
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.240]   - No. - Okay.
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:59.560]   - Actually hold on.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.320]   - There's a guy here says I'm getting 10 Dick's Sporting Goods
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.440]   email a day.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.560]   Wow.
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:09.080]   - And that's all spam?
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.080]   - Yeah.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.520]   - So probably also for Google,
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:15.720]   it's hard for them to distinguish between spam and bacon.
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:18.360]   Bacon being male that you asked for,
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.360]   perhaps accidentally signing up for a mailing list when you,
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.120]   you know, logged in.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:26.280]   And so they don't want to block that because, you know,
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.440]   from the point of view of the vendor for legit reasons.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.280]   - They got permission, right?
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:31.600]   - I get a lot of those.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.440]   - Yeah, maybe I want that.
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:35.280]   - But I can't really call those spam,
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:38.080]   'cause I do recognize that where they come from
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.200]   with looking at it now.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.240]   - Yeah, they call that bacon.
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.760]   - The hackers.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:42.880]   - Yeah.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:43.720]   - But it's a long time.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:47.280]   - They've just started testing,
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:49.440]   letting political spam through.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.280]   - Right.
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.600]   - Because the-- - No, I don't want them
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.440]   to do that.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:53.280]   - I know.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.120]   - 'Cause I'm asking that now.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:58.400]   - You, you give them like an email in like,
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.160]   "God, I donated to Act Blue."
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.760]   It was the worst thing I ever did.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:02.600]   - Yeah, I'm gonna fan.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.720]   - No, I'm gonna fan. - No, go right to give it
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.440]   directly to the candidate because--
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.320]   - In asking never to tell you.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.160]   - Yeah.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.880]   - Don't say liberal things on podcasts
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.000]   because then people sign you up for Trump.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.240]   - I know, I get all of those.
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:21.000]   The problem with any political donation, it is public.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.440]   It's by law.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:23.880]   So if a spammer, you know,
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.560]   wants to mine the political donation database,
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.520]   they certainly certainly can do that.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.400]   Let me see if I'm getting any Dick's sporting goods.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.280]   Oh, I am getting a lot of Dick's.
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.440]   (laughing)
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.040]   - Are they having a spam, though?
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:36.880]   - They're getting spam.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.720]   - I don't think I've ever signed up for,
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.900]   I've never even been into a Dick's.
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:44.320]   So-- - Yeah, I don't have any.
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:47.200]   You might have any filter.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.840]   - I was like, I'm not gonna search Dick's
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:50.240]   in my email app.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.720]   - Yeah, that's probably right.
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.720]   - That's what I did.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.680]   - So I'm like, I'm just not gonna do that.
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.440]   - I never signed up, I know,
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:23:00.640]   'cause I don't even, I've never partaked.
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:01.600]   Oh, that's good.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.240]   So I just clicked the unsubscribe button
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.920]   and I got a 400.
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.760]   So-- - Oh, yeah.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:08.360]   - There you go.
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:09.200]   There you go.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:10.840]   Hey, it's better than-- - That's legit.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.520]   - Yeah, that's legit.
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.960]   - Was that you just gave them a positive?
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:17.040]   - Yeah, they said, oh, we got a sucker, yeah.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.400]   - Yep, send them more.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:22.520]   - You're real.
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.960]   (laughing)
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.720]   - All right, well, anyway, yeah,
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.520]   I do feel like Gmail is not,
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:32.180]   which used to be the best way to not get spam.
[01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:37.600]   Amazon's purchase of Roomba is,
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:42.440]   as we thought it might be under FTC investigation.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:45.920]   - Yes, well, they're asking for more records.
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:49.280]   It was gonna be, the FTC was gonna decide,
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.440]   once the deal was announced,
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.480]   they were like, yeah, we're probably gonna take a look at it.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:53.680]   And now they're like, all right,
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.400]   we need way more information.
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.520]   So that's-- - Yeah, that's not an investigation
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:59.280]   that's just asking for,
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.960]   I mean, it is an investigation technically.
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:01.880]   - It is an investigation.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:04.720]   Like the FTC, when you announce a deal,
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:07.080]   the FTC can tell the companies, yeah,
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:10.200]   they can just pass on doing anything with it, right?
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:13.400]   They can just be like, yeah, go ahead, have fun.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.640]   They can immediately say they're gonna stop it,
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:20.160]   or they can say, you know what, let's take a closer look.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.680]   - Yeah. - Give me some.
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:24.800]   - I-Robot disclosed yesterday that the FTC
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.720]   has formally requested documents from both companies,
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.520]   explaining the purpose and rationale of the acquisition.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.920]   Like, why you wanna do this?
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:35.680]   They're also investigating Amazon's
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:39.240]   deal to buy one life healthcare, same thing.
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.880]   - Oh yeah.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:43.240]   - I-Robot said both companies will cooperate
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:46.920]   and expect to promptly reply.
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.400]   The problem is an investigation slows things down.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.840]   It could take up to a year, often does.
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:57.960]   So it's all on hold until that's done, right?
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:00.800]   So that means can you shareholders suffer?
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:04.000]   And even though we're trying to do this for the greater good,
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.520]   is that what this is about?
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:07.360]   - I don't think they're trying to do it
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.200]   for the greater good.
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.880]   I think they're just trying to make,
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:12.920]   I mean, who cares if the shareholders suffer, honestly?
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.640]   - There's no suffering, no money is exchanged.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:17.680]   It just delays it, but I think, you know,
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:21.640]   big companies these days, I mean, every time we talk about
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:25.640]   Adobe buying Figma, it's always pending regulatory approval.
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:27.960]   You always run that risk.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.080]   Amazon sells-
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.000]   - Well, it's been big deals.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.840]   - A very good steward of people's data
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.040]   across all our businesses.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:37.400]   And then it really doesn't want any of Roomba's information
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.960]   about what's going on inside of people's homes.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.840]   - And that's like just a red herring.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:44.200]   The issue isn't, like I said before,
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:47.200]   the issue isn't that Amazon's getting more data
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:48.040]   necessarily.
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:51.200]   The issue is that Amazon will then have the power
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.280]   and the tools to create the ambient home
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:58.120]   in a way that presses their goals,
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.520]   not the goals of other companies in the industry
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.760]   and our consumers.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:07.760]   - FTC is also investigating Amazon's prime membership program,
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.560]   according to a legal petition Amazon filed last month.
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:13.640]   The company has asked the five member commission
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:16.360]   to quash subpoenas tied to the probe,
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:19.800]   saying the FTC staff made excessive demands
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:23.400]   on poor, ill, Jeff Bezos.
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:25.480]   He's busy.
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:30.000]   Don't bother him and other company executives.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   - Sorry, what is he doing?
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.520]   He's going to space.
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:33.360]   The man literally-
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:34.200]   - He's not even doing that now.
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.560]   He's like sailing around on boat.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.920]   - If he can get it out under the bridge.
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:44.320]   - I saw him at the football game on Thursday night football.
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.160]   - Really?
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:50.160]   - He was there with his parabler and his main squeeze.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:54.240]   And who was he sitting with?
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.880]   Some big shot, big wig.
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.360]   They were chatting and talking and all that.
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:01.920]   Very prominently featured on the broadcast.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.480]   I wonder why.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:04.800]   - I hate that stuff.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:06.040]   - I know, who cares?
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:07.360]   Who cares?
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.200]   Who cares?
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.360]   Ooh, Jay Z's at the ball game today.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.280]   - I don't care.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.160]   He's not going to convert third and one.
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.760]   - How many of you listened to serial?
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:21.720]   It was the podcast that put podcasting on the map.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:23.160]   - What podcasting of that sort?
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.440]   You are the podcast.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.000]   - True crime podcasting on the map.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.480]   - True crime podcasting.
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:28.640]   - It was very-
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:30.880]   - Some say this is a true crime, but we don't think.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:31.880]   - Yeah, it's a crime.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.400]   - I think they just say it's a crime, yeah.
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:34.480]   - It's a crime, yeah.
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:37.400]   - Serial, which debuted in 2014,
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:41.640]   was they did a series of 12 episodes
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:46.640]   about the case against a time teenager
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:51.360]   who had not had had been accused of strangling
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:54.920]   his high school classmate in 1999.
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:59.160]   He was found guilty serving a life prison sentence.
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:04.400]   They examined the case with Cliff Hanger.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.520]   I didn't actually listen, but I know a lot of people did.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:07.880]   - I did, I did a lot of Cliff Hanger.
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.960]   - Yeah, Cliff Hangers,
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.360]   they described his peculiarities of his lawyer
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:16.920]   who was disbarred and then died in 2004.
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:22.560]   Well, here we are, how many years later, eight years later,
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:27.640]   say I had walked out of prison on Monday.
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:32.640]   His conviction was overturned thanks to the serial podcast.
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:35.360]   - Well, there was also, well, yes,
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.280]   but there was an investigation then by both prosecutors.
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.920]   - Well, if it hadn't had the podcast,
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:40.400]   probably nobody could pay any attention.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.320]   - I'm sure someone with the org.
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:44.080]   - Judge Melissa M. Finn of Baltimore City Circuit Court
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:46.920]   vacated the conviction in the interests of justice
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:49.480]   and fairness, finding that prosecutors had failed
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:52.320]   to turn over evidence that could have helped say at trial.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:56.000]   I guess that was one of the revelations of serial rights
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.960]   and discovered new evidence that could have affected
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:59.640]   the other possible suspects
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:03.560]   and somebody who could have been a witness in his favor,
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.580]   the state AG was pissed as hell.
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:07.920]   - Pissed at whom?
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:08.760]   - It's your aunt?
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.600]   - This happening.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:13.960]   No, at the city prosecutor for doing this.
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:15.960]   Said he wasn't notified, wouldn't have done this,
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.080]   would have kept it specific.
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:17.920]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:19.760]   So you listened to the whole thing.
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.720]   - I should have, well done, it was very well done
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:23.560]   and I should have listened
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.160]   'cause it really transformed podcast.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.240]   - Now being mocked by, you know,
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.600]   was it only workers in the building?
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:30.320]   - Yeah, and Steve Martin's show
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:33.160]   is basically making fun of true crime podcasts.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.320]   - It's a loving trip.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:37.640]   - It launched a bunch of, I mean,
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:42.120]   like serial never succeeded as well as the first episode.
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:45.400]   Nobody was ever able to duplicate their amazing success
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:46.560]   in the first series.
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:53.560]   So do you think Jeff's serial was legit
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:58.640]   like they, or were they trying to stir up interest
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:01.120]   to, for the interest of a podcast?
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:03.760]   - Well, it's like any crime reporter ever has
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.520]   in New York Daily News, we did the same thing.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:08.120]   You know, the case of the missing nun, you know?
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:08.960]   - Right.
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.440]   - We'd do that kind of stuff.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.560]   We'd go back in the files and find old cases.
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:15.320]   - Do you think it's a long-standing tradition?
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:16.160]   - Yeah.
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:20.240]   - Was it straining credulity or did you--
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.560]   - It was no, it was well done.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:22.800]   It did not come to a conclusion.
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.320]   It did not say he was innocent.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.920]   It led you that direction,
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:29.000]   but did not come to a conclusion.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.560]   - Yeah.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.120]   - And the family of the victim is very upset by this
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:38.360]   and thinks that it was a legitimate verdict.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.920]   - And the thing is, this is life.
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.640]   Life is messy, you never know.
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:43.480]   The thing is, art's certain.
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:46.040]   - Prosecutors recommended that his conviction
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.040]   be vacated and that he be granted a new trial
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:51.360]   because they said the state no longer has confidence
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:53.120]   in the integrity of the conviction.
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:55.200]   So the podcast convinced people.
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.000]   - That's key, that's key.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.560]   And they don't know what they haven't yet said
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:01.600]   whether they're gonna try a McInner not.
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:04.840]   He's on home detention.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:07.680]   He's out of prison but on home detention until they decide.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:13.480]   - But it is podcast, one of you dumbly, oh?
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:15.040]   That podcast got somebody out of prison.
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:16.320]   What the heck have you done over these years?
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:17.520]   - Nothing, not compared to that.
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.800]   - Nothing.
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.840]   - I can't remember the audience numbers
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:22.120]   through the roof.
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:25.360]   I mean, it really was, it put podcasting on the map at the time.
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:31.200]   Mr. Mizzly, the victim's brother said,
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.720]   and asked about the podcast, this is not a podcast for me.
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:37.560]   This is real life, a never ending nightmare for 20 plus years.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:41.120]   He felt betrayed and blindsided by the motion of vacate
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.680]   and frustrated with the many turns
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:44.840]   in the case of the last two decades.
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.480]   Whenever I think it's over and it's ended,
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:48.360]   it's always coming back, it's killing me
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:50.200]   and it's killing my mother.
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:51.720]   (sighs)
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:56.200]   - Of course, if you, if you were a family, how many?
[01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:57.680]   - 3.4 million. - Wow.
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:00.680]   If you were in the family, we do that almost every month.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:05.680]   If you were in the family of the victim
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:07.560]   and you thought they had the wrong guy
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:10.160]   and the real guy was wandering around,
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:12.800]   you would want this to be re-examined, right?
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:14.440]   - But they don't think they got the wrong guy.
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:15.280]   That's what they're saying.
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:17.560]   - Yeah, they've bought heavily into that,
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:18.840]   which, I mean, I get it.
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:22.080]   - Every time the wrong guy is convicted,
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.240]   the right guy is walking free.
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:25.080]   - Yes. - Right.
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:31.320]   - So were you convinced, Jeff?
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:34.320]   - I was convinced he had a bad trial.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.440]   I was convinced he should have had a re-trial.
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.000]   - Yeah. - So that much, yes.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:37.840]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:41.160]   - There was also a documentary on HBO,
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:43.040]   which came out a couple of years ago.
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:47.400]   New York Times bought serial productions in 2020.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:53.120]   So it's now a part of the New York Times family of podcasts.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:55.760]   They never quite got that many,
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:58.720]   it's hard, that's catching lightning in a bottle, isn't it?
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.040]   - It really, really is.
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:04.240]   - All right, let's talk about helium.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:08.440]   - J.C. Tom. - This is a helium.
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:11.400]   So the first time I ever heard about helium was you,
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.280]   you have a helium router.
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:18.000]   - I do, I have a hotspot that is a Laura hotspot.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.040]   - Low range, long range.
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:21.920]   - Long range. - Long range.
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:24.400]   - And the idea is people use it
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:28.320]   and generate helium crypto tokens for you.
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:32.120]   - So the idea is by having this hotspot,
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:35.560]   I am providing a node in a LauraWAN network
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:39.200]   that helium offers out to companies who want to use it.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:42.920]   They send their LauraWAN data to my hotspot
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:47.360]   and then it goes over my home wifi to the public internet.
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:49.640]   In return for doing this,
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.560]   I get a helium network token,
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:55.840]   which is the helium's cryptocurrency,
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.800]   which then I can exchange either to buy data credits
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:03.120]   on the helium network if I want to operate my own sensors
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:05.760]   or I just sell for cash money
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:08.960]   based on how much agencies are exchanging on.
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:11.160]   They are not exchanging for much now.
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:14.200]   - So that's the question, have you made money on this?
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.320]   - I did, I made a lot of money in the beginning
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.760]   and I sold it so I made actual money.
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:21.840]   I made fiat currency.
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:26.480]   - I made a lot of money back then.
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:30.960]   - Seattle, I made 15 or $18,000.
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:31.800]   - Wow.
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.560]   - So yeah, it was great.
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:38.280]   - And you're not making much now?
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:41.440]   - I can tell you right now that I think it's worth,
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:43.680]   well, I never know what it's worth at.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.520]   But I never checked it.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.320]   So part of it was I didn't check it for a long time
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:49.160]   and then when I checked it, it was like $8,000
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:50.880]   and then all of a sudden it had the super run up
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.760]   and then it was like a lot of money
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:54.040]   and I was like, "Oh, holy cow,
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:54.880]   I should sell."
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:35:00.840]   Right now I had, oh, it's $565.
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:01.680]   - Okay.
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:02.960]   And how much how many months is that?
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.000]   - Since when, yeah.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.440]   - Well, so there's two issues.
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:09.480]   One, I'm generating fewer H&Ts in the beginning
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:10.480]   to set up the network.
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:13.080]   They incentivize people by giving them more H&Ts
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:16.760]   but also the value of H&Ts have dropped precipitously.
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:20.120]   Like at its high point, the price of an H&T,
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:23.080]   like when I sold it was like $15 to $20
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:25.640]   and now it's at $4.30.
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.000]   So there's a couple things.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.240]   - But so has Bitcoin which is now $18,000.
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:33.320]   So as ETH, which is now at $1,200,
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:36.320]   I mean all the cryptocurrencies have dropped quite a bit.
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.340]   So that may not be a helium issue.
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:43.280]   So the reason I bring it up is helium has made an announcement.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.680]   They're partnering with T-Mobile.
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:46.960]   - Yeah.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:47.960]   - They're gonna make helium mobile
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:51.120]   a 5G wireless service for smartphones
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:54.440]   using, I think, using your router, right?
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:55.440]   Using the helium?
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:56.640]   - No. - No.
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.480]   - No.
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.680]   So it is the same sort of model
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:01.680]   but it is not the same.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:04.880]   My router only does Laura and Wi-Fi.
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:07.600]   - So it's too slow to do anything useful.
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:10.800]   - It doesn't have the right radio inside.
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:13.240]   I mean, it's a totally different wireless.
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:15.000]   - This is gonna be 5G.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:15.840]   - Yeah.
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:19.560]   - For 5G you have to buy a different type of router
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.280]   and it's much more expensive.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:25.480]   It ranges from 1,800 to about $10,000 for this router
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:29.200]   because a 5G radio is inherently more expensive
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.480]   and more complicated.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:34.560]   You're also going to need a back-hole for any 5G.
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.360]   You could use your Wi-Fi network
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:38.680]   and I actually asked helium,
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:41.880]   I was like, "Hey, how are you gonna handle this?"
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:43.440]   'Cause 5G's a lot.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.880]   And I asked, "Okay, this is verbatim what they sent me."
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.680]   I said, "Hey, how does the helium 5G hotspot
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:53.440]   "handle large data requests on a user's broadband account?
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.520]   "Are there limits?"
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:58.080]   They answered me, "This move will allow 5G infrastructure
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.800]   "to be accessible at a much faster pace
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:01.680]   "by enabling the helium community to help build
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.120]   "and use the network, especially in hard-to-reach places."
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:06.080]   So the answer is they're not answering.
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:12.040]   So I don't know how you could actually do this reasonably
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:15.120]   and what kind of data speeds you could expect on this network.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:18.640]   But if you are a subscriber, you can buy,
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.200]   if you are a T-Mobile subscriber,
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:25.040]   you can now buy basically, let me rephrase it,
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.960]   you can buy a helium mobile subscription
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.920]   that will run on the helium 5G network
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:35.680]   and TMO's 5G network.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:38.400]   Most of the time it's gonna be on TMO's 5G network.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:42.120]   - So according to the article on decrypt,
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:44.800]   helium has 950,000 node operators,
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.200]   including Stacey Higginbotham.
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:47.800]   They mentioned you by name.
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:49.680]   No, they don't.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:52.200]   So that's pretty widespread, but as you say,
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:55.800]   not nearly widespread enough to provide heat 5G.
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:56.800]   Helium's own 5G--
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:59.200]   - You only have 4,500 5G networks.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:02.160]   - Oh, that's a little deceptive.
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:06.720]   Okay, that's the for the IoT speed, Laura.
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:09.040]   - They have two separate tokens.
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:11.360]   They have the HNTs, which is their IoT,
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:14.800]   and then they have what they call mobile and call caps.
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:17.360]   And those are, so the 5G network.
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:18.360]   So--
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:20.480]   - So there's hardly anybody has the helium.
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:22.480]   You said it was $18,000.
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:28.000]   - It's between $1,800 and $5,000.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.920]   - Okay, but so very few people have those.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:34.720]   - Right, only 4,500 of them are in operation.
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:38.480]   - Helium's own 5G network will be the preferred network
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.200]   from helium mobile when coverage is available,
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:42.200]   which is never.
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:46.240]   Initially, voice calls will take place entirely
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:49.920]   on T-Mobile's network, while data transfers will use service
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:53.600]   provided by node operators in the decentralized network
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:56.680]   when available, otherwise it falls back to T-Mobile.
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:00.760]   So it would, it'll behave probably like any other T-Mobile
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:02.240]   and VNO initially.
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:06.200]   - Yeah, but with less coverage.
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.360]   - Well, it'll have T-Mobile.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:10.600]   It'll use T-Mobile if you can't get anything else.
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:13.080]   - Yeah, so it'll be just like a T-Mobile and VNO,
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.560]   but maybe if you're near somebody who has a 5G helium.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.480]   - If you're near someone else's hots.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:22.320]   - Yeah, and the idea is hopefully people will buy these,
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.040]   like if you're a Wisp operator,
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:25.920]   like a wireless infrastructure provider
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:28.320]   in the middle of like Wisconsin, right?
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:30.120]   You might wanna put one of these up
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:31.800]   because you already have the infrastructure
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:33.680]   and if you can earn money when,
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:35.440]   'cause T-Mobile doesn't have a 5G network
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.240]   in the middle of nowhere of Wisconsin,
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:40.240]   but you know, maybe people would use it if it were.
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:44.200]   - So the analog to this is Xfinity's cell service,
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:46.440]   which is a Verizon and VNO.
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:49.440]   If you're near an Xfinity router that's connected
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:50.680]   to the internet, you'll use that.
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:52.720]   Otherwise you'll use Verizon.
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.600]   There are a lot more Xfinity routers out there,
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:55.600]   but it's the same idea.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:58.600]   You can bootstrap and affect bootstrap your network
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:39:59.440]   by starting as NDA.
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:02.240]   - There are 20 million Xfinity routers out there
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:05.600]   'cause there are 20 million Comcast Xfinity subscribers.
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:09.520]   - Right, well, not all of us turn on our routers.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.360]   - I don't.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.200]   - That is true.
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:16.200]   So if you don't use the Comcast modem, okay,
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:18.040]   you're right, you're right.
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:21.960]   - And if I have a Helium 5G node,
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:26.000]   do I make money just like you do on your other Helium node?
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.200]   - Yeah, when someone comes on your,
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:29.200]   you'll make it by proof of stake,
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.400]   or sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, proof of coverage.
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.960]   Like, hey, I'm here.
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.040]   Hey, is she really here?
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.600]   Okay, yeah, great.
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.480]   - So we've talked, we were talking before the show
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:42.000]   about proof of work, which is how Bitcoin works,
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.440]   proof of stake, which is how the new Ethereum works,
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.480]   and there's also proof of coverage,
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:50.600]   which is not doing math problems, I think, just saying hello.
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:51.440]   Right?
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:53.640]   - Yeah, it's basically saying hello.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:54.480]   Are you really here?
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:55.320]   Yes, I'm really here.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:58.080]   - Oh good, you get to Ching, you get a coin.
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:59.440]   Okay, actually--
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:00.800]   - Or you get a tenth of a coin.
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:01.880]   (laughs)
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:04.800]   - I'm sure they'll be talking about the Ethereum emerge.
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:07.480]   I think they did actually on Techno's Weekly last Thursday.
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:11.720]   As far as we can tell, it went absolutely smoothly, flawlessly.
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:13.920]   So Ethereum has moved from proof of work,
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:17.760]   which is very environmentally unfriendly system
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:20.560]   that one Bitcoin uses, and Ethereum used to use,
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.200]   to proof of stake, which they say saves 99% of the power
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:27.800]   that a proof of work protocol does.
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:29.080]   And apparently did it flawlessly.
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:33.360]   Not that Ethereum has not gone down in value,
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:35.600]   but so has Bitcoin.
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:38.000]   The real losers in this are the miners,
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.680]   the Ethereum miners who had the big A6 and the GPUs,
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:43.560]   and were making money off of mining Ethereum,
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:45.920]   'cause they won't be making that kind of money anymore.
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:48.800]   In fact, article in PC Magazine from last week,
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.120]   no one is profitable.
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:55.120]   GPU mining faces dark days after Ethereum merge.
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:59.120]   Yeah, it also means you'll be able to find a lot of GPUs
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:01.400]   on eBay, unless you're at buy 'em.
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.920]   The merge--
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:05.520]   - Most of the power should go down.
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:09.040]   - The merge killed it all off, said one miner named Philip Rob.
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.800]   All my stuff is idling now.
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:14.240]   Initially, miners were hoping to shift
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:17.880]   to alternative cryptocurrencies like Ergo and Ravencoin,
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:19.920]   which can also be mined with PC graphics cards,
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:22.080]   but they're so worthless,
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.680]   and the electricity is so expensive
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.360]   that you're just not gonna make money.
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:30.280]   - So I actually wore these people that are using,
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:32.560]   that are doing the mining, are they all US-based?
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:33.400]   - Or where?
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.560]   - Well, for a while they were in China.
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:37.880]   They didn't have the same electricity rates
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:39.640]   that we have here.
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:42.160]   - So a lot of them were in China,
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:43.160]   till China booted 'em out,
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:46.280]   'cause they would be next door to hydroelectric dams
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.880]   where the electricity was virtually free.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.080]   Then you can make money,
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:51.640]   but you can't in California,
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:53.680]   there's no way you can make money.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.040]   We have a friend, Steve Gibson,
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.920]   and I have a good friend in Arizona who makes money
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:00.080]   because his electricity rates are low.
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:04.280]   I guess if you had solar in the state like Arizona,
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:07.360]   it might be profitable, but not anymore,
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:08.920]   I guess is the point, not anymore.
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:12.080]   - That would figure some of the rural European,
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:13.920]   it might not be as much of an issue to mine.
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:15.400]   - Right, right.
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:17.080]   Some miners are taking a wait and see,
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.240]   approach this PC magazine on the possibility
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:22.920]   that GPU mining could make a comeback one day.
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:25.200]   Blake Teeter says he only plans to sell
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.160]   his older generation GPUs.
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.240]   I'm cleaning my rigs and watching the market
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:32.600]   until a few coins stand out to mine profitability-wise.
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:35.080]   I think GPU mining will still have a place in crypto mining
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:36.640]   at least for a few years.
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:39.040]   - It's also made up, it's also amazing.
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:44.040]   I asked you before the show to explain proof of stake to me.
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:46.720]   - So normally the way Bitcoin,
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:51.240]   and most cryptocurrencies originally were designed,
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:54.920]   you would make money by solving tough math problems.
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.800]   In order for a transaction to go through,
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:59.600]   let's say I want to give you a Bitcoin,
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:05.560]   I then have to offer an amount of money for the transaction,
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:06.960]   there's a default amount,
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:09.160]   but if you want the transaction to go through faster,
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:11.520]   you might give a bigger percentage of the transaction.
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:14.400]   And then it goes out to all the Bitcoin miners
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:15.960]   who attempt to solve the problem.
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:18.000]   They're all working on it at the same time.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.120]   The first one to solve it gets the transaction fee,
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:22.400]   the gas fee.
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:25.280]   So what you have is this duplication of effort
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:29.520]   across the whole, all the miners are working full steam,
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:31.880]   trying to commit stuff to the blockchain.
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:35.040]   Proof of stake doesn't have that lottery system.
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:36.600]   All right, actually it does have a lottery system,
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:38.200]   it doesn't have that system.
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:40.160]   It picks one miner,
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:42.720]   says you get the transaction fee,
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:44.120]   doesn't necessarily reduce gas fees,
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:47.600]   but it keeps everybody from mining for the same coin.
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:48.720]   So it--
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:50.560]   - And what does that, and that miner,
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:51.640]   'cause they're all what I read about it,
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:53.280]   does that miner verify's?
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:55.460]   Is that miner also solving a problem?
[01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:56.520]   - Yeah.
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:57.480]   - Oh, okay, it's just not quite,
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:59.480]   I always say that's the difference, is that--
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:02.400]   - Just going to, one block per miner, basically.
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:04.280]   - And so you're presuming a trust there,
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:06.120]   'cause that miner doesn't want to ruin their trust
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:07.120]   if they screw it up.
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:10.320]   - Yeah, I guess so, yeah.
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:11.160]   Yeah, okay.
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:13.680]   That's my understanding,
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:15.840]   I'm sure I got a little bit wrong,
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:18.680]   but the slide ferret in the chair,
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:20.560]   it says they solve for blocks of transactions,
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:21.920]   not individual transactions.
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:23.480]   Well, yeah, they bundle them,
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.080]   but you get the idea, you get the idea.
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:28.000]   - So-- - That's put a link from coin desk.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:28.960]   - Yeah, I see that. - It's playing
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:30.440]   into different sets. - Yeah.
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:34.160]   Two different methods to validate transactions.
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:35.200]   The whole idea of blockchain,
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:36.480]   the whole idea of all of this is
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:38.400]   you have a decentralized ledger
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:40.120]   that everybody who has a copy of the blockchain
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:42.920]   knows all the transactions that happen on the blockchain.
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:47.920]   So it's all simultaneously public and decentralized
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:51.240]   so that no bank runs it,
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:54.120]   it's just run by every, it's a consensus mechanism.
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:46:00.240]   And in theory, that works better.
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:04.200]   But I think there's certainly applications
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:07.160]   for a distributed database, obviously,
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.120]   but not as many as one might think.
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:11.120]   It works just fine.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:13.640]   The cost, I saw somewhere the cost
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:18.640]   of a Bitcoin transaction compared to a 100,000 visa transactions.
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:24.160]   And it's like 100 times higher than 100,000 visa transactions.
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:27.760]   It's just not a sensible way of doing it at all.
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:30.320]   - I heard you mentioned that I think it was Sunday.
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:33.200]   - Yeah. - Yeah, I think it was Sunday.
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:34.480]   I was talking about it, I was like, who?
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:36.520]   - Whoa, I wish I could find-- - It was significant
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.760]   a story 'cause I wanted to wear their source come from.
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:40.000]   That's a big thing. - Well, no,
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.040]   I mean, everybody knows.
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:45.240]   It's a very significant amount of energy used.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:49.480]   Proof of work required, this is from the coin desk article.
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:51.720]   Proof of work requires a significant amount of energy
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:54.680]   to verify transactions since the computers and the network
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:56.800]   must spend a lot of energy and operate a lot.
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:58.680]   The blockchain is less environmentally friendly
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:01.440]   than other systems by a lot, I added.
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:04.240]   Another problem some raised is that because of the competition
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:07.640]   between miners for rewards, a small number of mining pools
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:11.200]   control the blockchain and kind of de facto centralization.
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:12.800]   That's what happened in NFTs, by the way,
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:15.200]   OpenSea basically dominates. - Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:17.240]   - It's important to note though that mining pools
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:19.720]   are made up of individual miners or smaller groups of miners
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:21.280]   who are free to pull their hash power
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:23.320]   if they no longer agree with the direction
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:25.760]   of a larger mining pool.
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:29.560]   The downsides of Proof of stake is that it requires
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:32.320]   an often enormous initial investment.
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.200]   You must purchase enough of the native token
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:37.560]   of that cryptocurrency to qualify to be a validator
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.240]   which is dependent on the size of the network.
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:42.560]   In theory, people must be wealthy or earn enough money
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:45.360]   to buy a network stake. - Or you can buy
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:47.360]   a stake in the stake. - I wonder, yeah.
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:49.080]   Leading to an extent could do that.
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:50.480]   - But then again, that's centralization.
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:51.720]   - Yeah.
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:54.760]   - It's 32 eats, I think, you have to power.
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:55.600]   - Yeah.
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:00.480]   Could Bitcoin do what ETH just did?
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:05.480]   What made ETH able to do this?
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:09.640]   - It was a promise of Ethereum from the very beginning.
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:10.680]   They said-- - Oh.
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:13.000]   - They also had to achieve consensus, right?
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.880]   - Yeah. - So if you got enough people
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:19.880]   to agree to do it on Bitcoin, then yes, you could.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.800]   - Got it. - Yeah, it's just, you know,
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:23.680]   it's just an algorithm.
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:25.640]   You changed the algorithm, I guess.
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:28.240]   - Well, yeah, but you have to get enough,
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:33.120]   you have to get 51% or maybe it's more to agree
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:35.560]   to decide that that's the new math we all want to follow.
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:38.880]   - All of this has roiled the GPU market.
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:43.440]   One of the biggest GPU manufacturers, EVGA,
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:46.880]   has announced that they're out of the business entirely.
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:49.520]   - It's just-- - 80% of their revenue
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:53.000]   comes from making NVIDIA GeForce GPUs.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.280]   They're cutting their ties with NVIDIA,
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:59.240]   saying it's just a bad business.
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:00.240]   It's a bad business.
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:02.720]   A lot of us have EVGA cards. - It's all this made up thing.
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:03.960]   - Yeah. - Wow.
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:06.120]   - This is the problem.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:09.160]   NVIDIA's gross margin has been going up, up and up.
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:12.360]   Meanwhile, the people who make the cards,
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:16.520]   their profit's been going down, down and down.
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.920]   EVGA is just one of those partners.
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:22.040]   So it's not a good business.
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:24.040]   And NVIDIA's suffering too, frankly.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:25.400]   They just announced new cards,
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:27.800]   so maybe then I don't know, we'll see.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:30.120]   The markets, too. - Just well, and they also have,
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:32.600]   there is a legitimate market that is not driven
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:35.080]   by financial speculation for NVIDIA's products.
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:36.960]   - There's three, as far as I know,
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:39.720]   there's PC gaming, artificial intelligence
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:41.360]   and driverless cars.
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:43.240]   Those are big markets for NVIDIA.
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:44.120]   - Yeah. - Well, yeah.
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:45.600]   There's also like transcoding.
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:48.080]   There's a lot. - Right.
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:49.720]   - Right.
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:51.480]   All right, let's take a little break.
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:53.360]   Can it be, wait a minute, before we take a break,
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:55.080]   I think I have to do a changelog and stuff.
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:56.400]   Shoot.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:59.040]   - Oh, there's a lot of other destroyers here.
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:01.240]   - I know there's other good stories, but dude,
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:03.040]   we're already in an hour 48.
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:05.400]   I gotta do the picks of the week.
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:06.240]   Life has to go on. - Two seconds.
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:08.800]   - I can't keep doing it. - I had to go get my waffle.
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:10.120]   I was hungry. - Uh-huh.
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:12.080]   - It's 34 o'clock. - All right, let me see.
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:13.320]   Let me see real quick.
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:17.000]   - Uh... - Clearview stories.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.520]   - Oh, he's interested in-- - No, no.
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:22.720]   Robert Kinsel, former chief business officer of YouTube.
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:25.160]   We mentioned he left YouTube, he's going to Warner Music,
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:26.480]   gonna run Warner Music.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:30.840]   Clearview used by police to find criminals
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:32.960]   now in public defenders' hands.
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:36.160]   - Oh boy. - After Florida man accused
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:39.320]   of vehicular homicide, his lawyer used their facial
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:41.560]   and recognition software to prove his innocence.
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.480]   So there was a guy who was in the passenger,
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:46.240]   that guy was in the passenger seat in a car.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:49.760]   The driver in a bad crash was thrown out.
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:53.200]   Good Samaritan pulled him out, the passenger door was jammed,
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:55.800]   so pulled him out through the driver's door,
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:58.200]   and then the cops said, "You were the driver."
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:50:59.960]   - Uh-huh. - The McKerlin homicide.
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:03.880]   The cops didn't get the name of the Good Samaritan,
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:04.720]   even though they interviewed him.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:05.880]   They didn't get the name, and they said,
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:07.800]   "Dup, you're it, you're going to jail."
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:09.920]   And so the lawyers said they had images
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:13.040]   from the police video of the Good Samaritan,
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:18.240]   and they needed to use Clearview to match face
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:20.080]   and find the real person.
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:22.760]   And they called the Clearview CEO,
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:24.960]   and they said, "Well, okay, we'll try this."
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:27.120]   'Cause it's been the only useful police,
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:29.560]   and in this case, they found the person,
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.600]   and this person said, "Yes, absolutely."
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:33.600]   I pulled him out from the passenger side.
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:35.160]   He was not the driver of the car,
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:37.840]   and the guy's not going to jail as a result.
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:42.160]   Now, what's wrong in this story is the prosecution,
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:43.600]   and the police were all messed up.
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:45.160]   They shouldn't have gone after this guy in this way,
[01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:46.360]   and they should have done their job
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:48.520]   and gotten the documentation and all of that.
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:52.120]   Nonetheless, it was technology that's decried
[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:54.920]   and properly so for use by police only.
[01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:58.480]   If it's also in the hands of defense,
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:00.720]   then shouldn't it be in both hands at least?
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:01.760]   That's the story.
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:02.760]   - So, yeah, it's technology.
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:05.600]   - Technology is a tool in the police are lazy.
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:06.520]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:08.720]   - Yeah, I don't want to do that story.
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:09.560]   Let's see what--
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:11.040]   (laughing)
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:12.160]   - Appreciate it.
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:13.000]   - Too late.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.920]   (laughing)
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:16.560]   (gasping)
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:17.560]   - I try.
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:18.400]   - No, we did this.
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:21.440]   - Coach, David, AI is going to--
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:22.280]   - Go ahead.
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:25.360]   - AI is going to eliminate coding?
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.200]   - No, it's not.
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:27.480]   - IEEE story?
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:29.320]   No, it's not, but it's going to make people more dependent,
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:31.360]   and by the way, interesting stat.
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:34.000]   Right, it's not a number this week.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:34.840]   I'll use it anyway.
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:37.560]   - The bonus number is that within about a year,
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:39.840]   American colleges and universities will graduate
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:44.200]   more computer science majors alone than all humanities.
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:46.240]   - Which means there's going to be a glut.
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:47.080]   - Yeah.
[01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:47.920]   - And also that--
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:48.760]   - We need more English teachers.
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:49.600]   - We need more English teachers.
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:50.440]   - Yeah.
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:51.280]   - We do, and we need more--
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:52.120]   - No, we don't.
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:52.960]   - At their politics.
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:53.800]   - Yeah, we need more plumbers.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:55.160]   - Yeah, that's what we need.
[01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:56.160]   Bingo.
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:57.080]   - We need more plumbers.
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:59.920]   - We need more carpenters, plumbers, handymen,
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:01.160]   people who can saw--
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:03.320]   - We also need more historians and philosophers.
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:04.160]   - Oh, yes, this is--
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:05.000]   - There's plenty of those.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:05.840]   - Yes, we do.
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:08.440]   - I was putting brake pads on my car the other day,
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:10.880]   and I kept getting messages from people,
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:13.280]   and I'm like, yeah, I'm busy changing my brakes.
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:17.360]   And it's like it amazed people that somebody else
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:19.680]   would work on their car, and I'm like,
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:20.720]   you know what, not do this?
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:21.560]   Apparently not.
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:22.400]   - No.
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:23.800]   - 'Cause you can't anymore,
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:25.600]   'cause you need a computer.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:26.960]   - Did I tell you the story of--
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:29.160]   - The one time I tried to change my oil.
[01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:31.720]   - No, you tried to change your oil?
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:32.560]   Let me guess.
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:35.240]   - You had your face under the hole.
[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:37.440]   - I was under the car,
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:40.720]   and I was convinced by a coworker,
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:41.640]   you know, you could do this, Jeff,
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:42.480]   you could really do this,
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:43.520]   so I went and bought all this stuff.
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:44.600]   - And he just unscrew the thing.
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:46.400]   - And no, no.
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:48.800]   I was under the car on a street in Chicago,
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:51.120]   on the upper one, on the other side,
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:53.600]   and I got the round thing on the oil.
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:55.960]   First, I took the, not off, got oil, the oil out,
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:56.960]   so there's no oil in the car.
[01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:58.040]   - Okay, good start, okay.
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:59.120]   - Good start, right?
[01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:01.960]   And then I take the thing to try to get the filter off.
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:02.800]   - Yeah.
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:05.200]   (grunting)
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:08.400]   - And I wrecked the filter, but can't get it off.
[01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:10.520]   So now I have a car that has no oil in it,
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:11.360]   and no filter.
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:12.320]   - If I put oil in it,
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:14.880]   what comes spruits it out of the filter,
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:17.280]   so I had to have the car towed.
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:18.800]   - Oh, man.
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:19.640]   - Yeah.
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:21.000]   - How about a humiliation?
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.720]   - Humiliation.
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:23.880]   - Somebody of ants,
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:28.720]   talents driving the tow truck, saying you idiot.
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:30.880]   - Did you have the special filter wrench?
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:31.920]   - Yes, I did.
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:32.760]   - I did.
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:33.600]   - Mm.
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:36.160]   - I got there, and all I did was took a big screwdriver
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:38.920]   and stuck it through and then turned it and it came off.
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:40.800]   (laughing)
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:43.120]   I've never tried to change my oil again.
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:43.960]   - That's hilarious.
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:46.400]   - And I certainly, and wouldn't be changing my brakes.
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:48.600]   - Yeah, I'm so sorry, Jeff.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:50.840]   My dad taught me how to change my spark plugs.
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:51.680]   - That's good.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:52.840]   - We used to do all that.
[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:54.000]   - Can't do that anymore, but--
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.160]   - I don't do that anymore.
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:56.000]   - That's a skill you don't need.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.320]   - It's a computer.
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:59.200]   - But this is the outfit I would wear
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:00.040]   if I were doing it.
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:00.880]   - Yeah.
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:01.720]   (laughing)
[01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:03.480]   - Rosie the River over here.
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.000]   (laughing)
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000]   Girl power.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.840]   Let's do the Google change log,
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:10.680]   otherwise we'll never get out of here.
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:13.920]   - The Google change log.
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:16.680]   (dramatic music)
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:21.280]   - Google Fi offering free service.
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:25.600]   If you were a Fi customer and you stopped,
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:27.920]   expect an email from Fi saying,
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.560]   "Please come back, free service for the rest of the year."
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:35.880]   If invited and you'll get an email,
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:37.640]   if you are, you and up to five other people
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:39.440]   get three months of free service,
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:45.160]   which is about 720 bucks if you have all six lines going.
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:48.760]   If you are an existing Google Fi user,
[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:50.120]   that'll be the normal fee.
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:51.280]   Thank you very much.
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:52.840]   No deal for you, no deal.
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:57.200]   This is actually a much more useful story.
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:00.560]   Google app starts rolling out results about you
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:03.520]   to help remove personal information.
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:05.920]   Google said they'd be able to do this.
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:09.520]   So here's the deal, you have to be using the Google app.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:11.040]   Take control of results about you,
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:13.040]   your personal info is yours to share or not.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:14.440]   We're here to help you remove personal info
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:19.040]   you see on Google and you can have requests.
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:23.560]   You can say what you want to remove from wear.
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:25.760]   Google will then do it.
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:27.680]   You'll have to answer the question,
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:30.440]   why would you like to remove this result?
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:32.200]   It shows my personal contact info,
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:35.120]   it shows my contact info with an intent to harm me.
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:36.400]   It shows other personal info,
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:38.640]   it contains illegal info or it's outdated.
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:42.040]   Remember they announced this Google IO,
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:44.360]   it's now appearing in Europe and the US.
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:47.640]   Not wide though, they're doing it slowly.
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:50.560]   So it's important to note says Google
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:52.640]   and we receive a removal request will evaluate
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:55.640]   all content on the webpage to ensure we're not limiting
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:57.560]   the availability of other information
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:00.800]   that is broadly useful for instance in news articles.
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:02.720]   Remember they said that because that was the question,
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:03.880]   is what are you gonna remove news articles?
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:06.880]   No, removing contact information from Google search
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:08.960]   does not remove it for the web,
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:11.240]   which is why you may wish to contact
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:12.600]   the web hosting site directly.
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:17.600]   There is so much revenge porn and stuff like that on the web.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:20.200]   I think this is a good thing for Google to do.
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:21.640]   There've been companies who make a lot of money
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:23.920]   trying to do this, but really Google's gonna be
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:25.560]   the king of this one.
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:31.200]   Google's to-do list and reminders will finally work together.
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:35.680]   Google is working on a big update to Google Tasks,
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:40.480]   integrating its reminders system across Assistant Calendar
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:42.240]   and the rest of Google suite of apps.
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:45.360]   That's good, right?
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:46.440]   Google Tasks. - I know what thing
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:49.040]   is on a to-do list 'cause then I don't do 'em.
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:51.840]   - If they're on your to-do list, you consider that done?
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:54.680]   - No, then I fear them and they hang over me.
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:56.440]   - They're scary. - Like torture.
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:58.280]   And yes, that's the worst thing I can do
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:57:59.880]   is put it on a to-do list.
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:01.120]   - So if you have a Google Assistant,
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:02.440]   you might try saying something like,
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:05.400]   hey, you know who remind me to take out the trash at nine,
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:07.760]   it will then get added to your tasks
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:10.320]   as well as your reminders.
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:11.880]   I think that's good.
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:12.720]   - What was genius?
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:14.520]   - Isn't that always what happened?
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:16.280]   - No, there were two separate things.
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:18.160]   If you said, remind me to put it on the reminder list.
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:20.640]   - So I just got a reminder and it wasn't on my to-do.
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:21.480]   Okay, yeah, I don't care.
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:22.320]   - I think that's perfect.
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:23.160]   - Yeah.
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:24.000]   - Yeah.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.120]   - Yeah, Gina had one called to-do.txt,
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:30.040]   which is a command line based text to-do program.
[01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:32.600]   I don't know if she maintains it or somebody else does.
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:34.080]   It's open source might somebody else.
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:35.520]   - Let's go to the command line.
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:36.360]   - Yeah.
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:37.520]   - I have terminal.
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:39.280]   - I often-- - Go to terminal.
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:40.440]   - Terminal.
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:43.440]   - Maybe it all comes down to Emacs in the end.
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:44.600]   Are you using Stadia?
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:45.600]   Are you a pro member?
[01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:48.960]   Look for 1440p quality, it's rolling out.
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:50.480]   Of course you would have to have a lot of bandwidth
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:51.840]   to do that I wouldn't imagine.
[01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:55.640]   YouTube's partner program is expanding
[01:58:55.640 --> 01:58:59.880]   so that people who do shorts will get some revenue.
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:01.960]   The revenue sharing program.
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:05.120]   And there also is a creator music catalog coming
[01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:07.280]   with licensed music.
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:10.200]   - It's a big deal to join.
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.040]   - To join.
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:12.440]   - Just saying this is a big deal.
[01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:15.840]   - Yeah, it is a big deal, but you gotta be pretty active.
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:18.960]   You have to have 10 million views of your shorts
[01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:23.560]   over 90 days and 1,000 channel subscribers.
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:24.560]   - My God.
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:26.760]   I guess that's like going viral on TikTok.
[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:29.760]   - Yeah, 10 million views seems like a lot to have in your--
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:30.760]   - That's a lot.
[01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:33.640]   I didn't know it was an and I thought it was an or.
[01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:35.760]   - Yeah, it's a plus.
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:38.720]   40,000 valid public watch hours,
[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:43.160]   but you'll get some money, I guess.
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:45.000]   - And the 20th of the month,
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.800]   that's when YouTube sends out their pay.
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:49.280]   Do you get a check?
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:51.200]   - Oh yeah, I always get beer money from YouTube.
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:53.080]   - So that's good.
[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:54.480]   - It's quite nice.
[01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:56.200]   And then when I saw the news about shorts,
[01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:58.880]   I was like, well, maybe I could put more into shorts.
[01:59:58.880 --> 01:59:59.960]   - Oh, it works.
[01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:01.960]   - That and clothes that--
[02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:04.000]   - Well, you know what, Google's numbers,
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.840]   YouTube's numbers are so inflated.
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:08.760]   Maybe 10 million's not as much as it sounds, I don't know.
[02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:09.760]   And they're short.
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:12.080]   The idea is this is Google's TikTok competitor.
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:13.320]   - Yeah, right.
[02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:14.160]   - And I always told them--
[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:15.360]   - And they don't have TikTok,
[02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:16.920]   10 million's a lot of views.
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:18.160]   - Yeah, that's a lot.
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:22.680]   - Google has begun, this is for you, Stacey.
[02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:26.040]   Google has begun testing matter update for the Nest Hub Max.
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:30.360]   We'll give your Max Bridge and extender features.
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:32.880]   I have one of these Nest Hub Maxes.
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:36.160]   - I am, if you have the, yeah, if you have their,
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:38.880]   you can actually get their SDK and run matter today
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:39.720]   if you want.
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:41.080]   - Oh, what will that give me?
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:42.880]   - If they approve you.
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:45.040]   If you have any threat devices in your house
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:46.600]   that are also running on thread--
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:48.560]   - Which I probably do, I might not know it,
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:49.840]   but I probably do.
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:50.680]   - Yeah.
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:51.520]   - Yeah.
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:52.360]   - Exactly.
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:53.200]   - Right.
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:54.200]   How would you know?
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:57.920]   - If you have threat devices, do you have any Eve devices?
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:00:59.320]   - No.
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:00.720]   Eve's one of them?
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:01.560]   How about Wink?
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:04.200]   - Eve's the one, the Wink?
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:06.320]   - How about SmartThings?
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:08.800]   - No, no, those are not smart things.
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:10.640]   - How about Hue lights?
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:12.840]   - No, but Nanoleaves.
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:14.520]   - Nanoleaves.
[02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:15.360]   Okay.
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:16.200]   - The newer Nanoleaves.
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:17.040]   - You're gonna hit with the kids.
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:18.400]   - You're just messing with me, I know.
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:19.240]   - Yeah.
[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:23.600]   - Chromes incognito tab can now require
[02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:25.760]   your fingerprint on Android.
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:27.680]   Seems that's the opposite of incognito.
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:29.840]   - The opposite of what you want.
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:30.680]   - Begin it.
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:34.080]   So, you could, oh, this is--
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:36.120]   - Oh, I guess it's a hobby.
[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:38.200]   - To lock your incognito tabs.
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:39.040]   - Oh, oh.
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:41.200]   - So you can have some incognito tabs open,
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:43.320]   they'll be locked and then nobody'll be able to see them
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:45.280]   unless you prove it's you.
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:46.200]   Okay, that's fine.
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:49.080]   - Oh, so no one will look at your porn
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:51.360]   if they pick up your phone to look at your photos.
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:52.200]   - It's no point on my phone.
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:53.040]   - Got it.
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:53.880]   - What porn?
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:54.720]   - Just saying.
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:56.880]   - Just his TikTok is good enough.
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:01.240]   Look in the privacy and security settings,
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:03.560]   there will be a switch lock incognito tabs
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:05.080]   when you leave Chrome.
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:09.760]   Turn that on and you can have it be fingerprint based as well.
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:10.600]   Good.
[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:13.840]   And that's the Google change law.
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:15.920]   (dramatic music)
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:18.840]   - Honey, can you give me your fingerprint on your phone,
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:19.840]   please?
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:25.880]   Honey, just show me your face for a second.
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:27.640]   Okay, thank you.
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:31.880]   Thank you.
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:33.840]   I'm wise to you, Trix.
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:36.360]   All right, let's take a break when we come back.
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:39.440]   Your picks of the week, if you will.
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.520]   Thank you very much.
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:44.160]   This episode of this week in Google
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:47.480]   is brought to you by SecureWorks.
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:51.240]   SecureWorks is a leader in cyber security building solutions
[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:54.560]   for security experts by security experts.
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:57.400]   SecureWorks offers superior threat detection
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:00.080]   and rapid incident response,
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:03.160]   all while making sure that customers are never locked
[02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:04.920]   into a single vendor.
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:08.400]   SecureWorks offers an open extended detection
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:12.920]   and response platform called Tages XDR.
[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:13.840]   Why?
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:16.440]   Well, why do you have to ask?
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:19.240]   In 2022, cyber crime is gonna cost the world
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:23.800]   $7 trillion by 2025.
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:27.680]   That number is gonna be $10 and a half trillion.
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:30.640]   Last year, ransomware totaled $20 billion in damages.
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:33.040]   The tax occurred every 11 seconds.
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:35.480]   It's estimated by 2031.
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:38.640]   Ransomware will cost $265 billion a year
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:42.120]   and strike every two seconds.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:43.920]   How do you make sure your organization
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:45.400]   is not the next victim?
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:49.440]   The answer, SecureWorks Tages XDR.
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:52.480]   SecureWorks Tages provide superior detection,
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:57.480]   identifying over 470 billion security events every day.
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:01.680]   Prioritizing the true positive alerts,
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:04.320]   eliminating alert noise and allowing organizations
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:06.080]   to focus on the real threat.
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:08.560]   In addition, Tages offers unmatched response
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:10.560]   with automated response actions
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:13.800]   to eliminate threats before the damage is ever done.
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:16.480]   Whether your organization has a limited IT staff and budget
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:18.480]   or you run a well-funded, fully staffed,
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:20.280]   Security Operations Center,
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:22.400]   you'll receive customized support.
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:25.080]   With SecureWorks Tages managed XDR,
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:28.200]   you can easily leverage SecureWorks experts
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:32.320]   to investigate and respond to threats on your behalf.
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:35.520]   That cuts dwell times, decreases operational burdens
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:37.160]   and reduces cost.
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:40.080]   And with 24/7 by 365 coverage,
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:42.640]   whether you experience a Christmas Day security event
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:45.080]   or half your team's out sick, you can trust,
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:48.000]   SecureWorks is there behind you.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.880]   Many companies are facing a shortage of security talent.
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:53.160]   Hiring and retention are harder than ever.
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:55.680]   SecureWorks customizes the approach
[02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:57.000]   and the coverage level you get
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.360]   in order to give you exactly what you need.
[02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:01.480]   Bottom line, SecureWorks acts
[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:04.800]   as an extension of your security team on day one,
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:08.480]   alleviating cybersecurity talent caps.
[02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:09.800]   Now what happens if you've already found
[02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:11.320]   an intruder in your system?
[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:12.840]   There's no need to worry.
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:16.320]   Just write down this number 1-800-breached.
[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:18.480]   1-800-breached.
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:19.440]   That number will connect you
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:22.840]   with the SecureWorks Emergency Incident Response Team
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:26.160]   and they can provide you with immediate assistance.
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:30.480]   24/7 in responding to and remediating a possible cyber
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:32.120]   incident or data breach.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:34.400]   And you see there on the website.
[02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:35.720]   That's for the US and Canada,
[02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:38.840]   but regional numbers are also available.
[02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:42.400]   But if you're in the US or Canada 1-800-breached,
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:43.760]   at SecureWorks you can learn more
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:46.320]   about the ways today's threat environment is evolving
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:49.720]   and the risks it can present to your organization,
[02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:51.720]   including case studies,
[02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:54.640]   reports from their counter threat unit and more.

[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:10.720]   Thank you, SecureWorks for supporting us this week.
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:14.160]   Google, let us get a thing.
[02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:15.080]   - That one story. - Yeah,
[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:16.920]   you got one more story, okay.
[02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:17.920]   - I'm just gonna ask your opinion about it.
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:19.840]   I was curious, we saw this coming,
[02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:22.880]   but Spotify going heavy in audiobooks.
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:25.840]   - Yeah, I mean 300,000. - You do, do it.
[02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:27.680]   - I can't remember what Audible has.
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:31.040]   I think it's a good thing Audible really dominates.
[02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:34.680]   Right now it's a monopoly in effect, Amazon's Audible.
[02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:37.480]   There's others, there's Libro.fm and there's town court.
[02:06:37.480 --> 02:06:38.960]   - You can do all of them, Apple.
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:40.940]   - Apple sells Audible books.
[02:06:40.940 --> 02:06:44.560]   Google, I think, also sells Audible books.
[02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:47.640]   I don't remember where Google gets its books,
[02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:50.360]   but Audible really is kind of 90% of the market.
[02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:53.160]   So in a way, I think that's good.
[02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:56.480]   You're gonna pay per book, it's not a subscription.
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:57.320]   - Right. - And they're not.
[02:06:57.320 --> 02:06:58.840]   - You split it up where you want a given book
[02:06:58.840 --> 02:07:00.880]   and it's gonna be on Spotify, not Audible,
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:03.400]   or that was my, is it gonna fragment the market?
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:05.920]   - No, 'cause they make deals with publishers, right?
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:08.040]   - Okay. - So, you know,
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:11.440]   Random House has its books on a variety of services.
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:14.560]   Audible does its own exclusives, which is very smart.
[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:19.200]   And that's, this is Spotify trying to get out
[02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:21.720]   from under the thumb of the record industry.
[02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:24.360]   They are completely at the mercy
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:25.960]   of whatever the record industry decides.
[02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:29.160]   If they wanna charge more, Spotify pays more.
[02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:31.120]   If they charge less, Spotify pays less.
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:34.240]   So, you know, and if Taylor Swift doesn't like Spotify,
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:35.360]   that's it.
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:37.680]   So Spotify's looking for alternate revenue streams,
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:40.920]   podcasts clearly are, you know, a big focus.
[02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:43.760]   They've spent, I think they said that we're gonna spend,
[02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:47.480]   what is it, $500 million on podcasts?
[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:49.040]   They acquired a bunch of companies.
[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:51.400]   They bought Joe Rogan's show.
[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:54.040]   They bought a bunch of other shows for exclusive.
[02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:55.920]   I think they've spent more than a billion now,
[02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:58.320]   actually at this point. - Jeez.
[02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:01.240]   - So, this makes sense, you know, spoken word content.
[02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:02.400]   It's not music.
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:07.520]   I don't know, if you're a Spotify listener,
[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:10.200]   I guess you don't mind living in the app, right?
[02:08:10.200 --> 02:08:13.840]   - Yeah. - I mean, okay.
[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:17.200]   - I guess I have my Spotify app open more often than not.
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:20.760]   - I think really a lot of it is also,
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:24.680]   to me anyway, the deals these companies make with
[02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:27.320]   smart speakers.
[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:30.320]   Do you listen when you listen to an audiobook,
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:31.560]   do you listen to a smart speaker,
[02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:33.840]   or do you listen on a phone?
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:36.160]   - Sometimes. - Usually I know--
[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:37.520]   - No, smart speakers, not smart.
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:38.640]   - Well, I listen to the car,
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:41.720]   so that's just the phone paired to the car.
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:45.680]   But I will, because it's audible, I'll ask Echo to play,
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:47.880]   I'll say read to me, and it reads my book,
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:51.840]   unless it instead decides to play a movie from Netflix
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:55.000]   that I ask for, but usually it reads my book.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:00.360]   So, Audible is a sponsor I should mention.
[02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:03.560]   And I'm certainly not rooting against him.
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:05.760]   I'm kind of like an audible fanatic.
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:07.080]   - Yeah, so why? - But I think it's good
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:08.200]   that a lot of us are. - I think it's good
[02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:09.920]   to have competition, yeah.
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:13.080]   And of course, Simon and Schuster says yes, it's good.
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:16.600]   Competition also means perhaps,
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:21.600]   they can get a better deal from some of these companies.
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:26.240]   According to The Times, Audible is by far
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:31.080]   the biggest audiobook retailer with more than 760,000 titles.
[02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:33.040]   Many of them originals.
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:40.560]   Daniel Eck of Spotify says the company is
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:43.400]   prepared to invest heavily in order to compete with Audible.
[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:48.000]   Just as we've done in podcasting, expect us to play to win.
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:51.120]   Oh, I didn't even know they were playing to win.
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:52.280]   Oh no.
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:55.240]   What does that mean, Daniel?
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:56.160]   Play to win.
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:57.000]   You competing against me?
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.320]   - Okay, we can't make fun of people for their mind,
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:03.120]   I mean, we can't, but it's silly.
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:04.840]   - Well, who are they competing with?
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:06.480]   - I understand it with audiobooks
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:08.520]   and competing with Audible, I guess.
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:10.640]   Who are they competing with with podcasts?
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:14.320]   All the little independent podcasts.
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:15.160]   - Well, that's the idea.
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:16.760]   - Yeah, I'll give you the ecosystem.
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:19.400]   'Cause I know they're competing with the ecosystem, exactly.
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:20.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:23.320]   - Or the ecosystem.
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:26.280]   - The eco-echo, it's all the same to me.
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:28.640]   Stacy Higginbotham, your thing in a week.
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:32.640]   - Okay, so I don't, did y'all talk about this?
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:36.160]   'Cause it's really a, did y'all talk about this last week?
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:40.000]   My story about matter?
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.040]   - No, you know, your story?
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:44.000]   No, what was your story?
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.680]   - I don't usually promote my own stuff, y'all, so.
[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:48.760]   - Promote it away. - Bear with me.
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:51.800]   But I did on my newsletter last week
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:53.320]   and I think it came out Monday,
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:57.320]   maybe five ways matter with disappoint users at launch.
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:10:59.160]   For a second there, I thought I typed lunch in my headline,
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:00.000]   it was like, "I'm..."
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.240]   (laughing)
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:04.280]   And I think this is important to talk about
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:07.240]   because I have been really extolling the virtues of matter.
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:11.200]   And I spent last week in Austin eating tacos
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:13.320]   and attending this particular event.
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:14.720]   - That's where you were.
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:16.800]   - Ah, secret.
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:18.560]   Nothing is really secret in my life.
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:23.760]   And I have to say, you should check this out
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:27.360]   because there's, matter is, it's not gonna be a failure,
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:30.120]   but it is not gonna be as cool as we all wanted it to be.
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:32.280]   And there's a couple reasons for that.
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:34.240]   One is it's very complicated
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:36.920]   and so things are gonna break for like heavy users.
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:39.160]   And I think that's really important to note.
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:42.720]   Anyway, so I, y'all should just check this out
[02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:45.720]   if your matter's, if you're interested in that.
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:50.320]   - So what's a heavy user means?
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:51.160]   I don't know.
[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:53.520]   - Well, like so some things like,
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:56.880]   if you hear someone who has lots of complicated routines,
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:59.640]   matter is probably not gonna help you very much.
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:04.320]   If you want to, like my home when I switch over to matter,
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:05.680]   it might be rough going.
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:07.940]   (laughing)
[02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:11.720]   Developers, like one of the biggest promises of matter
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:14.440]   was that developers would be able to build once
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:15.760]   and won't need it.
[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:19.280]   But since 2019 when it was launched,
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:22.400]   there's been a lot of programs on top of that.
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:24.680]   So things like Google's Home Device SDK
[02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:26.920]   and Intelligence clusters,
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:29.040]   Amazon's ambient home developer kit,
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:30.960]   where they're like trying to tell your stuff
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:33.000]   if you're home or away or not.
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.240]   That all is way above matter.
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:37.040]   So you're still going, if you're a developer,
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:39.640]   you're still going to have to focus on those, right?
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:40.840]   So that's kind of sucky.
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:42.840]   What else is that?
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:45.840]   - So matter is really a low level interface is not.
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:47.160]   - Super low level.
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:52.160]   And like a lot of your devices too,
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:54.880]   one of the other values was that you weren't gonna have
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:55.960]   as many apps, right?
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:57.720]   Like I was really looking forward to dumping
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:00.200]   a lot of my like one off apps.
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:02.440]   That's probably not gonna be the case for things
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:06.000]   like my smart plugs that track energy monitoring.
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.400]   The energy monitoring isn't gonna come through on matter.
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:09.840]   So I'm gonna still need that.
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:13.720]   Even your lock apps are gonna have like setting codes
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:16.440]   and things like that might not be supported with matter.
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:20.560]   So it's just they over promise they're gonna under deliver.
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:22.960]   It'll get better over time, but it's still like,
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:25.560]   I think this is probably a good level set.
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:26.880]   - So where would you at this point
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:31.720]   will recommend people go for a capable home hub?
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:37.600]   I mean, all of the most support matter eventually, yes?
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:40.920]   - Well, I mean, like the big ones, yes.
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:43.480]   I think if you are just a normal person
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:46.000]   who wants some convenience like lights,
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.800]   if you're an Apple user, do home kit.
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:51.200]   If you're Google or Amazon person, you can do those too.
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:56.200]   Most normal people should not be like smart things is nice.
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:14:00.280]   I like it, but it's too much for like normal people.
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:03.400]   - If I use phone kit, do I also get access
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:04.520]   to matter capabilities?
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:06.000]   Can it talk to other devices?
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:06.840]   - Yes.
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:10.720]   - So you're really choosing the higher level interfaces
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:13.560]   gonna come from whatever system you choose.
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:16.040]   And matter is really an interoperability layer
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:20.560]   so that you can have multiple devices in the same house.
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:22.480]   - It's an interoperability.
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:23.840]   It's so you don't have to sit there
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:25.760]   and like when you're buying a light bulb, go,
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:27.520]   crap, does this work with Madam A
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:29.040]   or does this work with G?
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:32.960]   - Well, but you can see that it works with matter.
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:34.760]   - A light bulb's gonna have all those logos.
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:36.640]   It's not gonna just stop with the matter logo.
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:38.000]   It's gonna have all those.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.560]   - Well, yeah, that's someone else was very upset over that.
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:42.880]   They're like, I still have to do all the logos.
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:46.360]   I was like, oh, sorry, they're like so many badges.
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:49.840]   But prior to this, you didn't actually know.
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:54.840]   Like, your ring sensors don't work with your Google stuff.
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.280]   And now if you buy a ring, a matter of security sensor,
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:01.880]   or sorry, a ring security sensor that's matter certified,
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:03.680]   it will talk to your Google home.
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:07.320]   - Oh, my, I feel like I'm not unusual in thinking,
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:09.600]   ain't nobody got time for this.
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:10.600]   This isn't true.
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:12.440]   (laughing)
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:16.600]   I got more important things to do than this.
[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:17.840]   - That's fair.
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:21.440]   Well, that's, anyway, that's my, it's not really a thing.
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:23.320]   Also, Kevin reviewed a Laura Winters,
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:24.800]   or a Laura developer kit.
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:26.760]   So if you're-- - I saw you built one.
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:28.120]   Or that was Kevin's article.
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:29.260]   - Kevin did, that's Kevin.
[02:15:29.260 --> 02:15:31.320]   - I was so impressed, I thought you did it.
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:33.400]   Got your little soldering out.
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:35.480]   - She was busy changing the oil of the car.
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:36.320]   - Yeah.
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:38.960]   - I was like, I could have done it, but Kevin was like--
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:40.280]   - In the Tesla?
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:41.120]   - Yeah.
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:43.840]   (laughing)
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:46.040]   - I was busy plugging it in.
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:47.960]   I mean, Kevin loves that stuff.
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:49.920]   And I gotta give him fun stuff,
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:51.720]   'cause I gotta write all the boring business stuff
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:52.560]   that he doesn't want to do.
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:54.040]   - Ooh, yeah, yeah.
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:55.480]   - See, yeah.
[02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:56.920]   - And so now that he's got it going,
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:15:58.920]   what do you do with it?
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:00.560]   - He's just sending data today.
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:02.720]   He asked for good, he was like,
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:05.080]   "Send Project in the show that comes out tomorrow."
[02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:06.520]   He asked for Project IBS.
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:08.520]   - Okay, cool.
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:09.520]   Nice. - Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:11.040]   I mean, it's a sweet little kit.
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:12.600]   It's kind of pricey, as I'm putting out.
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:14.640]   - It's a sparrowed velvet kit.
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:17.520]   - Yeah, it's Ray Aussie's company.
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:18.360]   - Oh, is it?
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:19.440]   - Oh. - Yeah.
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:22.600]   Blues Wireless is Ray Aussie's latest company.
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:24.080]   - Well, that's a step down.
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:25.880]   (laughing)
[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:26.720]   What's he gonna do next?
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:27.560]   - So, really?
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:29.040]   - See, it says, "I'll file a place inserts."
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:30.640]   What's this? - Ooh.
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:32.480]   - Ooh. - Ooh.
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:33.920]   - Well, it's connectivity.
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:36.280]   - He was like a big shy of Microsoft.
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:39.760]   He created Lotus Notes. - Lotus Notes.
[02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:44.240]   - Now he's doing like boxes to connect things.
[02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:49.240]   - No, he's doing connectivity plans for IoT devices.
[02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:51.760]   Shh.
[02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:52.760]   It'll be big.
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:53.600]   Go on. - It'll be huge.
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:58.040]   Some day, some day it'll be huge.
[02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:00.960]   - He was not prepared for the dig against Ray Aussie.
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:02.840]   - Aussie's, yeah.
[02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:03.800]   Are you buddies?
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:04.640]   I'm sorry.
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:06.080]   I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:07.920]   - We live in the same place.
[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:11.320]   - He's on the island, my favorite island.
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:13.040]   - No, he lives in Seattle.
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:14.480]   Your favorite island's Mercer.
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:16.880]   Don't even try to convince me otherwise.
[02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:18.320]   - I don't know yet. - You're too she-shey
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:19.160]   for me, Ray. - I don't know yet.
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:20.000]   We gotta go.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:20.840]   We gotta go.
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:21.680]   We gotta check.
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:23.360]   We gotta check it out.
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:25.480]   See what for main bridge?
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:29.160]   - We gotta move next door to Ray Aussie.
[02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:30.000]   - Shh.
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:30.840]   - Shh.
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:32.160]   - Shh.
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:34.000]   I'm shh.
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.520]   - Jeff Jarvis, number of the week.
[02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:37.720]   - Well, since we were talking about books,
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:39.160]   I was starting to research something.
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:43.040]   During the Department of Justice
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:45.640]   versus Penguin Random House trial going on,
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:48.840]   trying to stop the acquisition of Simon & Schuster,
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:52.200]   there was a thing that resonated all around
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:56.080]   the literary Twitter about how few books sell.
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:59.920]   And so NPD book scans, Kristin McLean came in
[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:02.080]   and used the numbers and gave this,
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:04.720]   which I thought maybe you might find interesting.
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:09.720]   So total number of titles, new titles last year,
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:11.840]   487000. - Wow.
[02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:14.280]   - She looked only at the top 10 publishers.
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:17.200]   All right, so the 50s guys are gonna make money, right?
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:20.560]   So out of that, they've published 45,000 titles.
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:21.640]   Got me so far?
[02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:22.880]   - Yeah.
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:26.720]   - Out of 45,000 titles, how many do you think sold
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:28.000]   more than 100,000?
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.560]   - That's not, I've got even got a million,
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:32.880]   I'm just taking 100,000 as a decent,
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:34.360]   decent good popular say.
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:35.200]   - Stacey, what'd you say?
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:36.120]   - 4%.
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:37.040]   - 12.
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:39.720]   - Yeah, I was gonna say it doesn't do.
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:42.320]   163.4%.
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:43.680]   - 0.4%.
[02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:46.920]   - So of those who sold between 50,000 and 100,000
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:48.520]   about double that, right?
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:49.560]   300,000.
[02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:52.040]   But you get that all the way down the bottom.
[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:56.200]   14.7% of these books,
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:19:02.120]   6,700 of them sold fewer than 12 copies.
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:03.560]   - Oh, that's so depressing.
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:05.240]   - Oh, that was the 12, okay, yeah.
[02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:06.840]   - That was the 12.
[02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:11.240]   51% half of them sold between 12,000, 12 copies
[02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:12.360]   and 1000 copies.
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:14.000]   - You're gonna sell 12 to the author
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.640]   and the author's mother.
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:16.480]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:17.560]   - Alone.
[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:18.400]   - Yeah.
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:19.240]   - Well, you actually get free copies.
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:20.880]   - You tried a book in 12.
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:23.440]   You can't sell 12 copies to your friends at family.
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:24.880]   - No, so depressing.
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:25.720]   - I know, isn't that--
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:26.720]   - I would cry.
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:28.520]   - I mean, I feel like if I published a book,
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:31.280]   I could probably get 100 people to buy it, Max.
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:32.120]   - I can't.
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:35.640]   - You don't, I thought your book, Aunt.
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:37.880]   - You have, my mom wouldn't even buy it.
[02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:40.320]   She was like, boy, move.
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:45.320]   - My best selling book was I think 55,000 copies.
[02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:48.440]   - Which is good, that's the second time you're there.
[02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:51.240]   - Well, with having a TV show behind it, you know,
[02:19:51.240 --> 02:19:52.480]   it's still pretty-- - Exactly.
[02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:54.800]   - It was, Pearson was very happy,
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:57.040]   but it was like, so there's no money
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:19:58.680]   and this is what you're saying, they're saying, yeah.
[02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:01.400]   - So Will Page, who was the former chief economist
[02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:04.760]   at Spotify, also in part of this discussion,
[02:20:04.760 --> 02:20:09.520]   for context said that out of the 6.3 million artists
[02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:11.840]   on Spotify, just let that sink in,
[02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:14.840]   6.3 million singer and singer and songwriters in the world,
[02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:16.880]   everybody wants to give you his their song.
[02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:20.040]   78% of them have a monthly audience of fewer than 50.
[02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:21.960]   - Mm.
[02:20:21.960 --> 02:20:24.720]   - Yeah, I believe it.
[02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:25.560]   - Yep.
[02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:27.480]   - If the buy was your song-- - If the buy was a shout out
[02:20:27.480 --> 02:20:29.400]   to my favorite singer songwriter,
[02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:32.000]   Slae Cleves, he's amazing.
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:35.000]   - The good news is if you put poo poo in the title,
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:40.000]   you make millions because two-year-olds love to shout,
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:43.400]   echo, play poo poo.
[02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:46.080]   - No, it's so-- - I am not kidding.
[02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:47.360]   - Show titles. - This is--
[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:49.600]   (laughing)
[02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:53.640]   - They, I'm not, anybody's got a title in the house knows.
[02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:56.640]   They love doing that and they'll do it over and over and over again.
[02:20:56.640 --> 02:20:58.120]   - They do, they like farts too.
[02:20:58.120 --> 02:20:58.960]   - Yep.
[02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:00.880]   - Speaking of disinformation poo poo and farts,
[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:02.280]   I should talk about disinformation online
[02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:04.560]   and give a plug to our friend Joe Donovan's book,
[02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:06.520]   Memoirs, is out right now.
[02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:07.360]   - Ooh.
[02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:10.920]   - Should have had poo poo in the title.
[02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:12.840]   - So now available on Spotify Plus,
[02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:15.120]   the Poop song by the toilet bowl cleaners,
[02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:17.840]   Poop song and lyrics by Donald Glover.
[02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:20.840]   You never gonna poop on the floor by--
[02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:23.840]   - And if you play it, Evie's, we'll get taken off YouTube.
[02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:25.760]   (laughing)
[02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:27.400]   - How about you thought we ran out--
[02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:28.560]   - You need to serve it.
[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:30.040]   - You thought we ran out of poop.
[02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:30.880]   (laughing)
[02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:33.480]   You thought we ran out of poop song ideas.
[02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:36.120]   You were wrong by the toilet bowl cleaners.
[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:40.840]   Poop clouds, this toilet bowl cleaners actually have a whole
[02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:42.000]   album of this. - album?
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:42.840]   - Yeah.
[02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:46.120]   - Randy Licki poops 11 times a day,
[02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:48.480]   poop sneeze, Bristol stool chart.
[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:50.680]   I want stomach flu because I love to poo.
[02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:52.040]   - You could stop now, you could stop.
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:54.080]   - Tell me if I'm a booger on my nose.
[02:21:54.080 --> 02:21:54.920]   - Please stop.
[02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:55.920]   Stop, stop, stop.
[02:21:55.920 --> 02:21:57.600]   (laughing)
[02:21:57.600 --> 02:22:02.600]   - And of course, the magnum opus, I didn't pee on my tie.
[02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:07.760]   Huge, these guys make a lot of money.
[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:11.200]   I'm just saying. - Yeah.
[02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:13.600]   - Mr. Anthony, prove it.
[02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:15.280]   - You're picking the week.
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:20.280]   - My pick is in shot for your iOS or Android devices.
[02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:21.640]   - Yeah. - They are.
[02:22:21.640 --> 02:22:25.600]   - Editing the app for photos and video.
[02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:30.760]   I've been playing with it in contrast to using Premier Rush
[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:32.640]   on my mobile device.
[02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:35.080]   And it's pretty bad, I'm slick.
[02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:38.000]   It's got nice transitions, really easy to use.
[02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:42.920]   And the video quality comes out 30 frames per second,
[02:22:42.920 --> 02:22:44.840]   like it should.
[02:22:44.840 --> 02:22:47.760]   - And I like it. - You can do stills and movies.
[02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:50.520]   - Yeah. - That's nice.
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:52.840]   - Free ads in it. - Free ads in it.
[02:22:52.840 --> 02:22:54.120]   - Yeah, there's some ads. - Oh, yes.
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:57.040]   - And you know, if you want to,
[02:22:57.040 --> 02:22:59.480]   if you're in a session and you want to stop the ads
[02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:01.520]   from popping up, you just have to watch a long one,
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:02.840]   similar to how we talked about it
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:05.280]   to begin into the show with Hulu.
[02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:07.840]   And then you can just continue doing what you need to do
[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:10.480]   without any ad interruptions.
[02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:14.120]   - Can you pay to get rid of the ads or is that not?
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:15.080]   - I don't think so.
[02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:16.840]   I don't remember seeing that option.
[02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:18.120]   - Yeah.
[02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:19.120]   Nice.
[02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:21.080]   In a shot. - Nice though.
[02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:22.560]   'Cause I've been using Premier Rush
[02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:25.000]   and Premier Rush gets on my nerves some days.
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:28.240]   They could do a lot better with Adobe.
[02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:30.520]   And hopefully with our very own,
[02:23:30.520 --> 02:23:33.760]   all about Android miss when to it now,
[02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:34.880]   be in there at Adobe,
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:37.280]   maybe that's something that's going to change.
[02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:39.800]   - Oh, she got a job at Adobe, did she?
[02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:41.120]   - Yeah, she's at Adobe now.
[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:42.800]   - Nice, good for her.
[02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:44.960]   - She's, we've chatted.
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:46.320]   I'll just say that.
[02:23:46.320 --> 02:23:48.640]   - Yeah, that's great.
[02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:52.960]   - And my last pick, this is from him,
[02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:55.680]   I don't know, I can't think of the name,
[02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:57.080]   but someone sent this to me on Twitter
[02:23:57.080 --> 02:23:59.120]   and I thought it was pretty daggum cool.
[02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:02.000]   And it's Mike Parker Nick,
[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.800]   poker Nick. (laughs)
[02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:06.440]   Sorry if I mispronounced on your last name,
[02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:09.520]   but it's AI portraits, imagine how celebrities would look
[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:11.320]   if they were still alive today.
[02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:15.440]   - He has a Instagram,
[02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:19.160]   this is, he uses AI to do this.
[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:22.440]   Here's Princess Diana, if she were still alive today.
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:23.400]   I think these are,
[02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:27.440]   what I wanna do is do one for me, that's--
[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:29.000]   - I didn't like that one,
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.600]   'cause I think you got that one wrong.
[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:33.280]   - This is who, who's this?
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:34.120]   - That's Michael Jackson.
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:35.120]   - Oh, MJ.
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:36.400]   - Oh my, oh.
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:37.240]   - Okay.
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:39.000]   - 'Cause that's Michael Jackson from the '70s.
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:40.520]   Michael Jackson from the '90s.
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:41.840]   - Exactly. - Exactly.
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:44.440]   - There's an EY house,
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:46.360]   you know, she wouldn't be that old now.
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:48.280]   Here's the Beatles.
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:51.440]   So actually Sir Paul and Ringo, that's what they look like,
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:53.360]   but this is what John Lennon would look like now,
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:55.280]   what George Harrison would look like now.
[02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:57.240]   It's really good.
[02:24:57.240 --> 02:24:58.080]   - I mean, it's a guest.
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:24:59.240]   - He's a guest. - He's a ledger.
[02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:03.680]   - Yeah, he's ledger as if he didn't have the,
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:07.800]   this is Freddie Mercury wearing suspenders.
[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:10.680]   Like a little like Tom Selleck, but I guess he would, right?
[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:13.040]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:15.040]   My favorite one is that one, Tupac.
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:15.880]   - Tupac.
[02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:19.000]   - 'Cause a lot of the rappers from the '90s
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:22.280]   and early 2000s, I've seen them today
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:24.800]   and most of them have aged pretty much about
[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:26.400]   like how that image looks.
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:27.240]   - Interesting.
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:30.960]   He's Turkish, so some of these are,
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:32.680]   he was Turkish, that's John Lennon.
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:36.520]   Who is this?
[02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:38.360]   Madonna.
[02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:40.440]   - Well, I don't think we have to guess.
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:41.840]   She's already in her 60s.
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:43.920]   (laughs)
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:45.240]   - Oh.
[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:47.280]   - And then she doesn't look like that.
[02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:49.960]   He has some other AI artwork too, which is beautiful.
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:52.920]   So this is mid-journey.
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:55.300]   So he does some interesting stuff.
[02:25:55.300 --> 02:25:57.760]   Those ducks are real.
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:25:59.080]   - Yeah, pretty good stuff.
[02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:00.160]   - They're not AI.
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:04.480]   - Yeah, I did a mid-journey the other day of,
[02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:09.080]   I think I said like Milky Way at night in Napa Valley.
[02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:10.440]   Just it was something really simple.
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:12.600]   I didn't, it came out quite nicely.
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:15.440]   And a lot of people in Jordan, I had to be very clear.
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:17.520]   This is not my photograph.
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:19.280]   This is AI.
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:20.120]   - Right.
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:23.560]   - And I think that's a problem that we could probably run
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:27.320]   into in the future with people using these tools
[02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:31.280]   to create the art and taking all the credit for it.
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:35.400]   And I don't know if that's necessarily right.
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:38.880]   - Well, just make sure you get the Getty images
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:42.520]   watermark off of it before you try to pass it off.
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:45.000]   - Trust me, I've severed my relationship with Getty.
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:46.440]   Getty don't pay enough money.
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:50.840]   - And throw it hands-on photography.
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:53.720]   - What's coming up on a hop?
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:58.240]   - This week, what is the show this week?
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:26:59.080]   - I did a report. - You said something.
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:00.840]   I thought it sounded really good.
[02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:02.200]   - Yesterday, or at a time. - Just a real meeting,
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:03.360]   but I don't remember either.
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:05.480]   - Oh, I'm gonna talk about the iPhone, the new iPhone.
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:06.960]   - Oh, that's right, using the iPhone camera.
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:09.400]   - Yeah. - Everybody's pretty excited
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:11.080]   about that camera, so I figure out
[02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:13.400]   what to do in an episode and share my two cents on it.
[02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:14.920]   - Nice.
[02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:16.880]   You can't borrow mine though.
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:19.040]   - No, don't worry, I'm not.
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:20.480]   - I need it.
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:22.400]   I gotta take pictures of Rodder Waters.
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:24.520]   - Oh, right.
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:26.680]   Mr. Jamby was talking about the concert
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:28.000]   that he went to Tuesday.
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:29.760]   - Right, he went to, he's been,
[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:31.280]   he's been to like a dozen of them,
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:33.920]   but we're all going on Friday.
[02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:38.440]   Mike is going, Jason Hall's going, right?
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:40.880]   We're all going, it's gonna be exciting.
[02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:43.040]   - Ant, you could come.
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:44.280]   - Football. - Benito.
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:45.440]   - Football. - Football.
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:47.880]   - Oh, college season. - High school football.
[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:49.560]   - High school and college. - High school and college.
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:50.960]   - Oh, you can't do that. - Football season.
[02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:52.680]   Gotta have our priorities here.
[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:55.440]   - And of course, Jeff Jarvis is the director
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:27:57.320]   of the townite center for entrepreneur Lydron
[02:27:57.320 --> 02:27:58.600]   and another great number.
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:00.600]   - Grinding, yeah.
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:03.400]   New mark, graduate school journalism
[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:04.680]   at the city university.
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:07.560]   - New York. - New York.
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:09.040]   Hey, Jeff. - I'm taking a breath
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:10.360]   so you can say that, sir.
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:12.360]   - I could say it in one breath.
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:13.360]   Ready?
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:14.320]   The director of the townite center
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:15.280]   for entrepreneur journalism
[02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:16.360]   at the Craig Newmark Graduate School
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:18.600]   of Journalism at the city university of New York.
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:19.880]   One breath, such a problem.
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:22.880]   - Such a problem. - No problem.
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:25.200]   - Yeah, but I don't think you read the whole card, right?
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:26.720]   - Well, I didn't read this part.
[02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:29.200]   - Google Share heard a former TV guy,
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:30.480]   Craig Frank Sinatra called him a bum,
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:31.480]   Ray Crock called him a nickel,
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:32.960]   a million amor if he brown called him a bottom,
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:34.480]   must be the eight formerly one of San Francisco's
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:37.880]   (indistinct)
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:39.720]   - And Pat Sage, Jack Hates him.
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:41.080]   - And Pat Sage, Jack Hates him,
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:43.240]   says it right at the bottom.
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:44.400]   Hated by-- - One of those pit.
