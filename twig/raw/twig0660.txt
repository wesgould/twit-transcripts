[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.400]   It looks like it's gone for good in the company that makes vodka out of thin air.

[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.480]   The Google verse, the Twitter verse, the meta verse.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.560]   And all the verses with Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on IOT.com at Gigastacey.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.080]   Keeping up with the Higginbotham fame.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080]   And lovely.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.840]   Look at that lovely cup of tea.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.800]   You know what's interesting?
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.200]   Because I'm sitting right next to a guy who's got a lovely cup of joe.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   Look at this.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   Aunt Pruitt.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   Look at that.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   Same cup.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.800]   Only his is a lot larger.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.600]   Oh, she did find my glasses.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   Oh my glasses fell off.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   Sorry.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   Oh.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.600]   Which one's Aunt size?
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.920]   Buck, can you get me the cup that Russell was using?
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.880]   Because I want, I mean, if you're all going to have white cups, I want my own.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.800]   Also with his Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   Professor.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   You have no cup.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.800]   You have no cup.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   Professor.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   There you go.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   He's got Starbucks.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.800]   There we go.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.520]   The Leonard Taill Professor for journalistic innovation at the Cray.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520]   Cray.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.040]   Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.200]   Okay, Aunt.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.160]   Your cup next to my cup.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.800]   Something wrong with this picture.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   No.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   It's Goldilocks.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   It's my little cup.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   It's my little tiny cup.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   It's the size of each of your arms.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   It compares it for a lot of different things.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.080]   One of these things is not like the other.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.080]   Wow.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.080]   My Breville coffee.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   Oh, God.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.080]   Cheers.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   Cheers to me.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.160]   I think if you have a cup like this, you have to go.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.960]   Somebody needs some infrared.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.960]   I don't know what that means, and I'm not going to ask.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   All right.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.360]   Tucker Carlson, Tucker Carlson reference.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.520]   Oh, oh, you're talking about the new, all the rage.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.520]   No.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.840]   We're not going there.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.920]   It's too early.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920]   You know what?
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.960]   The only thing I'm not going to say anything, but the only thing that was funny about that
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.040]   whole thing is that it was a bridge too far, even for kid rock.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.880]   That was a bridge too far.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.920]   I'm just saying.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   Well, bad, bad day.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.480]   Bad go no good terrible day for Netflix yesterday.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.880]   They had to announce for the first time ever a loss of subscribers.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.960]   Not a huge number, 100,000 subscribers, but it sure killed the stock.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.600]   You sure it has 100,000?
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   Sorry, 200,000.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.600]   All right.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.920]   Well, that's still a bit as compared to whatever millions they have, right?
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.720]   Well, Wall Street saying they may lose up to 2 million by July.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.440]   I don't know where that number came from, but that's apparently part of the reason behind
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.800]   the freak out.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.840]   It's kind of it's a bit bad in the fact that it's for the first time ever that they lost
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.840]   subscribers.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.560]   So it's like, oh my God.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.000]   It's a real measure though of how Wall Street just wants internal growth.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.200]   So here's the graph from Axios.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.320]   Actually, this is Aaron Davis at Axios did this chart of percentage chain and global
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.800]   streaming customers.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   10%, 10%, 5%, but always up, always up until we got to this little red slice right here
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.800]   was down 0.1%.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.600]   I mean, it's not the end of the world.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.640]   Netflix is saying we're going to start looking at, this is something Ben Thompson called
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.160]   for a few weeks ago, ads supported.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.880]   I don't want ads in my Netflix.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.400]   I think that could go the other way for them, right?
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.560]   The stock, which had already been down 40% so far this year, it was down another almost
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.880]   30%.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.440]   I think competition from Disney, right?
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   HBO.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.520]   Competition from Disney, HBO, they put a lot of money into building content and they also
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.080]   have been raising prices.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.440]   They've had two price hikes in the last year to have.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.800]   That's what I was going to get to.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.280]   What about inflation?
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.520]   People aren't making as much money nowadays and they're just trying to cut costs.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.520]   It is what it is.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.840]   I did think though that in COVID, this was like heaven for streaming services, right?
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.640]   Because girls stuck at home.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.920]   Netflix model is tough though because all the catalogs being pulled back by the various
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.520]   other streaming services who want it for themselves.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.000]   They lost the office to Peacock and all that.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.960]   They have to do, yeah, Marvel goes to Disney.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.560]   They have to do original content, which is expensive.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.480]   I think that's the reason the prices went up.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.600]   Netflix has 222 million paying subscribers.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.560]   There might have been a little hint about this because last week Netflix said, "We're
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.960]   going to get all of you freeloaders who are borrowing your subscription from somebody
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.120]   else to pay."
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.360]   They estimate that's 100 million households, 30 million in the US and Canada, that don't
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.520]   pay for Netflix but borrow a password.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.840]   That is an astonishing number to me.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.760]   I just can't believe.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.200]   I'm like, wow, I mean, do you have?
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.240]   I pay for my own subscription and I do not share it.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.800]   It's only shared in the house under last pass.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.840]   Nobody knows the password.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.760]   I think my kids might be using my Netflix but that was originally, they were in the household
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.080]   and then they went to college.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.440]   At that point, I said, "Well, yeah, you can take it with you."
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.440]   Probably shouldn't have though, right?
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.440]   I don't know.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.520]   Right now, they're all living on their own.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.680]   They probably shouldn't be using my Netflix, I guess.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.680]   Yeah, I would assume.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.920]   I do think it's kind of an interesting thing.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.000]   Do your own account, if it were me.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   It's expensive.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.520]   It's expensive but it's also, think about like cell phone plans.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.160]   Are your kids still on your cell phone?
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.160]   Yes.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.560]   Hard head is not on my plan anymore.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   Hard head is on his own.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.560]   You are.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.560]   It was at a man in the eye.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.560]   Was that a man in the eye?
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.560]   Was that a man in the eye?
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.560]   Yeah, he's in college now.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.560]   College of a job?
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.560]   He works.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.040]   Yes, so he can't afford to.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.640]   My kids have jobs but I still pay.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.360]   I pay for everybody's cell phone.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.920]   I pay for Lisa's ex-husband's cell phone.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.880]   Will you adopt me?
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.800]   I bought yourself a phone and they'll pay for your service.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.280]   You bought this one.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.280]   You bought Stacey's.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.280]   I bought, yeah.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.280]   Do you use that by the way?
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.280]   Is that flip phone and you like it?
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.280]   I do.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.280]   Okay, good.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.280]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.280]   How about the komba?
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.280]   Do you want to miss it in the back?
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.280]   No, how about the komba reader?
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.960]   Okay, so I have to tell you, now I have a plethora of e-readers because from my
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.120]   birthday, my husband got me the latest Kindle because it's waterproof.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.480]   Andrew and I have got to start to coordinate your gifts.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.720]   Yeah, yeah, I've got to coordinate because now I've got three e-readers.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.840]   I only need one and I don't know what to do with them.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.920]   Well, yeah, give it to your kid, doesn't she want one?
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.160]   She refuses to read things on Kindle.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.160]   She likes paper.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.160]   She's in a book.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.160]   I have a little hipster tween here, or teen.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.840]   Anyway, Disney+ is also looking at ads.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.240]   I feel like that's why we pay for Netflix and Disney+.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.280]   Hulu had ads and I ended up paying for the higher tier because I don't want to see ads,
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.480]   especially in the early days of these networks where the ads are the same over and over and
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.480]   over.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:57.920]   What's so important about this, I think, is that the dial goes one way or the other.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.280]   The thing was supported by advertising, everything is supported by subscription and now it's
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.960]   going to go back.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.800]   But are they going to be able to get the ads?
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.280]   The ad market is shrinking.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.880]   I don't know.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.760]   This is not actually, I have a number this week.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.600]   This is a, I don't know if you put this in or Stacey did.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.760]   Carl Bodie who, yeah, you used to work with him at a gig.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.360]   Oh, of course, he's great.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.040]   I enjoy this is Twitter thread.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.080]   It's a good thread.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.920]   I always enjoy watching one time innovators, aka Netflix.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.600]   Now huge and successful pivot to turf protection.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.520]   It always involves using all kinds of distorted logic to justify making their product worse
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.360]   to please investors.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.640]   In other words, adding ads, I guess.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.000]   Like here in the Netflix letter to investors where they claim the problem with password
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.160]   sharing, by the way, Carl points out streaming executives used to love and noted it had no
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.960]   material impact on subscriber totals and revenues.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.520]   That may still be true, by the way, because if somebody's sharing a password, do you think
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.520]   they're going to have once it's revoked go out and buy Netflix or just say, well, I
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.040]   don't know some, but not all.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.040]   That was always the argument.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.160]   You can take a trip that into a business bottle where I could create my own club on Netflix
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.400]   and get a cut of convincing aunt to be on my group and that kind of stuff.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.200]   I know people are doing that.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.200]   To meet investor demand, Bodie goes on, is it Bodie or Bodie?
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.200]   I was at Bodie.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   Okay.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   Carl Bod.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.800]   So I'm like, well, your way is different.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.200]   Have you ever met in person?
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.200]   No.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.200]   Oh, so how would you know?
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   Anybody should worship.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.840]   She actually lives in Seattle now, but I've never met him in person.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.840]   I like this Twitter.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.320]   We ought to have them on sometime.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.320]   Absolutely.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.320]   I've been reading him for years.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.320]   I love everything he writes.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320]   It's great.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.320]   He's been on the show, right?
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.320]   Oh, yeah, he has.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.320]   He was on my show.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.480]   And I asked him how to say his name, but I forgot.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.480]   Okay.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   I'll shock him.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.480]   I think it was Bodie.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.880]   I think that's why I say Bodie.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:06.240]   To meet investor demand for improved, just Carl to me.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.080]   To meet investor demand for improved quality, I'm sorry, quarterly returns at any cost under
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.680]   this lovely public model we've developed.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:20.480]   The company starts to effectively self cannibalize and make its product crappier and more expensive.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.480]   Like newspapers.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.440]   Price hikes, worst customer service, less features.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.520]   It's fewer features.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.520]   He needs your red pencil.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.520]   Grammarly.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.520]   Grammarly.

[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.640]   Well, yeah.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.640]   Okay.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:43.640]   Cable company spent the last few years winning a whining about how streaming password sharing
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.640]   is a great read today.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.280]   I did that when I'm first.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.280]   What you do for a living?
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.280]   Have a company.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:56.480]   I spent the last few years whining about how stream if I do it in a pompous voice, I never
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.720]   make mistakes.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   Do it.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.680]   Campbell companies spent the last few years whining about how streaming password sharing
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.680]   was piracy.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.800]   Netflix is increasingly been shoved toward that position by the market as well.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.680]   Despite the fact that it's well, not true.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.200]   Well, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.680]   but even the point is, you made the point which is what happens once you become successful,
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.160]   then it's all about covering your turf, protecting your turf, keeping your market share up.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.000]   Well, I, well, yes, I mean, you have to keep innovating at a certain point.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   That's hard.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   There's only so many times you can learn and relearn.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.560]   Yes, I saw the cell phone.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.040]   And all street demands constant growth.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.440]   You know, this is why I don't have public money in my company.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:52.160]   I can just coast along delivering a consistent product and I don't have to worry about anything.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.440]   They're not going to the door to give you millions?
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.040]   No, no one has knocked on my phone.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.040]   I don't even get stuffed ants but male.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.760]   But if they were, you wouldn't take it.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.600]   If they're, no, I'd probably just sell out, I'll be honest.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.880]   If someone wants to offer me a few million, I'd be like, yeah, take it.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.680]   Oh, believe me, but it would be more than a few million.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.680]   Come on, hold out.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.240]   I don't think so.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.800]   You know, I wouldn't want to stick around.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   What's your number?
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.280]   Oh, wait, no, no, wait a minute.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.200]   You got to stick around for three years.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.200]   Three years.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.040]   Isn't that usually, it's like, usually the, yeah, they're out.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.040]   You got to stick around.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.440]   So I don't know how much would you pay.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.440]   You just wouldn't do it.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.440]   I wouldn't.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.440]   I just feel like I'm thinking.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.440]   And you've got to make it grow in those three years to a certain level.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.000]   So Elon Musk comes along and says, Stacey, I want to buy Stacey on IoT.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.200]   I will give you $4.3 million.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.120]   It's worth a tenth of Twitter.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.440]   I mean, a thousandth of Twitter.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.640]   I mean, a hundred thousandth of Twitter.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.080]   I would say, I mean, if I had to stay on for three whole years, I would say no, they
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.080]   and grow it.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.080]   No, thank you.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.080]   No, you wouldn't do it stressful.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.080]   You know, couple years ago.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.880]   What do I do without money?
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.080]   Retire after three years.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.080]   Right?
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.760]   Would you want to retire?
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.280]   I mean, what would you do if you retired with your garden?
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.280]   Would you make cookies?
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.280]   I'm like, what would I do?
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.080]   Yeah, I would probably go work for a policy.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.520]   I would work for a thing.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.600]   Like make the world be a better place kind of thing.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.640]   Probably the same thing I do, but with resources to be like.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.640]   For free.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.640]   I would be absolutely.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.640]   Screw the man.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.640]   Lazy and love it.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.040]   If Elon said you have to meet with me in person, would you then?
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.040]   Elon wants his final answer.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.040]   I am never coming back to the table.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.040]   This is it.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.040]   $43 billion.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.040]   Although a lot of people have said, first of all, where is he going to get that money?
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.400]   He's going to have to sell a huge amount of Tesla stock.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   He's looking for it now.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.960]   I went to Goldman Sachs and others.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.440]   Some people are saying, well, you get some hedge funds involved.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.600]   The problem is it ain't going to stop at $43.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.920]   It's going to go closer to $50.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.000]   I've seen a number of so-called experts like Jim Kramer say he's not going to be able to
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   get the money.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.440]   No one else is going to buy Twitter.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.280]   It's not in play.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.120]   Who would want it?
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.920]   Well, hold on.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.360]   He wouldn't be able to get the money because he's trying to buy Twitter.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:20.080]   But are there assuming the risk is him not being able to get the money back because he's
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.880]   not earning enough off of Tesla?
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.720]   Oh, I would use his Tesla stock as the-
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.720]   As collateral.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.720]   Security against it.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.720]   And that is highly volatile.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.720]   Okay.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.720]   All right.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.720]   Interesting.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.720]   Oh, interesting.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.200]   A huge amount against the Tesla stock.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.200]   Right.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   Oh.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   Didn't know that.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.800]   So I'm, you know, I mean, we've talked about this probably beyond the point where it's
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.960]   interesting, but I'm just, do you think he was serious about doing it or?
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.920]   No, no.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.520]   Why not?
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.360]   What does he want with Twitter?
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.240]   I mean, what's the intention he's getting?
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.120]   He's getting exactly what he wanted, right?
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   He doesn't need the-
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   Right.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.120]   Attention and ego, you know?
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.000]   You don't need to actually spend money on something if you just, you know, shout loud
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.640]   enough about it in your Elon Musk.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.120]   He doesn't need the swirrs of Twitter.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.120]   He just wants the attention.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.160]   I mean, they were ready to put them on the board.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.920]   Well, as a way to stop them doing this, but yeah.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.560]   You know, I, well, I started filling things in on the run-out this morning and I put the
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.960]   beginnings of Twitter stuff down under Twitter thinking, "No, surely we're past this now.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.960]   Surely not."
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.960]   A huge amount kept going.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:36.960]   Well, even Ben Thompson has weighed in April 18th, a couple of days ago.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.760]   Back to the future of Twitter, this is, of course, Ben is one of our favorite strategists
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.480]   at Stratecary.com.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.320]   Is it Ch- or Ch- Stratecary?
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.400]   We say this every time.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.400]   It's Ch- My leave is Bode.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.440]   It's spelled Stratecary, but it's pronounced Bode.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.960]   We need like a style, a pronunciation guide for this show.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.960]   Literally, though.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.200]   But see, this is what's so interesting, Stacey, and you're discovering this now as a podcaster
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   as well.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.000]   Most of the time, all this stuff is just written.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.240]   No one has to say it out loud, but as podcasters/broadcasters, we have to say it out loud.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.320]   And oftentimes, for the first time, it's ever been said out loud, except by the person's
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.320]   mother.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.640]   So we have to figure it out.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:28.400]   That's why the, for us, the gif versus gif thing is so fraught.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.000]   We have to decide how it's pronounced.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.080]   I'm going to say Stratecary.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.760]   I believe that's correct.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.760]   Fair enough.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:40.280]   I actually choose words sometimes I catch myself to say, "Do I need to quote this person
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.000]   by name if I actually record the book?"
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Oh.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.400]   Ah, you know, that's an interesting question.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.400]   So I actually haven't read Ben's post.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:59.000]   So he suggested breaking it up into a social graph company and an app company.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.960]   I'm not sure that I really get what that means, but it's Ben, so we talk about him.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.200]   So I guess the social graph is the thing that you sell to advertisers.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.400]   It's the thing that people want to know.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.400]   Right.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.240]   And there's a per user value that you can then move out.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.240]   Right.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.000]   But what fills that social graph, what informs that social graph is the app.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.280]   So if you separate the two, suddenly your social graph no longer has the value that
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.280]   it had.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.760]   Well, that's the paradox of Twitter, right?
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.080]   When they killed the API, they go into my friend Bill Gross in there, but he tried to
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.920]   build monetization strategies on top of Twitter, and that's what scared them, and they shut
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.000]   it all down then.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.920]   Do you think now in hindsight, so Bill Gross's plan, he owned TweetDeck.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.120]   Actually, he owned a number, I think.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.120]   Well, no, he was no.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.120]   He actually got stopped by it.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.040]   He bought others, and then he was right by TweetDeck.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.720]   And they swooped in and said, "No," and bought it.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.040]   And that's what he knew that it was through.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.760]   So his plan, which is a, I thought, quite clever.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:03.600]   He's a smart fella friend of yours, was to buy up all the clients, and thereby, in effect,
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:09.080]   making his holdings more important than Twitter itself, because everybody would use his stuff
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:14.280]   to get to Twitter in a way, splitting the company along these same lines where Twitter
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.960]   still owns the social graph, but he owns the apps.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.520]   And it would be a way of, in effect, acquiring Twitter without actually acquiring Twitter
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.520]   and acquiring off users.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.040]   They could have said that there's a cost to the API.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.040]   They could have done that.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.040]   They could have done a per user cost to the API.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.040]   Did they make a mistake?
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.040]   They could have done a rev share.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.200]   They just cut them off, basically.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.640]   Yeah, they just cut it off, and they cut off potentially the huge growth.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.360]   Now, blue sky starts to go that way.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:44.720]   Blue Sky says there's a commodity list of layer of speech, which wouldn't be just Twitter.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.120]   It could be any other social network, and then you build stuff on top of that if you start
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.600]   to open source it.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.960]   You could have had much more growth.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.960]   People make fun of Twitter.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.960]   Oh, it's just tiny.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.760]   It just has these plain people in the event.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.760]   Right?
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:03.800]   Well, it could have grown, but then trying to control the content would have been much
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.160]   more difficult.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.680]   But as we can do on the Fediverse, if you distribute the content that way, it is controllable
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.680]   locally.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:17.680]   In some ways, it offloads the moderation problems in a way that, at least in the Fediverse,
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.680]   works quite well.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.680]   Of course, it's not as well as Twitter.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:25.240]   Well, unless you choose your moderation model, I'll take Leo's boring Twitter versus
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:33.520]   Ants fun Twitter versus my Rauchy Twitter versus Stacey's smart Twitter.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.720]   Well, what was I get?
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:40.440]   I was like, oh, God, it's going to be like Pollyanna Twitter.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.360]   I know that Stacey's moral panic Twitter versus not.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.800]   Stacey's nerdy Pollyanna Twitter.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:52.200]   I would submit that it is not, in fact, that's not why Twitter is not growing.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:56.720]   It's not because there aren't a variety of clients and all sorts of ways to interact
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.720]   with it.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.800]   It's the nature of Twitter.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.120]   It's the 280 characters.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.640]   It's the personality of Twitter is not mass appeal like Facebook is.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.640]   Not anymore.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.160]   I don't think it ever was.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.160]   Was it ever?
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.760]   I mean, look, we're the wrong people last because you all loved it.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.040]   Well, yeah, we're in the circle and you're inside.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.320]   Yeah, we're all those.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.240]   I mean, I think there's actually a little bit of that because to be on Twitter, you
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:30.200]   ultimately have to have something to say that's interesting to someone else on Twitter or
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.800]   a big enough group on people, right?
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.800]   If people on Twitter, I think you're right.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   I think you're right.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.000]   You just have to have something interesting to say to your friends, right?
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Or in your life or your report, you're sharing something there or in TikTok, you're making
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.560]   something but in Twitter, you have to have an opinion.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   Well, speaking of opinions.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.560]   So I think a lot of people don't want to share their opinions to everybody.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.560]   And that's fine.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.520]   Speaking of opinions, Omala had quite an opinion.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.640]   Musk or not, Twitter CEO needs to go.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.640]   Is that fair?
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.640]   What Bergh got in the album?
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.440]   He does not like Agrool.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.440]   Is that fair?
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.200]   He's just been to CEO for like 10 minutes.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:13.080]   Om writes, the 37 year old is woefully out of place as a guy leading a company trying to
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.280]   fight for its independence and remain a functioning entity.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:23.720]   I mean, if you look at the lineup, Musk versus Agrool is not a great lineup for a guy.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.800]   It's a lot of sighted.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.360]   I feel like Agrool reminds me a little of Sundar Pichai, somebody who was a good soldier,
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:38.240]   operations guy deep within the company who kind of rose perhaps beyond his skillset.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.280]   Kind of put it into a position.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.280]   He's pretty sprinting.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.280]   He's pretty weird.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.920]   And I mean, look, Jack Dorsey couldn't solve it.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.720]   Have Williams couldn't solve it.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.560]   Twitter is a tough nut to crack.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:56.960]   I don't see any reason why do you think Dorsey made Agrool or the board?
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.880]   By the way, that's another thing that's coming under huge fire is the board itself.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.600]   Dorsey said the board is dysfunctional has always been dysfunctional.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:10.400]   Dorsey, after he left, has lambasted the board.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.160]   Sounds like this is a very poorly run company.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.160]   All at all.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.160]   Oh, boy.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:20.200]   But it's not uncommon to have like a CIO, a CTO come in.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.880]   Well, Tim Cook's an example of where it really worked well.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.720]   There's an operations guy who made Apple.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.800]   I don't think they had a plan.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.800]   I think Dorsey left a abruptly.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:30.800]   I do think there's some--
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.120]   He-- nobody knew he was going to--
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.960]   Yeah, he left abruptly.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.440]   This guy basically-- I think they kind of were like, you want to--
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.000]   Who wants this?
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   He got the short straw.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   He got the short straw.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.440]   And then, you know, I think there-- I mean, it would be nice if Twitter had like somebody
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:51.400]   with a visionary plan for what to do and who could communicate that clearly to both the
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.760]   employees, the board, and the masses.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.920]   I don't think Agrool is it.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.480]   But I mean--
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.480]   Oh, Om writes.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.480]   Agrool is--
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.480]   What do you do?
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:05.080]   No one's been able-- I mean, you could argue Jack Dorsey is a competent innovator.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.080]   I have Williams.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.080]   Very competent.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:13.120]   Om writes, "Agrool has been part of the underperforming Twitter establishment for a
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.120]   decade.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.280]   And I'm yet to hear any fresh ideas from him or the company.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:23.760]   Tech Media has lapped up a flurry of minor product weeks and sees them as a season of
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.120]   change.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.480]   I have read many articles about the Twitter CEO discussing censorship and freedom of speech.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.640]   I was hoping that equal, if not more energy, was going to be spent by both the executives
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.440]   and the media on the business of Twitter's business.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.240]   It is, after all, a publicly traded company.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.240]   He's just disappointed.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.600]   You think, well, why not just clean house?
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:49.200]   Because this sounds like just like any other corporate shake up where they come in and
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.960]   take everybody out from the top and start over.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.200]   Why not just do that?
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.200]   Is it--
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.080]   Well, you've got to have someone with an idea.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.520]   Who has an idea?
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.480]   Jack does with Blue Sky.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.480]   That's the thing.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.480]   I think Blue Sky--
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.480]   So why do you leave?
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.480]   I don't know.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.480]   Couldn't get his way.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.480]   I don't know.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.480]   I think Blue Sky is still alive.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.480]   I think--
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.480]   So--
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.480]   --Agrool is still encouraging.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.480]   It's--
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.480]   Yeah?
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.480]   --omens, if the board of directors at Twitter is serious about finding a way forward as a
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.960]   standalone company, one that isn't being jerked around by a billionaire or Wall Street
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:24.560]   Hoxters who call themselves activist managers in making a bid for Twitter.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.840]   Musk has given Twitter a chance to shake off its stupor, tighten the belt, run leaner
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.140]   faster and further.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.760]   And that starts with new leadership right at the top.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.760]   I can't disagree with all.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.760]   Let's give it to--
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   Oh, man.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.760]   --that's hard.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.760]   Oh, shit, run it is.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.760]   Easy to sort.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.760]   Oh, oh, for Twitter.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:47.520]   I'm like, it's easy to point all that out, but it really is like-- what is the-- oh, actually
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.800]   might have-- I would not be surprised if I had opinions, thoughts on what to do with
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   Twitter.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.560]   But it's just so hard to say-- I mean, like-- see, to be like, well, this guy's not doing
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.560]   it.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.200]   You like Blue Sky, but was there a revenue model associated with it?
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.800]   No, it's very unproven.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.640]   It's very-- it's very innovative and not thought through.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.640]   And once you're probably--
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.640]   --you can't do that.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.160]   That's why Dell went private.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.160]   He was like, oh, crap.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.480]   The cloud in Edge computing and all this is going to eat our lunch if we're still--
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.480]   --stay out in the public markets.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.640]   Let's take it private.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.640]   So--
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.920]   So here's a-- here's a car work game.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:28.480]   So Stacey, let's say the musket gets close and then a white knight arrives.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.560]   What technology company-- like, should Google buy Twitter?
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.840]   What would Google do with Twitter if it had it?
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:40.360]   No, someone should take it-- they should take it private.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.960]   Like Google's not-- there's no model for--
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.960]   --we're saying--
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.400]   Maybe you could get a crazy crypto nerd.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.400]   Oh, no.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.400]   Oh, what?
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.680]   Am I reading this wrong where it's saying it's like, oh, and others are speaking about
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:01.640]   Twitter as if it's just a failing mess, yet at the same time, any Twitter competitor that
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.320]   tries to pop up never even stands a chance.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.360]   So why are they hitting so much grief?
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.240]   They're doing something right.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.760]   Who says it has to be this big?
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.760]   I guess saying it's that--
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.760]   They're public.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.760]   That's what Wall Street does.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.560]   That's kind of why you don't want to take their money.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.560]   Right.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.160]   I mean, that's what Netflix is going up against right now.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.600]   Well, good billionaire to take it private.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.560]   It would be a nice thing.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.560]   But eventually there's more--
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.560]   Should Jeff Bezos--
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.560]   --be trying on their money?
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.240]   Maybe Jeff should buy.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.960]   I don't think he bought the post to make money.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:38.360]   He bought the post to preserve a public forum that was very important.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.920]   Maybe he'd feel the same way.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:45.240]   The problem is you still have so many problems with Twitter that no one knows how to solve.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.720]   Stacey's part of Stacey's point is that you have problems based on the public market
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.440]   expectation.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.320]   If you were private, you could set your own expectations.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.320]   Right?
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.280]   What was Twitter's revenue?
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.080]   Let's go back to their last financial--
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.600]   They had one profitable quarter.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   I think Q4 2021.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.240]   And then I don't think they made a profit last quarter.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.480]   Oh, my God.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.480]   Yeah, it's not good.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.960]   They have one they made.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:21.160]   Thank goodness for those 10,000 Twitter blue subscribers that we are.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.200]   We're in the few, the proud.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.040]   The Twitter blue.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.080]   What is probably 10,000?
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.080]   Cheers.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.080]   Not very many.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.240]   If you're the proud, the Twitter blue.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.400]   Cheers, cheers.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.880]   I mean, they boosted their revenue by quite a bit.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.680]   You're over a year.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.680]   Revenue.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.440]   Do you see a profit here?
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.320]   Yeah, gross profit.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.960]   Well, let's go down to their EBITDA profit.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:54.880]   So somebody's saying in the IRC that Elon wants to reinstate Trump, is that true or that's
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:55.880]   just speculative?
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.560]   He hasn't said it, but it's presumed.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.560]   It's presumed sort of.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.560]   It's serious.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.560]   It's legal.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.640]   It goes up.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.640]   So he's the, says, let's get back to the free speech thing.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:11.880]   Oh, yeah, plus plus the, you know, I made some joking tweets about it.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:16.800]   And then I ended up on Fox News and Glenn Greenwald and Andrew Sullivan came after me.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   What?
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   All the tweets.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   All the...
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.800]   All the...
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   All the...
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   He had a nice, busy week last week.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.800]   I mean, I missed this one.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.800]   All the...
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.640]   Where should I go to find this?
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.640]   What was it on?
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.840]   And the reason they're after me is because they want Trump to be back.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.840]   I mean, the funny thing is, you're against free speech.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.840]   No, I'm not.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.840]   You're just yelling at me all the time.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.840]   You can yell at me.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.840]   I'm not telling you not to yell at me.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.840]   Go ahead and yell at me.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.840]   I'm like, how am I against free speech?
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.840]   I don't like Elon.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.320]   I have my free speech, but you're yelling at me like I shouldn't have my speech because
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.480]   I don't know if you're a speech.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.000]   So I said, here's what it was.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   I said...
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   It sounds so productive.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Yes.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Well, here's what I said.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.680]   It was halfway through the day of Elon.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.840]   I woke up in the morning and said I'm going to edit my book today, and then this happened.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.840]   And I can't...
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.840]   Like, for some stupid reason, I can't help myself.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.720]   I've got to tweet about this because I'm not looking at the world.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.120]   This is why everyone should put away the Twitter right now.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.120]   No.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.040]   So, I tweeted at some point mid-day.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.600]   I said, today on Twitter reminds me...
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:23.520]   It makes me think of the last night in the last Berlin nightclub at the dust of Weimar
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.520]   Drum.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.960]   You invoked God was law.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.760]   I was actually evoking cabaret, the movie.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.400]   It's one more step to the Nazis.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.400]   I put it in the...
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:53.080]   They went to the
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:31:00.080]   Jewish book.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.240]   You know what New York means.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   Exactly.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.240]   Liberal New York professor invokes Weimar Republic.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.080]   I don't think their audience would know what that means.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.080]   No.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.080]   [laughter]
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.080]   It's like in free speech to Nazi Germany.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.080]   I was liking it to...
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.080]   I mean, I even put up a clip from cabaret, but this told me to get it.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.080]   I'll get more now.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.080]   I'll get emails and that kind of stuff now.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.080]   It will come from this, but if you all, you're just an idiotic.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.200]   So, that's interesting though.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.160]   That means you have a huge amount of...
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:37.000]   People are very aware of you on the right.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.640]   Well, what happens when the Andrew Sullivan and Renwald do it?
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.640]   That draws the lines.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.640]   That's the bat signal.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.640]   Ah, yes.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.640]   The boys in the bots.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.640]   Yes.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.640]   And I've learned now...
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.640]   Well, the good news is...
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:52.040]   The good news is Taylor Lawrence ran right by waving a flag.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.040]   And they chased her instead.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.040]   Exactly.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:00.040]   Letting you off the hook, the hounds followed the other rabbit.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.560]   Now that I'm doing this, this will come back up for a while.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.040]   Somebody will send me some emails and calling me whatever.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.240]   So, Taylor in the Washington Post, she's great.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.480]   I think we all agree.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.400]   She's a various student observer of social media.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:21.040]   But did she make a mistake in revealing the identity of the libtards of TikTok Twitter?
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.040]   No.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.440]   No, you cannot be an adult on the internet having...
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.800]   Creating an account that has real repercussions for people without experiencing setting yourself
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.080]   up for the same real repercussions.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.080]   Yes, for cutting.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.680]   So, it was an anonymous account.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:45.000]   But it was absolutely, you know, Glenn Greenwald retweeted it at 1.8 million followers on Twitter.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.440]   Tucker Carlson would continually bring up clips from Libs of TikTok.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.440]   He would appear on his show, anonymously.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.240]   I mean, you see her face, right?
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   She didn't have...
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.760]   A voice change to the voice jitter, tiktiktikt.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.160]   Which would have been pretty funny.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:07.240]   In any event, her identity wasn't super kept secret, but she was anonymous.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:14.320]   And so, but she was revealed through the reportorial work of Taylor Lawrence and two of her colleagues
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.120]   at the Post.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.880]   Although I guess that information might have been available in other places.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.520]   And that was seen as doxing.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.400]   But as Stacy just said, you do something in public that has public repercussions.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.040]   You do it to other people and then you say, "It can't be done to you."
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.040]   No.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   No.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.040]   I mean, as a reporter...
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.040]   I mean, as a reporter...
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.960]   My admire greatly as a journalist came in, there was a discussion among some journalist-y
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.640]   online and he just said, "This is journalism, period."
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.640]   You know, it was Josh.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.640]   It's not doxing.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.640]   It's reporting.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.640]   It's reporting.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.400]   So, I'm trying to get the outline of this.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.720]   So, it's okay to have an anonymous account on Twitter, right?
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.640]   This is the end of that.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:02.200]   And if I had an anonymous account on Twitter or somebody had an anonymous...
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:06.600]   There's trolls that were attacking you, Jeff, and they were attacking me anonymously.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.080]   If we found out who they were, would it be appropriate to dox...
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.760]   I want to use the word dox because that's loaded.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.760]   It's not a vial there identity in public.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.320]   It depends on what they're doing.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.320]   Okay.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.320]   Right.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.160]   So, the thing that made this okay was that she was...
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:28.800]   That the person who owned this handle was making political speeches.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.960]   Was she became a public figure?
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.440]   She became a public figure.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.440]   Yes.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:39.700]   I would say she became a public figure and then by virtue of that, her actions created
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.440]   direct harm for people.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.440]   Yes.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.440]   She lost her job.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.440]   Okay.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.960]   So, once you have...
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:53.400]   If you're just saying something nasty and it doesn't cause harm, then...
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:35:00.560]   But in the American legal system, I mean, libel, slander, all of those things, and they're
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.560]   true.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.920]   She wasn't doing anything illegal.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.920]   Right.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.640]   She was doing something in public.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.400]   And to me, that's sufficient.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.120]   There is not a period of corruption or privacy in public.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.920]   Because I do defend anonymity.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.560]   I do think it's important for the vulnerable, but she was violating that for others and then
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.800]   hypocritically saying it shouldn't come after me.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.880]   So she was doxing other people.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.080]   She was causing people to lose their jobs.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.520]   Well, she wasn't doxing them.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.960]   She was pulling them.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.960]   And this is why the internet is such a scary place and why people haven't really...
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.880]   They don't understand that everything you put on it is searchable and findable and even
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.040]   weaponizable against them.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.520]   So she was reposting TikToks mostly?
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.280]   I mean, that's the implication.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.280]   She was finding...
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.320]   I mean, yes, she would find people's TikToks.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.440]   She would repost them under this thing and then other people would draw more attention
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.440]   to them.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.440]   Right.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.440]   Then that would be amplified by Glenn Greenwald.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.000]   She would set loose the dogs.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   And tuck her croc.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Barrite.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Okay.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Twitter.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.480]   So it was Taylor Lorenz that owned the anonymous account?
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:07.280]   No, no, Taylor Lorenz was the reporter who wrote an anonymous person who revealed her
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.280]   identity and was accused of toxic.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.120]   Have some more coffee yet.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:15.920]   You know, maybe we should trade mugs.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.320]   And I should give credit because Taylor didn't do this alone.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:24.640]   She had reporting help from Allison Creeds and Rizan Naklawi at The Washington Post.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:28.160]   But I don't want to leave this discussion before we...
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:32.200]   Yishan Wang's threat on moderation, I think, is relevant here.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   All right.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.200]   I'll pull that up.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.080]   Because it's this back of the Twitter story.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.080]   What are you saying?
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.960]   Yishan used to run Reddit.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:44.120]   So from the voice of experience, he can say, "Elan's in for a mess of pain, running a
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.120]   social network."
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.000]   And he goes through this, I think, brilliantly.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   And he makes a few points, which I think are relevant to TikTok as well, is, you know,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   where are the rules?
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   What are you enforcing?
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.080]   And one point he makes that I think is wonderful.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.800]   He said, "Listen, all you people, you think that you're stuck and taken down because of
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.120]   the assumptions of what you say?"
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.120]   No.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:06.040]   If you said everything you said civilly and nicely, nobody would take anything you say
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.040]   down.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.920]   It's because of your behavior.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.920]   It's because you're being jerks and a-holes and awful people, right?
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.920]   And that's what it is.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:19.040]   And so we focus on this as left versus right, and we try to get all kinds of false balance
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.040]   going there.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.920]   No, it's about awful behavior and where that comes from.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.920]   And guess what?
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.440]   It comes from one place more than the other.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.120]   And that's why that side is trying to say, "You can't take down our stuff because that's
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.280]   our freedom of a speech.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.280]   How dare you?"
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.280]   Right?
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.600]   Because the left, they say, "Take down the hate speech."
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.600]   And then when the hate speech gets taken down, the right says, "Whoa, that was my hate
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.600]   speech."
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.000]   And so, Yashan, I think does a good job of saying, "It's the Mike Masnick rule, right?
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.800]   The impossibility of content moderation at scale."
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.160]   And this is about a society trying to figure out what our standards and norms are, and
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.760]   we ain't there yet.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.560]   It's complicated clearly.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.560]   It is indeed.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:02.440]   I'll just say, I don't think Elon is worried about this because I don't think he really
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.440]   wants Twitter.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.440]   Does he really want Twitter?
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.040]   What would he do with, though?
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.720]   He knows how hard this would be.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.480]   This is just a quagmire.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.320]   He's got Tesla and SpaceX to run.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.800]   Yeah, but he wouldn't need this.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.280]   I could see him trying to put people in place.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.800]   Only because you think he's a goofball.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.800]   Right?
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.760]   I mean, he's a smart enough man to put all of those other things in place with SpaceX
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.760]   and Tesla.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:29.400]   He's not out there building those cars or launching the ride.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.200]   But he's doing two fairly important things.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.000]   You're taking two letters for both those things.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.680]   He's putting the right people in place to make sure all of that stuff gets done.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.560]   He's keeping it with all of his answers.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.560]   No, and he's still sleeping on the ride.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:44.000]   The Tesla's angry.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.360]   He's doing something about it.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.280]   I honestly, it's very hard to tell with Elon.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.120]   No one can tell what his motivations are.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.680]   But it feels to me like he's just having fun.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.280]   He's kind of trolling around.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.520]   Well, he likes the attention.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.840]   He likes to stir the ants nest with a stick.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.920]   He's like a kid poking the ants nest.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.280]   But I don't think he has any real ambition to run Twitter.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.320]   That would be a very hard thing to do.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.440]   Maybe he has enough ego think he could solve all these problems.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.440]   I don't know.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.440]   I think that's sort of it.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.440]   Yeah, I know.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.440]   Exactly.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.440]   And he's a troll.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.440]   He's a troll.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   He's a troll.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.440]   He's a troll.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.440]   And that's the joy he has.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.640]   And I want to be careful here.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:26.840]   By the way, for somebody who was really trolling is the SEC.
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.440]   This is all about thumbing his nose.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.040]   His head interview, he goes right after the SEC.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.040]   That's the whole thing.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.520]   I think that's exactly what he's doing is saying.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.600]   You're going after me because what I said on Twitter will be, I'll buy Twitter.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.320]   Then what are you going to do?
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.640]   That's not why the way he wouldn't change.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.760]   Either he doesn't understand securities law at all.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.640]   Or he knows this wouldn't change anything.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:53.160]   Him owning the platform that he's pumping and dumping on does not change in any way
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.960]   the liability for bumping up.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.520]   Maybe makes him more responsible.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.920]   He bought a platform just so he can pump up stock scams.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:08.000]   I want to be, I want to be, I want to be careful here because an ignore diversity is really
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.240]   important and we have a lot to learn from the newer diverse.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.080]   But he brought up Asperger's in his TED talk.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:21.880]   And I wonder if, I wonder what, what it was like to be Elon the child.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.960]   I wonder, because he talks in that about the difficulty of understanding signals and having
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.680]   to learn and be also cautious.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.880]   I would also caution fun of because he didn't.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.240]   I would caution you in a way of rails place.
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.800]   I would really caution you because everything Elon says is performative.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.800]   You think even that is?
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.800]   Really?
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.200]   I mean, we don't know.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.720]   That's the, I mean, it might not be.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.280]   He might be coming from the heart.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.160]   But so much of what he says is performative that I would not necessarily.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:53.400]   Well, he's even claiming that as a, as a, as a, as a, which is really insulting.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.440]   If you're, if you're a fan of neurodiversity, if you want to support it for somebody to
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.280]   say, oh yeah, well, I'm on the spectrum.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.440]   I was headed toward the, on the path of trying to give us empathy, but okay, you pulled
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.440]   it back.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:08.720]   Well, I just, he may be, maybe, but it would be the first time he's been forth right about
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.040]   anything.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:14.800]   I think this sounds a little bit like more like I'm sleeping on the floor of the factory.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   In fact, he even brought that up at the TED talk.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.080]   That was a boy that was at a, was that a softball game?
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.440]   Well, Chris Anderson is not a hard hitter.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.440]   No.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.840]   And it was exactly the audience boy.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.640]   That's, that's Elon's audience right there.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.640]   I'm surprised.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:36.760]   I was like, yeah, I'm surprising to announce his NFTs.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.560]   Perfect place to do it.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.560]   All right.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.560]   Let's take a break.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.960]   Now that we've offended pretty much anybody who's listening.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:48.400]   Hey, welcome to twig.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.960]   It's four twenty, by the way, in case you want to, you know, buy any.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:57.640]   No, it's only two fifty.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.880]   Two fifty on four twenty.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:03.520]   Hey, actually I want to tell you about a really cool company.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.680]   I think we've talked about before called policy genius.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.640]   Do you know about them?
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:14.360]   If you're looking for life insurance and you should be, if you have a family, if you
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:21.080]   have kids, if the death of you, something happening to you would be a financial problem
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.280]   for your loved ones, for rent, for mortgage payments, loans, education costs, everyday
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.360]   expenses.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.200]   You need life insurance.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.440]   You know, that was one of the, that's the first grown up thing I did when we had kids.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.000]   I went out and got life insurance policy.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.280]   I still have one.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.680]   Having life insurance through your job, you know, I hope you have it.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:42.040]   That's a nice benefit, but it's probably not nearly enough.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:47.880]   More people, most people need about ten times more coverage than their job offers to properly
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.080]   provide for their family.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:54.520]   I also should point out, as I have learned, life insurance gets a lot more expensive as
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.880]   you age.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.960]   So if you are still, you know, starting out a family, it is better to get a policy now
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.520]   sooner than later.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.960]   Policy genius is very cool.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:11.400]   It's a one stop shop to help you find the life insurance you need at the right price.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:19.080]   You click the link in the description or you head to policygenius.com/twig and you answer
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.840]   a few questions.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:25.000]   In minutes, you can compare personalized quotes from my top companies to find your lowest
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.440]   price.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:33.080]   And by doing this price comparison, I mean, this really saves you as much as 50% or more
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.080]   on life insurance by comparing quotes with policy genius.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.640]   Then the team of licensed experts at policy genius are on hand throughout the entire process
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.960]   to help you understand your options and make choices with confidence.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.600]   So you're not, you're not on your own doing this.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:53.000]   The policy genius team though, I should point out, works for you.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.840]   They're not working for the insurance companies.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:59.480]   Whether you're just starting to shop or have questions about your current policy, they're
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:03.120]   independent advocates offering unbiased advice.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.280]   That's super important.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.280]   Policy genius does not add on extra fees.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.800]   They do not sell your info to third parties.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.000]   You can really trust them.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.520]   Just look at the reviews, thousands of five-star reviews on TrustViolet and Google.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:24.440]   They have options to offer coverage in as little as a week, some without unnecessary
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.880]   medical exams.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.040]   It's the easiest way and the best way to get that life insurance.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:36.920]   Since 2014, policy genius has helped over 30 million people shop for insurance and placed
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.120]   over $120 billion in coverage.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.920]   These are the kings of this business.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:46.480]   While you're there, policy genius has home, auto, disability, renters and more.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:51.760]   So it's not just life insurance, but I really want to remind you that you may not want to
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.760]   think about it.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:58.120]   You may put it off, but if you've got a young growing family, if you've got people dependent
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.440]   on you, you need life insurance.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:03.120]   Head to policygenius.com/tweg.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.560]   Get your free life insurance quotes.

[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.080]   genius.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:19.160]   We thank you so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.160]   I like this lower third.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.160]   It's very simple.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.160]   Just policy genius.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.240]   It's all you need.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:29.280]   Policygenius.com/tweg.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.840]   We do have a sponsor, Grammarly.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:36.360]   We've talked about it before, that Dutch grammar checking.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:40.960]   I was a little worried when I saw that Google Docs is going to start doing grammar checking.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:46.880]   I started reading some of the things Google Docs recommending, and I realized there's
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.640]   always going to be a place for Grammarly.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:53.480]   Have you played yet with the Google Docs grammar checker?
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.400]   How do I turn it on?
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.400]   I trust myself.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.400]   You'll get a purple squiggly line.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.600]   I guess I use Grammarly, so I don't...
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.920]   Yeah, it's better.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:05.920]   Trust me.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.960]   Let me see if I can find one example of Google Docs.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.560]   Where do you turn it on?
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.400]   It's a purple line.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.640]   I'm not getting the purple lines.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.400]   You must have to turn it on somewhere.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.400]   Oh, okay.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.400]   It's going in grammar.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.800]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:21.800]   That's it.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.800]   It's all.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:23.800]   Well, I guess I'm just too damn perfect.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:24.800]   You're perfect.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:25.800]   You're perfect.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:26.800]   Perfect lines.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   Ha ha ha.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:28.800]   Did I not bookmark this?
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.800]   Right.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.800]   Hey, Stacy.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.800]   They're doing tone recognition.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.800]   I heard that.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.520]   Grammarly does tone recognition.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.240]   Yeah, but Google Docs.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.240]   Informal.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.680]   Yeah, which I like.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:43.680]   Let me see if I can find...
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.680]   Maybe I'll see if there's a more of these.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:51.520]   Or even has emojis, which is so silly.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.520]   I found one.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:57.120]   There's a couple of examples that were just really ridiculous, but now, see, I didn't bookmark
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.120]   them.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.120]   So never mind.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.840]   And I can't find it.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.520]   I can go open a Google Doc and see...
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.920]   Oh, it was just silly one now now.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.760]   And stuff.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.080]   The couple purple squiggly lines, and I don't agree with them.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.720]   Oh, I get purple squiggly lines, but that's...
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.720]   There we go.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.720]   There we go.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.720]   This is from Motherboards.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:17.720]   It's all synonyms.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.720]   Here's from Motherboard.
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:23.960]   I have a new title is Google's AI-powered inclusive warnings feature is very broken.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:29.480]   So in this case, Motherboard writer Lorenzo Franceschi Bicare typed annoyed.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.640]   Google said, "Nah, make it upset."
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.640]   [laughter]
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.640]   Make it angry.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   Okay.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:39.880]   You say this about a woman that's going to piss them off because no I'm angry.
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:44.120]   Business worse though, social editor Emily Lipstein typed in Motherboard, the name of
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:48.760]   the website, and Google popped up to tell her she was being insensitive.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   You motherboard.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.880]   Some of these words may not be inclusive to all readers, considering using different
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.720]   words.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.320]   Okay.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:01.960]   Journalist Rebecca Baird Remba tweeted an inclusive warning she received on the word
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:07.240]   "landlord," which Google suggested she changed your property owner or proprietor.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.240]   [laughter]
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:13.160]   Which, I mean, that's, I guess, is it the same?
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.160]   It may be the same, but what's wrong?
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.160]   Is landlord...
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.160]   Is landlord...
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.200]   Do we not say lord anymore, lord is in ladies?
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   I still say landlord.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.200]   Maybe that's the issue.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:26.400]   I'd be curious if you typed in something like white knight or white hat.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   What would happen?
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:28.560]   There's always, you know, some risks.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:34.000]   They talk about, Google suggested Martin Luther King should have talked about the intense urgency
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.080]   of now, instead of the fierce urgency of now.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:42.080]   And as I have a dream speech, John F. Kennedy should have used for all humankind instead
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.640]   of for all mankind.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.640]   And...
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.240]   Well, yeah, obviously.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:50.160]   Okay, I understand.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.760]   What makes a speech resonant often is when you...
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:56.400]   I mean, what makes good writing is when you know the rules, you break the rules and you
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.400]   come off with it.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.400]   Yes.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.400]   That's a good point.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.400]   And I've written...
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.400]   That's a good point.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:05.400]   So, Motherboard Fed, a transcribed interview of Neo-Nazi and former clan leader David Duke
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:10.280]   into the inclusive editor.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:14.720]   It got no recommendations, even though he uses the N word and talks about hunting black
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.720]   people.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:21.040]   But, radical feminist Valerie Solanus's scum manifesto was...
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.680]   Got many edits.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.160]   She should use police officers instead of policemen, Google Notes.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.160]   And Jesus.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.440]   It's just stunt journalism.
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:31.600]   This is silly.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.920]   All right, all right.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.160]   Stunt journalism.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:37.520]   By the way, you might not want to use the phrase stunt journalism.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.440]   Just call it gimmicky.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.440]   How about that?
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.440]   It appears, "Judgy."
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.440]   "Judgy."
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:43.440]   You're judging.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.440]   It's "Judgy."
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.440]   Like all of the...
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.920]   It's a fun article, but you're right in training.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:49.920]   It's kind of...
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:50.920]   Yeah, it's kind of...
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:51.920]   In fact, that's what Google says.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.960]   It's an ongoing evolution, Google says.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:58.400]   I made Simpson's book of quotations.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.400]   You did?
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.400]   Why?
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.400]   Homer or Bart?
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.400]   Well, it's not this one.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.400]   It's not this one.
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.400]   It's not this one.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.400]   I remember there were things where the editor...
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.400]   Bart.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.040]   People were trying to turn it into the cliche.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:13.080]   I said that hearing Yoko Otus saying was like hearing a...
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.440]   What did I say?
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.440]   It's like a...
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.440]   Wayo call?
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.280]   No, it was...
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:23.560]   I said it was like hearing a bald eagle being goosed.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.560]   It's a hap...
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.360]   The other one was that I said something about...
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.360]   Who's the guy used to that celebrity...
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.160]   John's suggestion, by the way.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:37.200]   John said just for more inclusivity, you call it a goose being bald eagle instead.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.200]   Yes, exactly.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.200]   Yes.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.840]   What was this name who did "Life Fell" is the rich and famous?
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:43.840]   Robert Leitch!
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:48.080]   Here we are at the "Life Fellows of Jeff Jarvis's House."
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.080]   Oh, you do that.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.080]   So I see.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:53.520]   He called something tacky, and I said that was a case of the pot calling the kettle metal.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.980]   Oh, I like it.
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:51:00.040]   And the editor wanted to make it black, and I said, "No, you see, that's the point of the cliche."
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.840]   I'm breaking the cliche.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.240]   Oh, editors.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.560]   So I kept it in and I won, and I made substance quotations for those talents.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.560]   Wow.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:12.600]   Can you look up and see if they have anything from me?
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.200]   No, they don't.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.480]   I'll tell you right now.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.480]   Who's Leo Leitch?
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:17.480]   Sorry, but yeah.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.880]   No, I'm not in there.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.100]   I'll never forget when I've told this story before when my dad, when I was a kid, my dad
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:27.680]   was a professor, he got a letter saying, "You have been included in Who's Who."
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.840]   You probably get that letter once in a while, too.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.120]   No, I actually don't.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:39.680]   And for $55, we'll send you a copy of Who's Who with your name, which we, by the way,
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:46.520]   dad, I think he's wised up since, but he did buy, and we had for many years the library
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:50.440]   shelf, who's with Professor Leo F. Ford's.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.440]   I'm in there.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.440]   I've never met anyone.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.780]   I hope someone of the cocktail party would say, "Oh, are you in that?"
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:57.780]   I'm in Who's Who.
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:58.780]   Yes.
[00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:05.380]   Kids today have no idea that there was a thing called Who's Who.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:06.380]   Now you just Google it.
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.860]   I have no idea there was something called a bull's book.
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.620]   Who's Who and I?
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:15.700]   Again, and I bet those letters get sent to proud parents all over the world.
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:16.700]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.700]   Yeah.
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:18.700]   Marquise Who's Who.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.800]   Scam artist still doing their thing.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:26.900]   By the way, according to Marquise Who's Who, it's remained the standard for reliable and
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.400]   comprehensive biographical data.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.400]   So look at yourself up.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.400]   Are you in it, Leo?
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.400]   Oh, do you think you can-
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.400]   Look at that still in it.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.400]   How long do you get to be in it?
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:36.400]   I wonder if you-
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.400]   If you paid by a book.
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.400]   I wonder if you can look it up.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.400]   Look up somebody in a perpetuity.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.880]   I bet you it's not on law.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:42.880]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.480]   Marquise biography's online.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.280]   1.6 million biographies.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.580]   It's not too restrictive, I guess.
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:53.660]   Did you look down on the homepage?
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.260]   On the homepage of Who's Who?
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.260]   Of Who's Who?
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:57.260]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:58.260]   Yeah.

[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:00.260]   Listies branding.
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:01.260]   No, no.
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:02.260]   Okay.
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:04.260]   I went to MarquiseWho.com.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.500]   Yeah, that's where I am.
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:07.500]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:08.500]   Oh, funny.

[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.580]   Are you looking-

[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:23.580]   Seasoned.
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:24.580]   Well seasoned.
[00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:25.580]   Wow.
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.540]   We should feed this to Google's grammar checker.
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:32.980]   Are you looking for an effective way to revive your professional reputation?
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:34.460]   What?
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:35.660]   What?
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:38.620]   Revive your- Wow.

[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:44.760]   [laughter]
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:47.440]   Clout walked up and said, "Hold up, hold my beer.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.440]   I'll be right back."
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:54.620]   Clearly, this is now being aimed at people who are old and need to be revived.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:55.620]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:58.900]   Well, yeah, because the rest of us are online.
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:53:59.900]   Yeah.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:00.900]   No kidding.
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:07.380]   We'll put you in a book that will be featured in libraries worldwide and never open.
[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:08.380]   Never open.
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.380]   Never open.
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:10.380]   True that.
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.380]   Okay.
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:15.720]   How do we get that?
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.880]   Well, Stacy, what happened to Instion?
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.880]   Do we know?
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:20.880]   Oh.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:21.880]   [laughter]
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:25.400]   We don't know.
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:30.360]   And it- we will never- Is this like the Wink fiasco or worse?
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:35.360]   No, Wink actually was purchased and people talked about what happened.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.520]   So Wink still exists and if you pay money, you can still work.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.120]   Yeah, that's the problem is that you had to pay for it.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.760]   - Right, but Instee on. - Who would miss about that?
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.840]   - Tell me what Instee on. - Instee on.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:49.540]   So on Friday, Instee on is a smart home hub.
[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:51.320]   It's been around since 2005.
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:53.020]   - One of the first. - Because they're proprietary.
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:53.860]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:55.800]   - Proprietary mesh network technology
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.120]   works really well, people love it.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:02.240]   I cannot tell you how many times people like send me emails
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:04.680]   about how Stacey, why are you wasting time
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.920]   with smart things, or home assistant?
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.880]   Get Instee on, it just works.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.320]   It's rock solid, people love it.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.640]   So what happened is on Friday night,
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.200]   I started getting emails.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:18.400]   People realized that their app wasn't working
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.440]   and their hub was down,
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.360]   and they were like, what the heck is happening?
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.520]   It's been pretty clear for the last couple of months
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.640]   that Instee on has been having some troubles.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.560]   And. - Financial.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:32.480]   - Apparently, financial, and they stopped supporting
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.320]   some of their stuff.
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.840]   They had some cloud outages,
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.040]   but they didn't really communicate,
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.160]   and then they came back up.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.320]   So people thought this might be just a big cloud outage,
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:44.400]   but it turns out that it hasn't yet turned back on.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:48.680]   And I went through, because I had gotten enough
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:51.160]   of these emails and started looking,
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:55.440]   and the people affiliated with Instee on,
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:58.160]   many of them are no longer with the company,
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:01.400]   and those that used to own the company
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:06.080]   are now denying that they have any business with the company.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:08.800]   So I found Rob Lilliness,
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.840]   who is the CEO of Smart Labs,
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.600]   which is the company that in 2017,
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:18.600]   invest, well, Rob's private investment fund,
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.800]   Richmond Capital Partners,
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:25.160]   created Smart Labs and invested money into it
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:28.880]   to buy Instee on the assets and wrap that all up.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:31.280]   So they had this Smart Home website
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:34.080]   that sold Instee on gear, they had the Instee on stuff.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:38.400]   And he has scrubbed all mention of Instee on
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:39.480]   from his LinkedIn profile,
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.360]   and as of now, he no longer has a LinkedIn profile.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:45.200]   He just took that sucker down.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.320]   - Oh, same as death. - Of the five people.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.960]   - Yeah, of the five people in the minute.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:50.400]   - I've got a book you can buy it into
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:53.000]   that might help him re-clitalize.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   (laughing)
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.480]   - Sounds like the Cleveland Browns.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:56.320]   - 'Cause we're here. - 'Cause we're here.
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:57.760]   - Baltimore. - Yeah.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.960]   - Holy cow. - So he did actually respond
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:05.120]   to me on Tuesday, and he said he's not affiliated
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:09.360]   with the company, but he didn't answer any of my questions,
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.280]   and that was the only response he has,
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:14.600]   but he was clearly used to be affiliated with the company.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:18.320]   So it's anyone's guess what has happened.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.840]   And people are pissed.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:26.120]   - So if you bought an Instee in Hub
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.160]   and have been powering your Smart Home with Instee
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.320]   on they had an app and everything, right?
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:34.040]   - Yeah. - None of that's working anymore.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.800]   - Well, so Instee on has local control.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:37.960]   If your hub was programmed. - Oh, okay.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.400]   - This is why people love it so much.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.960]   If your hub was programmed, your timers
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.800]   and anything on the hub will still work.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.800]   If you want to change anything though, you need the app.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:50.320]   Now, my thing of the week is actually a very comprehensive
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.000]   guide that we put together on what to do
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.480]   if your Instee on thing has failed.
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:54.640]   - Save that. - Just give a look at that.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.920]   - We'll talk about that then. - Okay.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.200]   - So there is hope.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:02.520]   - No. - There's not hope for Instee on,
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.400]   but there's hope for your particular home.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:08.120]   - There is hope for you to do. - Yeah, okay, good.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:11.280]   Was it the problem with Instee on that it was proprietary
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:13.840]   and that Zigbee and Matter and all of these things
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.640]   have just kind of eclipsed it?
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:19.760]   - I think yes and no.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:24.560]   I think it was, I mean,
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.800]   the fact that it was proprietary
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.200]   and it worked really well was great.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:30.280]   I think the fact that it was a pain to buy
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:32.560]   and you need a professional installation,
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:34.200]   all of that is hard.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.680]   And we've seen the smart home eclipse
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.240]   kind of the professional CDI type installers.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.920]   - Yeah. - And then things like Matter
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:42.400]   coming on didn't help it.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:45.240]   - Was Instee on a member of the Matter Coalition?
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.240]   - I don't believe so now.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.080]   - Yeah.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:51.920]   - Matter could theoretically help if you had a situation
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:54.760]   like this going forward 'cause you would have local control
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.640]   with Matter, theoretically when it comes out.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:59.600]   - Was it the Sonos of IoT?
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.440]   - The Sonos of IoT?
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.320]   - Well, Sonos is still around so let's not.
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.720]   - Well, I know, but no the sense that it worked well
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.680]   but then a lot of other things came out also.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:10.080]   - They got it, yeah. - Very expensive.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:11.320]   You got a question with me saying.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:12.480]   - Yeah.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.080]   - Yeah, yeah, that's probably in Sonos is expensive.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:17.960]   Now Sonos is still investing in things
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:20.440]   and having lawsuits and--
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:22.200]   - Yeah, Sonos is gonna be around, I think.
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.400]   I think they've decided it, you know,
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:27.840]   but it does, in some respects,
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.560]   it kind of does sound like the Sonos of IoT
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:31.560]   in some respects.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:32.960]   All right, well, we'll find your worker,
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.160]   we'll get your work around so later in the show.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.520]   - While we're on IoT, can I suggest one?
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.360]   - Yeah.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:41.240]   - 'Cause I wanna hear Amy, Stacey, what do I say, Amy?
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:44.840]   Talk about this, the puffs of air, line 82.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:50.040]   Have you gone into this yet, Stacey?
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.120]   - Who's the video?
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.440]   - Going down to 80s.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:54.120]   - Let me show you Google's little signal.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.480]   - Oh yes!
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:56.320]   - Little signals.
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:59.840]   - If you go watch the video, we'll all watch and learn.
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:03.200]   - At Google, we like to rehearse the future.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.320]   - Wait a minute, does she call it Google?
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.760]   (laughing)
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.040]   - She's got an accent.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:08.880]   - Where'd it be?
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.040]   - Let me hear it again.
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.600]   - At Google, we like to--
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:13.680]   - Google?
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.760]   - Hearse the future.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.120]   - Google?
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.720]   - In collaboration with Map Project Office,
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.080]   we have explored how technology can support us
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.240]   in the background of our day-to-day lives.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.080]   - Well Irish.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.000]   - Oh, it's just Scottish.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   - Through the lens of our meeting.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:27.840]   - That's Google!
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.760]   - Google, okay, no channel.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.520]   - We're adding new ways to interact with technology.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.800]   Using less of our attention
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.880]   and allowing us to have moments of calm.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:41.200]   - Call me next.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.320]   - Little signals is a family of unassuming
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.840]   but charming objects that share notifications
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.400]   and information by engaging with our senses
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.880]   in more nuanced ways.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:54.240]   - Wait a minute, little unassuming objects
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.720]   that engage our attention.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.640]   - This is for the company that we're running over.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.960]   - What?
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.720]   - Can't be in a Zoom if it's engaging.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.800]   - Is this blue sky or are they doing it?
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.600]   Well, let's listen.
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.200]   - No, no, this has been around for a while.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.320]   This is the whole concept of ambient information delivery.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.280]   - Yes, but keep going.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.120]   This is a lovely--
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.600]   - Is it sound, movement, and visual cues
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.920]   we can successfully perceive?
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:23.400]   A soft shadow, a friendly tap,
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.240]   - What?
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.400]   - A reassuring sound, a subtle indicator.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.800]   - I'd never, I'd never hear any of it.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.480]   - I'd never see any of it.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.320]   - A gentle motion.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.280]   (laughing)
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.640]   They use familiar patterns to calmly convey information
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:42.960]   and keep us in the loop.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.200]   - The giggle-lift.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.920]   We're only the giggle-lift.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.560]   - Gentle nudges at the right time in the right way.
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.640]   - Okay, you can't.
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.840]   - I don't know if I'm gonna win.
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.480]   - Okay, if you're just listening,
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.280]   it is not nearly as hysterical.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.320]   There are little objects tapping on things.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.640]   - These are something else with thought starters
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.480]   of how we can foster new behaviors
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.560]   and relationships with our technology.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.560]   - Look at that, I turned it upside down.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.080]   - Working in harmony with the objects
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.080]   we already love in a little way.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.080]   - Bip.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.120]   (laughing)
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.080]   So, is this too little to put in?
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.320]   - So there's a whole design philosophy
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.160]   is called common design.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.400]   - This is what I wanna hear Stacy on this.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.240]   - Okay.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.120]   - Yeah, and so we've had people,
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.600]   so this has been all the way back,
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.600]   so all the way back to like 2010, 2008,
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.160]   we were seeing people develop connected objects.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.320]   Like, so one of the first ones that I recall hearing about
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.640]   was like an umbrella stand
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:44.560]   that would just light up softly if rain was expected.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.720]   So as you walked out the door,
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.240]   your umbrella stand would glow.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.080]   - Don't forget me.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.720]   - And you forgot what you said, umbrella.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.440]   And that was one of the,
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.360]   and there were lots of ideas around products like this.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.400]   And most of them have failed.
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.960]   Goodnight lamp was a wonderful one that is,
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.640]   you can kind of, it's been developed into other things,
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:08.080]   which is like, just by turning on a light,
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.480]   it would share, it would turn on a light somewhere else
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.280]   with like a connected other person.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.240]   And they would just know that you were home
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.840]   or that it was like a way to connect with people from far away.
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.720]   And the idea here was that you wouldn't have a screen,
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.560]   you would have some object or device in your home
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.960]   that would give you some sort of indication
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.840]   that you could pay attention to in a way
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.040]   that was not like a notification screaming at you.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:35.160]   And these objects really fetishize things like
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:39.100]   light, sound, motion as a way to get your attention.
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:43.880]   And a lot of them are nice, but.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.960]   - So look, you can build them yourself
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.400]   using an Arduino,
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.000]   and they have 3D printer models.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.080]   So these are the three things we saw,
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.120]   which is the thing you push down.
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.360]   - I could use it for my father to remember to take his pill
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.520]   and then plop down the thing.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.760]   - Well, that was an interesting one.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.760]   It has a little, it's a little,
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.480]   it looks like the hands of a clock,
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.720]   but instead of being the hands of a clock,
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.360]   it taps on your medicine bottle.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.320]   - But okay, it taps on the medicine bottle.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.400]   - But how audible is that?
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.920]   You know, you tap in on the medicine bottle.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.360]   - Well, the idea around them is they,
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:19.280]   they come to your attention when you need them at home.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.640]   So in that case, probably you were looking at something
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:25.680]   like light triggered the sensor to indicate that light
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.640]   in time, for example.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:31.560]   So opening your medicine cabinet gave you that notification,
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.760]   right? - Yeah, okay.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.360]   - I'm sorry, I'm trying to.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.960]   - No, it's, there's.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.960]   - Launch experiment, but all it's doing is showing me
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.800]   that same video again.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.480]   So I wanted to see what the experiment,
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.480]   oh here, your explanation helps this thing.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.320]   - And you see them.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.640]   You see these things getting built into like people,
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.520]   like tying their Philips Hue lights
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:59.120]   to various pieces of information and, sorry,
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:02.960]   lights changing colors to like tell you something has happened.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.880]   And that's just ambient information delivery.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.440]   And it's really popular and it's actually,
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.920]   I've set up a bunch of them in my home
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.000]   and it's actually quite nice.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.320]   - Oh, totally.
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.640]   - I like that. - Like what I hear is, yeah.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.680]   I like the idea of this, but I feel like I would struggle
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.720]   with catching you.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:24.480]   - Sure, so here's a little air thing.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.120]   It interacts with this pulses of air move nearby items
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.880]   to attract attention.
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:33.080]   So it'll blow, wiggle, or spin.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.600]   That's an example. - So like something like this,
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.880]   you could use it for something that's not imperative
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.240]   that you notice it right away.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.000]   - Okay. - But like,
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   a good example would be something like quitting time, actually.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.200]   So here's like, it could, this way,
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.000]   if it's five o'clock and usually you wanna be,
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.680]   like you wanna have a reminder to yourself
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.520]   to get up and stop working, right?
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.600]   That can start blowing around five o'clock
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.200]   and you could be working and you'd notice it
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.960]   and you'd be like, "Oh, okay, yeah, it's time to go."
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.440]   But it's less intrusive than like a bell going off.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.040]   - Right, I like this one. - Okay.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.200]   This is kind of interesting.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.840]   This is this one's called movement.
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:10.960]   And seven pegs that graphically represent information
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:14.760]   like a calendar timer through their height and motion.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.000]   The pegs work individually or as a group
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.280]   and are tapped for simple input.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.160]   That's really interesting.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.200]   I mean, they're just, yeah, these are very interesting.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.040]   - You know, these are super fun and age.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.520]   - Things don't have to shout at you.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:30.880]   They can just hint at as normal environmental things do.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:35.280]   - And like this one with the haptic feedback is fun.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.300]   Like I've seen things like that.
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.760]   I've seen projects like for bicyclists,
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:43.480]   like little vests that people wear with haptic feedback
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.600]   where the closer a car gets to you on a bicycle,
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.520]   the more the haptic feedback happens.
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:54.480]   Like the harder or the faster the percussive motion
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.320]   would happen.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.760]   So you'd feel the car coming up behind you.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.080]   So you'd know it was there, but it wouldn't,
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:02.280]   it would build slowly, presumably.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.040]   Or if it built too fast, you'd figure it out
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.880]   and you'd be like, "Oh, sorry."
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:07.840]   - This one's really interesting.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.520]   Tap makes use of surfaces.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.840]   This is the one that was tapping on the medicine bottle
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.920]   to create sounds that act as notifications.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:17.280]   A stronger tap means more pressing news.
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:21.680]   So you could, now you can download these as little,
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:23.760]   there's little zip files.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.080]   - Is this a script?
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.880]   - It's an S-T.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.280]   - Oh, he's gonna make one now.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:31.480]   - I think we could experiment with little signals.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.320]   - You could, yeah.
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.400]   - You come here and walk you through
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.920]   how to make the air object.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.240]   - This doesn't look so quite so.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:40.360]   You need a 12-volt computer fan in our joueno,
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.880]   a transistor, a resistor.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:45.080]   So these are, these are do-it-yourself projects.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.280]   - Yeah, and like the air blowing might be fun.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.760]   Like, let's say you've got a sensor tied to your plant
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.280]   that is like when it needs water,
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.280]   what if you start seeing the leaves blow and you're like,
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.320]   "Oh, that means it needs water."
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.040]   - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.280]   - So instead of having a boxing glove
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.600]   that hits me, Stacy,
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:02.840]   (laughing)
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.680]   you could have something that blows in my ear.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.000]   - You could build one of these and your urgent tapping.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:06.840]   - It just blows in my ear.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.520]   - Tap or tap on your forehead, yeah.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.360]   - Boop.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.600]   - I thought we solved that with ant.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:12.680]   - Could have a booper.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:13.520]   - Yeah.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.360]   (laughing)
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.000]   So I'm trying to find a replacement.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.040]   I would like to build one of these.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:19.880]   This is cool.
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.080]   Maybe Burke can build us some of these.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.760]   Are you, 'cause it's soldering.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:25.600]   - There's so much fun in here.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.440]   - Yeah.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.600]   - It's super like--
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.160]   - And there's code.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.400]   So you can write your own code.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.600]   - Yeah.
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.440]   It's Nate.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:40.360]   - And I thought we'd have this sort of thing
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:43.520]   in more places, but until we have a truly open
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:47.680]   kind of format for communicating information
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.640]   and then the end result,
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:53.760]   like the, what's it called?
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.440]   The execution of a puff of air or whatever.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.080]   There's no way to build something like that
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.320]   that's really universal.
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.240]   So you get these like single use products
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.080]   that are real gimmicky feeling.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.640]   And it's kind of sad.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.360]   - Why does this look like visual basic or something?
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:13.160]   - This is JavaScript, but what it looks like you could do,
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.480]   for instance, it's got an API.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:18.280]   You could query a weather service for a forecast.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:20.080]   So that's what this code does.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:25.080]   They get the forecast and then they react to the forecast
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:29.360]   by doing something, you know,
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:32.160]   depending on which thing you're connected to.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.760]   - I used to have a light in my closet
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:35.920]   that if it was below freezing, it would turn blue.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:38.040]   So when in the morning when I went into my closet,
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.040]   it would be blue.
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.880]   - Oh, that's a lazy smart home.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.080]   - Can it turn, do something else?
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.120]   If I hit the red thing down,
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.480]   does it send my doctor a notification?
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.320]   Yes, he does.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:48.160]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.320]   It's all programmable.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:54.320]   So in this case, if you've said it to something,
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.720]   whatever the trigger is, it'll turn the fan on,
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:57.680]   it'll blow on you.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.160]   - I might find that here.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.680]   (laughing)
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:02.880]   - Well, this is the air object.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.800]   So there's code for all different kinds of objects.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.040]   This is actually the one I'd be most interested in
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.480]   is this little tap object.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.120]   That's the one I wanna play with.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.920]   - Well, so it seems to operate on two axes.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.360]   - Yeah.
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.760]   - Go down and in.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:21.840]   - Oh, this is the same one.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:22.880]   This is the air.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.600]   The air one.
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:25.760]   Oh, well, I'm gonna have to,
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.240]   maybe we should build one of these.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.280]   Be kind of fun.
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.480]   - Build it, program it.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.320]   - Yeah.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.760]   - And then give control of it to Stacy.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:34.600]   - Yeah.
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.440]   - On the set.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.440]   - And they just, then let me have it.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.520]   - So actually, all you need is it's on the table.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.960]   And when you start to say something bad,
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.600]   it just taps like an insistent ant.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.680]   - Yeah, and I could put a little finger on it.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.360]   Like it's tapping.
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.920]   - So if you go to,
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:53.120]   there's a site called comtech.com,
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.520]   it'll talk about some of these sort of things
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.080]   and other places that you see this developed.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.160]   I've had a person on the podcast talk about this.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.200]   So.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.480]   - Here's a comtech. - It's nice.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.200]   - A com office window,
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.800]   a lavatory sign,
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:10.920]   a com rumor.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.720]   Yeah, I like this idea.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:17.040]   I mean, there's a reason why these alerts
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.760]   coming from your assistants and your phone
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.320]   are loud and annoying.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.080]   I mean, otherwise you might miss it.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.640]   Right?
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.640]   - Well, this would be very permission.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.920]   This is, I'm gonna pay attention to you
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.640]   at an agreed upon level.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:34.000]   I'll, what I see the plant,
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.480]   plant sleeves going like that,
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.320]   then that's fine.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.120]   I've agreed to that and I'll do something,
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:40.960]   and that's that.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.800]   It's nice and simple.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:42.640]   It's easy.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.440]   I like that idea.
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:45.360]   It's not intrusive.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.200]   It's not loud. - It's cool.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.720]   - It's not in your face. - Yes.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.560]   - Very cool.
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.560]   Thank you, Stacey, for explaining it.
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.520]   - Yeah. - Should we build some stuff?
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.480]   - If you wanna know more about this,
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:58.560]   Amber Case is the woman who you should follow.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.320]   And you have some, like where did you get that blue light?
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.360]   How did you, did you build that yourself or?
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.440]   - Oh, I programmed a Philips Hue using IFT.
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:07.560]   - Oh, duh. - Of course.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.760]   - That was hard. - Yeah.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:09.760]   - No, I've done stuff like that.
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:10.920]   - I programmed it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.880]   - Sorry. - Kevin, Kevin actually did something
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:17.880]   he programmed a life expo tied to the price of Bitcoin,
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:22.280]   which is again, another example of doing something like this.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.800]   It's calmer.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:24.960]   - Calm.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.480]   - Calm.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.320]   - Very calm, I like it.
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:33.160]   - Mr. Beast gone beyond the cover of the Rolling Stone.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.760]   Rolling Stone. - Oh.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.320]   - Rolling Stone.
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:41.840]   Rolling Stone has been the Kevin Rose cover of Business Week.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.440]   - Yeah. - It's kiss to death, isn't it?
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.000]   So if you get the cover of Sports Illustrated,
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.480]   that means you're gonna be traded, right?
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.600]   - Or you break the leg usually. - Or you break your leg.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.480]   No, we know Wish Elder, Mr. Beast.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.200]   Rolling Stone, what did you-- - I love about this.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.000]   It's not just Mr. Beast, it's creators.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   It's really-- - It's creators
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   called the Creator issue. - It's creators.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.320]   - This is because of Penske Media, I guess?
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.360]   - Yes, it is.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:07.960]   They're gonna do, it's almost like a new VidCon.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.320]   They're, you know, VidCon loves creators.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.760]   - They're gonna do a live event in May.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.040]   - Yep, yep. - In Los Angeles,
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.360]   sponsored by Meta, it's kind of a VidCon.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.480]   I'll bring together hundreds of creators.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:22.840]   Oh, Jan Winter is still there?
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.200]   - Oh, Gus Winter. - No, Gus Winter.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.560]   - It's his son. - No, Gus Winter.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.840]   - It's like, what? - It's like, what?
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.040]   Winter called the Inaugural Creators issue
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.480]   a crescendo moment for the company,
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.840]   which plans to invest heavily in covering creators
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.480]   as part of youth culture moving forward.
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.760]   Yeah, Rolling Stone covered music.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.240]   - Exactly. - As part of my love culture.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.000]   This is the new youth culture.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   - It opens the arms wider to respect
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.880]   the greater creator culture.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:51.160]   - Bella Porch, TikTok star will be interviewed.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.240]   A deep dive into black creators.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.080]   - This is interesting.
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:58.720]   Rolling Stone.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.040]   In February, Rolling Stone-- - I forgot the past
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.520]   that's the only half of South by Southwest.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.720]   - Well, and listen to this,
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.560]   last month they acquired a majority stake
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.680]   in Las Vegas as Life Is Beautiful Music Festival.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.920]   So, yeah, it's a-- - Rolling Stone.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.260]   - Rolling Stone Public.
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:17.160]   - Or the Delta. - No, it's all by Penske.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.600]   - I don't know what they said right now.
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.960]   - Yeah. - No, it's all by Penske Media.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.560]   - Monthly print magazine is still
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.400]   a circulation of half a million.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:27.320]   Oh no, that was last year.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.360]   It's currently 425,000.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.360]   Digital audience, 22 to 28 million monthly uniques.
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.600]   So, very interesting.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.040]   - I'm quite happy with those numbers.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.520]   - Yeah. - Goodness.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:38.800]   - And by the way, so I put this
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.160]   this is a Sarah Fisher story from Axios.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.240]   This morning when I was going through
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.600]   and putting stuff up here,
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.720]   Axios was just jammed this week with good stuff.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.480]   - Good stuff, I agree.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.560]   It's funny, you can-- - Sarah Fisher's very good there.
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.360]   - You can kind of tell when something clicks into gear.
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.480]   And yeah, I had a lot of Axios stories
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.600]   bookmarked as well.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:58.720]   Interesting. - Yeah.
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:04.160]   - Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.160]   All right, let's take a little break.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.760]   - You okay, John?
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.000]   - I heard you moaning.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.840]   (laughing)
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.520]   Am I wrong? - It was his ambient--
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:15.680]   - I heard it too. - I heard it bored.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.240]   - I heard, ah!
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.480]   (laughing)
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:22.160]   - I heard it too.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.680]   - He's smiling. - He's smiling.
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.520]   He's good. - He's okay.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.280]   - It's okay. - It's good.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.720]   - I would love to get,
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.880]   Burke, is Burke out there?
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.620]   Every time I have an ad,
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.800]   poor Burke has to go find something for me.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.920]   And there's a box of clothing in my office, Burke,
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.680]   just inside the door on the right,
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:42.280]   that box of clothing, it's my Buck Mason's.
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:44.480]   And I've been saving this, I've been dying to open it up
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.320]   'cause I have, you like Buck Mason, right?
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.320]   - Yes, yes. - I have some Buck Mason pants.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:51.600]   They're not exactly sweats, they're casual pants,
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.560]   but they're heavier, I love 'em.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:56.520]   My Buck Mason sweatshirt's the best made sweatshirt.
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.720]   Really good quality sweatshirt.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.880]   It's an ad for Buck Mason.
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:01.680]   - We're in the ad now, yes. - Okay, sorry.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.480]   - I know it's confusing.
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.120]   - It's my money is the lowest look really easy.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.080]   - You might want to stick around for this one.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.320]   - The words weren't there yet, and, okay, I'm sorry.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.200]   - Look, we all have, I think you probably do too.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.440]   You go to your closet and there's your favorite shirt,
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:17.440]   your favorite pants, your favorite jacket,
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.760]   and you just wear that until it falls apart.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.480]   - No comment.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.520]   - These are my Buck Masons now.
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.840]   I have a sweater.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.720]   What was, we were talking about this on an episode,
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.560]   the sweater.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:32.760]   It's the sweater, it's a beautiful cotton fisherman sweater.
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:34.160]   It's so gorgeous.
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:39.160]   The jeans, the shirts, it's the stuff you wear all the time.
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.560]   And it's, increasingly for me, it's Buck Mason.
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.600]   Grown and sewn in the US, I love that, right?
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.440]   - That's cool.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.720]   - US cotton, US manufacturer.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:52.760]   Their clothes are timeless and very well made.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.640]   I'll tell you what, a lot of times you get clothes
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.440]   and they're not so well made.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:00.200]   These are gonna, it's good that these are your go-tos
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.280]   'cause they're gonna last forever,
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.000]   and they're timeless, they're not gonna go out of style.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.560]   It fits, they fit beautifully.
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.600]   Jean's shirts, jackets, so much more.
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:11.600]   Is Burke's not here?
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.080]   Somebody, will somebody go in my office
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.480]   and get me my Buck Masons?
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.080]   Please.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:19.120]   I love the tailored looking fit of the T-shirts.
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:22.000]   Actually quality T-shirts, a lot of times you get a T-shirt.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.360]   They're just falling apart and cheap after three watching.
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:26.120]   It's not Buck Mason, they look good
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:28.680]   and feel good at wash after wash.
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:32.080]   And they invented the curve HEMT.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:37.080]   GQ called it the best T-shirt in the game.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.080]   It's really nice, it's really nice.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.000]   The fit, the finish, the quality.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:42.840]   Thank you.
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.920]   Oh, oh, oh, I'm so glad these are the,
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.680]   these are the navy versions
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.160]   of those green sweats I was talking about.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.200]   And just 'cause you got up and did that,
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.920]   I'm gonna offer these to you.
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:55.920]   Would you like these?
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.000]   - So you will thank you.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.280]   - Oh shoot, he accepted.
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:00.240]   (laughing)
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.240]   You know they're not gonna fit your massive thighs.
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.320]   - Look at that, we'll try.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.680]   - Yeah, try.
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:06.840]   Look at that, doesn't that?
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:10.280]   - Look out, look at the weight of arms.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.640]   - Oh, it's so good.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.640]   - These are really well made.
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:14.480]   - Yes.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:15.760]   - I'm kind of blown away by these.
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.280]   Here's, okay, you can't have this though.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.760]   - I'm thinking about the T-shirts, yeah.
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.560]   - Yeah, they're really well made.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.400]   Quality, yeah, you wear a lot of black T-shirts.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.880]   - First thing I do is always check the stitching
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:25.720]   in the inside.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:26.920]   - Yeah, you can tell these are well made
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.000]   and I love it that they're made in the US.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.000]   This is the Darby Venice Wash Vintage Thermal Surplus T.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.520]   And the thing is it's gonna wash and wash
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:38.440]   and it's never gonna wear, oh yeah, I wear these.
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:40.920]   This is, so when you were a kid,
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.200]   maybe you did this with your kids.
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.000]   I bet you, Jeff Jarvis is old enough.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.200]   Did you have, when you got home from school,
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.280]   did your mom say, "Get out of your school clothes,
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.960]   "get into your play clothes?"
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.320]   - Do you presume that I went out
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.720]   and did something kids would do when I play outside?
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:55.560]   (laughing)
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.400]   - I'll save you.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.720]   - Did you do that too much to me?
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.560]   - Did mom approach you said, "Get out of your school clothes."
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.960]   - I didn't show that to Aunt that question.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.040]   - 'Cause you have school clothes, right?
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.600]   But you're gonna go outside and play.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.440]   - That's right.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.960]   - These are my, this is when I get home,
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.000]   I get out of the suit and I get them.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.120]   Yeah, see, you got right there
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:13.480]   when I'm gonna get into my play clothes.
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.440]   - Those are my work clothes.
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.280]   You got this hair.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.280]   - Yeah, I know, you live in your play clothes, yeah.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.280]   - It does feel good.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:19.480]   - Isn't that nice?
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:20.320]   All right, so.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.040]   - They also have tall, by the way.
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:22.880]   - Oh yeah.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.080]   - Can't have these back, so.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:25.920]   - You know what, you can have them.
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.440]   - Okay, seriously.
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.720]   - If they fit you, take them.
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:29.560]   - That's fine.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:30.400]   - Thank you.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.440]   - I'll get more, 'cause actually,
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.280]   I think I'm from my third or fourth order.
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.760]   (laughing)
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.520]   I just keep getting more, Buck Mason's.
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.280]   Buck Mason.com/twig,

[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:44.600]   B-U-C-K-M-A-S-O-N,

[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:49.660]   Get that free T-shirt with your first order.
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:52.440]   But you know, I don't even have to say,
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.160]   you know, get something free or get this kind of thing
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:58.360]   because trust me, you will be so glad you get these shirts
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.800]   and you will love them and pants and jackets
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.680]   and jeans and everything.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.920]   That you're gonna be a Buck Mason.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.200]   This is your go-to from now on, just like me.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.680]   Isn't that nice?
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.520]   Do you have?
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:13.240]   - These feel so, so I have the green ones of those.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.880]   That's why I'm willing to let you have those.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.800]   I love them, they're heavy, they're comfy.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.960]   - They're gonna look good on me.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.520]   - They're gonna look good on you.
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.400]   - As opposed to you, Leo.
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.840]   - I didn't say that, but you did.
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:25.920]   (laughing)
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.760]   - They look good on me.
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.040]   - They look good on me.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:29.560]   You know what, it's nice, they fit.
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:30.880]   It's hard for me to get close to fit,
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:31.960]   'cause I'm fat.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.160]   It's hard for you to get close to fit.
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.000]   - Oh, they have women's clothes, y'all?
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.400]   - Oh, did I not mention that?
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.560]   Of course they do.
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:38.400]   - No.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.400]   - Buck kind of flies us together.
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:40.240]   - I was like, "That's bad, man."
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.200]   - You're a guy, Blucks Mason.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.760]   - They have leather jackets too.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.160]   Let's see.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.640]   - It's actually great stuff.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.160]   Now everybody's going to Buck Mason.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.000]   - Yeah, no, no, I'm looking.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.200]   - Buck Mason.com/twig.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.920]   Thank you, Buck Mason.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.320]   - There's now Queen Pruitt's gonna be like,
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:57.600]   "I want Buck Mason."
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:58.440]   - Aren't they nice?
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.720]   Look at this.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:00.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.160]   - Let's close work with you, Stacey, yeah.
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:03.000]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:03.840]   - That's white jacket.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:04.840]   - They're kind of classic, right?
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:06.320]   They're not, yeah.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.640]   - They look chill.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.480]   - I don't like to wear--
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.000]   - They look like things I already own.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.200]   - Exactly.
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.520]   I'm telling you, this is the,
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:15.920]   from now on, you're kind of go-to style.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:16.800]   Look at that.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.640]   Okay.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:22.000]   Maybe it's 'cause I read Puck News now all the time.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.760]   But what's going on with CNN Warner Discovery?
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.080]   What a mess and a half is going on over there.
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.200]   It's almost as bad as AOL.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.240]   - It's very much like that, isn't it?
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:34.080]   So--
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.320]   - Warner is the jigs, obviously.
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.200]   It's been a mess after mess after mess.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:38.600]   - So Discovery and Warner,
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.600]   Discovery and Warner and Discovery and Warner-y
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.240]   are meeting, me and Murr, and emerging.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.120]   They're merging together.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.120]   Warner is HBO and CNN.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:51.080]   I mean, Warner is a big, big property.
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.240]   Discovery doesn't feel that big,
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.360]   but they own a lot of stuff too.
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:57.880]   And they're gonna be running the show, right?
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:59.480]   What, Zazloff will be running the show.
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:01.080]   - Yeah, Zazloff's running the show, yep.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:06.080]   - So apparently, CNN, even though they were about,
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.400]   they still haven't, merger hasn't happened yet,
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:11.720]   but it's about to, I think May 1st, something like that.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:16.240]   CNN started CNN Plus even though Discovery didn't want them to.
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:20.040]   Discovery set wanted them to,
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.920]   they wanted it like to all be HBO Max,
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.600]   like put everything in HBO Max.
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:27.440]   CNN Plus, they were gonna spend a huge amount of money
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.520]   over the next three years.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.200]   Now, they're starting to fire people.
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.040]   - Oh boy.
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.640]   - This story from Axios, Scoop, Sarah Fisher,
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.160]   CNN Plus looks doomed.
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:40.360]   This is the streaming version,
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:44.000]   merely 150,000 subscribers so far.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.760]   - This is like Ant was talking about Agro-Wall,
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.280]   you know, he's only been in the job 10 minutes.
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.000]   This thing's only been on the air one minute.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.160]   - Yeah, because they put no news in it.
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:52.920]   I think that was part of the problem.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:53.760]   - Yeah.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:54.600]   - Part of the problem.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.360]   Warner, Brothers Discovery wants to eventually build
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.840]   one giant service around HBO Max.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:01.800]   Zucker of course was fired at CNN.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.960]   The new guy isn't in yet.
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.520]   CNN's original. - He just started.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.360]   - He just started.
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.880]   Okay, CNN's original plan was for CNN Plus
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.720]   to become profitable in four years
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.480]   by investing a billion dollars.
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:15.520]   But in order to become profitable,
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:19.320]   they were expecting millions of subscribers.
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.880]   - Let me ask you this.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:25.960]   If CNN is the news arm of everything,
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.400]   and this is their premium platform,
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:32.960]   what else can they add to make this a viable option?
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.800]   What's the carrot that says you know what?
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.240]   - It's a really good question.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:39.800]   You want us for news now, pay us more for--
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.120]   - More news.
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:46.120]   - You know, Ant, way, way back when I helped start Epicurious.
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:48.480]   At Gourmet and Born Epicty recipes, we all stuff,
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:51.840]   and the pressure came around the year 2000 to say,
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.080]   well, can we also do subscriptions?
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.960]   Can we also get some money for the consumers?
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:57.600]   And Joan Feeney, who was the brilliant person who started
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.760]   at Sat there and Brainstorm for hours,
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:03.160]   trying to think of what is it we can invent
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.760]   that on top of Epicurious is already exists,
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:06.840]   people will pay for it.
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.120]   And we came up with a million ideas,
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.560]   and finally she just said,
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:13.640]   the gold is the recipes.
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:14.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:15.320]   - You're gonna get charged for recipes
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.160]   when we don't charge. - Yes.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:17.280]   - And same for CNN.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.120]   - Gold is the news. - The problem is--
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:18.960]   - The problem is-- - The news.
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:22.280]   - The MSOs will let you sell it separately,
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.280]   these cable systems. - Okay.
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:26.040]   - So they've got nothing else.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:28.160]   That's the crown jewels,
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.000]   and they got nothing else to sell, so they make it up.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.680]   So Anderson Cooper talking about parenting.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:34.760]   Oh, okay, that's cute, but maybe it's a YouTube video,
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:36.320]   you want something to do here.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.640]   - Right. - No.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.440]   - According to Fisher, CNN brought in
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:42.000]   a billion dollars in profit last year.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.480]   Most of that coming from distribution contracts
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.920]   with the cable operators.
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.840]   This is according to her two sources.
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:50.680]   - That's where all the money is.
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:51.680]   That's where the all Fox money is.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:52.520]   - That's where the money is.
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:54.680]   - Trying to get ads off of Fox doesn't matter.
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.040]   It's all in the carry fees.
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:00.080]   - This was on the heels of already problem,
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:03.840]   troubled CNN after the firing of Chris Cuomo,
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:07.320]   the firing of Jeff Zucker, which was probably related.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.760]   Zucker, who was kind of beloved by the
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:15.160]   on-air staff at CNN and took off.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:18.080]   He had turned CNN more, and you'll remember this
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:22.320]   during the last few years, more political.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.880]   And I don't know if this has to do with his departure.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:28.920]   As you say, the new guy, Chris Lick, isn't in position yet.
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.520]   But basically all CNN does all day all night,
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.000]   Ukraine war. - Yeah.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:34.920]   - Have you noticed that Jeff?
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:35.760]   Is that driving you nuts?
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:36.720]   - Oh, absolutely.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:40.200]   Well, so it has like there's nothing else going on.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:42.960]   Like there's no COVID, there's no nothing.
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:45.320]   - Dazlav has talked about, about, you know,
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.080]   like a bad car. - But Dazlav is on the
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:48.520]   side, so I'm sorry.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.840]   - Great. - Well, just the other thing
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.440]   is Chris Lick, the new head, who last was at CBS
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.760]   running Colbert Show as a executive.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.960]   He went on this week and he said, well,
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:03.280]   'cause I'm starting to see it in, I'm gonna quit Twitter,
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:05.160]   which of course drives me nutty.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.640]   Okay, so you're gonna stop talking to the public, very good.
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:10.240]   So it's gonna be this whole haughty,
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:14.360]   weird objective throwback kind of news
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:16.200]   that's not gonna work well.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.480]   - Well, right now it's war porn.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:21.680]   - I mean, it's bizarre, if you ask me.
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:22.520]   - Yeah.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:26.200]   - Not that this isn't an important story, of course it is,
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:28.840]   but there are other important stories in the country
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.440]   going on in the around the world.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.840]   - Well, bottom of the line, it was the same during COVID.
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.080]   I mean, it was a very important story.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.360]   People were dying and million people
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.960]   aren't gonna have died from this,
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.400]   but yes, it was to the exclusion of all other news.
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.400]   - That's all they did. - In the world.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.240]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.280]   - So I'm not surprised CNN+ is having trouble
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.480]   because there's no news.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.720]   (laughing)
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:54.920]   - It's really an interesting slow motion car wreck.
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:57.200]   - And can you imagine anything that you would pay for
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.360]   from CNN that isn't, they CNN itself feed?
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:00.920]   - Negative. - Negative, I mean.
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:03.800]   - No, no, no. - The people watching CNN,
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.160]   they could care less, at least they said,
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.800]   this is my assumption, they could care less
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.680]   about behind the scenes stuff.
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:12.600]   They can care less about just sit downs with Anderson
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:15.600]   or whomever that's not news related.
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:18.000]   They go to CNN4News, period.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.880]   - Here's the other problem.
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:22.200]   I searched Google for CNN+ sign.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.520]   - That's the thing. - Yeah, so yeah.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.520]   - Joy results for CNN. - Right.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.240]   - Google say to wait, huh? - Yeah.
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:30.400]   - That's typo.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.240]   - And I would say that, well, this is a big opportunity
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:36.640]   for CBSN, which is their streaming version,
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:39.560]   except the Viacom Paramount's,
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.080]   lose it, having the same kind of nutty,
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:47.200]   divisive, leaderless craziness,
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:50.080]   and with a merger, of course.
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:53.760]   And what's, it feels like something's,
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:57.760]   is this a representative of some sort of illness
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.640]   in journalism and news?
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:01.600]   - Well, it's interesting to fit into your first story,
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:05.240]   Leo, I think, which is, it's media pivots
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.960]   to whatever the next Messiah is.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.360]   So the next Messiah of late has been streaming.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:12.240]   - So everybody's gotta have a streaming channel, right?
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:13.680]   And so they're all rushing to that,
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:16.640]   and CNN hires Casey Hunt and hires,
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:18.280]   what's his name?
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:21.840]   The news guy from Fox, the only respectable one.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:22.960]   Chris Wallace. - Hey.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:24.800]   - Thank you, Chris Wallace.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.920]   And so they spent a fortune on this,
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:27.800]   we ought to have a streaming channel.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:28.920]   Everybody's gonna have a streaming channel.
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:30.240]   Well, what's happening to streaming?
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:33.160]   Streaming's saying, oh hell, it's oversold.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.440]   Netflix is losing, oh darn.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:38.120]   - So where is the audience going?
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:38.960]   Is it YouTube?
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.240]   Is it TikTok? - It's unlimited.
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:43.400]   Well, it's people will spend only so much
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:44.920]   that was ascribed only so many things.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.160]   - And there's so many-- - It's a scarcity.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.920]   - And there are so many sources of information
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:49.920]   in entertainment. - Exactly.
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.600]   - And so many opportunities to stream.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.920]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:55.080]   - So there's competitors' Netflix now,
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.680]   and they're feeling it, right?
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:57.520]   - Yeah. - They're also,
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:01.720]   Netflix is also feeling the embers of the pandemic.
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:04.400]   There was a huge upswing during that.
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.080]   But yeah, there's plenty of things to stream.
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.560]   People are going back to work.
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:09.840]   There's less time to stream.
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.320]   Much of it isn't worth anything.
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:14.080]   - I think that's the main thing is there's only 24 hours
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:17.920]   in a day, and a lot of people are only gonna give you,
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:18.760]   what's the analytic?
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:20.160]   They're gonna give you 15 seconds,
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.320]   guaranteed of their attention,
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:23.760]   and then they move on to the next thing.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:25.600]   - People watch a lot of TV.
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:26.880]   I just wanna throw that out there
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.880]   because I am always stunned,
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.960]   'cause I don't really want it to be.
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.600]   - Hours a night, four or five hours a day.
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:33.400]   - But it's envy. - You watch hours a lot
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.200]   the background. - Yeah, 'cause they,
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:38.920]   exactly, so I was gonna say, sometimes streaming
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:43.360]   because it feels like TV, it's still not the lean back
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.560]   experience. - Uh-huh.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.840]   - It's much more purposeful,
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.800]   so things like Fox are a little different,
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.400]   'cause you just turn it on and it just goes for hours,
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.520]   so it's a different...
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:55.560]   - We have the news on sometimes when I'm making dinner,
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.120]   we're making dinner, we're kind of getting together.
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:58.920]   The news will be on for a little bit,
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:01.000]   just to kind of catch up on the day.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.880]   But then usually, we'll watch episodic television.
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:07.280]   We'll watch shows. - Yeah, but there's,
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.840]   you're well off.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:15.320]   There's whole homes where TV's just on all the time.
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:17.920]   - All the time, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:20.960]   - And it's a different product for them.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:22.560]   - Right. - I just, I feel like
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:25.360]   we're talking about TV, like it's this monolithic thing,
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.360]   but TV viewing habits are actually very different
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.280]   across different demographics. - Yeah, that's true.
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:32.080]   - And ages. - And ages, especially.
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:35.880]   - Meanwhile, Dean Baskett is about to exit the New York Times
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:40.440]   and Baskett, Baskett, I didn't know he was so French.
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:42.920]   - Baskett is like a... - His crash like he was like...
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.720]   - Joey, why bar? - Joey, you know.
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:48.120]   - Like I've told before. - Joey Baskett's is leaving.
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:53.040]   And Joey Kahn is coming in as executive
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.160]   ever in the New York Times.
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:57.040]   I only bring this up just 'cause I know Jeff likes to go on
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:57.920]   and on about this stuff.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.240]   Anything to say?
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.000]   Is he a good guy?
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.800]   - Oh, he's a very smart guy.
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:05.560]   Very much an inside guy, very quiet.
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:08.280]   I think that my friend Jay Rose in New York University,
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:09.200]   who's brilliant on this stuff,
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.080]   was quoted by The Washington Post about this.
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:13.000]   And I think that it means more the same.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.760]   A.G. Salzberger, who's now the publisher,
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:18.440]   having taken over from his father, is very quiet too.
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:21.000]   So there are peas of a pod.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.400]   And Jay did a very good Twitter thread today
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:26.560]   talking when he was asked about what were the positive things
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:29.040]   of Bequay's reign and there were many things.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.520]   He really brought it into digital.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:33.120]   He brought the subscriptions up hugely.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.440]   He brought up investigations.
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:36.760]   He brought up the staff.
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:39.240]   But negatively, they still have not grappled
[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:42.760]   with their role in the 2006 election, '16 election.
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:47.520]   He dismisses listening to the public
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.360]   through Twitter through any means.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.080]   James Fallow just wrote a good piece.
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:55.640]   I just saw where he said two things that Khan should do.
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:58.320]   One, bring back the public editor.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.880]   - Yes, that was a huge mistake.
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.320]   - But they got rid of it and said,
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:02.600]   "Oh, Twitter is gonna be a public editor."
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:03.680]   And then they dismiss Twitter now.
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:05.320]   So they don't care about listening to the public.
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:08.560]   And two, have an honest reckoning with your role
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:09.960]   with the 2016 election.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.360]   And don't do it again.
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:15.000]   But that's not where they are now.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:19.640]   Jay also has a theory which I think is very intriguing
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:23.960]   about the times, which is when they went full on board
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:27.760]   with subscriptions as the primary means of support.
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:30.120]   It changed the newsroom so that the newsroom
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.800]   kind of has to prove it to their subscribers.
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:33.000]   Well, you don't own us.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.640]   We're gonna piss you off here and there.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:36.440]   I think that's what has led to a lot of the problems
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.120]   with the event-tasting. - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.160]   - And yeah, there really is.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:42.240]   And we're gonna go talk to all those guys
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:44.120]   in the Ohio dining room 'cause we know you don't like that,
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.520]   but that's gonna prove how independent and wonderful we are.
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:50.200]   And I think this idea, the subscription markets,
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.240]   are wonderful because we're finally in charge.
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:57.240]   Well, no, they're trying to suck up to you on the one hand
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:00.040]   and then prove they're independent from you
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:00.880]   the other hand.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.560]   And I think it's great at the times in some ways.
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:05.120]   I start my day now with the Washington Post,
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:05.960]   not with New York Times.
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:07.200]   Unfortunately though, I see the Washington Post
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:08.880]   go in the same way.
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:10.600]   - The only reason I bring this all up is I feel like
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.880]   that we are rapidly heading into a situation
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:16.840]   in this world where news is gonna become very, very important.
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:19.680]   It always has been, but I think it a formed electorate
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:23.160]   is gonna be vital to solve some of the problems
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.520]   we are gonna face in the next decade or so.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:28.080]   - We gotta rethink the fundamentally, why don't we--
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.240]   - The actual end.
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:31.800]   - The vessel of news being the most important,
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:33.640]   like where are people gonna get the news from?
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:36.560]   It seems like that's the main thing.
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:37.600]   Is it going to be--
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:40.040]   - Well, it's hard to find reputable people
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.320]   in areas that you're not focused in.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:46.040]   So you look for reputable outlets who can steer,
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:49.240]   like the idea behind a newspaper is that they hire people
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:52.960]   who know what they're doing and you can pick a place
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:56.600]   and find those people.
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.240]   And that actually extends all the way
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.080]   to their opinion pages and voice.
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:05.080]   You, like people read the Wall Street Journal
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.960]   for a certain world view and they read the New York Times
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:10.760]   or the Washington Post for a slightly different world view.
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:14.000]   And I don't know.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.800]   - Let's us do it, Google.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:19.960]   - Wait, wait, I had a--
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:22.600]   - Oh, you had an epiphany, I heard it and I let it go.
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:24.520]   - I, that's okay.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.440]   I mean-- - Was it, ooh, epiphany?
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:27.560]   No, it was an, oh.
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:28.920]   - It was, oh.
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:31.040]   - And we had to have had a great article
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:32.600]   and I thought about-- - Jonathan Hates,
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.600]   Hites. - Oh no.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:34.600]   - Yes.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.800]   - I thought it was great, you didn't like it?
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:37.640]   - Oh, I hate it.
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.600]   - I, I, this is a black, I brought it up.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.200]   - That grumpy face.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:43.600]   So Jonathan Hite, who I've interviewed,
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.720]   we've had him on triangulation, wrote,
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.840]   I thought a very important book called Righteous Minds.
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:50.240]   He's a, he's a social psychologist.
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.200]   - A social psychologist. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:55.240]   And Righteous Minds was why we can't agree.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.480]   And I think actually as time has gone by,
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:01.040]   I think Hite has maybe changed his tune a little bit.
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:03.560]   But his most recent article, which I think is
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:04.640]   what you're referring to Stacey,
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:07.440]   is why the past 10 years of American life
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.480]   have been uniquely stupid.
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:13.640]   And it's not just a phase and he blames social media.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.200]   - Of course he does, of course he does.
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:18.360]   - Well, okay, did you read the article, Jeff?
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.160]   - Yes I did. - It was long.
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:21.440]   It was long. - Okay, yeah,
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:23.160]   it was really long, but there were lots of things
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:24.000]   in there I actually-- - I was watching
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.280]   my morning show this morning.
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:26.120]   And he drove me that.
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.240]   - I thought that I'm trying to pull up the article
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:30.560]   and for some reason I'm failing.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.400]   - You have to pay wall?
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.800]   (laughs)
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.280]   - I have it right here in front of me.
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:39.000]   - There's actually a section in there
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.880]   that actually picked your favorite point,
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:46.360]   which was all about how it has given voice
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:48.760]   to the disenfranchised.
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:49.600]   - Yes, he doesn't know.
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:52.520]   - And I thought that was good
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:54.000]   'cause that is an important acknowledgement.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.160]   I thought that many of the points he brought up
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.600]   were right on and I liked,
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.040]   I was actually kind of pissed
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:02.680]   that he spent so much time educating us about this
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:07.040]   and so like five paragraphs on like what to do about it.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.760]   But I thought the idea of adding friction
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.480]   is what I wanted to talk to you about, Jeff,
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:13.120]   because I thought that was an interesting way
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:16.560]   to ensure that people still had the ability
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:20.200]   to share their points of view and reach people,
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:22.480]   but also that it became,
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:24.680]   that you had to try a little harder to do so.
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:26.680]   - Had to work for it a little bit.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:30.120]   - Yeah, so I just, I wanted to ask you specifically
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:33.360]   about adding friction to social media.
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.920]   So the one thing he mentioned was Francis,
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.640]   how do you say, is it Houghton?
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:40.480]   - Hogging.
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:41.640]   - Hogging. - Francis Houghton.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.160]   - Her idea. - Facebook.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.800]   - Yeah, on Facebook basically saying,
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:48.360]   look, you can only cut and paste something,
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:49.400]   or you could only hit share
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.800]   and then you have to cut and paste
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:52.160]   to help slow the spread.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.360]   And I was trying to think of things
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.840]   that might help on Twitter,
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.760]   other than cutting down a box.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:00.320]   - I just wanna get your opinion on that.
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:02.040]   - I don't think the solution is technology.
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:04.080]   I don't think it's UI.
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:05.880]   I don't think it's nudging.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.480]   I think it's harder than that.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:09.560]   Like it's much harder than that.
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:14.320]   And if I go back to Yishan Wang's thread,
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:16.000]   when he said in there, as I said,
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.760]   I think a quarter is already, that's right,
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:20.160]   that it doesn't matter what you say,
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.160]   it's the behavior.
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:25.520]   And the behavior is that people right now come on
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:28.560]   and they wanna blow off and they wanna go after each other.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.960]   And the only way we're gonna solve this
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:34.520]   is by having norms and institutions
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:37.800]   that we agree to as a society that say that's unacceptable.
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:39.080]   - That's a problem. - And that's hard
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:40.760]   to get those agreements of--
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:43.160]   - Not now, but I think it's time we like.
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.600]   - So big. - But not now,
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.400]   because people are trying to do this.
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.840]   So I just don't think there's any,
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.880]   I think that's a techno-determinist.
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:54.280]   - Well, she also offers that as one of his solutions.
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:57.780]   One of his solutions was helping educate kids.
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:01.200]   - Ah, but they're the kids are not the problem.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:02.680]   It's the old farts, the problem,
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:05.360]   and there's research, right there in his own universities.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:06.680]   Josh Tucker, he shouldn't have looked up
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.960]   'cause Josh Tucker has good research on this,
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:11.160]   that this presumption, there's a lot of presumptions
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:12.160]   in this piece.
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:14.360]   One of them is, yeah, the kids and the echo chambers
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:15.200]   and all that.
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:17.800]   - I don't think he's focusing on the kids
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:20.040]   because they're sharing the problems.
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:21.440]   I think he's focusing on the kids
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.280]   because you can actually change kids.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.880]   We're not gonna change my parents.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.160]   - Yeah, they're smarter than me.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:27.000]   - I love 'em, but--
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.800]   - He says prepare the next generation.
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:31.080]   His point, if I could put it in a nutshell,
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:34.760]   is that not that Twitter and tweets
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:39.160]   and social media shareings are so dangerous
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:42.160]   in and of themselves, but they are a million,
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:44.800]   it's death by a thousand cuts there, a million blows.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:48.200]   And what has happened as a result is that people
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:52.320]   are so sensitive to what, and you are too, Jeff.
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:56.000]   I mean, look at all the attention you got.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.440]   Look how much you were beaten down for your tweets.
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:38:59.280]   - No, it wasn't.
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:01.080]   - Last week, well, they attempted to, they certainly--
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:02.440]   - They attempted to, but I just--
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.320]   - Well, what happens, it may not have affected you,
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:05.160]   but what happens is--
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:08.600]   - No, I'm a privileged white cis--
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:09.440]   - Yeah.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:11.920]   - What he's saying is-- - And you're an old male,
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.880]   the country, the country. - The person who was a genius.
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:15.840]   - And I think this has always been the conventional wisdom,
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:18.520]   tends to be centrist, and then there's a left wing
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:21.400]   and a right wing, but what all of these little darts
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:26.400]   have done is pushed, basically empowered the extreme
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:30.960]   and shot down anybody in the middle.
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:32.160]   He's kind of always been saying,
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:34.320]   and this is also part of his earlier book,
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:37.480]   but so that the extremes have an outsized voice now,
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:41.000]   both on the left and the right, and outsized power.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:41.840]   I think that's true.
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:42.840]   - I can agree to that.
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:43.680]   - I'm always caught in the middle.
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:44.520]   - I'm always caught in the middle.
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:49.480]   - I'm always caught in the middle, and I get yelled at
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:52.520]   all the time because I don't lean one particular way
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:55.640]   or another regarding whatever social activity
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:57.440]   or political activity you would have.
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:00.160]   - Precisely. - Yeah, I totally agree with that.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.960]   - So this morning, he was on Morning Joe,
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:06.760]   and they had Eddie Glodjr, who I think the world of,
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.680]   who's the head of the African-American Studies Program
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:12.200]   at Princeton, are at the same time to act as a ballast.
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:15.520]   They basically gave Glod no time to talk at all,
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:19.160]   and I was enraged afterwards, and I tweeted about it,
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:22.360]   and it was a microcosm for what's happening.
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:24.760]   What we had was in Joe and Hight,
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:28.520]   there were two white men complaining about saying that,
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:32.280]   oh, people in our classrooms don't feel like they can talk,
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:34.600]   and we're being shut up.
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.560]   When they wouldn't listen to the black man,
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:38.400]   who was there trying to say to them,
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.400]   and who said to them, you talk Hight
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.000]   about the right extreme left,
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.440]   who's the extreme left you're talking about
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.360]   in this balance here?
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:46.080]   Are you trying to say people who are fighting for justice
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:47.160]   on this extreme left?
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:49.000]   Who is this extreme left?
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.640]   And it ignored, it was a microcosm of the world we have
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:56.200]   where what's going on here,
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:57.600]   we've talked about this a couple of times,
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:00.160]   and I've quoted this tweet from Regina Rini,
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:02.680]   a professor in Canada, that says it's,
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:05.160]   at the one hand, it's the people who want to change the rules
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:07.360]   because they can finally have a seat at the table
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.360]   to say, I've had to live by your rules all this time,
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:10.600]   but now I'm gonna tell you,
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:13.200]   this is how you should treat me as a trans person, for example,
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:15.840]   and no, I don't want you to say that about me.
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.240]   And then the people on the other side,
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.880]   Rini calls them the status quo warriors,
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:20.280]   say, well, don't criticize me,
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:22.280]   don't tell me what to do,
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:24.920]   because they still want to hold on to the power they have.
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:26.640]   This is all a process of renegotiating
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:28.000]   enormous society.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.600]   The worst part about Hight's piece is he acts
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:31.000]   as if this time is unique.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.200]   Try the Reformation, but in the 30 years war,
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:35.640]   you know, there's plenty of times before
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:37.240]   where technology has caused changes.
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:41.000]   It is an exception, a chronological exceptionalism
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.680]   to think that we're so special now, we're not.
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:46.080]   It was historically--
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:49.400]   - So are you saying there's no issue, there's no problem?
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:50.680]   - No, not at all.
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.040]   I'm saying that there are plenty of problems,
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:53.880]   and I'm saying the problems are a lot harder
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:57.680]   than he lets on, and the problems are us.
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:00.360]   The problems are that, and this is what Eddie Glod
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:02.160]   was trying to say today to them,
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:04.600]   is that we are deciding who we are as America,
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:06.520]   just because an American thing here.
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.240]   We're deciding who we are,
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:11.080]   and there are people who are resenting
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:13.480]   that there are more people having their voice and choice
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:15.560]   in that, and that's the essence of what's going on here.
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.440]   That's the basis of January six.
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:19.280]   That's the basis of Charlottesville,
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:22.120]   and don't cancel us and don't replace us.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:24.520]   Let's admit that, let's discuss that out loud,
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:26.520]   instead of saying, oh, it's social media's fault.
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:27.880]   They made us worse suddenly.
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:31.040]   No, we've been a racist country for 400 years,
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:32.600]   and it's coming to roost.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:33.960]   And so on Twitter today, I said,
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:35.920]   what's really going on here is that
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:38.600]   what he's ignoring is, as far as I'm concerned,
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:41.000]   Black Lives Matter is the reformation,
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.280]   and media are in the counter reformation.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.640]   And Andre Brock Jr., who wrote the book
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:50.160]   I saw admire, called "Distributed Blackness,"
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:53.280]   said, "Ooh, I like that construct back in Twitter."
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:55.720]   And what we're seeing is a point, counterpoint,
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:57.840]   that goes on at these moments of change in society.
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.560]   Yes, we're at a big moment of change,
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:02.400]   but we've got to grapple with our underlying problems,
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:04.000]   and we're not doing that.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.760]   I still need to be aspect of having some friction,
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:10.800]   as Miss Stacy mentioned.
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:13.480]   I think that's a sociolutionism,
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:15.040]   technological solutionism,
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:16.640]   that doesn't get to the core problem whatsoever.
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:19.040]   No, I'm just saying, just in the simplest form,
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:22.000]   having a little bit of friction to make you breathe a second
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.800]   before you hit send, you know?
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:25.200]   I think it's paternalistic.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.440]   I think that's saying, like today,
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:30.880]   I did want to tweet directly what was happening in the show.
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:33.120]   And nobody decides that, no, no, no, no,
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:35.520]   that's not good for you, you shouldn't do that.
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:39.840]   That's a paternalistic and techno-solutionism way,
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.160]   that I don't think so.
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:42.000]   That's the problem.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.840]   I have to say, Jeff, to me, it feels a little bit like,
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:51.120]   you're the guy, you're in the middle of it,
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.480]   and you love it, you love the engagement,
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:57.680]   the Hurley-Burley, and somebody like Ant,
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:59.040]   and probably because you're Black,
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.720]   you're not allowed to be centrist.
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:06.000]   You have to go to the far left.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.040]   I am the Black man,
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.480]   that's either not Black enough or I'm too Black.
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:10.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:11.760]   I don't have right in the middle of that.
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:12.760]   Exactly.
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:15.360]   And I think the vast majority of people
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:18.360]   are kind of in that middle in one way or the other.
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:20.800]   I think that's more the American state than anything else.
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:24.600]   And yet, so all of this so-called polarization
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:29.120]   is really this battle between the people on your side, Jeff,
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:31.520]   the extreme left and the extreme right.
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:34.000]   But there is a, I think it's not-
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.520]   It's right there, right there,
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:36.880]   you're making an equivalency.
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:40.040]   No, but wait, wait, there is a vast majority of people
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.840]   like Ant in the middle who are looking to the left,
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:44.720]   looking to the right, and saying,
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:48.280]   this doesn't reflect me, this is a battle
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:52.280]   that is not reflective of my experience.
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:53.360]   Right.
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:54.760]   I don't wanna put words in your mouth.
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:55.600]   I don't wanna put words in your mouth.
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:56.440]   100%.
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:59.280]   So I can kind of understand that.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:04.280]   And I think it's, I think that people like you, Jeff,
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:06.600]   who are in the Hurley-Berley of it,
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.000]   think that that's all that there is.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000]   I'm likely to be making presumptions here.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.480]   I know, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:12.920]   Hey, believe me, there's tons of people on the left
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:15.080]   who think I'm way too conservative.
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:17.680]   I defend capitalism, I defend these companies.
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:19.320]   Oh, so you get it too?
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:20.440]   I get it too absolutely.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.280]   I got it this way.
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:22.120]   Absolutely.
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:23.120]   I get it all the time.
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:24.640]   Not for the left, but he got it.
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:26.240]   And I don't want it, I wanna have discussions.
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:28.000]   I'm trying to write an academic book.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.360]   And what I love is having a discussion with,
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:31.600]   so how could, well, about this?
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.280]   How could, I mean, honest.
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:35.120]   (laughing)
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.120]   How can we get to the Google change log?
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.000]   There's a nudge, there's a little fridge.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.520]   Yeah, that was lovely.
[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:43.400]   I didn't mean to start this.
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:45.000]   This is actually the sort of thing I want.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.280]   I wasn't gonna go there, Stacey.
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:47.120]   I wasn't gonna go there.
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:48.680]   I appreciate you asking on the one.
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:51.080]   I thought it was, I was trying to like engage you.
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:53.360]   So it's normally I tune out all of this stuff.
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:54.360]   (laughing)
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:55.200]   That was a mistake.
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:56.200]   Now you don't watch.
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:58.280]   It's just, I know.
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:45:59.480]   She's like, I've done this.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:00.920]   I don't know what's wrong with me.
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:01.920]   (laughing)
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:03.920]   The Google change log.
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:08.160]   Now we can't find the phone dead note.
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:09.000]   There we go.
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.600]   The Google change log.
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:13.880]   I'm gonna rip through this 'cause I don't care.
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:14.720]   One bit of that.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:15.560]   There's not much here.
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:16.400]   There is not.
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.640]   Google search on desktop tests,
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:20.160]   redesign that puts images video and more
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:23.000]   to the left, Jeff.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:23.840]   Oh, wow.
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:24.680]   To the left.
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:25.520]   To the left.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:27.000]   It's your fault, sir.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:28.680]   I blame you.
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:33.080]   Google now is getting an upgrade to nearby share
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.360]   where you don't any,
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:36.520]   this makes me very nervous.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:41.200]   You don't actually have to say, okay,
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:42.040]   if you're in the--
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:42.880]   You're on your own computer.
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:44.280]   You're on your own computer.
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:46.160]   Which I think is probably a good idea.
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:49.480]   But it does also make me a little nervous
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:51.080]   that there is no, yeah, okay.
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:54.520]   You can actually with AirDrop on Apple,
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.360]   turn that on, I think so it happens automatically.
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:58.120]   So I guess that's just parody.
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:59.280]   It's catching up.
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:00.120]   It's catching up.
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:02.720]   Nearby share it's called.
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:04.520]   And I think it's moving Google closer
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:06.760]   to something Apple calls universal control
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:09.040]   where you can actually kind of control
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:11.480]   all the devices from any one of them.
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:14.480]   So interesting, we'll watch.
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:16.400]   There was another zero day in Chrome.
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:20.520]   This is the third emergency fix this year.
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:23.440]   Two vulnerabilities actually in the Chrome web browser,
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:27.720]   but one of them is a zero day already exploited in the wild.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:31.320]   Get your update to your Google Chrome.
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:33.120]   It's a high severity zero day bug
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:35.880]   actively abused by attackers.
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:40.920]   Steve Gibson talked about it yesterday on security now
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:42.520]   if you want more details.
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:44.640]   Can I ask you a question about that?
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:46.880]   So when I go looking for the show
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:48.840]   and I look up Google news,
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.520]   every time these kinds of things happen,
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:52.080]   a whole bunch of, it used to be like
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:53.880]   just the New York Post.
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:58.120]   And then it was your night ritter paper.
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:00.120]   And now it's even the technology publications,
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:03.400]   the CNET's, you must not install this immediately
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:04.760]   emergency emergency.
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:05.600]   It's going crazy.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:06.440]   It's late bait.
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:07.440]   It's all it is, right?
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:09.440]   There's not, I mean, yes, it's an update,
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.640]   but it's not a big deal, right?
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:11.480]   It's an editor's.
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:13.480]   And you get updated automatically.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:15.040]   So yeah, I wouldn't worry.
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:16.520]   But there are a lot of security flaws.
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:18.760]   We seem to be finding a lot of Microsoft
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:21.840]   to patch 238 flaws a week ago.
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:24.720]   So there are a lot of security flaws out there.
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:25.560]   And really--
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:27.280]   - You think there's more attention on it?
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:28.120]   - Yes.
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:31.760]   - And there's also more, you know, more people,
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:35.720]   a more people looking, but also we're recognizing
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:38.320]   and there's much more government paying attention
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:40.280]   and stockholders paying attention to,
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.960]   oh crap, this is a big deal.
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:43.160]   - Yeah.
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:45.600]   Yeah, I mean, we should pay attention to it.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:47.440]   We should, but it's not here on fire.
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:49.120]   It's not getting worse or anything or something.
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:50.480]   - Well, it might be.
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:52.280]   I mean, we've also gotta be aware that, you know,
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:53.760]   with the war in Ukraine, Russia is very much--
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.720]   - We basically started looking for things
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:56.560]   and found-- - That's right.
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:58.280]   - Is kind of what I feel like.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:00.160]   And we've been talking about it for a while
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:03.240]   and we've been building things that are gonna be better,
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:07.120]   but until that actually starts happening,
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:07.960]   we're kind of host.
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:08.800]   - Well, the positives.
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:10.680]   - Well, and our friend Craig Newmark, you know,
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:13.080]   just last week we talked about he's given $50 million
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.560]   to worry about our cybersecurity.
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:17.360]   So the positives plan on this is we are finding
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:18.200]   and fixing them.
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:19.040]   - Yeah.
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:20.040]   - I think that's really the truth.
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:23.040]   And that's, you could say we're gonna do better,
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:24.040]   but we're not gonna do better.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:26.520]   There's always gonna be bugs.
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:30.080]   Software is, it's just inherent in the process.
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:31.840]   So yes, we're getting better at finding them
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:33.720]   and we're fixing them, which is good.
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:36.900]   So update your Chrome if it's not updated already.
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:41.320]   Google is rolling out new badges for Chrome extensions,
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:44.880]   which will help you avoid the bad extensions.
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:47.200]   Why don't they just get rid of the bad--
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:48.040]   - I was wondering--
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:48.880]   - Yes!
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:53.160]   - You know the bad, don't get it.
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:56.080]   I guess it's the ones they can really verify are good.
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:56.920]   - Yeah.
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:00.880]   So Google is now using a manual process
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:03.640]   to evaluate extensions for an enjoyable
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:05.600]   and intuitive experience.
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:07.480]   They're also making sure under the hood developers
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:09.720]   are using the latest APIs
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:12.520]   and they're looking at extension privacy practices
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:13.720]   and permissions.
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:16.080]   And then if you do it all well,
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:19.480]   you will get a prize ribbon identifying you
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:22.240]   as a featured extension.
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:24.560]   It says, "Created by the owner of a listed website,
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:28.600]   "publisher has a good record, no history of violations.
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:33.600]   "It meets a high standard of user experience and design."
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:36.360]   - They should end that with comma yet.
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:37.200]   - Yet.
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:39.320]   Yeah, well that's actually not a joke
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:41.960]   because sometimes these extensions get sold.
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:43.520]   They're very popular, they're very safe
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:46.800]   and then the new owner does all sorts of nefarious things.
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:48.040]   So there are gonna be two badges,
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:51.920]   one with a check mark design for verified identity
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:55.080]   and another badge that looks like a prize ribbon
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.360]   for best practices.
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:59.440]   Look for those in the extension store.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:02.880]   Are you ready for your free Titan security key?
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:05.520]   If you are a Google One Two Terabyte subscriber,
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:08.720]   top of the line, best A number one,
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:13.400]   you're gonna get a free Titan security key
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:14.240]   to be eligible.
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:15.480]   - Each otherwise costs what?
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:20.240]   - I don't know, 35 bucks.
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:21.120]   - That's it, yeah.
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:21.960]   - Some, right?
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:23.120]   - That is some who could leave.
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:24.720]   - Thing is, you can't really, you shouldn't.
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:25.760]   - I'm in love with a,
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:27.240]   I gotta say, I'm too excited.
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:30.320]   I gotta point this out, you shouldn't really just have one.
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:31.800]   You should always have two.
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:34.600]   One you use, you carry around and one you keep some are safe.
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:37.040]   In case you lose the first one, I'm just saying.
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:42.040]   So anyway, these are nice USB-A or USB-C NFC enabled
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:47.040]   Titan security keys, has a built-in keychain loop.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:51.240]   Good way to get you started.
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:52.640]   I think I have a two terabyte.
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:54.000]   - That sounds like, that sounds like a,
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.320]   you know, one of those cheap TV commercials.
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.440]   And with a chain for your,
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:00.920]   with a loop for your key or keys, what'd you do?
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:02.600]   - Oh no, I will kinda hold it.
[01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:06.320]   - I keep my security key, it's not a Titan,
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:07.680]   it's a UB key, right?
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:10.000]   On my key chain right there,
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.760]   so I can, you know, I can log into things.
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:15.360]   My problem is I don't always carry my keys around.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:16.600]   That's my problem.
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:17.840]   - Well, you don't carry?
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:21.160]   - You should get locked out more often than you would.
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.760]   - Well, I mean, I'm in my home.
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:24.160]   How do you get into the office?
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:26.040]   - No, I'm saying it, like right now,
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:27.720]   I actually have my key in my pocket
[01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:30.640]   because I had to go to the toilet before we started the show.
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:34.120]   But any other time, my key is normally in the host office.
[01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:36.960]   - Right, but you walk around, I keep my pocket.
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:38.640]   - I keep my keys all the time.
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:41.160]   - Well, that's, honestly, one of the benefits,
[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:44.080]   there are two benefits to wearing a suit jacket
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:46.880]   like I do a blazer, one is it hides your girth,
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:50.080]   the other is it's got multiple pockets for storing,
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:53.440]   it's slimming, and they're like Captain Kangaroo,
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:56.320]   you got lots of pockets and you can carry all sorts of stuff.
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:57.520]   Highly recommended.
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:01.640]   You probably can't buy jackets that fit you though, I bet.
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:03.400]   - I can't be like just-- - It costs a lot.
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:05.960]   - You go like this and it splits down the back, right?
[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:06.800]   (laughing)
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:07.800]   It just costs a lot.
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:09.000]   - Shh, mad.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.800]   - Long arms, white shoulders.
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:16.680]   Google is rolling out conversation magnet tool.
[01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:19.280]   - No, conversion.
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:20.920]   - You're having a problem today.
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:21.760]   - Conversion.
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:23.800]   - You didn't do it in the right voice, that's why.
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:27.920]   Google rolling out conversion migration tools
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:30.360]   for Google Analytics 4.
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:33.040]   You can use this tool to import your usual,
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:35.120]   you know why I can't read this?
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:35.960]   You know why?
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:36.800]   'Cause it's--
[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:38.120]   - Okay, thank you very much.
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:38.960]   And that's--
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:39.800]   - Play the drums.
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:40.880]   Play the drums, John.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.600]   Go get us out of this.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:43.920]   - Change log.
[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:45.280]   Well, look here.
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:48.800]   Mr. Howe, I guess I owe you a beer
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:50.600]   because he did read it in mid-year.
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:51.440]   - Oh, did you bet?
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:53.040]   But I wouldn't read it.
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:55.360]   Yes, I put that into change log.
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:56.440]   Do you wanna defend it?
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:57.280]   Do you wanna say what it's all about?
[01:53:57.280 --> 01:53:58.120]   - No, no, no.
[01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:00.480]   I just put it in there because it is a change,
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:02.240]   but I had no interest in it either.
[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:05.440]   - Conversion migration tool for Google Analytics 4.
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:07.320]   We did have a side back here
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:08.160]   that most often--
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:09.000]   - Maybe the most--
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.320]   - The most important thing ever in the change log.
[01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:12.240]   Ever, wow.
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:13.920]   - Mr. Howe, I owe you a beer.
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:15.000]   He did read it.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:20.440]   I wish now to take you, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:22.120]   to Poundstown.
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:26.680]   Are you ready to buy a $420,000 home
[01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:29.280]   in Onalaska, Wisconsin?
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:31.200]   Look at this lovely home.
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:34.080]   The owner has a little bit of a predilection
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:36.480]   for signs.
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:37.520]   There's the American flag.
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:39.680]   There's a welcome sign in the door.
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:40.520]   Go inside.
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:42.880]   There's another welcome sign in the mudroom.
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:45.200]   Our nest pillow. - Oh, yes.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:46.840]   - Over the kitchen sink.
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:48.280]   The kitchen is for dancing.
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:49.240]   - Where is the bread?
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:50.080]   I forget.
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:50.920]   - Bread goes in the-- - Bread goes in the--
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:51.760]   - It's bread inside, honey.
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:54.480]   - By the way, I wanna know where I get this microwave.
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:56.720]   What is this super wide microwave for?
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:57.560]   - What is that?
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:58.400]   - Pranasaurus legs?
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:54:59.600]   I don't know what the hell.
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:00.560]   That is weird.
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.720]   Eat a little pizza peel that you must--
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:03.800]   - What are we supposed to do here?
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:06.120]   - Never use for a pizza.
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:09.360]   But the best part is in the bedroom, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:12.440]   where you will be welcomed to Pound Town.
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:14.360]   (laughing)
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:15.200]   - I cannot.
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:18.320]   Did they, I think they put that there just so much--
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:19.160]   - They did.
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:20.080]   You wanna hear the story?
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:20.920]   So this is great.
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:24.960]   This is from the Zillow Gone Wild Twitter account
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:27.480]   that lists, you know, interesting home listings,
[01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:30.600]   which there are many, but then the story came out
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:33.640]   and this is in Mel magazine.
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:38.640]   Laura Haganbarth and her husband Flip Holmes.
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:41.760]   When she listed her family's rural Wisconsin home
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:43.520]   for sale online on Friday,
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:46.840]   she hoped the spacious bedrooms, vast plot of land,
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:50.080]   and freshly refurbished decor would catch the eye
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:51.520]   of a few potential buyers.
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:52.360]   Never.
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:55.120]   In her wildest dreams, which she have guessed her house
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:57.920]   would land on Zillow Gone Wild,
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:01.840]   mainly because of the welcomed to the Pound Town sign.
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:04.760]   Whenever my, she should sound like,
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:09.760]   I never in my life thought I'd go viral for anything.
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:11.160]   - Oh, Midwestern mom.
[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:13.240]   - I don't even use Twitter, no.
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:15.800]   And my home is trending there today, like,
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:17.200]   what the heck?
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:18.040]   (laughing)
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:19.400]   That's an actual quote.
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:23.160]   They began buying and flipping houses in 2013.
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:25.240]   The house in Onalaska, Wisconsin,
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:29.440]   she lovingly refers to as the Pound Town house.
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:31.080]   Is there fourth?
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:32.960]   - I've always loved.
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:35.400]   She actually should be more, yeah, sure, you betcha.
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:37.480]   I've always loved decorating in design.
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:39.000]   I just kind of started winging it, you know.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.000]   - No, that's more Minnesota.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.800]   - When we started Flipping Holmes,
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:43.680]   since we do most of the work ourselves,
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:45.400]   they took like that Wisconsin too.
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:46.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:51.000]   Born from that penchant for interior decor and design,
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:54.040]   Haganbarth started a small online shop,
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:59.040]   sleepless beauty designs to sell her DIY signs
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:03.000]   and decorations, which helps to explain why there are--
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:03.840]   - She makes them?
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:05.680]   - She makes them.
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:07.080]   There are a few walls in the house that are--
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:08.720]   - One of the Pound Town is one that she makes.
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:09.640]   - She made it!
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:11.720]   (laughing)
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:13.040]   - She knows what it is.
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:14.520]   - She's gonna sell a fortune.
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:15.360]   - Yes!
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:17.680]   - People are saying I went overboard with the signs
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:19.480]   and I lead the layoff Michaels,
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:21.440]   even though I never go to Michaels.
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:24.960]   If I go to a store, it's Hobby Lobby or TJ Max,
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:27.840]   but I mainly make my own signs.
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:29.960]   - To be sure-- - Go to eBay, go to eBay
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:32.800]   and search for Pound Town.
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:33.640]   - Yeah.
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:35.000]   - It's already starting to pop your link.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:35.840]   - Oh yeah.
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:39.040]   She says I saw the original Pound Town sign
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:41.440]   in a group on Facebook and was,
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:44.240]   "Yeah, I love that, I need to make it."
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:49.640]   For some reason, Mel magazine then goes on to say,
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:52.160]   "For the sake of clarification,
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:55.680]   Pound Town is a euphemism for sexual intercourse."
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:57.520]   (laughing)
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:00.440]   And the sign welcomes visitors to the place
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:02.480]   where that happens.
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:06.200]   I wanted to make it look like just another cheesy decor sign,
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:08.520]   and then once you read it, bam!
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:11.600]   Run, she and hilarious.
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:12.920]   She created-- - I like this lady.
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:14.280]   - I know, did you love her?
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:16.040]   She created the sign while her husband was gone
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:17.960]   so she could surprise him when he returned.
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:19.640]   He absolutely loved it.
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:22.240]   It matches our humor to a tee,
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:25.200]   plus two or out of a three of our kids can't read.
[01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:27.280]   And when our oldest read it while I was making it,
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:29.720]   I just told her it was a funny quote from a movie
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:31.920]   and she never asked about it again.
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:37.300]   There is the story of Welcome to Pound Town.
[01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:40.320]   I think we have a show title.
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:42.560]   (laughing)
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:45.800]   - Is that great? - Is that great?
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:46.640]   Put it in the chat.
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:48.400]   - What does that say?
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:51.040]   - Delightfully, delightfully, puriant?
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:53.200]   - Yes, delightfully, puriant.
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:58.440]   There is a vodka made out of carbon dioxide,
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:00.240]   which is gonna save the planet.
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:01.560]   - Save the earth and get drunk.
[01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:03.200]   - Yeah, and then go to Pound Town.
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:06.560]   - Yeah, and for the fact that it's from a company
[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:09.080]   called The Air Company, they sell vodka,
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:14.080]   hand sanitizer and perfume made out of CO2,
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:18.200]   pulled out of the air.
[01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:22.080]   - Guess that way, is this right?
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:24.120]   The company claims the world's leading carbon
[01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:25.640]   technology company.
[01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:27.400]   It creates carbon negative alcohols
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:29.840]   and consumer products from CO2.
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:33.580]   They just raised $30 million in Series A funding.
[01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:38.040]   Here's the machine from air and water to alcohol
[01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:41.240]   in a number of steps through a fancy looking machine.
[01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:44.160]   Wow, all right, so there's a machine.
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:47.640]   If you wanna buy the vodka, it's called
[01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:50.040]   - The Air CO.
[01:59:50.040 --> 01:59:51.200]   - I don't know, I forgot to look up.
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:53.000]   - It's a fancy box.
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.720]   Should we go to the air company and buy some?
[01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:59.360]   Aircompany.com, we make products from air.
[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:01.880]   And then it says we use cookies to ensure.
[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:03.400]   (laughing)
[02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:05.160]   Welcome to the future.
[02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:09.040]   All right, here's the sanitizer, air sanitizer.
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:13.520]   That's the technology.
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:16.080]   Where do I buy the vodka?
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:17.120]   - They're hiding the goscha.
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:18.120]   - Yeah, they don't.
[02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:20.760]   - Products on the bottom.
[02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:22.360]   - Products, okay.
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:25.560]   - Perfume, air vodka, there it is.
[02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:26.400]   Okay, shop now.
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:27.800]   - Shop now, should I?
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:32.800]   - You know, Amy Webb sent me some glyph whiskey.
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:34.000]   - Oh, that's right, I was supposed to try that.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:34.880]   - You haven't tried it yet?
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:37.720]   Go get it, it's in the cabinet over the refrigerator.
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:39.040]   I think you should try it on the show.
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:39.880]   - Okay.
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:41.600]   - Might as well, right? - Sure, why not?
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:43.480]   - She sent us this whiskey that's made,
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:46.000]   also made completely synthetically
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.520]   to simulate the aging and stuff.
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:50.800]   So by the way, this vodka is gluten free.
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:53.120]   You can get it from--
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:54.720]   - $55 to $79.
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:57.040]   - That's not, well, that's a little pricey, isn't it?
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:00:57.880]   - A little pricey.
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:00.560]   - But that, you know, 40% alcohol by volume,
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:01.400]   is that what vodka or something?
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:03.560]   - Yeah, it's 80 proof, yeah.
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:06.120]   It's interesting.
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:07.560]   I wonder what it tastes like.
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:10.240]   It tastes like Brooklyn.
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:13.640]   All right, so this is, it's bottled in Brooklyn.
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:16.520]   So this is glyph, Amy Webb says,
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.080]   somebody's been drinking the glyph.
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:21.120]   - Amy Webb sent it to us,
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:23.280]   spirit whiskey with natural flavors.
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:26.600]   Shall I pour you a finger full?
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:28.520]   - Maybe a-- - Do you drink it neat?
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:31.840]   - Maybe I have finger considering what I've heard.
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:32.680]   Best plenty.
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:35.360]   - That is not very good.
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:39.160]   - Well, I don't wanna look a gift whiskey in the mouth,
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:42.440]   but I, it's, I don't know, see,
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:43.560]   this is why we wanted Antitribe,
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:45.200]   because he knows his whiskey.
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:46.680]   - What makes it special?
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:50.240]   - It's made, completely synthetically, it's not aged.
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:53.920]   They do all of the aging to make it--
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:55.920]   - It's due to the coal mill. - It's making a bourbon, yeah.
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:58.280]   In the lab.
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:01:59.120]   - Bourbon or a scotch?
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:00.280]   - It's a bourbon.
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:01.120]   - Bourbon.
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:07.760]   - 14 awards, platinum award at the 2020 SIP competition.
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:09.320]   - This doesn't smell good, sir.
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:11.200]   - It doesn't smell good, does it?
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:12.200]   - A bourbon, a must smell.
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:14.000]   - It's a whole plate of a bourbon.
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:16.280]   - Whew.
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:19.920]   - It smells chemically. - Let's go.
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:20.760]   - Chemical.
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:24.560]   - Oh, the face.
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:27.560]   (laughing)
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:29.120]   - That's all you need to know.
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:31.440]   - Whiskies owe their flavor, aroma, and mouth field
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:33.920]   of hundreds, sometimes thousands of molecules
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:37.000]   developed during the distillation barrel aging.
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.280]   To make glyph, we source these molecules directly
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:42.040]   from plants and yeasts, rather than obtaining them
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:44.080]   through distilling and aging.
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:46.720]   So essentially, they're able to produce whiskey
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:51.720]   with 94% less water, 92% less agricultural land use,
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:56.000]   and they emit 87% less CO2 emissions.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.200]   And I know that's what you're looking for
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:02:58.360]   in a good whiskey. - Oh, boy.
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:02:59.760]   - Is there any leftover lunch so that
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:00.960]   Ant can get the taste out of his mouth?
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:02.360]   - Oh, boy, that's bad.
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:04.080]   (laughing)
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:06.440]   - Okay, that was my thought when I drank it.
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:09.480]   Is this has, it tastes like a Cherokee D.
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:10.680]   It tastes like a cough syrup.
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:11.920]   - Oh, man.
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:13.840]   - First, we create a profile of our desired
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:17.040]   spirit, its precise flavor, aroma, and mouth field,
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:20.360]   and identify the constellation of molecules responsible
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:22.560]   for these characteristics.
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:24.160]   - I appreciate the effort, but--
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:25.560]   - Yeah, they're trying to, you know--
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:27.360]   - Some things you don't need to change.
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:28.720]   - Oh, boy, that's bad.
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:32.080]   - Tastes like dog patch, the neighborhood
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:33.640]   in San Francisco where it's made.
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:35.760]   Isn't that interesting?
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:37.160]   - They have great pizza and dog patch.
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:38.000]   - Oh, they do.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.720]   - Maybe if I had an ice cube in it, that would have helped it,
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:41.560]   but that--
[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:43.800]   - What would you, how would you describe it?
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:47.600]   - It's almost like it wanted to have a bit
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:51.440]   of a licorice taste to it, but it's just,
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:54.360]   but it's so much more medicine-y, like, you know?
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:56.000]   Like, um--
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.560]   - There's somewhere floral thing going on in it.
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:03:59.400]   - Oh, man.
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:01.720]   - It's not actually, it's not bad if you don't say,
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:04.120]   oh, this is just gonna taste like Jack Daniels.
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:05.960]   It's just, no, I didn't even,
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:07.520]   I wasn't even thinking that.
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:10.080]   I just went in blindly, that's why you smell it.
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:13.240]   - And it does taste a little like A&W root beer.
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:15.080]   - No, no, I don't want that either.
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:16.720]   (laughing)
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:18.160]   - Root beer is horrible.
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:20.080]   - Okay, well, if you don't like root beer,
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:21.120]   I don't know how to trust you.
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:23.760]   - Yeah, maybe with an ice cube,
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:25.200]   it would be a little bit better.
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:27.000]   - But that was hard.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.200]   Is this taste this like--
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:30.800]   - I'm hoping you like that.
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:32.720]   - Well, it's just not for me,
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:35.840]   but I appreciate the effort that they put into this.
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:40.280]   - Yeah, it's interesting.
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:44.600]   Maybe they just need to go a little farther, I don't know.
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:48.080]   All right, let's take our final break.
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:49.760]   That is not our pick of the week.
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:50.600]   - No.
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:52.200]   (laughing)
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:53.640]   - But we will get to our picks of the week.
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:54.800]   - I'm used to drinking something.
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:57.360]   - 'Cause I can ask you to throw a full barrel carburetor.
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:58.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:00.840]   - Well, you know what, if you ran out of gas,
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:02.360]   you might be set.
[02:05:02.360 --> 02:05:03.560]   - Sorry?
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:05.760]   - The center cam, have you looked at the center cam?
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:06.600]   - No, what is this?
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:08.080]   I'm gonna look at it right now.
[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:10.520]   - The center cam, I wonder if you recommend this first.
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:11.560]   - Calm.
[02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:12.400]   I haven't seen this.
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:14.280]   - We don't have to shake your audience.
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:17.960]   It's the world's middle screen webcam.
[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:20.440]   So it's in the middle of your screen.
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:23.160]   - So that you're looking at right at looking at--
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:25.000]   - Oh, that's an interesting idea.
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.440]   So it hangs over from your screen.
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:30.080]   That's fine, but what if you're trying to be warm?
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:32.200]   - Oh, but it's a little ring light.
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:34.880]   - Yeah, it's got its own little ring light, that's cute.
[02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:36.920]   That's not gonna give you much brightness, is it?
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:37.920]   - No, not that.
[02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:40.480]   But I mean, but what if you're someone
[02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:42.200]   that's actually trying to do work during
[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:45.160]   a Zoom call, what have you, on the laptop?
[02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:46.440]   - What if you're trying to be on Twitter
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:47.760]   while you're also recording?
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:50.000]   (laughing)
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.800]   - I don't like that.
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:56.040]   I think laptop cameras are fine,
[02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:57.640]   where they are at the top of the screen.
[02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:59.000]   As long as you just look at it.
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:02.240]   - And are we all used to people looking below us?
[02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:04.960]   Well, you don't look, you're not looking below us.
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:05.960]   So what are you looking at, J?
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:07.440]   - I do, people I try to look at.
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:08.800]   - People yell at me all the time.
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:09.640]   - You're looking down.
[02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:11.240]   - I never look at the camera.
[02:06:11.240 --> 02:06:13.400]   - Yeah, it's hard.
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:16.000]   - I think we don't want people to look at the camera.
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.640]   - I can't say that.
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:20.200]   - It's a little creepy, if I start doing the show
[02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:22.680]   and I'm really boring into your eyes and looking at you,
[02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:24.840]   don't you think that's a little bit creepy?
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:27.160]   - You're supposed to look at our foreheads, Leo.
[02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:29.320]   (laughing)
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:33.200]   - Even when I did TV, and I think I was pretty good
[02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:34.800]   at connecting with the audience,
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:36.800]   I would always glance away.
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.160]   'Cause I don't think people want you to stare at it.
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:39.480]   - Well, yeah, every now and then,
[02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:40.920]   I would always, yeah.
[02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:43.280]   - 'Cause you look robotic otherwise.
[02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:44.800]   - Well, you know, it's like,
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:47.960]   - But you can use it as punctuation where you go,
[02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:50.000]   you know, I really wanna tell you something.
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.120]   - Yes, right, right, right.
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:54.240]   - And then it's punctuation.
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:55.840]   But you don't wanna do the whole time
[02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:58.160]   you're talking into the camera.
[02:06:58.160 --> 02:06:59.440]   I'll have to watch some news.
[02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:01.240]   - That's why you have zero.
[02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:02.280]   - Yeah, that's true.
[02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:04.560]   But I think Anderson Cooper might look
[02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:05.840]   into the camera.
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:07.440]   I don't know.
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:08.780]   I don't know.
[02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:10.520]   (laughing)
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:11.440]   - I need water.
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:13.080]   - Let's all stare.
[02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:19.120]   - Let's go to the ad so we can get our waffles.
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:21.360]   (laughing)
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:26.200]   - Our shirt and one eye.
[02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:28.400]   One eye goes a little to the other.
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:30.960]   - I'm cross-eyed, don't bring it up.
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:31.800]   - Oh, sorry.
[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:33.280]   - Let's see, again,
[02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:36.960]   I'm handicapped and you should not mock it.
[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:37.800]   - I don't mock it.
[02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:38.800]   I was saying that with a little bit of a--
[02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:41.800]   - Yeah, no, I have a, when I was a kid,
[02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:44.880]   it was funny, I remember going to the doctor.
[02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:45.880]   I remember this vividly.
[02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:48.200]   I must have been in seven, eight.
[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:50.880]   And the doctor's talking to my mom and she says,
[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:52.640]   well, you know, one eye turns in a little,
[02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:54.880]   but it's not like he's gonna be on TV or anything.
[02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:57.080]   (laughing)
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:58.800]   I swear to God.
[02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:01.400]   That's what the doctor said.
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:03.160]   And I don't know if that had anything to do with anything.
[02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:04.240]   - Doctor ever.
[02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:06.320]   - But yeah, it's amblyopia.
[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:07.280]   It's had a little bit of a lazy.
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:08.200]   Yeah, my daughter had it too.
[02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:12.200]   When she was little, we, she had to wear a patch,
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:14.720]   poor little kid, and then special glasses
[02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:17.600]   and it's been corrected and had my parents done that.
[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:20.320]   But they thought, he's not gonna be on TV.
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:23.280]   Our show today brought to you by Blueland.
[02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:27.040]   I am on a crusade.
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:29.800]   I really am to eliminate, and Lisa and I are together
[02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:32.280]   on this eliminate single use plastics.
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:36.560]   I just, I feel like there's a few things we can do
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:38.560]   in our lives to make the world a better place.
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:41.240]   I see the plastic patch in the, you know,
[02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:42.760]   in the middle of the ocean.
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:47.760]   I see turtles and animals, sea animals die from plastics.
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:51.840]   We now have plastics in our lungs, in our bloods.
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:53.080]   We have microplastics.
[02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:56.480]   And it uses oil.
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:57.640]   It's a bad thing.
[02:08:57.640 --> 02:08:59.960]   So I'm gonna, you know, I don't carry plastic bags
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:03.240]   at the grocery store, we have shopping bags.
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:05.200]   We try to eliminate plastics everywhere.
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:06.960]   There is one place in our lives.
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:08.760]   It's hard to eliminate plastics.
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:11.200]   That's in the cleaning things we use,
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:12.400]   the clean products we use.
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:17.400]   But I have to tell you, an estimated five billion
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:20.560]   plastic, hand soap, and cleaning bottles
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:22.080]   are thrown away in America every year.
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:25.000]   Five billion thrown away.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.480]   And if that weren't bad enough,
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:31.200]   most of those bottles were filled with 90% water
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:34.160]   when they were delivered to the store in a big truck.
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:36.080]   They're shipping water around in these.
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:40.360]   Blue land has figured out a way to win for everybody.
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:43.280]   Stop wasting water, stop throwing out more plastic,
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:48.280]   get Blue Land's revolutionary refill cleaning system instead.
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:49.680]   Blue Land was founded on the belief
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:52.600]   that a cleaner planet starts by eliminating plastic waste
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:54.440]   while creating powerful, effective cleaners
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:55.280]   in your entire home.
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:56.440]   And I know what you're thinking,
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:09:58.400]   oh, I've tried those eco-friendly cleaners.
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:00.280]   They don't work, no, these work.
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:01.120]   These are great.
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:01.960]   This is an example.
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:04.360]   This is a Blue Land Forever bottle.
[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:07.360]   This is on a multi-surface.
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:08.640]   It's a beautiful bottle.
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:11.680]   It's about 10 bucks when you buy the kit.
[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:12.800]   You don't throw it away.
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:15.600]   When you use it up, you fill it up with warm water
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:19.000]   up to the line and you drop in a tablet.
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.560]   And it dissolves and it makes a great cleaning solution.
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:23.400]   They've got multi-surface cleaner.
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:25.000]   They've got dish washing soap.
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:28.240]   They've got hand dish washing soap.
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:29.920]   They've got dish washing machine soap.
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:31.720]   They've got toilet cleaner.
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:32.840]   Those tablets are great, by the way.
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:34.160]   Throwing them, you don't need a bottle for that.
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:35.200]   You throw it in the toilet.
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:36.720]   It's incredible.
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:41.360]   I have the hand soap everywhere in the house.
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:42.360]   We even have it at work now.
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:43.800]   Did you see that I put some in?
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:45.320]   And this smells great.
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:46.600]   And then when you run low,
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:48.400]   they don't throw this out.
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:50.080]   You don't get a new bottle.
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:51.280]   You just get a tablet.
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:53.040]   They have a replenishment service if you want,
[02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:56.320]   you can just order them on demand as you need them.
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:58.000]   They have wonderful scents.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.800]   Iris agave, that's what's in the bathroom,
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:00.840]   the mens room right now.
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:03.560]   Perine lemon, lavender, eucalyptus.
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:06.360]   They have unscented products as well,
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:07.800]   if you don't want scents.
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:09.200]   We wash all our laundry in it.
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:11.400]   We do our dish washing in it.
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:13.720]   No more plastic bottles for us.
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:15.080]   And it feels good.
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:17.840]   And you're not sacrificing anything.
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:19.520]   They're effective.
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:21.920]   So just discard that outdated idea
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:24.920]   that eco-friendly products are more expensive and less effective.
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:26.640]   You're gonna save money.
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:29.920]   These tablets, money-saving refill tablets
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:31.640]   started just $2 each.
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:37.560]   So this is an incredible money saver, earth saver.
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:38.760]   And you're gonna love it.
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:41.240]   Plastic-free laundry and dishwasher tablets.
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:43.960]   The toilet tablet cleaner sells out,
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:45.720]   get it, it's back in stock.
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:47.560]   I am a huge fan.
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:48.640]   Just fill these beautiful,
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:51.960]   Instagrammable bottles with warm water, pop in.
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:53.920]   One of the hand-soap or spray cleaner tablets.
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:56.360]   And within minutes you have a powerful cleaning product
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:59.440]   that smells great, works great, and is earth-friendly.
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:04.400]   I think in every respect, this is a win all around.
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:05.320]   Try Blue Land today.
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:06.400]   You're gonna love it.
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:08.080]   Your planet will thank you.
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:10.760]   Your kids will say, "Wow, it smells good in here."
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:12.400]   And they'll wash their hands more.
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:15.280]   I swear to you, I love the foaming hand soap.
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:17.960]   I've got it, like I said, it's in everywhere now.
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:18.960]   Even in the men's room.
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:20.840]   We gotta get one for the ladies.
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:22.880]   Right now you get 20% off your first order

[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:31.960]   This is a great housewarming gift
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:34.200]   when my daughter moved into her new apartment.
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:35.840]   I set her up with a Blue Land.
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:37.040]   She's got Blue Land everywhere.
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:38.140]   It's wonderful.
[02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:42.160]   Blueland.com/twig.
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:46.280]   You know, every plastic bottle ever made
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:48.080]   is still sitting there in the landfill.
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:48.920]   They don't degrade.
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:49.760]   They don't go away.
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:50.600]   They just sit in there.
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:51.440]   Scary.
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:52.280]   Billions of them.
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:53.680]   Let's stop that, right?
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:55.800]   Right now you can get 20% off your first order.
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:59.440]   When you go to blueland.com/twig.
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:02.600]   Blueland.com/twig.
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:04.520]   This is an advertiser I love.
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:06.320]   I can really get behind.
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:09.160]   All right, Stacey, you said you were gonna help
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:12.360]   in Stion users find a better solution.
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:15.760]   Yes, if you go to Stacey on AOT, I have a link for y'all.
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:17.000]   This is a bunch of options.
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.160]   So the best way to go is just,
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:23.640]   this is every single option available for you today.
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:25.840]   Many of which are actually things,
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:28.680]   we haven't tried to move it over
[02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:30.800]   'cause we don't have a non-working in Stion hub,
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:32.280]   either of us.
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:33.600]   Kevin actually used to have one,
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:35.240]   but he shut it down years ago.
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:38.520]   So you're talking about hoops,
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:40.240]   which, or have habitat hoops.
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:42.240]   Whose home assistant open have.
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:43.080]   Okay. All of these.
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:45.560]   So basically we cover the gear that you need,
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:48.360]   the instruction, we link directly to the instructions
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:51.600]   from the most reputable version of those instructions.
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:55.200]   There's even an insti-uncompatible product of home sear.
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:58.920]   That's interesting. Yeah, home sear, yeah.
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:04.040]   So basically a lot of options available to you,
[02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:07.320]   differing costs, different capabilities,
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:12.320]   but personally I would, okay, sorry.
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:13.720]   She's boring herself.
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:14.560]   (laughing)
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:15.800]   Actually, you should, she's.
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:16.960]   You know what I'm talking.
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:17.800]   That's the first.
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:19.440]   Yeah, I don't know what happened there.
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:20.920]   You're like, "What'd you put?"
[02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:22.440]   Would you like some glyph?
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:23.840]   (laughing)
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:24.680]   No, no.
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:29.040]   I teach food and water, I guess.
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:32.800]   Anyway, I would say, I know there's lots of people
[02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:34.240]   who are like, "We're gonna get the code
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:35.360]   and we're gonna set it back up."
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:37.680]   I'm like, "Y'all, it's done."
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:39.360]   It is done.
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:41.560]   Just stop buying more.
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:43.200]   I have a lot of that. It would be nice.
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:45.920]   Somebody put out a press release saying that
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:48.400]   instead of just disappearing.
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:50.400]   That's bizarre. Yeah, it would be nice.
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:53.800]   And we'll wait for that.
[02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:56.200]   Or maybe they could file for bankruptcy in the meantime.
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:58.320]   Yeah, something, anything. Let us know.
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:00.480]   I'm keeping an eye open.
[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:01.520]   I'll let y'all know.
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:05.360]   It's a front page of Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:07.160]   And if you ever needed a reason to go there now,
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:08.000]   you've got it.
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.560]   That's a, what a wonderful thing you're doing over there.
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:12.160]   That's good. Thank you, Stacy.
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:15.800]   And Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:18.040]   Welcome to Butch's Lost Town.
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:21.560]   I want you to get that sign.
[02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:25.920]   I saw On eBay have a mayor of Pound Town.
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:28.760]   Oh, I might get that for our bedroom.
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:30.160]   That's good.
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:31.680]   Yeah, that's good.
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:36.720]   All right, so there's a whole bunch of numbers.
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:38.160]   But I'm gonna go to one in one.
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:39.640]   Anyone you want. Yeah.
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:41.200]   Well, we can just go through them real quickly.
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:42.560]   Okay. Go through the change lock.
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:43.760]   Yeah, good.
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:47.440]   Jassy's letter to shareholders says that Amazon now employs
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:50.080]   260,000 drivers worldwide.
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:51.520]   Wow. That's amazing.
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:53.520]   I said earlier, the digital advertising is going down.
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:57.520]   It's up 35% according to the interactive advertising bureau.
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:01.200]   Digital ads, digital video is up 50%.
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:04.840]   Digital audio is the biggest winner of 57%.
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:06.240]   Podcasts.
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:07.400]   All of that, yes.
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:09.400]   Podcasts.
[02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:12.600]   And there's a survey of teenagers.
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:14.160]   Now I'm forgetting who did it.
[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:15.160]   Sandler.
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:17.360]   By percentler. Yeah.
[02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:20.320]   26% of teens own a VR device,
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:23.440]   but only 5% use them daily.
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:28.440]   And 48% are not terribly interested in the metaverse.
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:34.880]   And TikTok is now the fave among the teens,
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:37.480]   the teen people, the teeners.
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:42.480]   The youths at 33% of finally being Snapchat at 31%.
[02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:43.600]   Oh, interesting.
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:45.640]   However, I'm going to go to an important number now,
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:46.880]   because this is something I didn't know.
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:48.600]   Maybe you all knew this and I just didn't know this,
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:50.120]   but there is not enough knowledge to this.
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:53.320]   Do you know what happens if you dial the number 988 on the phone?
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:54.880]   No.
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:56.040]   It is suicide hotline.
[02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:57.080]   Oh, that's good to know.
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:16:58.080]   That's not necessary.
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:16:58.880]   That's new.
[02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:01.320]   That's new, first of all, and it's not come.
[02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:02.520]   I don't think it's there yet.
[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:03.640]   Not fully there yet.
[02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:04.440]   Yeah.
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:07.280]   But that is why, remember we talked about this.
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:09.280]   Many people are going to have to dial 10 digit numbers.
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:11.280]   We're in the past, they didn't have to,
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:14.200]   because of this new 988.
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:15.520]   Let me see the exact date.
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:17.520]   All providers are required to route them.
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:18.000]   Yeah.
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.680]   And text messages to 988.
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:21.040]   Yeah, this is very, very.
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:22.480]   By July 16.
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:23.160]   There you go.
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:24.480]   It's not nationwide yet.
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:28.440]   The Trevor Project is on a poll and said that 69% of respondents
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:31.440]   had not seen, heard, or read much about this.
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:34.640]   So getting the word out is critically important.
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:36.360]   Actually, let me correct you.
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:38.880]   Oh, yes, you're right.
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:43.040]   By July 16, 988 will route calls to the National Suicide
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:44.400]   Prevention Lifeline.
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:46.920]   So this has to happen by July 15.
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:47.880]   OK.
[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:50.280]   All providers must complete this process.
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:50.920]   All right.
[02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:51.120]   Good.
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:51.840]   I did not heard it.
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:52.440]   I didn't know.
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:53.360]   Yeah, brand new.
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:54.720]   And that is really important.
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:55.880]   And thank you.
[02:17:55.880 --> 02:17:58.840]   I thought you were going to talk about Chipotle.
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:00.000]   Well, that is an interesting number.
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:00.560]   It's not.
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:01.040]   Is it not?
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:01.560]   It is.
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:01.880]   Go ahead.
[02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:05.080]   Chick-fil-A, number one restaurant among the youth.
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:07.960]   But Chipotle, which is number three,
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:10.480]   gained 300 BPS of share.
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:11.560]   What's that, BPs?
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:12.280]   It's per second.
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:12.760]   It's per second.
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:14.560]   It's BPs.
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:15.560]   Basis points.
[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:17.880]   Basis points to 8%.
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:20.200]   Starbucks number two at 11%.
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:25.080]   So among the youngs, Chick-fil-A, Starbucks, Chipotle.
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:27.360]   What's also interesting if you saw this on the rundown,
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:27.880]   I put it in there.
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:32.720]   Chipotle has started a $50 million VC fund, I guess,
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:33.960]   for new kinds of beans.
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:34.600]   I'm not sure.
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:37.480]   Oh, yeah, really.
[02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:38.000]   Huh.
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:41.240]   Then that's the numbers of the week.
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:43.000]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:44.800]   We could do a bunch of numbers every week.
[02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:45.360]   I don't mind that.
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:45.800]   I think it's going to--
[02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:46.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:46.760]   More work for me.
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:48.560]   Thanks a lot.
[02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:51.400]   Mr. Jarvis, that Amazon number about the drivers.
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:53.120]   What was that again?
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:55.800]   That's 260,000 drivers around the world.
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:18:57.840]   It's under the Amazon section.
[02:18:57.840 --> 02:18:59.520]   It's in Jassy's Shareholder Letter.
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:00.400]   Question for you.
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:01.600]   Do you think that's enough?
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:05.280]   Because of the whole work-conditioned narrative
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:06.800]   that we hear from all of the drivers
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:09.880]   struggling to make the deliveries on time?
[02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:11.320]   It's a good question, man.
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:13.240]   I mean, I was just thinking about--
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:15.760]   I mean, how long has it been since we've
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:18.800]   gotten an Amazon delivery from UPS or the mail?
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:20.520]   Yeah, it's been a while.
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:23.320]   They've managed to take it over in a way
[02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:25.680]   that-- who thought it was possible?
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:29.000]   There's these areas where I thought too small.
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.200]   Nobody's going to be able to map and restreat
[02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:32.040]   the country.
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:33.120]   That's ridiculous.
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:35.920]   It's fine that they're taking over, but what cost, though?
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:38.160]   Well, I think there is a cost-- not just to the humans,
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:39.840]   but also to the roads.
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:41.680]   I will get sometimes three or four deliveries
[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:43.680]   from three or four different trucks in one day.
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:44.400]   Oh, yeah.
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:44.640]   Yeah.
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:46.600]   And that means there's way too many trucks out there.
[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:47.480]   That's you.
[02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:48.760]   That's me.
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:49.760]   I am.
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:50.560]   Let me try to buy that.
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:52.000]   My driveway is a travel driveway.
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.400]   It is suffering.
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:54.760]   Yeah, right?
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:57.400]   We have a neighbor that gets so many Amazon deliveries.
[02:19:57.400 --> 02:20:00.160]   They put a giant metal box outside with instructions
[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:04.000]   and a number code, and it says, put the Amazon packages in here.
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:08.200]   And even then, many is the day where, obviously, the box
[02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:12.400]   is full and it's piled high with Amazon packages.
[02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:14.120]   So, Andy, I think a couple things.
[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:16.840]   I think that the unionization of Amazon, like Starbucks,
[02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:17.800]   is going to spread.
[02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:19.280]   No question about it.
[02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:20.680]   It's going to need to.
[02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:22.520]   Even though they pay more than everybody else
[02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:26.000]   and they've raised the salaries of people
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.280]   on hourly wages across industries,
[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:30.000]   that's part of the reason that we have inflation right now.
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.160]   But it's a good thing because it's a redistribution of wealth
[02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:33.480]   and it should happen.
[02:20:33.480 --> 02:20:34.960]   So Amazon has done that well, but yes,
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:36.480]   the work conditions are difficult.
[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:38.360]   They also, another story today is they're going to,
[02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:42.040]   they hired former attorney general.
[02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:44.400]   Oh, the lady.
[02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:47.280]   Yeah, Claude.
[02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:48.520]   Lorena Loretta Lynch.
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:49.440]   Lorena Bobbitt.
[02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:50.440]   I'll inch.
[02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:51.440]   I'll inch.
[02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:52.440]   Yeah, I'll inch.
[02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:54.440]   To do a race.
[02:20:54.440 --> 02:20:55.440]   Yeah, you know.
[02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:56.480]   I'll do a line words.
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:20:57.320]   Yes, we do.
[02:20:57.320 --> 02:20:57.680]   We do.
[02:20:57.680 --> 02:20:58.840]   That's what we're trying to talk over you.
[02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:00.280]   Not Lorena Bobbitt.
[02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:03.440]   Lorena Lynch, of course.
[02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:05.360]   Good lord, man.
[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:06.840]   Stacy just stares at the camera.
[02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:08.920]   She says, I'm so sorry I'm here.
[02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:11.360]   So, so sorry.
[02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:14.480]   Sorry, could I get a racial equity audit at Amazon?
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:16.120]   So I think it's going to, I think they're going to have
[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:19.280]   to change at the company and not a bad thing.
[02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:22.280]   Somebody, the chatroom is, many in the chatroom pointing out,
[02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:26.800]   I could, if I weren't so greedy, set my Amazon deliveries
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:27.920]   to all come on a single day.
[02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:28.920]   Same day, yeah.
[02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:29.920]   Yeah, yes you could.
[02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:30.920]   Yep.
[02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:31.920]   With that eliminate all those trucks?
[02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:33.920]   That's, isn't that a whole part of the whole thing?
[02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:35.920]   We're going to get eight trucks on the same day.
[02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:36.920]   Isn't that part of the whole thing?
[02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:37.920]   I'll try.
[02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:38.920]   I'll save the Earth message.
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:39.920]   Yeah, I'll try it.
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:40.920]   That's, you're absolutely right, I should do that.
[02:21:40.920 --> 02:21:41.920]   It is true.
[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:44.240]   Sometimes, because we have our set to go in the same day, but
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:46.960]   sometimes we do get multiple Amazon trucks at our house at the
[02:21:46.960 --> 02:21:47.960]   same time.
[02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:48.960]   Mm.
[02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:51.760]   So, but it can help.
[02:21:51.760 --> 02:21:53.160]   Yeah, I'll turn that on.
[02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:54.160]   All right, let's go.
[02:21:54.160 --> 02:21:56.560]   If you think about it, we all drove to five different pools.
[02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:57.560]   Waffles.
[02:21:57.560 --> 02:21:58.560]   Waffle time.
[02:21:58.560 --> 02:21:59.560]   Waffle time.
[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:00.560]   Waffle time.
[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:04.080]   It is first, though, before Waffle time.
[02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:06.680]   Aunt Pruitt's turn for his picks of the week.
[02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:11.600]   All right, quickly, first off, yesterday, not yesterday, Monday,
[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:16.840]   Blackmagic Design announced a bunch of new updates, cloud support, a whole lot of different
[02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:19.280]   hardware, a lot of stuff that I'm not going to necessarily need.
[02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:22.440]   And AB is coming this week, so they got stuff to say.
[02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:23.440]   Yes.
[02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:27.480]   But the thing that got me interested was the venture resolve.
[02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:31.360]   Beta 18 is out for people to play around with.
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:36.320]   I'm not using it yet, but I have been using resolve a little bit more recently for some
[02:22:36.320 --> 02:22:37.320]   client work.
[02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:39.840]   And 18 has me excited, so try it out.
[02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:40.840]   Go look at it.
[02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:43.240]   It's free if you're interested.
[02:22:43.240 --> 02:22:45.600]   Next, Adobe Max.
[02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:49.520]   They've announced their dates for this year, and it's in person.
[02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:50.520]   Woo hoo.
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:55.520]   That's some happy times for content creators to be able to get together again in downtown
[02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:56.520]   LA.
[02:22:56.520 --> 02:23:00.320]   So, I say, in October, I believe this is the 18th through the 20th or something.
[02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:01.760]   They're still streaming, if you want.
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:04.280]   But you can go to LA and do it in person.
[02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:05.280]   Yep, yep, yep.
[02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:06.280]   Nice.
[02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:10.960]   And next up, I wanted to give a shout out to Gamecock.
[02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:15.400]   And I know that sounds weird coming from a Clemson person, but Don Staley.
[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:16.400]   Don Staley is the--
[02:23:16.400 --> 02:23:18.000]   Oh, God bless our coach.
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:19.000]   Yes.
[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.480]   I'm down in Columbia, South Carolina.
[02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:24.520]   I used to watch Don Staley play basketball.
[02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:26.240]   Crush on Don Staley, good Lord.
[02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:27.240]   Oh, you're kidding?
[02:23:27.240 --> 02:23:28.240]   Oh, boy, yeah.
[02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:30.080]   She was the star of the March Madness.
[02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:33.440]   She was so good at the University of Virginia.
[02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:35.920]   And then she was with the Charlotte Sting.
[02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:38.640]   This is back in the '90s.
[02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:39.960]   And yeah, she's now the coach.
[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:41.960]   She's been the coach for about 12, 13 years.
[02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:42.960]   Yeah.
[02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:43.960]   Yeah.
[02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:44.960]   Yeah.
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:45.960]   Yeah.
[02:23:45.960 --> 02:23:47.960]   One, the National Championship for the second time this year.
[02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:54.600]   And her speech was just the best because she took the time to recognize not only the
[02:23:54.600 --> 02:24:01.320]   players that start on the team for the basketball team, but she also made a point to shine the
[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:04.760]   light, quote, on the bench players because--
[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:05.760]   Good.
[02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:06.760]   That's the thing.
[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:09.000]   A lot of folks stayed kids anyway.
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:12.640]   They don't quite get the fact that, hey, even though you're not necessarily a starter,
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:15.760]   you're still very important on the team.
[02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:21.520]   So if you check that link out and I show notes to watch that video, it's very, very heartwarming.
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:27.120]   And I will not hold it against her that she had a $500 jacket on.
[02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:28.120]   That was--
[02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:29.120]   She's paid.
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:30.120]   Yeah.
[02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:31.120]   She's got the money.
[02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:36.800]   First, black coach in men's or women's division won basketball history to win multiple championships
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:38.520]   with South Carolina.
[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:41.600]   She won when they won her first national championship.
[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:44.040]   I think it was back in '07.
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:50.120]   And when they cut down the basketball net, she took her pieces of the net and trimmed it
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:54.200]   up into little pieces and sent it to all the other black coaches in the league.
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:55.200]   Because this is your--
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:57.920]   Just say, hey, you're winning too.
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:24:58.920]   Yeah.
[02:24:58.920 --> 02:24:59.920]   $5,000.
[02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:00.920]   Sorry, Louis Vuitton.
[02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:01.920]   I was like a $500 jacket.
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:03.720]   It was not actually that expensive.
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:04.720]   Sorry, $5,000.
[02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:07.600]   She's the highest paid coach now.
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:09.600]   She's up there amongst the great--
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:10.600]   Good for her.
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:11.600]   --she's got to be.
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:12.600]   She's got to be.
[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:13.600]   She's got to be.
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:15.000]   She's got to be in college basketball.
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:16.000]   So yes.
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:17.000]   Awesome.
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:25.280]   Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are concluding this episode of this week in Google.
[02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:26.280]   Fun show.
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:27.280]   Thank you, Stacey Higginbotham.
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:28.920]   It's Stacey on IOT.
[02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:29.920]   Sign up for her newsletter.
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:31.440]   It's freestaceyoniot.com.
[02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:37.720]   The free fabulous show she does with Kevin Tuffle, the IOT podcast at Gigastacey on the
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:38.720]   Twitter.
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:41.200]   If you want to follow her, nice Twitter.
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:42.200]   It's over there.
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:43.200]   Smart.
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:44.200]   Nice Twitter.
[02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:45.200]   Twitter.
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:52.800]   If you want to follow the evil Twitter at Jeff Jarvis at Buzzmachine.com.
[02:25:52.800 --> 02:25:53.800]   At face.
[02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:54.800]   Just grumpy Twitter.
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:55.800]   Grumpy Twitter.
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:57.800]   The director of the townite center.
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:25:58.800]   I'm not.
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:04.040]   For entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:08.280]   At the city of University of New York.
[02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:10.880]   No, he's not grumpy.
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:12.520]   Not grumpy.
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:14.240]   The crew host hands on photography.
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:15.880]   What's coming up this week on hands on photography?
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:16.960]   You can do a little street.
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:18.680]   We're going to talk street photography again.
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:22.440]   I have another photographer that's actually local here to the area.
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:23.960]   It's going to be great.
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:26.760]   He gets up great close and intimate.
[02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:30.840]   I am going to listen because I am so embarrassed to take pictures of people.
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:32.080]   He gets right in there.
[02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:33.680]   Right in their faces.
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:36.040]   I just want to know what his trick is to do that.
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:37.920]   It's going to be good.
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:39.840]   Can I shout out Mr. Jarvis?
[02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:40.840]   Yes.
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:45.080]   Mr. Jarvis was on the fireside chat for Club Twitter last week.
[02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:46.080]   Holy crap.
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:47.560]   It was so much fun talking to him.
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:48.560]   It was a lot of fun.
[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:50.360]   I tried to ask more questions than he has.
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:51.360]   Oh, no.
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:52.640]   That's not how that show was going to work with me.
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:53.640]   I know it didn't.
[02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:54.640]   I tried.
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:55.640]   I tried.
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:56.640]   I tried.
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:57.640]   He did.
[02:26:57.640 --> 02:26:58.640]   He did.
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:01.480]   That's on the Twit Plus feed if people didn't get there for the AMA.
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:02.480]   We've got some more coming up.
[02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:04.920]   Scott Wilkinson is May 5th.
[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:07.320]   Stacey's book club termination shock.
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:08.320]   Neil Stevenson.
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:09.320]   You have a little time to read it.
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:10.800]   You need time to read it.
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:11.800]   I'm not sure if you're going to get a month off.
[02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:13.800]   But you can't read the last week.
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:15.960]   I had shorter options in there.
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:16.960]   No, no, that's good.
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:19.960]   You forgot sympathy from Stacey last week saying, yeah, that's not like this is a real
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:20.960]   long one.
[02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:21.960]   This is good, man.
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:23.320]   But I'm enjoying it so far.
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:24.320]   So yeah, we're good.
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:26.160]   Well, you've been listening or reading.
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:27.160]   I'm listening.
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:28.160]   I'm listening to it.
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:30.680]   I think the Seek Warrior section is a lot of fun.
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:31.680]   You should enjoy that.
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:32.680]   Yeah.
[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:36.320]   All I know is right now vitamin D is not what I thought it was.
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:37.320]   Uh oh.
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:38.880]   That's all I was saying.
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:40.440]   All of this happens in the club.
[02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:44.120]   Now, if you're not a member of Club Twit, I hope you're not feeling left out.
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:45.120]   It isn't expensive to join.
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:46.120]   You don't need to be fluffed out.
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:47.120]   Not at all.
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:48.920]   No, he's going to take it away.
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:50.080]   Gets you in.
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:52.880]   You get a lot of benefits to all of the shows ad free.
[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:53.880]   Absolutely.
[02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:55.800]   You don't even hear this plug for Club Twit.
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:28:00.680]   You also get the Twit Plus feed.
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:01.680]   Again.
[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:03.880]   And not in the right voice.
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:10.360]   The Twit Plus feed and access to our fine discord where all the chatting happens.
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:13.680]   It's really a wonderful, wonderful place.
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:18.960]   So if it's a big support for us too, we are able to launch shows in there because they're
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:19.960]   not ad supported.
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:24.960]   So we're able to launch them in there with a support of our members twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:27.640]   Thank you in advance.
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:32.800]   But also, sir, we now offer annual plans for Club Twit.
[02:28:32.800 --> 02:28:37.160]   So if you don't want to do the seven bucks a month, you can just sign up for you.
[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:38.160]   84 bucks for able.
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:41.600]   The reason we did that, a lot of people wanted to buy a gift for a family member or something
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:44.520]   like that instead of buying a $7 gift.
[02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:45.520]   They wanted to buy a year.
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:47.000]   So there you have it.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.400]   There's corporate memberships as well.
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:51.040]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:52.720]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:53.720]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:54.720]   Go get some waffles.
[02:28:54.720 --> 02:28:57.480]   Go get some kachoypepe.
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:28:58.480]   Thank you, Aunt Pruitt.
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:00.440]   I'm going to get some water.
[02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:01.720]   Get some water and...
[02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:03.840]   Too much glyph.
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:06.200]   I'll watch down the glyph.
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:07.400]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:12.800]   We do this week in Google, 2PM Pacific every Wednesday, 5PM Eastern, 2100 UTC.
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:16.840]   If you want to watch us live live.twit.tv, there's also an audio stream there.
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:21.760]   If you're watching or listening live, chat live, IRC.twit.tv or, of course, in our Club
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:23.880]   Twit Discord.
[02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:28.200]   After the fact, all of the shows are available at the website, twit.tv in the case of this
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:31.360]   show, twit.tv/twig.
[02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:33.640]   You'll see at that page some links.
[02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:35.040]   There's a YouTube channel.
[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:37.280]   All the Twit shows are there.
[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:40.400]   There's also links to your favorite podcast players.
[02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:44.520]   You can subscribe to those in one of those and get the show automatically.
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:47.480]   The minute it's available on Wednesday evening.
[02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:49.480]   We thank you for listening.
[02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:50.480]   Have a wonderful week.
[02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:52.960]   We'll see you next time on Twit.
[02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:53.960]   Bye-bye.
[02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:54.960]   I'm sorry.
[02:29:54.960 --> 02:29:57.960]   I didn't mean to do that.
[02:29:57.960 --> 02:30:03.120]   Hey, I'm Rod Pyle, editor of Ad Astra Magazine.
[02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:08.120]   And each week I'm joined by Tariq Malek, the editor in chief over at space.com, in our
[02:30:08.120 --> 02:30:10.160]   New This Week in Space podcast.
[02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:13.840]   Every Friday, Tariq and I take a deep dive into the stories that define the new space
[02:30:13.840 --> 02:30:14.840]   age.
[02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:15.840]   What's NASA up to?
[02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:18.040]   When will Americans once again set foot on the moon?
[02:30:18.040 --> 02:30:20.480]   And how about those samples from the Perseverance rover?
[02:30:20.480 --> 02:30:21.920]   One of those coming home.
[02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:24.120]   What the heck is Elon Musk done now?
[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:27.720]   In addition to all the latest and greatest in space exploration, we'll take an occasional
[02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:31.600]   look at bits of space flight history that you've probably never heard of.
[02:30:31.600 --> 02:30:34.760]   And all with an eye towards having a good time along the way.
[02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:36.320]   Check us out on your favorite podcatcher.
