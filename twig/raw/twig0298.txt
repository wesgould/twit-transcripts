[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, Jeff's in New Delhi or somewhere.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.800]   But don't worry, because we've got a great show planned for you.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.720]   Mike Elgin is here. Aaron Newcomb, Aaron's going to show him,
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.160]   show us, his new arcade project.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.960]   We'll talk about Google's quarterly results.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.600]   Twitter's too. It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.400]   Netcast you love.

[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.200]   Episode 298, recorded Wednesday, April 29, 2015.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.000]   Aaron's arcade.

[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.960]   It's time for Twig. This weekend, Google and Jeff Jarvis is somewhere outside the United States.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.960]   Where is he today, Jason? He's in India?
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.600]   You know, he told me.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.400]   He told me too. I forgot.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.320]   Problem is he's all over.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.120]   So anyway, he's outside of the internet.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.080]   It's such a thing that might exist.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.760]   Fortunately, we always have great people to fill in Mike Elgens here, our news director.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.000]   You had a busy morning with the Build Conference.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.120]   We'll talk about that.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.960]   Yeah, we had an awesome show today, Tech News.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.040]   I'm excited.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.040]   Actually, it's hard to believe that on a Google show, I would say I'm excited,
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.720]   but I am actually about mine.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.880]   Aaron Newcomb is also here.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.320]   You see him all the time on all about Android and on Floss Weekly.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.400]   We love Aaron and he has a people on along his little Raspberry Pi project.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.840]   Yeah, I had to because I feel so inadequate sitting next to you guys.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.080]   You guys are going to have to really keep me honest today, but I did bring a project
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.760]   and we'll talk about that.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.200]   I feel like you brought Watson.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.040]   Yeah. I feel like Watson is sitting there ready to answer questions.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.880]   It's kind of like the opposite of Watson, actually.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.320]   Yeah, it's backwards Watson.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.320]   Backwards Watson, yeah.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.400]   But it's fun.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.880]   So this is a show where we talk about Google, the cloud, Twitter, of course, big in the news.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.720]   Twitter results got leaked.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.320]   Although, I guess they didn't get leaked.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.120]   They released them ahead of time.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.680]   Right.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.960]   And the stock plummeted and they stopped trading briefly.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.680]   But it didn't plummet because the leak was accurate.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.200]   Right.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.440]   The plummeted because the information was bad for Twitter.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.680]   So, yeah.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.760]   But they showed a profit.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.480]   They showed--
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.080]   So what went wrong at Twitter?
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.760]   Why did the stock-- first of all, we should say,
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.120]   "Hey, don't get your stock advice from us.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.680]   That's not our job.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.840]   We're not here to make you money in the stock market.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.480]   We're here to talk about technology from the point of view of users of technology."
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.880]   So if we say, "We hate Twitter," that doesn't mean it's bad--
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.920]   It's your sell the stock.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.400]   It's your sell the stock.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.200]   That means we don't like it as a user.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.120]   But-- and I think the stock price does not necessarily reflect the strength or weakness
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.000]   of a company.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.680]   Right.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.400]   It reflects what investors think they're going to be able to make or lose on.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.320]   One of the-- I think one of the things people are talking about is that online
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.000]   advertising is hard right now.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Like everybody is--
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   It's hard for some.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Not for Facebook and Google.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.360]   What's happened-- I think generally speaking what's happening is that everything's moving
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.360]   to mobile.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.480]   And mobile is less monetizable.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.640]   The prices are lower.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.840]   The eyeballs don't stick around as long.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.720]   It's difficult to monetize mobile users and everybody's becoming increasingly mobile.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.720]   Their revenue was up.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.160]   But their advertisement-- advertising dollars were not what anybody expected.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.480]   It's actually pretty dire in a way.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.120]   The problem is that Twitter has lots of eyeballs and they're having trouble figuring out how
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.760]   to monetize it.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.080]   And so what they're doing is they--
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.080]   But that's always been the case.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.680]   In fact, the fact that monetizing at all is almost new.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680]   But--
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   Well, this is the thing.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.360]   They began all these major initiatives to monetize that they have suddenly lots of
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360]   ads.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.040]   They're messing around with putting ads in the stream.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.120]   All that stuff has happened recently.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.360]   And so investors were like, OK, let's see the money now.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.880]   After all this time, let's see the money.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.320]   And the money that they are seeing is not what they expected.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.080]   It was a significant disappointment to just about everybody.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.000]   And something of a surprise, I think.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.200]   And so that was just-- I think part of the larger trend-- and we're probably going to
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.080]   talk about Google's earnings report.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.240]   We're probably going to talk about Facebook and so on.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.720]   And you see this sort of hidden-- Google and Facebook are a lot more diversified.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.320]   They don't just have the one thing that they're trying to monetize.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.200]   And so it's-- but hidden in all this is the fact that advertising right now, there's a
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.920]   glut of ads.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.560]   Everybody's going mobile.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.480]   Eyeballs are super fickle.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.000]   And it's just really difficult.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.400]   They're going to have to go to increasing extremes, contextual advertising, retargeting
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.440]   and marketing, and so on, to get people to be able to monetize people.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.080]   What are they doing right now to make money?
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.680]   They have-- I'll see a sponsored post in my Twitter.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.600]   Well, for one thing, the first thing they're doing is shutting down third-party Twitter
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.640]   clients because you don't see ads in third-party Twitter clients necessarily.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.080]   So they want you to use their own Twitter client on mobile or the website.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.160]   And that's where you'll see what sponsored posts, much like Facebook.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.240]   The second post in the news feed is always an ad.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.520]   So I'm starting to see that in Twitter, although not always.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.760]   And then you can buy-- in fact, I don't see one in my Twitter feed right now.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.600]   And then you can buy followers by saying, here's a suggested follower.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.080]   And you can buy trends.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.640]   So you can say-- but it will always say, won't it?
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.360]   Sponsored or paid for or that kind of thing.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.360]   Here's, for instance, here's in a huda follow, Richard L. Trumka promoted.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.680]   Now, it's still somebody that I follow follows him.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:19.760]   So in that sense, you may not see that in your feed, but that's a promoted huda follow.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.760]   What's the issue?
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.600]   Are these not making as much money as they wanted them to make?
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.480]   Well, one of the things that they did was they transitioned to-- they have these downloadable
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.360]   ads and they transitioned to a system.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.920]   Instead of eyeballs, they're actually more honest about it.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.120]   They're actually charging the advertisers when action is taken through the--
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.120]   Ah, cost per action.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.000]   Right, so they have cost per clip.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Exactly.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.920]   So that's-- they've gotten a hit there.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.080]   They're also having a retention problem.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.880]   And this retention is on the high end, so lots of people are leaving.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.880]   And so they say-- what they said in the call yesterday was that they're doing all these
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.880]   different things with algorithmic filtering and these different streams.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.880]   I'll allow Facebook.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.880]   Can you go away and come back?
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.880]   Yes.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.800]   And they're saying that this is designed to retain these high end users.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.280]   I think that's the kind of thing that's driving away the high end users.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.560]   And by the way, you could turn that off.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.960]   So I got that stuff you missed.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.960]   And do you want to see this?
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.480]   And I immediately said no.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.800]   Because I want to use Twitter in the old fashioned way.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.440]   But presumably, people who are new to Twitter will say, oh, well, I guess that's how you
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.680]   do it.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.880]   But this is something that-- and again, they have better information than I do.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.120]   I don't know how much of this has been.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.680]   But my feeling has always been that they're trying so hard to be Facebook, that they're
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.400]   alienating their most loyal users.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.280]   And what they're doing with that, those initiatives is going after the less loyal people.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.440]   And so they've got increasingly novice, not really that committed to the platform kind
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.440]   of audience, I think.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.440]   Right.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.440]   Well, that's true.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.360]   I mean, if you look at their numbers, their users actually went up.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.600]   Their mobile users, which was stagnant over the past couple quarters, actually dramatically
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.080]   went up in this quarter.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.360]   So they're getting more eyeballs.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.520]   But like you say, if they're loyal users, the people that are actually creating content
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.840]   are leaving, then that's a big problem.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.840]   Well, we've also talked about the fact that the market expects a certain amount of people
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.080]   to have a certain amount of growth every quarter.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.120]   And Twitter is strongly motivated to maintain that growth.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.560]   And that's one of the things that's kept Twitter from booting spammers, trolls, other
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.360]   undesirables for Twitter, is that they can't afford not to have that growth.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.240]   But the spammers and trolls are yet another thing that's driving away the committed users.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.680]   How many reports have you seen of major celebrities, usually women, who basically say, I quit
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.120]   Twitter, I can't handle the vitriol anymore, I can't handle the trolls.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.880]   For every one of those famous people, there's probably a thousand people who aren't famous
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.560]   who are doing the same thing.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:43.440]   And so it's having the trolls and the harassment, I think, are probably having a suppressive
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.480]   sort of effect on conversation generally and engagement generally, because it's really
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.480]   bad.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.280]   And what's happened is that everybody else has gotten better troll control, and Twitter
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.880]   has been lagging in that area.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.400]   And so the trolls have all just come rushing into Twitter.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.320]   Twitter's the only game in town these days.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.080]   It is because everybody else has effectively gotten rid of it.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.960]   It's because of a real names policy, I think.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.720]   Yes, and YouTube wasn't doing it anymore.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.720]   Exactly.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.460]   But Google+, if a troll, again, we've had this conversation a million times, I can delete
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.460]   the trolls message.
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.720]   Whereas on Twitter, their solution was algorithmic filters.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.680]   Hide it from you.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.520]   Everybody else sees it, the trolls see it.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.280]   In your article, you wrote a great article on this.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.520]   What would you like in it too?
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.680]   It's like if you call the police because there's an armed intruder on your lawn, they come
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.680]   and close the curtains.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.680]   They just don't look.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.280]   Yeah, the problem is that you're upset about it.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.280]   Just don't look.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.280]   Exactly.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:43.520]   And that article brought in the rarely discussed aspect of trolling that is reputation management.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.720]   So if somebody's trashing your reputation in public, not knowing that it's happening
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.320]   doesn't help your reputation.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:55.600]   Reputation management is a much larger conversation because that is a big issue.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.240]   When I talk to kids, teenagers, I say, I hate to have to say this, but make a website, put
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.000]   stuff you are proud of up there because if you don't show up in the Google search and
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.920]   then somebody posts a video of you beating somebody or barfing in a corner or drunk, that's
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.920]   the video everybody's going to see because that's will be the only search result for
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.920]   you.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.920]   That's a very tough thing.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.720]   It's huge, especially for college kids.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.360]   People, they're looking to get into a job market in a few years.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.280]   That's the first thing you do when you go to interview someone is you do a Google search
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.280]   on them.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.160]   The only reason I have a job is because they didn't have all these recording devices.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.160]   I think right.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.160]   Right.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.400]   Can you imagine if there are a picture of me floating around with a giant bomb?
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   Actually, there is.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   But that's...
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   I was the one who posted that.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400]   And then last weekend.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.400]   Last weekend.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   No, not last.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.280]   It was from college, aren't it?
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.680]   But that actually in a way that's changed more as has it because it's hard to find.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.440]   We went from President Clinton saying, "But I didn't inhale."
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.440]   To Obama saying, "Woo hoo!"
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.800]   Because everybody, by this time, everybody had some sort of checkered past.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.240]   So to wrap up the Twitter conversation, do you think the market is right?
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.840]   Is Twitter headed for tough times?
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.600]   Or is this just a temporary blip?
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.440]   I think the market is wrong.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.360]   I think Twitter has a bright future financially.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   Something going on there.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.920]   What they did was they just also announced yesterday.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.080]   This is, I think, an underappreciated story.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.280]   They acquired a retail retargeting company called Telepart.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:33.520]   And what they do is they're about to initiate this super buy button concept where basically
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.680]   you'll see an ad.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.680]   The ad will say, "Buy now."
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.680]   I love that.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.680]   You'll flick the button.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.600]   They're going to turn Twitter into Amazon.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   Right?
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.600]   That's brilliant.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:48.840]   That's the way, really, that is an instantiation of what Twitter could be in general, which
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.240]   is this signaling box.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.240]   Right.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.240]   It's not just for buying things.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.040]   It's for anything, for a news story or a show you're interested in.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.400]   And if you follow the right signals, you get all this.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.600]   And that's what makes Twitter work.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.000]   Is that if you follow the right signals, you get a...
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   It's wonderful.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.400]   If you want to know, if you're watching Game of Thrones live and you want to have a conversation
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.920]   about it, where do you go?
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.880]   You don't go to Google+, you don't go to Facebook, you go to Twitter.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.320]   Because that's where real-time conversations happen.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.000]   I have to say, because of this, I've been loading the Twitter page, it's much more visual
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   than it used to be.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.880]   And one of the reasons I now use...
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.720]   First of all, there's the green line for conversations.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.240]   One of the reasons I now use the website as much as anything else, look at how visual
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.840]   it is, how much more than just 140 characters it is.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.800]   In fact, you get a lot of people, I'll scroll down a little bit, posting paragraphs of texts
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   in picture form.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.800]   So that they can get around the 100-40 characters.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   That's why I've never liked Twitter.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.200]   I'm not a big Twitter fan.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.080]   And I've always thought, "Okay, it's going to go belly up eventually," right?
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.600]   As newer platforms come up.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.840]   Somehow they've been able to hang onto it.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.880]   And the thing that they've done really well, and I think this actually goes to why the
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.120]   stock price fell so much, is everybody sees Twitter.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.400]   You watch CNN, you watch...
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.000]   I watch Survivor, right?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.320]   Everything that happens on Survivor, there's a hashtag for it.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.880]   And so they've done really well about getting out in front of people's faces with these hashtags.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.080]   And then you take a look at their numbers, you're like, "Holy cow, they missed their Wall Street
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.800]   estimate by whatever it was, $40 million."
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.600]   I thought they were doing well, so then you sell the stock.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.920]   By the way, I just found a link.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.840]   Apple found a defect in a key component of the Apple Watch Dow Jones has reported stories
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.240]   developing, so we don't know what it is.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.880]   But it has hit Apple a little bit a drop in the stock price.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.880]   Breaking news.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.080]   Breaking news from Twitter.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.080]   Yes.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.000]   How about that, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Here's breaking news.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.720]   I just got a text from Apple who they had...
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.720]   I ordered...
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.760]   I remember 10 minutes after midnight.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.760]   My bad.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.760]   Sorry, I'm sorry, Apple.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.400]   You were about four minutes late, two late.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.120]   So we was able to get the 38 millimeter, which is leases, because nobody apparently
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.760]   wants, has small risks.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.120]   And they said my 42 won't come for a few weeks, it's going to come tomorrow.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.000]   So I've started to hear this now for people.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.360]   I know this isn't the Apple Watch show, but the Apple Watch has this...
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.200]   It metastasizes into all of our programs.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   Yes, it does.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.560]   It's like a disease.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:08.280]   And the other funny thing that we reported on Tech News today this morning is that Apple
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.880]   has banned apps that keep time.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.400]   Yeah, well, you already have a watch.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.680]   You want another one?
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.680]   You know why?
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:21.560]   I think because it's a side way to get different watch faces in there.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   Right?
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.440]   And Apple doesn't want you to do that yet, partly because of battery life issues.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:33.400]   There was rumor that they had banned pebble compatibility on the iPhone, but that apparently
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.400]   Apple's denying now.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.120]   But they have a long history on that.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:43.680]   So, I haven't found any defects in the Apple Watch, but if I find any, I'll let CNBC know
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.680]   immediately.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.640]   Let's talk about Google's results because those are in...
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.480]   They missed estimates.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.480]   Now this is an example.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.440]   When you miss estimates, that doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing, but it means a stock market
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:01.480]   punishes you because the stock market is based on rumor.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.280]   Cap costs, caps costs as growth slows.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.640]   Say that five times.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.000]   Google caps costs as growth slows, according to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.120]   Refere you, though, up 12%.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.080]   And how's their mobile doing?
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.640]   Because that's the question, isn't it, with Twitter, with Facebook and with Google?
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.640]   Right.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.680]   Well, cost per click fell 7%.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.280]   That's a trend, right?
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.280]   Exactly.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.440]   And this is another thing that I'm talking about.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.440]   There's these little cracks in the online advertising world.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.960]   In this move to mobile, it's not as monetizable.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.880]   Just to define that.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.880]   That means...
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.480]   And the way Google works with its advertising, they do an auction.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.080]   So there's no set price for a Google ad.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.080]   It's like buying an airline ticket or something like that.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.240]   It's a flex price.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:48.000]   If you're bidding for a keyword like "lawyer," you're going to pay a lot more because there's
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.400]   others bidding for that.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.120]   And that was really smart of Google, who was a way for Google to make sure they maximized
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.280]   revenue.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.120]   But when you see the cost per click go down, that means that the bids are lower.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.960]   People are not willing to pay as much.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.120]   It means ultimately the ads are not as effective.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.120]   That's right.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:09.800]   The reason that's bad news for us is because in order for companies like Google to monetize
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.920]   mobile ads better, they're going to have to be a lot more intrusive.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.200]   And I'm talking auto-playing video ads.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.480]   I'm talking all this stuff that people hate.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.480]   We don't want that.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.880]   Well, it's coming because that's the only way they're going to be able to monetize and
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.400]   continue their growth.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.720]   And of course, Google did report the growth that you mentioned.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.560]   And the dollar figure on that was just under $14 billion of revenue.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:38.480]   So that's despite what the investors are doing, Google is an incredibly wealthy company making
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.480]   a ton of money.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.720]   One of the most interesting things from this report, in my opinion, was that now 55% of
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.120]   their revenue comes from outside the US.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.120]   It's like Apple, too.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.120]   Well, but see that the--
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.440]   Apple had a 30% growth mostly from China.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.640]   But this isn't from China.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.520]   So Google doesn't get revenue from China.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.400]   That's why this is such a huge figure.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.720]   I mean, before Apple was in China, which was fairly recent before they were in China Mobile,
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.280]   which is the big carrier in China, and before they really made their big push into China,
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.160]   it was way less than that.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.800]   In terms of their Chinese revenue.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:15.320]   So there's 55% without-- and the reason that's a big deal is because a big, big chunk of
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.320]   that is Europe.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:21.240]   And Google is struggling with Europe over privacy, antitrust, and all kinds of other things.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.520]   The euro is struggling.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:29.400]   So as the exchange rate for the dollar remains strong and the euro weakens, that means--
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   That's a problem for all companies.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   Everybody was as money.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.160]   Yeah, all US-based companies are getting less money out of Europe.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.680]   So profits were fine.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.600]   Revenue was fine.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.240]   They just didn't meet analysts estimate.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.400]   But there is some signs of weakness.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.560]   The falling price of Google ads is a long-term problem that Google has to deal with.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:56.120]   So another interesting data point here is their expenses, which I'm always concerned
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.120]   about.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.640]   They got balloons and self-driving cars and all this stuff.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.800]   And I'm like, how much is this costing?
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.080]   They're selling these inexpensive little online ads and they're doing-- and they're
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.400]   paying for all this stuff.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.080]   And that was a concern in past analyst reports.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.760]   This time they've stabilized it to a certain extent.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.720]   They did write total cost and expenses rose 13% to 12.8.8.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.120]   But $8.8.8 increase.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.360]   Yes, almost 30%.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:27.120]   That was a 46% increase last quarter, a 29% increase this quarter.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.880]   That tells me-- and that's a knob that Larry turns, right?
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:36.560]   That tells me that in response to the softness thing and things like ad sales, Google's saying,
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.680]   all right, turn up the knob, we need to find the next big thing.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.040]   Yeah, right.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.520]   And Google's pretty good at this.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.680]   I mean, if you compare them to a company like Microsoft, which has excellent research,
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.000]   Microsoft Research is a phenomenal organization.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.040]   It's never a hard time making a product.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.040]   Exactly.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.880]   Google, if you look at Google Glass, for example, everybody's-- we've talked about a
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.880]   million times.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.480]   You know, they had this research project, which they turned into a big beta program,
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.480]   essentially.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:09.000]   And then they steamrolled it right into a product division and now Luxautica is going
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.760]   to be coming out with Google Glass, you know, hopefully a more elegant version of Google.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.560]   Google Glass is not going to save Google Glass.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.560]   No, no, no.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.240]   But my point is, look at the time from--
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.240]   Here's an idea for a research project to product.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.800]   I mean, two years.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   What's the--
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:31.960]   If you think about the most successful Google X project I could think of is autonomous vehicles.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.560]   Will Google make any money out of that, though?
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.640]   It's clearly they pushed this forward.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.240]   But is it Google that's going to make the profits from this?
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.240]   I don't think so.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.520]   Well, and they're working with all these manufacturers, right?
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.520]   Do they have patents?
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.520]   Do they have--
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.520]   They must have some patents, absolutely.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.520]   But it's tough.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.160]   I mean, when I was at-- this reminds me of Son a little bit.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.480]   We're not that far down the road with Google yet.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.320]   But we had all kinds of smart people working at Son, right?
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.440]   And they're doing all these crazy R&D projects, which is great.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.000]   But they're not monetized.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   The project's never go anywhere.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.880]   At the end, we were acquiring companies that were just failing left and right.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.880]   And you know--
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.880]   Think about Xerox Park.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.880]   Xerox Park.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.760]   Think of-- I mean, Xerox-- in fact, there's a book, How Xerox invented the future and then
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.760]   make any money on it or something like that.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.760]   Right, exactly.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.760]   And I think about HHP.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.760]   Yep.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.440]   This is a story that's more often the case than otherwise.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.640]   And I think it's going to happen to-- the vast majority of tech companies are not going
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:28.680]   to be able to-- we've talked about this on triangulation with people and so forth.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.680]   There is a business cycle.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.840]   There's always been a business cycle.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.640]   But instead of 20 years or 50 years or 100 years, it's now 10.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.640]   Right.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.680]   And a company like Microsoft that was on top for two decades, there's no guarantee that
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.560]   third decade will keep you on top.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   Right.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.440]   And we've been watching the build coverage today.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.760]   I should mention that Mary, Joe, and Paul are at build.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.280]   That's why we didn't do it when it was weekly today.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:57.440]   We will do it Friday, 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern time 2100 UTC, day after tomorrow.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.440]   I saw beer in the pit.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.440]   Fantastic.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.040]   I saw some beer in there.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.040]   There is--
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.040]   And it's not the way they're there.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.040]   Beer is arriving.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.040]   Beer has been coming in trucks.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.600]   I don't know who they think is going to drink this.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.880]   We have a sellout crab, by the way.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.600]   So if you've received a ticket from tickets to Twitter TV, you're welcome.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.400]   But if you haven't, there is a waiting list.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.400]   But I think we're full.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.280]   Fortunately, we don't have a sellout staff.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.280]   They're not a bunch of sellouts.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.280]   Never.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.280]   Just the audience.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.280]   No, they're crack team.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.280]   They're crack team.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:34.720]   Before we move on from this concept of getting research projects into products, I think an
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:40.640]   under-appreciated situation at Google is Project Tango, which is just--
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.640]   Project Tango.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.520]   It strikes me as the perfect example.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.920]   Project Tango, you've heard of it.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:52.400]   It's a research project where you use a tablet or a smartphone to 3D map the indoor spaces
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.080]   very rapidly.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.640]   And what's brilliant about this is this something Google probably started working on seriously
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.600]   a year or two ago, maybe a year and a half ago, something like that.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.200]   The technology is such that they have the technology to do this.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:10.280]   And if they had smartphones that actually had this technology, they would cost $10,000
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   per phone.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.280]   They would be like Apple phones.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.800]   So it would be really, really expensive, which is perfect.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.000]   Exactly how you want to do it.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   They're building these things.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.600]   Because it's a high margin device.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.600]   But it more's law.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.600]   It'll be cheaper.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:25.160]   By the time this thing is a product, these will be $1,000 phones, maybe.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.520]   Google, I wonder.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:35.720]   Because I feel like Google was founded by two smart guys who were cognizant of the issues
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.320]   of keeping a tech company on top.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:46.680]   And from the very beginning, Microsoft's business was we want a computer on every desktop running
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.960]   Microsoft software.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.160]   That was how they started.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.520]   That was their model for many, many decades.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.000]   It's changed a little bit now.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   It had to.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.240]   Google, you could say their model, there was originally to organize the world's information.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.560]   They certainly said that a lot at the beginning.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.920]   Perhaps they got seduced by selling ads against it.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.640]   But they're really a big data company.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:17.120]   I think they understand that their business is about data, about collecting it, about
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.120]   using it intelligently, analyzing it.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.720]   So Tangos, a perfect example.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   What is that?
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.000]   That's a data collection device in a smart way.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   That's what that is.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Yes.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.200]   And basically, what it can do is it can basically very rapidly build into your phone for an
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.920]   application, a game, a virtual reality thing.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.720]   You can put this thing with a sort of Google cardboard type of virtual reality thing.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.360]   And you can integrate, do Microsoft HoloLens type integrations of the 3D physical space
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.360]   with the game.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.320]   So a ball bounces on the actual couch that's there and bounces off the walls because it
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.280]   knows where the couch and the walls are.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.360]   And so this is used as some very high-end graphics processing.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.880]   It's very high-tech stuff, but they've got a bunch of really smart people working on it.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.800]   They've got a bunch of partners working on it.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   And it's really exciting technology that is absolutely going to be on all of our smartphones
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.320]   in a few years.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.320]   And Google's all over it.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.320]   They've already--
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.200]   What about Project Ira?
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.760]   I know, Jason, you could probably talk about that a little bit more in all about Android.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.920]   But that's the thing they acquired from Motorola, essentially.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.720]   It was a modular smartphone.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.720]   Build your own smartphone.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.560]   People complain to me all the time that we don't talk about Project Rn.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.080]   Well, you know, it's going to be really--
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.080]   You know--
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.240]   I don't want a phone that's going to rally around in my hand.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.080]   You've got to send me to Puerto Rico next week.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.440]   And if you get it, that's right.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.640]   They're going to have it in Taco Trucks in Puerto Rico.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.640]   We're all going.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.280]   But I don't want to-- I've had-- we had that.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.280]   That was the visor.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.600]   Remember that with the visor had those modules that you would put in the back?
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.720]   I don't want a phone with pieces falling off of it correctly.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.720]   Well, there's actually--
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.120]   If you like the concept of modular phone, there's actually a product you can invest
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.360]   in on Kickstarter.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.280]   The news hit today.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.520]   It's a product called the NEX-PAC, so any XPAQ.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.960]   And it's a modular case for both iPhone and Galaxy.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:04.960]   Now, here's what's interesting.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.400]   The modules are interchangeable between the iPhone and the Android phone.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.520]   It does look like ARRA, doesn't it?
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.040]   It does.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.560]   But this is, again, a case that'll add a speaker.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.040]   It'll add a super high-powered flashlight.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.480]   It'll add like all this different stuff to you.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.800]   Battery would be nice.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.360]   They do have that as well.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.240]   The battery doesn't take up the whole back like other batteries--
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:23.240]   Right.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.360]   --room-crust stuff.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.360]   How much?
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.360]   Oh.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.360]   Well, pledge $39 or more.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.040]   You get the special edition USB.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.000]   You get one module, 75 for the STK.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.320]   Here you go, $89.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.040]   And four modules.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.040]   And four modules.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:39.600]   You get the back.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.320]   I might do that.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:40.800]   That's a bad.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.840]   You got an SD card reader for your iPhone.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.880]   Imagine that.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.360]   Temperature and humidity sensors.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.360]   I don't need that.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.800]   Oh, we don't need any of this stuff.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.080]   This is obviously going to be another one of my Kickstarter
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:53.960]   boondoggles.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.320]   Here's a good one.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.280]   There's a breathalyzer module.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.480]   So if you want to make sure that you can drive legally--
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.880]   Sure, I need that.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.480]   I'll get in the car and wonder all the time,
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.640]   what is my blood alcohol level?
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.880]   I'll maybe back this project.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.800]   I haven't wasted money on Kickstarter in a long time.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.960]   What do you get for $99?
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.920]   Beta bundle for iPhone 6.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.840]   I don't care about beta bundles.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.000]   Jason, there's a video on this.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.440]   Oh, they do support both the S6, which OK, I kind of like that.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.440]   January of next year.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.000]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.880]   But for a little more money, I can get the magenta version.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.640]   Ooh.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.600]   Or do I want green?
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.800]   Well, think of all the money you'll
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.880]   save not going to Puerto Rico.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.360]   Oh, I see.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.800]   It's the trim.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.640]   It is a little bit like aara, isn't it?
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:49.080]   There's no way this is going to ever emerge from the Kickstarter.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.160]   Yeah, you'll be waiting for years, unfortunately.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.760]   That's the downside of Kickstarter.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.280]   Yeah, a lot of times people go to Kickstarter as I just did
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.520]   and say, oh, it's like a store.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.880]   I think I'll buy the green one.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:04.360]   And what in fact happens is nothing.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.000]   Because these guys have never--
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.720]   I don't know.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.440]   You should check.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.840]   Have they ever made anything?
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.840]   Have they dealt with China before?
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.480]   Do they know what making physical objects and tails?
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.360]   That's a challenge.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.640]   That's a whole different kettle of fish.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.160]   But I like the idea.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.680]   So back to Google, though.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.320]   And Google R&D. Some of it seems crazy.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.440]   But in almost every case, I think what's worked for Google
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:33.480]   is this undercurrent of, we just want more data.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.200]   And we'll figure out a way to monetize.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.280]   It's nice to have a business model where you could say,
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.240]   well, this is our underlying vision.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.280]   And we don't have to judge whether we're
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.440]   going to make money on a R&D project, just whether it will
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.960]   support the underlying vision.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.120]   And then we trust that the vision is well enough designed
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.720]   that we will make money out of it.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.440]   Does that feel like what they're doing?
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.840]   I don't like to use the word vision for Google.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.920]   I don't think they're a visionary company.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.120]   They have a philosophy.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.480]   They have a general philosophy about data, which is that--
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.120]   there are two essential ways that they look at the world
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   that's different.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:10.480]   The first one-- and this goes back to Larry and Sergey--
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.880]   they think big, big, big, big, big.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:19.600]   Somebody will say, hey, maybe we should build a little satellite
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.760]   and put it in space.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.920]   And they'll say, no, let's build a space elevator.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.360]   They think just gigantic.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.560]   And you see this in all the books, especially in the plaques,
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.040]   all the books about Google.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.360]   They just take everything that normal people think about,
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.480]   and they multiply it by 100 and say, let's do that.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.240]   And that's why there are indeed budget is billions of billions.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.760]   Leo, I think you have a really good point.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.440]   If you look at what they've done well,
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.160]   all the way back to the beginning to the search engine,
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:50.840]   tons of data.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.640]   They've done really well at that.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.680]   You look at-- my brain just went.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.040]   You look at what they did--
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.560]   like things like YouTube.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.240]   Well, Android's like the third iteration.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.440]   If you look at what you're doing now with things
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.600]   like the Google Now integration, which they just announced,
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.640]   are doing more integration from apps to Google Now.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.400]   And Google as an ISP facilitates that,
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.160]   both terrestrial and mobile, because they've got Google Fine Now.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.640]   They have Google Gigabit in some cities.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.120]   Oh, ads.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:20.480]   That was it.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.560]   Ads is the second wave, right?
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.240]   So you've got the browser.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.920]   Search engines first, then ads.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.200]   Now Android.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.080]   And if you look at it, I think it's somewhere in the rundown.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.480]   Chrome is the same thing.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.120]   They want to--
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.400]   Chrome and to end.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.240]   They own-- they can gather data from all of that.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.760]   But it's data gathering points.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.800]   But it's data on you.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.000]   And do you think you just push back now from society?
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.040]   In fact, somebody in the chat room
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.920]   is saying that it's coming to an end,
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.360]   says RF 2020, privacy by design is becoming necessary.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:52.520]   And isn't that antithetical to what Google wants?
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.520]   I don't know.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.280]   I don't see--
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.000]   I have been very publicly embracing this notion of,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.400]   I'll give you everything you want, Google,
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.160]   because I feel like I'm getting my money's worth at a Google.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.520]   In other words, I don't care what Google knows about me.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.000]   It's not like I'm going to see more ads.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.600]   I already see ads on every surface.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.440]   It's a Philip K. Dick universe already.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.720]   So if they're more targeted, that's better.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.920]   As far as I'm concerned, at least I won't see ads for--
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.720]   But are they better targeted?
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.440]   I don't-- they're not.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.400]   That's why I want--
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.680]   I want to give them more information.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.720]   I want to help you, Google.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.760]   I want your ads to be better targeted.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.400]   Well, that's why this Google Now thing, I think,
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.920]   is so important in Google, what they're doing.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.360]   So Google, they want Google Now to become your interface.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.680]   This is the interface to my world.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.200]   This is the place where I spend my first minute of the day
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.600]   or my-- that minute where I just want to know what's going on,
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.360]   they want to take your eyeballs and dump them into Google Now.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.480]   And the way that they're doing that
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.480]   is making it more relevant by pulling this information
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.440]   from the app.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.680]   Google Now now tells me when a bill is going to be due.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.320]   Like tomorrow your PG&E bill is due.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:48.880]   That's useful.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.720]   So we're so excited about Google Now,
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.280]   is it's the one rare example where contextual information
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.680]   actually works.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.960]   You know, you look at-- I saw ads on--
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.400]   I think it was YouTube today.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.640]   It was in another language.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.160]   I mean, I didn't even recognize the language.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.560]   How do they not know that I don't speak
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.680]   whatever that language is?
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.400]   Wow, look at this.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.920]   Spotify.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.880]   Yeah, all kinds of stuff.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.360]   70-- 70 relationships.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:11.920]   What is that?
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.160]   So this is new integration.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:13.840]   This is new.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.240]   They added--
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.840]   --wonderless-- 70 new partnerships.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.040]   How do I turn that on?
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.440]   Well, I think it'll be a lot of time.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.840]   I want to turn it on now.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.400]   So if I install the app--
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.520]   So if I have-- I use Wunderlist as my to-do list,
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.680]   or I have Pandora or Kayak or Waze.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.200]   By virtue of having that app installed,
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.000]   somehow Google Now will now say that's a signal, ah--
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.520]   Right.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.400]   --and developers of those apps have tapped into Google Now
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.080]   and will feed that information in certain ways.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:45.240]   There's also this bottom half of this entire gigantic list.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.360]   It is now cards from Gmail markup.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.880]   These are all the companies--
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.760]   all the partners that when you get an email from them
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.760]   with any sort of information feeds into Google Now
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.520]   in helpful ways.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.840]   So now this can be troubling, though,
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.200]   because if Google Now has 1,000 cards every time I go there,
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.640]   this is just my inbox.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.280]   I am not worried about that, because every time I go to Google
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.680]   Now, I'm like, give me more.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.680]   I like to give you an example.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:13.160]   So I got a card Android 5.0 Lollipop update for the Galaxy S
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.960]   5 Galaxy Note 4, and it's saying, is this card useful right
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:17.960]   now?
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.920]   So I can-- I'm always nervous about this,
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.440]   because I don't want to say no, because maybe I want--
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.360]   it's kind of semi-useful.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.560]   What should I do now?
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.760]   Yeah, that's the question.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.920]   But I got a card from--
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.720]   Oh, I'll say yes.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.440]   What the heck?
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.280]   Six months, I guess.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.720]   Here's restaurants nearby.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.680]   I'm not getting all of those cool integrations yet.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.800]   I got one from-- because Jason contacted me
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.400]   to come be a host, right, a co-host on the show.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.080]   And it said, is this something you're interested in following?
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.040]   And when I said, yes, it went ahead and set up
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.120]   the appointment on my calendar and did all this great.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.240]   So it's like one click integration to everything I want to do.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.200]   But you see people, their reaction is going to be,
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:53.920]   how did it know that?
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   It read my email.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:55.840]   What the hell?
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.680]   But don't you think that's the reaction people
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.160]   are going to have about that?
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.720]   As long as I don't have to read my email.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.080]   Some people will.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.640]   Other people will be glad to give up--
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.280]   I'm thrilled.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.560]   --for the convenience factor.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.160]   It's all about the convenience factor.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:09.960]   I'm thrilled.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.760]   Here's the very first card is, of course, this show.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.360]   And there's a button which I like.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.600]   That seems new.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.560]   Email everyone.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.960]   So I can now email everybody who's attached to that appointment
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.320]   if I am running late.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.720]   If there are any.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.840]   It's just you, Jason.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.360]   Go ahead.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.360]   I use any email.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.080]   I use any do, which--
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:28.920]   I love any do.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.320]   --googling now integration with any do.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.440]   So now, if I have a reminder, it'll pop up on Google now,
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.640]   which is nice.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.440]   So is that just going to now just happen?
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.360]   Because I have most of those apps or many of those apps.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.880]   The one thing that I don't know is
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.520]   whether there's an update to Google search that
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.440]   has to roll out for that to be enabled.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.040]   And I think that is the case which will happen in the next week
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.360]   or two.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:55.720]   This is-- it's really interesting.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.080]   In every case-- we've been covering Google very closely
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.160]   for now for 10 years.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.160]   In every case, I think, oh, they've
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.120]   got this great new stuff.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.360]   I can't wait face recognition, which you know they're good at.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.800]   But they haven't--
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.560]   they're slow to roll some of this stuff out.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.040]   I guess it's probably prudent.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.920]   They put this amazing technology on Google+,
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.760]   where they could recognize whether it's a dog or a cat,
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.600]   the picture with a baby or an adult,
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.200]   whether you're smiling or not smiling.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.040]   Where is it?
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.480]   I don't know.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.440]   It's useless at Google+ if it's still there.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.480]   Nobody uses it as far as I know.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.600]   But it's amazing.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.200]   So it's amazing.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.200]   So it's amazing.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.560]   You can turn apps on or off in the Google Now settings.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.480]   There's a downloaded apps section.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.760]   All right, well, let me take a look at that.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.920]   So now cards--
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.720]   I mean, there have been some apps already
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:44.840]   tapping into Google Now.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.880]   So this is not the beginning of it.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.680]   It's just a broadening of it.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.400]   I think that this is maybe you have a newer version
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.880]   than I have, because I don't see that in my settings.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.880]   I haven't seen an update to my search app,
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.440]   and I'm pretty positive that's what's
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.120]   going to be required in order to get some of these changes.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:02.600]   Do you see it?
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.000]   I see Customize Google Now.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.160]   Oh, should I go to the Customize?
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:05.720]   So if you go to--
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.120]   Yeah, go to the--
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.680]   OK, that's a different menu.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.400]   Click on the hamburger.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.000]   And then you should have Customize.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.720]   If you click on the--
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:12.360]   Yeah, click on that.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.000]   On the hamburger.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.640]   Customize.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.760]   All right, let's see what's in here.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.200]   Coming here, baby.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:19.960]   All right.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.480]   This is, by the way, the--
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:21.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:22.480]   Download apps.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.000]   There you go.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.080]   So here's Sports, Stocks, Places.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.440]   This is where you control this.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.480]   This is much like Cortana on a Windows phone, where--
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.000]   when you first set up Cortana, the speech recognition,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.200]   and Windows phone, you tell her your interests,
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.480]   what you want to know about the disadvantaged Microsoft
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.600]   has this, unless you're using Bing all the time,
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.720]   and you're really in the microwave soft ecosystem,
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.560]   they're not going to know as much about you.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.200]   It's interesting.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.360]   It's becoming a Microsoft versus Google more here.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:48.860]   Right.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:49.960]   Who are you more plugged into?
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.320]   So receive now cards from your downloaded apps?
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.720]   Yes.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.200]   Also, I can turn this on.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.480]   Continuing receiving now cards from Waze?
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.120]   Yes.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.880]   So I haven't yet-- it hasn't yet populated
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.920]   this individual apps, but I have turned that on.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.360]   All right, thank you.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.560]   So it is in there.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.200]   It is in there.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:10.680]   Very interesting.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.560]   They're starting to surface cards in Google now,
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.040]   where if you're driving and it knows you're driving,
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.000]   it will tell you--
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:17.360]   Stop pulling it down.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.640]   Oh, these are the gas stations that are on your route.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.960]   It should say, put your phone away, you neve it.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.280]   That's what it should say.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.240]   And Google would never do that.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.040]   And the parking, when I think, spent out for a little bit,
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:26.880]   but I'm getting par--
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.600]   I love that.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.400]   I love parking.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.320]   It says, you parked, and here's where you parked.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.480]   So I get to park in--
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.320]   So you get to park in--
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.240]   Parking locations.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.240]   My son does a lot of Team Fortress 2,
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.360]   so I get-- and he plays sometimes it connects to mine.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.840]   He's playing on your Steam account.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.680]   Team Fortress 2, exactly.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.200]   That's the problem.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.200]   I have the same problem.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:42.700]   Yeah.
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.620]   But you know, I like it because it makes me look like a better
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.220]   gamer than I am.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:45.820]   It does, doesn't it?
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.220]   Yeah.
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.500]   I got thousands of points or whatever achievements.
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.860]   Man, you're good at TF2.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.100]   Yes, I am pretty good.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:52.940]   Yes, I am.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:53.380]   I don't think so.
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:53.900]   Yes, I am.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.460]   I'm almost as good as a 12-year-old boy.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.180]   Yeah, look at this added quite a bit, actually.
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.940]   So that's cool.
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:01.780]   Yeah.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.380]   But again, that's the big data, right?
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.420]   I mean, that's the data analysis that they can do.
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.940]   They're plugging into anything and everything
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.260]   to get in front of you more often.
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.380]   Keep track of this event.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.260]   I get a lot of event in my email.
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.660]   So you can say whether your story is to read.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:15.900]   You know what?
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.420]   This is pretty amazing now.
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.060]   I tell you.
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.380]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.500]   The next thing is to put this--
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.780]   I don't know-- in some sort of head-mounted display.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.260]   That's the problem with Google Now.
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.460]   It's never right there.
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:26.620]   Unless you have a Chromebook.
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.500]   Now it's on the Chromebook when you open a Chromebook.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.740]   There it is.
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.060]   But yeah, you always have to remember to go find it.
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.740]   And that's just not how this should work.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.540]   If you use the Google launcher on Android,
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.220]   you swipe left from the home page,
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:39.180]   and there's your Google Now.
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.180]   I don't know if you have any cards.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.380]   Maybe that's one of the ways to do it.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.180]   Such a hassle.
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:44.340]   Yeah, I love the Chromebook.
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:44.860]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:48.060]   But that's one reason a Chromebook is a great choice.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.060]   If you're in the Googleverse--
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:50.540]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.900]   --which obviously we are sucked into the Googleverse.
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:53.380]   Yep.
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:54.500]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.460]   I want to see your errands arcade.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.340]   Aaron Nukem is a maker.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:00.780]   Yep.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.700]   And the last time we saw a project of yours,
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:07.260]   you had an old-time radio that was playing old-time radio
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.980]   shows, like Lawrence Well.
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.580]   Like Lawrence Well.
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.940]   And out of an old-time radio, but it was over the internet
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:13.780]   from a Raspberry Pi.
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.260]   So let's see what he's got here.
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.300]   Aaron's arcade.
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.700]   But first a word from BrainTree.
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.380]   If you're a mobile developer, you must know about BrainTree.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:25.580]   If you're a mobile developer, then--
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:28.980]   ooh, you need to know about BrainTree.
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.460]   BrainTree is a payments API.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.180]   If you go to braintreepayments.com,
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.700]   you can find out all about it.
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.340]   That makes it very easy for you.
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.060]   Well, let's say you've got a mobile app
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.620]   and you want to accept payments.
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:43.660]   Would you like to accept--
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.580]   I don't know-- Bitcoin?
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.100]   Sure, no problem.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.060]   Apple Pay, of course.
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:49.500]   PayPal?
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.380]   Yeah.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.700]   Credit cards of any kind?
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:52.700]   Yes.
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:53.620]   Venmo?
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:54.180]   You know about that?
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.420]   That's awesome.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.620]   Yeah.
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.380]   They accept it all.
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:03.620]   And it's with a couple of lines of code in your app.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:04.900]   That's what I love about this.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.500]   The payments API is used by so many great companies.
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.060]   They're used by Uber and Lyft.
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.820]   You know it must be good if Uber and Lyft use it,
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.940]   and Airbnb, and LivingSocial GitHub,
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:19.820]   started when they first started taking payments with BrainTree.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.100]   And BrainTree has grown with them.
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:24.820]   They can start from one transaction a day to millions a day.
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.180]   They can grow with you.
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.020]   And right now, if you want to try it,
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.060]   we're going to give you a great deal for a startup
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.620]   for somebody who's just getting going.
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:36.620]   Your first $50,000 in transactions are fee-free.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.860]   So that really gives you a chance to get going.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.020]   And by the time you're getting $50,000 in transactions,
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:43.860]   you're ready.
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.420]   You're doing it.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.700]   BrainTreePayments.com/twig
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.740]   to get that special offer.
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.700]   BrainTreePayments.com/twig.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.620]   When you create an account, you'll be able to use their sandbox
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.420]   to actually see what your app would look like with BrainTree.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:00.540]   It works with all the languages, node, and everything
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.820]   that you use.net.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.380]   Makes it very, very easy.
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.580]   BrainTreePayments.com--
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.420]   I think seven different programming languages.
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.780]   And look at all the companies that use BrainTree.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.340]   StubHub uses BrainTree.
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:16.780]   Unrelated to GitHub.
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.540]   Airbnb, hotels tonight, the travel industry.
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.420]   I love it.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:26.380]   BrainTreePayments.com/twig.
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.260]   I want you to check it out if you want to take payments.
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:33.620]   And by the way, fast payouts and great support.
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:35.980]   This is the place from your first dollar to your billions,
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.300]   brainTreePayments.com/twig.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.260]   First $50,000.
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.100]   Fee-free.
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.940]   Pretty good deal.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.820]   Google's offering to buy patents.
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:46.740]   I like this.
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.300]   At first, I thought, oh, great.
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.660]   They want to be in the patent role business.
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.580]   And I thought, no, no, no, that's not it at all.
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.420]   They're taking these patents off the market.
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.500]   From trolls.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.340]   From trolls.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.740]   Because what happens is if you have a patent
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:02.900]   and you want to monetize it, you're not going to sue Google.
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:03.340]   Right?
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.700]   So you're going to go find a patent troll who's
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.660]   going to pay a ton of money.
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.460]   And then they're going to sue Google.
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.380]   And Google says, you know what?
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:09.500]   Let's just skip all that.
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.340]   Just eliminate the middleman.
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.340]   If we might use it sometime in the future, we'll buy it.
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.740]   So they're having tryouts.
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.460]   There's two weeks during the month of May when you can go and submit
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.140]   your patent and say, here's our patent.
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:20.820]   They'll check it out.
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.620]   And by sometime in June, I think it is.
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.660]   Love this.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.620]   June 26, they will tell you yes or no about whether or not
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.060]   they'll buy your patent.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:29.460]   I love this.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.460]   And they said, think of it like a 20% project for Google's
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.380]   patent lawyers.
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.260]   So give them a little something to do with their free credit.
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.340]   That's right.
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:41.500]   Have you received a project Fi invite?
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:42.540]   Has anybody yet?
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:44.180]   Do we know anybody who hasn't gotten invited?
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.020]   No, we all applied.
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.980]   I haven't heard of any invites.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.540]   I actually have an X of 6, but I couldn't--
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.340]   So it's Jason Boyer.
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.780]   Because it goes through my work.
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:52.300]   I was bluffing.
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:52.780]   Wow.
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:53.260]   What a change.
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.620]   You have your Google for work account.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.100]   No, it's for-- yeah, well, for NetApp,
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.220]   they pay for my bill and all that kind of stuff.
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.140]   So you can't apply for it?
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:00.620]   I can't apply for it.
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.860]   You can apply for it and then get your own Nexus 6.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.460]   I don't have to expense my bill.
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.900]   Well, you can make payments on it.
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.260]   So one of the options is checkbox.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:09.660]   Over two years?
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.860]   I'll send you the phone.
[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:11.620]   And then you pay for it.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.620]   It's like $20 or something.
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:13.620]   $20 bucks a month, $20 years.
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:14.620]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:14.620]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:15.780]   You can do a subsidy.
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.580]   I have an Nexus 6 just waiting.
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:19.940]   I hope they--
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:20.820]   I love the idea.
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:22.780]   It's not much cheaper when you add it all up.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:24.260]   It's pretty much the same as I'm already paying.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.580]   But you get the carryover.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.580]   Right.
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.580]   Which is the best part.
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.580]   Right.
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:29.580]   So yeah, if you look at the month to month,
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:30.580]   it's not much cheaper.
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:31.580]   In some cases, it's more expensive.
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:35.660]   But because you get that carryover, you know, you can kind of budget for that worst case
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.820]   month of the five gig month.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:37.820]   Right.
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:38.820]   And then every other month, you're only doing three gigs.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.100]   So you get that, your bill gets lowered every other month.
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.100]   So I think it's great.
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:45.340]   If you travel a lot, it's a great idea because, again, there's no contract.
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:50.100]   So you can just cancel it and then go back to it and go back and forth depending on what's
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.100]   favorable.
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.100]   Yeah.
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.100]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.500]   But, you know, I think what's going to hurt them out of the gate is the Nexus 6.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.500]   You have to have a Nexus 6.
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:01.020]   Or maybe another phone from Huawei or somebody else will see what happens.
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:05.100]   But, you know, right out of the gate, I mean, as everyone, they, part of their earnings
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:09.260]   announcement, we just talked about was the, you know, the slip in Nexus, their Nexus brand.
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.260]   Yeah.
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.780]   So the Nexus 6 apparently isn't doing too well.
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:12.780]   Sales are dropping.
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:13.780]   Sales are dropping.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.220]   And, but, and yet they're trying to roll out Google Fi and say you have to have a Nexus
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.220]   6.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.220]   Nobody wants a Nexus 6.
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:20.220]   That's really the problem.
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:23.300]   But it's one of the things about the price.
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.300]   It's all about the price.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.300]   Why do you like the Nexus 6?
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.100]   Well, yeah, but in the Nexus 6 is not a cheap Nexus phone.
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.100]   Exactly.
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.780]   The Nexus 5 was a 4 with, or the 5, I guess it was super cheap.
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.220]   If you want a Nexus, buy a 1 plus 1.
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.220]   And the 7 was 1.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.220]   Yeah.
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:41.060]   It would now with lollipop on it, the lollipop, the oxygen OS is basically pure lollipop.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.060]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.060]   And it's 350 bucks.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.060]   It's a Nexus priced phone.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:48.540]   I think they'll extend it to Android generally at some point.
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:49.540]   Yeah.
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.540]   Or release new phones.
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:51.540]   I think is it a hardware?
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:52.540]   I think it's a hardware issue.
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:53.540]   I think you have to have a phone that could support it.
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.260]   It's a phone that's fast enough to do.
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:58.300]   You can do the handoff between Wi-Fi and the two different cellular networks.
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.300]   I mean, I, and that's what gets me.
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.580]   Even on my Nexus 6, I have a hard time.
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:05.380]   I leave the house and sometimes I think I'm still connected to Wi-Fi and I have to go
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.820]   and manually turn Wi-Fi off.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.820]   Every day I do that.
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.820]   You do.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.380]   So I mean, is this going to be a problem then on Google Fi?
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.980]   I mean, if it's not supposed to be.
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.820]   If it doesn't work, you know, right now, how is it going to automatically?
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:21.460]   Well, so this, this edge, the S6 Edge is a T-Mobile phone.
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.460]   So it does Wi-Fi.
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:23.460]   You can do the Wi-Fi calls.
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.860]   It's completely transparent.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:29.220]   Just goes, I walk out the door, call continues, picks up on the cell network.
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:30.820]   T-Mobile happens to be very good in Petaloma.
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:33.580]   So I don't, I don't care if sprint is there or not.
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:38.420]   It tells me when I'm on Wi-Fi immediately calls will be made over Wi-Fi.
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.100]   And I could of course turn that off if I want, but why?
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:45.580]   So the settings in this are Wi-Fi preferred, cellular network preferred, never use cellular
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:48.100]   network or just turn it off entirely.
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.100]   Right.
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.500]   And it works well.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.740]   So Google did put an app in the app store.
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:57.020]   I don't know if you applied for an invite and install the app, do you think you have a
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.020]   better shot at it?
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.580]   The app does nothing.
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:00.740]   I wondered about that.
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.740]   Like, does that signal that you're even more serious?
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:04.740]   Right.
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:05.740]   I'm installing it on your Nexus 6.
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:09.140]   I'm installing it on my no carrier Motorola Nexus 6.
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:13.540]   That should tell them why they're sitting there waiting for you Google.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:14.540]   Waiting for you.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.540]   I'm wearing your Google Glass T-shirt.
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.540]   Actually, there's no point in staying on the edge because it will only work with the
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.540]   Nexus 6.
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:21.540]   Okay.
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:22.540]   It actually lets you though?
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:23.540]   Let me see.
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:24.540]   Let me see.
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:29.420]   Yeah, does it say, does it not grayed out?
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:30.420]   T-Mobile Samsung.
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.420]   It's interesting.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.420]   Yeah.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:33.420]   So I'll install it on this too.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.420]   I don't know what will happen.
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.420]   Congratulations.
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.020]   Here's an app that will never do anything.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.580]   There's an obvious flaw, right?
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:42.300]   You can use this to activate your project file service to manage your account settings.
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:46.940]   Check your data usage, see your monthly statements or get in touch with support.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.940]   Apps nowadays are just all about MindShare.
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:49.940]   It's like a little ad.
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:50.940]   Look at Apple.
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:55.580]   All the iPhones you have Apple watch icons and they even have the feature.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.940]   If you walk into Starbucks, they use ID.
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:45:59.940]   This happened to me.
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:03.540]   I was next door to Starbucks and a little Starbucks icon popped up.
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.540]   What the hell?
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:05.540]   I don't want that.
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.340]   So I signed up anyway.
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.460]   It does it in the handoff.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:16.300]   So when your iPhone is turned off, this is a new thing they added.
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:21.220]   I have an icon for a camera there, but little Starbucks icon popped up because I was near
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:25.820]   a Starbucks and I just had to see, well, what do they want?
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:30.100]   And then they said, well, on your birthday, we'll give you a free coffee.
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:31.100]   So I signed up.
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.100]   It's not an ad.
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.100]   It's a feature.
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.700]   Well, it's a feature.
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.540]   In their defense, I had already installed the Starbucks app in my past books.
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:42.140]   But if you hadn't, it would have suggested it.
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.140]   Really?
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.140]   It would have appeared to...
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.140]   Yeah, it would say tap here to download the app.
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.140]   That's criminal.
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.140]   That's just...
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.820]   But talk about Philip K. Dick advertising everywhere.
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:51.380]   Yeah, nothing like that.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:54.940]   Well, and then the technology they're using is Apple Ibekin.
[00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:55.940]   Yeah.
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:56.940]   So yeah, because I wasn't actually...
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.700]   I was next door to the Starbucks.
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:01.700]   So it wasn't in the Starbucks, but it was close enough, I guess, that Ibekin thought
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:02.700]   I was enough.
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:03.700]   Wow.
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:05.700]   But you know Google will do that, right?
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:06.700]   Well, they...
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:09.660]   I mean, right now, Google Wallet will pull up your loyalty cards if you're nearby and
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.140]   it does that based on location, though.
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:12.140]   Right.
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.140]   You know, it says, oh, I see you're near CVS.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.140]   Does it pull up without...
[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:16.460]   Pull up without going into the wallet?
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.460]   Yeah.
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:18.460]   Oh, so just...
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:19.460]   I get a notification.
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:20.460]   Yeah, I get a note...
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:21.460]   Well, but it's not signing up for anything.
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:24.140]   It's just saying you've already registered this loyalty card with you in the app.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:25.460]   So would you like to use it?
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:29.980]   It's like a shortcut, which is kind of nice because, you know, I don't know why, but...
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.140]   It's not that big, long CVS receipt.
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.980]   You know, you got to make it as long as possible.
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:36.580]   So you have to use your loyalty card a lot.
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:38.780]   All right.
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:39.780]   What else here?
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.380]   Oh, sad story.
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:48.620]   Of course, we all have heard about the tragedy in Nepal, more than 2,500 deaths so far.
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:51.300]   Actually, more than 5,000, I think the last count I saw.
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.300]   Yeah.
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:56.100]   And one of them, a Google executive, he's the...
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:57.540]   Was in charge of privacy, a project.
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.060]   We were talking about Google's R&D arm.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:05.820]   Dan Fredenberg, friend to many people, I know, I don't know Dan myself, but a lot of people
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:11.020]   posting this, his sister posted on his Instagram account saying that he had died.
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.740]   He was at base camp.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.900]   I guess preparing to climb Everest.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:15.900]   He was at...
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.620]   A big Everest season begins in a couple of weeks.
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:22.340]   So people are already at base camp getting acclimated to the oxygen.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.340]   He was there.
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.340]   There was a massive...
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:30.100]   I don't know if you've seen the YouTube video, but a dramatic video, a massive avalanche
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.100]   onto base camp.
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.100]   Oh man.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:33.100]   It's good.
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.300]   17 climbers killed, including Mr. Fredenberg.
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.700]   So a sad story.
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:43.540]   Google has done their people finder again, which is great for Nepal.
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:45.940]   That is a huge benefit.
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:51.820]   My son, a kid that we know, he grew up with, was in Nepal.
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:56.980]   And Saturday, his Spencer's mom called and said, "Spenser's out of...
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:57.980]   We don't know where he is.
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:58.980]   He's out of touch.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:48:59.980]   Here's this video.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:03.820]   Please, this is very dramatic if you avert your eyes.
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.060]   There's no blood and guts, but it's terrifying.
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.980]   No blood, but it's terrifying.
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.780]   One of his shows is that there was literally nowhere to run.
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:11.780]   And basically...
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.100]   It's my worst nightmare.
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:16.820]   If a rock gotcha, you were done for, and if it didn't, you were lucky.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.460]   And that was it.
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:19.660]   Huge avalanche of snow.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.580]   That's his wall of snow.
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:24.420]   And that'll give you nightmares.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:25.420]   And there you go.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:31.500]   Anyway, Spencer did call by SatPhone yesterday and reported in, and he's okay.
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:35.220]   And we had talked to Chris Markward on Saturday on the radio show.
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:43.300]   He was very worried about an Nepalese friend of his who ran a very popular cafe in Kathmandu
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:46.820]   had been not heard from, but he was heard from.
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:51.020]   And one of the things a lot of people are using is Facebook.com/safetycheck.
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:52.180]   Have you seen this?
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.180]   This is...
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:57.660]   Facebook started to do it this last year after another natural disaster.
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.740]   It knows where you are.
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:05.060]   So if you're in the affected area, it will pop up a thing saying post a status update
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.860]   to let your friends know you're okay.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:13.820]   And if you're not, you can see how your friends are.
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:17.140]   And it says here, none of my friends appear to be in the affected area.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.460]   I asked Chris Markward about this.
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:21.380]   I said, "Ketmandu and Nepal in general, very poor country."
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:25.060]   He said, "Yes, but they're all on Facebook on their phones."
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:31.780]   So this is actually a huge value in case of an emergency.
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:35.660]   And of course, we encourage people to donate, to contribute.
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.460]   There are lots of good charities.
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:41.460]   Apple has put a Red Cross donation button, as they've done in the past on their iTunes
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:42.460]   store.
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:43.940]   I see you have a site directly.
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.500]   Yeah, this is the one I donated to.
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.820]   It's a direct relief, just directrelief.org.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:53.300]   And they've pledged for the earthquake situation in Nepal.
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:57.300]   They're going to donate every single bit of money that's donated to relief from recovery
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.300]   efforts.
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:02.660]   There are a lot of other natural disasters and donation opportunities that exist.
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:06.860]   So I would highly recommend going to directrelief.org and donating there if you haven't done so
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:07.860]   already.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:08.860]   I will.
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:09.860]   That's great.
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.860]   Five-star charity from charity navigator.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:19.420]   And you do, I love giving to a charity where the vast majority, in this case, 100% go to.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.260]   And I believe that's why they're called directly.
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:25.860]   That's their mission is to use as much money that's donated as possible to go towards the
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:27.740]   relief effort of whatever the situation is.
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.940]   Some people want to go rushing to disaster areas to help.
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:31.940]   Never do that.
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:33.940]   Always stay home and send money.
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:34.940]   Let's much better.
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:37.500]   Let the G.O. is the trained professional.
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:42.460]   The Red Cross Unicef, the people who know what to do and how to do it, let them do it.
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:43.940]   You don't want to cross chaos.
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:44.940]   Good.
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:45.940]   That's a great tip.
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:52.740]   Directrelief.org and our sympathy to Dan's family and friends.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:53.740]   Absolutely.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:54.740]   A lot of people knew Dan.
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:52:01.060]   He was very much like, kind of a great tragedy, but one of many thousands of tragedies in
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:03.780]   Nepal right now.
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:09.020]   Have you started using notes and directions from search on desktop?
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:10.020]   This is weird.
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.020]   You could send it to your phone.
[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:12.180]   So you do a search.
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:13.180]   Tell me how this works.
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.180]   I do a search for directions.
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:20.260]   So if you go to Google, just open up a Google, I think this is what we're talking about.
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:24.580]   Just open up a Google.com type in Send Directions.
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:25.580]   Send directions.
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:26.900]   I actually tried this earlier.
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:27.900]   It's so cool.
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:28.900]   That's it.
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:29.900]   Just Send Directions.
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:30.900]   That's it.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:31.900]   Oh, I said Direct.
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:32.900]   Oh, I did.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:33.900]   It's Google knows, right?
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:34.900]   And so here's my phone's located now.
[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:37.300]   Now this is interesting because this is on my desktop, but it knows where my phone is.
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:42.140]   And by the way, because I have many phones, I can choose, but it's looking at the Galaxy
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:43.140]   S6.
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:45.300]   Where do I want to go?
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:50.860]   Let's see, I want to go to Reading California right now.
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:52.500]   It'll do the directions.
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:57.100]   And now I press Send Directions to my phone.
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:58.100]   You know, I do that all the time.
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:52:59.100]   It's funny.
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:04.020]   I use like push bullet and things like that to do that third party applications directions.
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:07.660]   It says, "It hasn't buzzed me yet."
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.580]   My buzz almost immediately when I did it earlier today.
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:11.300]   I was like very impressed.
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.380]   Unfortunately, Project Fi has stopped.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:17.020]   Oh, you should sign up for it.
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:18.020]   There it is.
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.020]   Got it.
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.020]   Look at that.
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.500]   It says, "Pull up for details about this place."
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:23.500]   And there it is.
[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:24.500]   There's directions to Reading.
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.260]   Wow, I like that.
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:27.260]   Very cool.
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.260]   Very quick and easy.
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:32.480]   You can also use the search bar to set reminders and alarms.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:34.180]   And send that to your phone.
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:36.220]   And of course, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:37.220]   You can search for your phone.
[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:38.220]   Where is my phone?
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.220]   Find my phone.
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:40.220]   Find my phone.
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.220]   Find my device.
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.220]   Find my phone.
[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:45.220]   This is the ecosystem play.
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:48.780]   In some ways, I hate it if it's a closed ecosystem.
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.180]   We talk about Apple's ecosystem.
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.060]   It's a lock-in.
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.220]   Is this a lock-in to Google?
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.020]   It's certainly insensitive.
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.380]   I would be more inclined to blame Apple.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.980]   I bet you that Google would love to have this support.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:00.980]   I have Apple.
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:01.980]   But they're the ones.
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:07.340]   And this is the biggest thing that sucks about the iPhone and Apple is that they're
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:08.620]   so anti-Google.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:14.740]   They're irrationally harming users because the best experience in my opinion is an Apple
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:16.700]   device with all the Google stuff you can.
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:17.700]   You're carrying iPhone.
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:18.700]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:20.980]   But I want Google now to be more integrated.
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:22.260]   I want all these other integrations.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:26.060]   I don't want to have Bing come up as the default when I search for things.
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:30.100]   I don't want Twitter and Facebook to be the default with no possibility of using Google
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.100]   Plus.
[00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:34.860]   And it's one of those things where they've got this like being there bonded about this
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:35.860]   other company.
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:38.100]   Yeah, by default, if I search on my watch Bing.
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:40.100]   Yeah, I want to search Google search.
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:41.620]   I want to use Google Maps.
[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:43.420]   I want the Googly stuff.
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:47.540]   Now, to be fair, Google does the same thing to Windows Phone.
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:52.020]   Well, but Windows Phone has no market share.
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:54.140]   I mean, they have a business reason for that.
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:55.140]   I guess.
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:55:01.260]   I mean, I'd be much more likely to use Windows Phone if it's supported all my Google services,
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:03.140]   but it doesn't.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:04.140]   So what do I use?
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.340]   I use Android.
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:08.340]   I'm really, by the way, schizophrenic because I want to use the Apple Watch.
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:10.580]   And so I have to carry two phones.
[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:11.580]   You have two pockets.
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.580]   You have two arms.
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:17.380]   You know, I feel like, you know, I've talked about this.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.260]   The Apple Watch is easily the most attractive.
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:23.580]   It's designed by the two of the best designers in the world, Mark Newsom and Johnny Ive.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.580]   I disagree.
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.580]   Well, a lot of people think it's not attractive.
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:29.740]   I think it's attractive, but that's, you know, it's that's a matter of taste.
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:30.740]   It's a chickling.
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:31.900]   It's very Johnny Ivey.
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:32.900]   It's Johnny Ivey.
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:34.540]   It looks like it's from the 70s.
[00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:35.540]   Okay.
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.420]   I'm sorry to derail your point, though.
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:42.540]   But my actual point is the guts, the functionality is not particularly ahead of Android Wear
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.540]   in any particular way.
[00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:47.700]   Oh, I until until about a half an hour ago, I would have disagreed with that.
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.340]   Oh, but that's because you just used Apple Pay at the pedal in my market.
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:53.380]   I think the Taptic extension is brilliant, but it turns out there's the Taptic engine
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:54.380]   that's broken on the thing.
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:55.380]   That's the broken part.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.380]   Yeah, that's the broken part.
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:57.980]   And that's what's delaying our watches.
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:02.980]   Well, yeah, apparently one of the two Chinese suppliers for the, by the way, the Taptic
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:03.980]   thing.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:04.980]   It's just a buzzer.
[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.180]   It's not that different.
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:07.860]   Do you have an Apple watch?
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.420]   No, trust me.
[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:11.220]   It's a buzzer.
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:16.140]   I thought it was going to do all these fancy like it would buzz my left wrist for a left
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:17.140]   turn.
[00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.140]   Right.
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:20.740]   No, it's just because it's just a z it.
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:22.660]   Anyway, it's not the Taptic engine.
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:24.020]   But anyway, the buzzer.
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:26.700]   It's marketing was probably apparently part of the party.
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:31.660]   It's very, very, very good marketing was apparently part of the problem in that, but not all of
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.660]   them are flawed.
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:38.380]   Apparently, they are, as I said, I'm getting mine in two or three weeks before they said
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.380]   it would come.
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:41.420]   So I think that whatever that problem was has been solved.
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:43.140]   That's what CNBC was reporting.
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:44.980]   This Apple pay is the biggest difference.
[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:50.220]   But I feel like Android where in the next iteration can in every respect duplicate what
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:52.980]   they've done with this, except maybe looks.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:55.420]   But that's just going to be, that's going to be a question of somebody coming along and
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.140]   designing a better looking watch.
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:57:01.180]   It also has to be said that there's no Android where watch with anywhere near the quality
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:02.180]   of display.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:03.180]   Yes.
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.500]   Well, you know, they're okay.
[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:08.620]   That's true because for some reason all the Android where watches use LCD, IPS LCDs, this
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:09.620]   is OLED.
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:10.620]   It's funny.
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:11.620]   It's Apple's first OLED.
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:12.620]   Right.
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:16.020]   So OLED's been in Android in many respects in so many ways for so long.
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:18.900]   And finally, and it's still not, still not OLED on the iPhone.
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:19.900]   Yeah.
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.740]   For the first OLED display and you're right, it's gorgeous.
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:26.900]   But Samsung has used OLED displays for its gear watches and they look great.
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:28.980]   And I think, I hear you're going to be OLED.
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:29.980]   Yeah.
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:32.140]   What you're going to see is now that Apple has.
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:36.820]   I said, okay, here's our, they didn't, they didn't go so far ahead that Android can't
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:37.820]   come up.
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:40.100]   Android where can't come up with some right, some very compatible.
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:42.580]   Do you do Wi-Fi?
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:43.580]   This does Wi-Fi.
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:44.580]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:48.460]   This does low tooth, low power Bluetooth, Bluetooth, L.A. until it can't or there's
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:51.700]   that, you know, there needs more data that'll, they'll go to Wi-Fi.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:53.540]   Much like Android where we'll do one thing.
[00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:58.180]   Android where it does do in the new iteration, which we haven't seen yet, but supposedly
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:05.180]   is just as this Apple Watch will talk to the iPhone anywhere on the local Wi-Fi network
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:07.860]   to any Apple phone or to my Apple phone.
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.540]   Android where we'll do it over the public internet.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:10.540]   Which is great.
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:13.860]   I could leave my Android phone at home and my Android where watch would still communicate
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:15.260]   with it.
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:23.420]   I feel like what's going on is much like with the phones, it's neck and neck.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:26.860]   And on any given day, any horse could win.
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:30.820]   And now, well, that's good for consumers because it gives consumers choice, it gives consumers
[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:32.900]   options that they might not have.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:37.660]   I think that there's some real similarities in the platforms.
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:41.740]   And I'm very interested to see what the next Android generation of Android were.
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:46.500]   Do you think that the price of the Apple Watch will affect the Android watches?
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:47.980]   Will they come, will they go up in price?
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:48.980]   No.
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:49.980]   Or go down and go down and go down and go.
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:50.980]   No, that's much like the phones.
[00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:51.980]   That'd be just like the phones.
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:53.660]   There may be some high-end Android where.
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:55.860]   But you know, remember the Apple Watch starts at 350 bucks.
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:56.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:59.460]   It's like 100 bucks more than the most expensive.
[00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:00.460]   It's not crazy.
[00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:01.460]   But I'm not surprising.
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:02.860]   I don't know the 250 when you break it.
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:03.860]   When you break the screen.
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:04.860]   Don't break the screen.
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.380]   Hey, if you break the screen, that's your problem.
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:08.540]   It's not Apple's problem.
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:09.540]   You broke your screen.
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:13.060]   I've already scheduled the breaking of my screen.
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:18.500]   One thing that's also we learned from the iFixit Tear Down is that the battery is actually
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:22.660]   weaker than your average Android where battery gets comparable battery life.
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:25.780]   So they're doing some really interesting kung-fu there with the battery.
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:27.860]   I think part of that's the OLED, by the way.
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.340]   Part of it's OLEDs are much more efficient screens.
[00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:31.340]   Yeah.
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:35.300]   But yeah, you know, Apple's, you know, I get much better battery life on my iPhones than
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.460]   I do on my Android phones.
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:44.740]   Galaxy Edge, iPhone, comparable batteries, comparable usage, 80% on the iPhone 6, 55%
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:46.700]   left on the S6.
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:48.980]   And here we are at 2 in the afternoon.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:51.900]   I still have some hours to go.
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:54.900]   You know, I just, I think Apple knows.
[00:59:54.900 --> 01:00:00.660]   You know, when you have a closed ecosystem, you can do better because you can limit things.
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:05.860]   For instance, there's only nine watch faces and they're all OLED friendly.
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:08.780]   You're not letting third party watch faces in the Apple watch because they could kill
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.020]   your battery life.
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:13.300]   Android Wear pebble, thousands of ugly choices.
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:14.300]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.300]   Thousands.
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:20.620]   But again, I think that's great.
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:21.620]   You get to choose.
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:22.780]   You want choice.
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:26.020]   You want, you want the Apple way, you get to choose.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.700]   If you hate all that money in your pocket.
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:32.180]   I'm surprised you given that you love Google are using an iPhone.
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.180]   You were using Android phone.
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:36.260]   I'm using an iPhone specifically so that I could use the Apple watch.
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.260]   I've been excited about the Apple watch for a long, long time.
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.940]   And I always felt that Apple would come out with a really great watch.
[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:43.940]   So can I send you a heartbeat when you get yours?
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:44.940]   Yes.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:45.940]   Would you?
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:46.940]   A little drawing.
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:47.940]   That would be wonderful.
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.900]   Renee Richie has been sending me Batman ads.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:54.340]   It's the most useless feature of all.
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:57.060]   But now that mine's coming tomorrow, I can send them to Lisa.
[01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:58.060]   We'll see.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.060]   I can send a little hearts and flowers.
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.060]   I can't wait till mine comes.
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:03.260]   They sent me an email yesterday that said the Apple watch is here.
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.820]   And I thought they were talking about my Apple watch.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:07.900]   No, don't get your hopes up.
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:08.900]   Was that me?
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:09.900]   That was from me.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:10.900]   Okay.
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.180]   I should have known I didn't get a tap.
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:15.420]   A wrist tap.
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.580]   We did have a change log.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:19.060]   We've kind of encroached a little bit in the change log.
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:23.100]   Let me take a look and see if we've got anything else.
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:24.260]   Password alert Chrome extension.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.100]   This comes from Google.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:29.740]   Combats phishing and risk from password reuse.
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:34.300]   When you enter your Google password in a non-Google site.
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:37.260]   Is that all it's going to do is check and see if it's the same password as my Google
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.260]   password?
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:39.260]   Because that's stupid.
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:42.940]   No, it's going to do a number of things.
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:45.780]   It's just general password management.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:46.780]   Is it?
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.780]   That's what I'd love to see is.
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:53.300]   Is it last pass equivalent from somebody in Eastern Europe uses your password to log in
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.380]   somewhere pops up right in the middle of your screen.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.380]   Oh, I like that.
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.180]   And says, hey, watch out.
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:08.220]   It also, if you go to a page that's been spoofed or faked, it's asking for a password,
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:12.300]   it will say, don't enter your password in this page.
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.300]   This is not the right page.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:14.300]   That's not the right way.
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:15.300]   That's great.
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.620]   There's an increasing problem there.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:23.060]   It's been commoditized tools for duplicating website pages.
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:27.460]   And so, of course, the main thing they're after is to harvest your user names and passwords.
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:29.060]   So is that available now in the?
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.060]   It is.
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:34.740]   Let me go to the extensions store and install it.
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.300]   Sounds like there's no reason not to.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.020]   Although you do want to be careful about--
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.660]   It's called password alert.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.660]   Too many extensions.
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:42.820]   Yeah, password alert.
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:43.820]   And yeah, exactly.
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:51.580]   I mean, the extensions in Chrome are just like the biggest, most bloated aspect of my
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:52.580]   mission.
[01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:54.580]   Yeah, I've had to be a little judicious.
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:57.180]   The other thing that happens is it installs on every machine.
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.180]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:59.180]   There it is.
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:03.060]   Google.com, password alert helps protect you against phishing.
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:04.420]   And it's open source.
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.820]   It's open source.
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:06.820]   And free.
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:07.820]   And free.
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:08.820]   All right.
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:11.660]   This would be something good for businesses as well.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:14.980]   Yeah, you'd think IT would love to install this everywhere.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:20.380]   So many businesses are using Chrome because they finally figured out that Internet Explorer
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.580]   is so insecure.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:27.740]   And then, at the same time, a lot of people at work are browsing public, you know, Facebook
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:28.860]   and all these public sites.
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:32.940]   It sounds like this would be a perfect thing for people to just auto push out to all their
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:33.940]   employees.
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:40.340]   Like make sure you're not going to the fake Facebook site and using your corporate password
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.780]   as your password for Facebook and all that stuff.
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:50.420]   So it doesn't seem to have any allowing incognito, allow access to file URLs.
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:55.020]   It doesn't seem to have any icon on the tool board.
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.340]   I guess it just sits there and it'll notify me.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:01.460]   You do have to sign in your Google account, which I just did when you install it.
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:08.540]   Okay, that's cool.
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.460]   Chrome Dev for Android app released.
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:14.540]   Oh, this is the Canary release.
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:15.540]   Is that what this is?
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.020]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.540]   Chrome Canary for Android, basically.
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:19.540]   Okay.
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.900]   And there was an update to Google Play Services.
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.700]   Do we know what that did?
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.540]   Oh, I know one thing it did.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:27.540]   You can now have more than one watch.
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:34.540]   I don't know exactly what the use case is, but it's called the Leel Report feature.
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:35.540]   Yeah, right.
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:39.300]   Not more than one, I guess.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.860]   Maybe this video will explain.
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:46.540]   Well, now Android Wear is supposedly not going to be just for watches, right?
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:47.700]   Ah, right.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.060]   It's the wearable operating system.
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:51.860]   So I can have Android Wear in my glass and my watch.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:55.100]   And your smart underwear and your like whatever.
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.940]   That's what this is.
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.300]   What is he talking about here?
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:59.940]   Who plays services 7.3?
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:00.940]   Get to work.
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.940]   That's right.
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.220]   This is worthy of a Microsoft video.
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.380]   I was just going to say.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:09.540]   Welcome to release 7.3 of Google Play Services.
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:10.540]   Magnus.
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.940]   And Fusion, we've packed in with lots of new features.
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:15.900]   He does all the Google Play Services update videos.
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:16.900]   He's kind of cute.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:17.900]   This is all about.
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:19.900]   Very geeky but fine.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:20.900]   And very geeky but fine.
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:23.740]   Wear is that you can now connect multiple wearables to a phone.
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:25.740]   Let's check that out.
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:30.300]   Can't decide which one I'm going to wear to be.
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:33.180]   Kind of like that black one.
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:34.780]   That one is battery from Google Play.
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:39.820]   It is the case that people in the real world have multiple watches.
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:40.820]   So that would be nuts.
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:44.140]   What dog since I have Google Play Services 7.3 installed?
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.820]   I can wear them all at the same time.
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:48.820]   So Chris Kackey.
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.620]   That was the network of wearable nodes.
[01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:52.620]   All connected to single phone.
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:53.620]   That's hilarious.
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.060]   Look how big that Nexus 6 looks.
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:57.060]   That's hilarious.
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:58.060]   That's hilarious.
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:01.820]   But you know, this is really the future of wearable computing.
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:04.300]   Wearable computing is not having a wearable device.
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.300]   I agree.
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.300]   I think you're right.
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.380]   It's a personal area network.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:10.980]   And you have different sensors in different places doing different things for different
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:11.980]   reasons.
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:14.980]   Well, and not only are they connecting to the phones, they're connecting to each other.
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:19.220]   I know, I just, my old man dirty old man.
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:21.220]   I'm sitting there for a little bit.
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:22.220]   Yes.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:23.980]   I know what you're thinking about.
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:24.980]   Sorry.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:25.980]   Mr. Maker Man.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:29.140]   If you watch your Bane is now in the Google Store.
[01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:30.820]   Who it is.
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.820]   Classic timepiece.
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:37.380]   Craft is so, if you've been looking for a better design watch, 350.
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:38.380]   See there you go.
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:41.180]   Apple Watch price.
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:42.740]   Ultra clear display from any angle.
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.500]   It is OLED.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.860]   So there you go.
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:48.020]   Answers that question.
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.100]   All right.
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.100]   All right.
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.100]   There you go.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.100]   I'm rooting for LG.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.100]   You know, they just came out with a really cool phone.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:54.100]   You like the G4?
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.100]   Have you taken it?
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.980]   Well, I like the color scanner.
[01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:01.500]   There's a scanner that basically it's a little sensor that's right next to the camera that
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:06.620]   basically does a quick check on the lighting conditions.
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:09.100]   And they also do object recognition.
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:11.980]   So if you've taken a picture of an apple, it'll check the lights.
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:16.540]   It'll recognize this apple and like, okay, here's what color the apple should be, given
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.540]   these, you know, this context.
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.540]   An auto white.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.900]   Yeah, it was really impressive.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.620]   Actually, Miriam Jour was on all that Android.
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.140]   She brought one last night.
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.140]   She brought one.
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:28.140]   Did you play with it?
[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:29.460]   Well, yeah, a little bit.
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:33.340]   She had only had it for a couple of hours, but it had taken some shots and I can kind
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:36.740]   of show you this was in a super dark room.
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:37.740]   Wow.
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:42.580]   She said this picture exactly matched how it looked when she took the picture to her
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:43.580]   eyes.
[01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:48.300]   Sometimes, you know, sometimes they over amplify it and it's brighter enhanced.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:49.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:50.300]   There you go.
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.340]   That's kind of like ratcheting it up.
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:52.940]   She needs to clean up her room.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:54.300]   You need to add voice commands.
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:59.020]   So you say enhance and have it right center, zoom and hands.
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.020]   Let's see here.
[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:01.020]   Let's see here.
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:04.620]   It has laser focusing and that's one thing maybe would be better and low light, you know,
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:05.620]   focusing is always tough.
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:06.620]   But look at that.
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.620]   I mean, do the details.
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.620]   I mean, do the details.
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:09.620]   Unbelievable on some of these.
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:10.620]   So this let's see here.
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:11.620]   Let's switch to this photo.
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:12.620]   Perfect.
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:13.620]   This is a macro.
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:14.900]   This is the normal shot, right?
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:15.900]   Fiddle firm.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:16.900]   Fiddle head ferns.
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:17.900]   That's gorgeous.
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:18.900]   That's gorgeous.
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.460]   Really, incredible.
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:25.900]   Everything that we saw on the photo features of this definitely at least put it at the same
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:27.820]   level as the S6.
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:29.020]   But they're duking it out.
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:33.500]   There's going to be a ton of matchups between these two side by side comparisons.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.500]   And at this point, this is a big contender.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.900]   I mean, the detail is just incredible.
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:38.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:39.900]   Beautiful.
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:40.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.580]   Really, really nice shots.
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:44.700]   Don't do this while you're driving.
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:45.700]   Thank you.
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:46.700]   But yeah.
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.820]   So there you go.
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:49.820]   Very cool.
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:50.820]   And G, you can do it.
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:56.260]   Well, I just ordered a LG Watcher bin just to help them along.
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:57.260]   Why not?
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:00.020]   I decided to get the gold so it would compete well with the Apple Watch.
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:03.180]   I can't afford a gold Apple Watch.
[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.180]   Looks pretty nice.
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.180]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:07.540]   It looks like a real watch, but that's not a real watch face, right?
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:09.380]   That's just the OLED screen.
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:10.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.380]   And it doesn't have a flat tire.
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:12.380]   It's round.
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:13.380]   It's completely round.
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:14.380]   It goes all the way around.
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:15.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.380]   Goes to 11.
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:17.380]   It's one better.
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:18.380]   And it's got the Wi-Fi.
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:19.380]   It's got the Wi-Fi.
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:20.380]   All right.
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:21.380]   Nice.
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.380]   Let's look at the specs.
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.580]   And that's a superior Apple's 6,6 grams.
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:26.060]   That's fairly heavy.
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.980]   It's heavier than an Apple Watch.
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:33.540]   Gold with brown leather, silver with black leather, stainless steel cover, Corning Gorilla
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:34.540]   Glass 3.
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:40.540]   Of course, that's the same glass used on the sport watches for the iPhone.
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:41.540]   Four gigs of storage.
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:44.460]   I was surprised the Apple Watch has six gigs.
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:46.340]   It has a significant storage.
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:51.980]   The Pio-led screen at 1.3 inches, it is similar to the Apple Watch, 320 by 320, 245 PPI.
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:55.420]   It does have a microphone, but oh, Android, we're watching.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:56.420]   Does it have a speaker?
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:58.300]   It does not have a speaker, apparently.
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:04.260]   And it does support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE on 1.2 gig, oh, a big battery, 410 milliamp
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:05.260]   hours.
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:07.300]   So it should run for a while.
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:09.700]   That's double the Apple Watch.
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:10.700]   Yeah.
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:11.700]   Yeah.
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:15.900]   Depending on when you get the watch or a bang, you'll probably be the first to have the new
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:20.340]   version of wear as well that has those enhanced Wi-Fi capabilities.
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.260]   It says available May 8th.
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.700]   So when you get that, you should be first through the door.
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:25.700]   Two weeks.
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:26.700]   With that.
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:27.700]   We'll do a review on before you buy.
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:28.700]   Yeah.
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.460]   Then I'll be ready to retire my Apple Watch.
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:31.460]   Really?
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:34.340]   I'm not, this is by the way, not who I am.
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:35.740]   This is what I do for a living.
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:38.340]   If you're going to retire, you're going to need the gold Apple Watch.
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:39.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.340]   This is my retirement watch.
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:41.340]   You can.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.340]   That's the...
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:45.860]   This is one of the most excited about right now.
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:46.860]   I mean, this is the one.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:49.380]   And then until Google announces what they're going to come out with, if they have a Nexus
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:50.380]   Watch.
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:51.380]   Is it going to do a watch?
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.380]   I think they may do a watch and we'll have to see what they do.
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:56.260]   But this is the one that at least looks the best.
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:59.020]   I don't know if I can afford it, but at least it looks the best.
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:00.580]   It looks like a normal watch to me.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.580]   Yeah, 350 bucks.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.340]   I'm glad to see the OLED.
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:06.820]   And I like Android Wear.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.420]   I feel like Android Wear is very close.
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:13.940]   I can't answer phone calls on this, but even though I can do that on the Apple Watch,
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.460]   I don't know if I'm going to do that a lot.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:17.700]   I've had a few phone calls.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:19.260]   You certainly wouldn't do a long phone call.
[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:23.380]   But what it is nice for is if somebody calls in the middle of a show or you're doing something
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:25.020]   you go, "Okay, can I call you back?"
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.020]   And it's perfect for that.
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:27.940]   Well, I think that the biggest...
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:32.100]   I always like to look at actual human behavior and how it changes through technology.
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:35.860]   And I think the biggest change with a smartwatch and especially the Apple Watch is that you
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:36.860]   stop carrying your iPhone.
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:40.660]   When you're at home or at work or in the car, it's not in your pocket.
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.140]   It's just around somewhere.
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:43.140]   And the Apple Watch...
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:44.460]   Talk to me when you have an Apple Watch.
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:47.860]   Well, I mean, but if somebody calls and it's in the other room, it's fine.
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:49.860]   You just say, "Hey, I'll call you back," or whatever.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.460]   You're not running around looking down.
[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:52.460]   I have not yet felt...
[01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:55.500]   I know I'm a story-y dreamer about this Apple Watch thing.
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.500]   I think you're a dreamer.
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:58.500]   But you're not the only one.
[01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.500]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.100]   I still feel tethered to this.
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.100]   I don't want to leave it behind.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.100]   I do.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.700]   I'll leave it in the bedroom and go into my office.
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.180]   But then I go back again.
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:14.540]   There's so much stuff you cannot do on it, something the size of a watch.
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:15.540]   We'll see.
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:16.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:17.540]   We'll see.
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:18.540]   I'm going to wear probably two watches for a while.
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:20.700]   Maybe three, I don't know.
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:23.500]   Could be like, what's his name?
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.500]   Sven Olaf?
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:29.620]   Sven, Sven, the Nexus 7 is gone, is dead.
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:32.260]   I thought that was a great tablet.
[01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:35.620]   I have mine, I had the 2012 and the 2013.
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:37.220]   Still use the 2013.
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:40.580]   A great price, a great tablet, I am sad to say.
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:45.660]   But I hope that that is a sign that they will do the Nexus 7 Plus.
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.660]   7.5 or something.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:51.700]   I just think that 7-inch tablet, they were the flavor of the month until all the phones
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.020]   got to be 5 and 6 inches.
[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:55.020]   And now it's like, who needs it?
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:56.020]   I am, maybe you're right.
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.700]   Yeah, I've been using even my shield tablet.
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:00.620]   I've been using it less and less since I got my Nexus 6.
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:01.620]   Yeah.
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:02.620]   Because it's just a bigger screen.
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:06.700]   The stuff that I was running solely on that tablet, I'm now running back on my phone again.
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:07.700]   Yeah.
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.700]   Yep.
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:14.740]   But I think it's safe to say that I think it's probably the most successful or one of
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:17.820]   the most successful Nexus devices I've ever put out.
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:21.660]   Well, I've been saying this and everybody who disagrees with me when I say this.
[01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:24.700]   But I'll say it again and see what happens.
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:27.980]   I think Google's lost its hardware mojo.
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:31.300]   There was a period of like a year or a year and a half where everything they came out
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.300]   with was kick.
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.140]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:38.700]   Like surely you're not talking about the Google TV or what was that ball?
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:40.020]   This is cute.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.660]   You know my son Kevin still uses that.
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:44.660]   Really?
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:45.660]   Yeah.
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:47.780]   He got for free at Google I am.
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:49.900]   Anyway, so he's the only one.
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.060]   He's the only one.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:55.300]   But no, if you look at the first few Nexus devices, they were great.
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:56.300]   They had vision.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.580]   I remember Google didn't build any of those.
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:58.580]   No, I know.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:00.380]   But they were responsible for bringing them into the world.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:02.460]   And they were, they were for maker.
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:03.700]   You know, you could take it apart.
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:04.700]   They were hackable.
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.580]   They were, you know, they had tethering.
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:09.900]   They had all these like really cool things and they were cheap.
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:10.900]   Right?
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:14.820]   So it's like, where are the, where are those types of devices these days from Google?
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.700]   You know, they're all, they're all, they used to be no compromises.
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:22.220]   Now they're back to compromises, namely a huge price for the, for the current phone.
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:25.300]   So it's like, I don't know, I just don't, it just seemed like they were so good at
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:27.020]   hardware for a little while.
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:30.900]   And now they're just kind of like, eh, oh, may stop all the Google edition phones too.
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:35.020]   You know, like the Samsung phones that would run stock Google, you know, they really killed
[01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:36.020]   all that.
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:37.020]   That's sad.
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:38.020]   It's sad.
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:40.020]   It's one of the reasons I still think the OnePlus one, and I don't know when they're going
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.620]   to do OnePlus too, but that, that deserves more attention.
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:46.020]   And now that you don't need an invite to buy it, I think that's the Nexus phone.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.020]   Yeah.
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:50.020]   Because oxygen, which is, they've, they, OnePlus one has severed ties with cyanogen,
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:53.540]   mona, oxygen, which I immediately installed on my OnePlus one.
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:54.540]   You did that too.
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:55.540]   Did you?
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:56.540]   I did it.
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:57.540]   It's pure lollipop.
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:58.540]   It's great.
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:14:59.540]   I can't.
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:03.380]   People that it bothers are the, are the people that really wanted all of that customization,
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:04.380]   the cyanogen.
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:05.380]   And all that kind of stuff.
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:06.380]   And all that kind of stuff.
[01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:07.380]   But I really don't miss that.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:09.620]   Like I just want that device to have lollipop.
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:10.620]   And now it does.
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:11.620]   I'm happy.
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:13.420]   I think that's the Google Play edition phone you want.
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:14.420]   Yeah.
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:15.420]   Frankly.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:16.420]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:18.420]   And with a, with a cheap low price.
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:19.940]   Windows, this was part of the announcement.
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:23.460]   A lot of announcements from Builden again, we'll be covering that on Friday with Mary
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:25.220]   Joe and Paul.
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:29.580]   But the big news, Windows 10 will be able to run Android and iOS apps.
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:31.780]   Well, sort of.
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:34.500]   You'll have to, you'll have to rewrite them.
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:39.220]   Google, I mean, Microsoft is offering now a cross platform development, free development
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:44.900]   tool called code, which is kind of a mini visual studio, will be available on Linux.
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.620]   And oh, it's 10.
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:52.900]   And that is to me such a departure from the Microsoft of all Microsoft hated Linux.
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:53.900]   Yeah.
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:54.900]   Yeah.
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:16:00.300]   The fact that they're now offering development tools for Linux for free and inviting developers
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:06.220]   of Android and iOS apps to rework them so that they can run on Windows 10 is fascinating
[01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:07.220]   to me.
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:11.900]   I think I think Microsoft is going to be selling its own version of Linux sometime in the next
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.900]   two or three years, the way they're going.
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:14.900]   Well, they did at one time.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:15.900]   Didn't they?
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:16.900]   They had Zenix.
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:17.900]   They had a, well, it wasn't Linux.
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:18.900]   It was a Unix.
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:23.700]   That was, I think Microsoft's first operating system was after DOS was Zenix.
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:24.700]   I've forgotten about that.
[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:25.700]   Wow.
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:26.700]   Yeah.
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:28.060]   Zenix has been around a long time.
[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:29.900]   But I think this is brilliant.
[01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:31.620]   This easy porting, I mean, this is the...
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.500]   We don't know how easy it's going to be.
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:38.140]   True, but the strategy is brilliant because essentially it's like every developer makes
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:43.140]   the same decision, you know, they're basically, well, we've got to be on iOS or Android or
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:44.460]   both.
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:49.380]   And then should we go to Blackberry and Windows and so on and it's like, nah, it's not worth
[01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:50.380]   it, right?
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:53.900]   So, but if they just make it worth it, they make it easy, you know, and this will be a
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:54.900]   chicken and egg type of thing.
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:55.900]   So this is...
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:57.220]   There's lots of apps available on Windows Phone?
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.620]   This is the interesting Windows thing.
[01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:07.740]   If you're an Android developer, continue to use Java and C++ on Windows 10 for your Windows
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:09.340]   10 version.
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:13.620]   Objective C, you would continue to use Objective C. They've provided SDKs.
[01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:15.700]   What I find really interesting, of course, most...
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:19.860]   One of the things that keeps apps on Android, I imagine this is true in iOS as well, is
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:24.660]   the use of services built in OS services that are not available across platform.
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:26.820]   Microsoft says...
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:28.420]   This is Terry Meierson.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:34.900]   If they're using some Google API, we have created Microsoft replacements for those APIs.
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:37.100]   You know where they first use this strategy?
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.100]   Remember when...
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:39.100]   And this is...
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:44.980]   I'm going to date myself here, but remember when WordPerfect was the big...
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:47.540]   And what they did was they came out with a...
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:52.420]   They supported all the keystrokes in WordPerfect in Word, and that's what killed WordPerfect
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:53.420]   and made...
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.180]   Put sent Word to the top.
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:56.340]   This is a great strategy again.
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:58.060]   This is something they've done before.
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:17:59.060]   I wonder if Microsoft's...
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:00.060]   I wonder if Microsoft's...
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:01.060]   I'm not even reading their own dog food.
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:06.140]   Are the very nice iOS apps that Microsoft has released based on this SDK?
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.140]   This would...
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:08.980]   That would be intriguing to me.
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:12.940]   So Microsoft for instance offers Outlook on iOS.
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:13.940]   Do they...
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.460]   I don't know if they have a Windows Phone Outlook yet.
[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:16.460]   They will.
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:20.180]   And I wonder if this is the same tool.
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:23.540]   Developers will be able to leverage their .NET and Win32 work, bring this to Windows
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:26.580]   Universal apps.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:27.580]   It would be a...
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:29.700]   You know, we've heard of this...
[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:30.700]   That's what Java was supposed to do.
[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:31.700]   Java.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:32.700]   I was going to keep thinking about Java.
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:33.700]   Yeah.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:34.700]   And right once run everywhere.
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:35.700]   Yep.
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:36.860]   The problem with Java was native...
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:38.500]   The native UI.
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:41.380]   And they developed Swing, which gave you a little bit more native UI.
[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:42.380]   But you could always tell.
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:43.620]   You still can.
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:46.300]   If an app is written in Java instead of the native OS.
[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:51.700]   So when you use Eclipse on Windows, you know it's Java, right?
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:54.980]   Even with the Swing widgets.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.460]   So that will be the test.
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:19:02.260]   If you can't tell if it's a native app or a ported iOS or Android app, I think that
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.260]   will be very interesting.
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.740]   In any event, it's a...
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:06.900]   What a brave new world.
[01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:07.900]   It's a new...
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:12.260]   If you had told me that someday Microsoft would make it possible to run Apple programs on
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:15.500]   a Microsoft platform, I would have laughed.
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:16.500]   Ah!
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:20.500]   And I think a lot of people are saying that all this is coming about because Satya Nadella
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:21.500]   is good.
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:22.500]   I agree.
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:26.180]   Well my contention is yeah, he's good, but I think the bigger point is that Steve Balmer
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.180]   was bad.
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.100]   He was a terrible CEO.
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:30.300]   I think you're right.
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:33.420]   And I've heard people say, "Oh no, all this was in process with..."
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:35.500]   Balmer was there and Satya just inherited this.
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.500]   I don't think so.
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:40.980]   Their market capitalization dropped by half over the period that he was a CEO.
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.100]   He was one of the worst CEOs in technology.
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:44.100]   Wow.
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:46.100]   It was all because he was Bill Gates' friend.
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.100]   Yeah.
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:48.100]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:51.500]   I think Nadella has shown that he is the right man for the time.
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.500]   Yeah.
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:56.500]   Cloud-focused, not Windows Windows Windows, but Microsoft Microsoft.
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:01.380]   He's willing to embrace the new paradigm, which is what they've needed to do for a long
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:02.380]   time.
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:06.580]   I've never been a big Microsoft fan, but I like the direction they're going.
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:11.540]   I posted something on Google+ about all the rumors swirling, like Windows is going to
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:14.980]   become open source because of some, like a couple of comments that somebody made in
[01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:15.980]   a conference.
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:16.980]   Yeah.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:19.420]   But still, I mean, if they're willing to at least talk about that, right?
[01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:21.500]   And that person didn't get fired, by the way, for saying that.
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.180]   So, I mean, if they're willing to talk about that, I mean, it is.
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:25.860]   It's a change in the momentum.
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:28.220]   And they're saying, "Look, we need to embrace these things.
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:32.180]   We can't just live in our own little bubble anymore because we're not selling billions
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:34.140]   of copies of Windows around the world anymore."
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:35.140]   And it's realism.
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:39.180]   I mean, there's certain major businesses that they rely on, namely Windows in Office
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:41.300]   and a lot of things around it.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:43.940]   But look, they're going to lose it anyway.
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.580]   So let's just try everything.
[01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:47.020]   Let's be on all platforms.
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:48.900]   That's the right attitude generally.
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:53.020]   And I think it's really going to take a while because they, you know, take a while to change
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:54.020]   your reputation.
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:55.020]   Good or bad.
[01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:58.580]   We should point out that both Gates and Palmer were the right men for the time, the
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:20:59.580]   90s and the 2000s.
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:01.900]   Palmer was never the right CEO.
[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:02.900]   He doubled.
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:05.500]   The profits were phenomenal.
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:06.500]   But I think you're right.
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:09.100]   He didn't turn the corner at an appropriate...
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:11.700]   Same way, Bill almost missed the internet.
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.580]   Palmer almost missed the cloud.
[01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:15.380]   But as yours there, they had Ray Aussie.
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:18.140]   Ray Aussie was the guy who said, "You guys got to pay attention.
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.420]   The cloud is the new OS, not Windows."
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:22.900]   And I think Nandella has recognized that.
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:27.500]   He did, in fact, come from Microsoft's cloud side, so he certainly recognized that.
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:32.180]   And he said very publicly, "Look, we're going to be everywhere our customers are.
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:35.260]   And if that means iOS and Android, we will be there.
[01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:38.140]   But the best experience will always be on Windows."
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:40.060]   I think that's exactly the right message.
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:42.580]   I don't think users anymore...
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:44.380]   This will be interesting to watch.
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:49.460]   Despite the fact that our viewers, because they're enthusiasts, will fight that battle.
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:53.100]   It used to be Mac versus Windows now, it's Android versus iOS.
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:57.740]   I don't think real users even care or know, just as they don't know a processor, how much
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:01.020]   RAM, why should they care about what OS they're running?
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:04.780]   If it's my data there or my apps there, can I do what I want to do, that's fine.
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:08.980]   And that's the promise of the cloud, isn't it?
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:14.020]   Just as the internet is OS independent, the cloud is OS independent.
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:15.460]   And apps as well.
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:18.780]   One of my favorite apps on iOS is a Microsoft app.
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:21.180]   They do a great job.
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:22.260]   It's a great app.
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:25.460]   And what if Microsoft made 50 more?
[01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:26.460]   Great apps.
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:27.460]   Why not?
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:28.940]   That's Facebook's model.
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:32.060]   It's just get as many apps out there.
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:36.220]   In the case of Photosyn that is not really involved in Microsoft Cloud, but what if they
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:40.180]   came out with the gazillion mobile cloud apps for every platform?
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:45.700]   That would be an amazing bit of culture changing, like change the reputation of Microsoft in
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.580]   the minds of the consumers.
[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:51.660]   Because you love the people who are giving you great apps and a great mobile experience.
[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:52.660]   And they can do it.
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:53.660]   Right.
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:55.700]   That's kind of like the Nintendo paradigm shift as well, right?
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:58.460]   And they recently announced that they were going to do, or start doing mobile apps.
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:00.260]   It's like we're not going to do a console really anymore.
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:01.260]   You know what they do?
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:05.780]   They did say that, but they also said, but don't expect our old apps on the...
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.580]   You know what everybody wants is Mario.
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:08.580]   Right.
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:09.580]   The next Mario, super Mario.
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:10.580]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:11.580]   They're going to do new apps.
[01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:12.580]   And it's like, come on.
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:13.580]   You know.
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:16.220]   But that's where their value is, is in their...
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:20.020]   The Mario stuff and the Smash Bros and all that kind of stuff.
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:21.020]   I mean, that's what people buy.
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:22.020]   That's what I want.
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:23.020]   Yeah.
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.020]   Exactly.
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:25.020]   On Android.
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:26.020]   Right.
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:28.180]   Not that I would ever take an old show that I used to do.
[01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:29.180]   No.
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:30.180]   Of course not.
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:31.180]   Why would you do that?
[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:32.180]   Not that back.
[01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:33.180]   No.
[01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:34.180]   Nobody wants that.
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:35.180]   Nobody wants that.
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:36.180]   Yeah, we do.
[01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:37.180]   We do.
[01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:40.060]   You know, I'll talk about an app that has failed.
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:42.220]   Just came in, breaking news.
[01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:44.820]   Secret is now going under.
[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:45.940]   And good riddance to it.
[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:52.900]   You know, I erased Secret from all my platforms months ago, but it was, for a while, a very
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:58.580]   addictive thing, especially because everybody in Silicon Valley was posting anonymous posts.
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:23:59.580]   Only people in Silicon Valley.
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:01.580]   Pretty much only people in Silicon Valley.
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:04.300]   Anonymous posts.
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.300]   Secret does not...
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:09.060]   This is David Bithow, who was the founder.
[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:12.220]   After a lot of thought and consultation with our board, I decided to shut down Secret.
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:18.260]   Secret does not represent the vision I had when starting the company.
[01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:22.860]   We built a product used by 15 million people, pushed the boundaries of traditional social
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:28.740]   media, but it's also the ultimate double-edged sword, which must be wielded with great respect
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:29.740]   and care.
[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:30.740]   He's talking about anonymity.
[01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:31.740]   Yeah.
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:32.740]   Yeah.
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:37.180]   And clearly, as we were talking at the very beginning, you know, in Twitter, you are anonymous
[01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:41.700]   in... with the real names policy of Facebook and the formerly of Google+, although I think
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:48.820]   it's that lingers, that legacy lingers, you cannot be as bad as you can be if you're anonymous.
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.180]   When you're anonymous, no holds barred.
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:52.180]   Right.
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:56.460]   And this was, to me, the fundamental flaw of Secret, which is that in the beginning,
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:57.940]   yes, it was also Silicon Valley people.
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:02.780]   It was, you know, leaking details about what's happening at, you know, at various companies
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:03.780]   and so on.
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:08.660]   But for it to go mainstream means that 90% of the users at some point are going to be trolls.
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:09.660]   Right.
[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:10.660]   Because it's anonymous.
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:19.420]   It's like, you know, anonymity is the perfect platform for being a total a-hole.
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:21.820]   Secret does not run out of money.
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:23.540]   In fact, they still have cash.
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:25.420]   They say they're returning that to the investors.
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:28.940]   However, of course, investors will have lost significant amount of money on this.
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:34.500]   And just as a side note, this has to be said that this was broken by a top-notch news organization
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:35.500]   that does not run.
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:36.500]   Buzzfeed.
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:39.460]   Buzzfeed is turned into a news.
[01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:44.820]   Well, they are both a link-baiting type of company and they also are a really good journalistic
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:45.820]   organization.
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:47.260]   And they've hired their way to become a good journalist.
[01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:48.260]   Exactly.
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:52.020]   And I saw somebody say today on Twitter, that's what people really want.
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:54.180]   People do like link bait and they do like good journalism.
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:56.180]   And Buzzfeed is running like both.
[01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:57.180]   Bring them to both.
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:25:58.180]   Bring it to us both.
[01:25:58.180 --> 01:25:59.340]   John O'Paretti who founded it.
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:00.340]   But who is running it?
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:02.820]   Now they hired some good people.
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:04.580]   But who's the EIC over there?
[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:05.580]   Because...
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:06.980]   I just heard a story on Buzzfeed the other day.
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:11.060]   I can't remember if it was on NPR or one of others.
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:13.220]   And it was really interesting to listen to.
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:16.980]   They're kind of up and down in the scandals that have gone on over the years with pulling
[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:17.980]   down articles.
[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:19.780]   You know who's Executive Vice President?
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:20.780]   Safe Rank.
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:21.780]   Really?
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:23.780]   I did not.
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:24.780]   What the...
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:25.780]   Wow.
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.540]   I'm glad to say Frank got a job.
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:30.820]   He was a very early video blogger.
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:34.900]   The guy who never blinked.
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:39.340]   So yeah, they broke the story fascinating.
[01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:44.460]   By the way, they didn't get much of a scoop since there was a medium post almost immediately.
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:45.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:49.660]   By David Batau, the founder.
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:51.180]   With a very lonely and sad...
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.180]   I know.
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:53.180]   Yeah.
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:54.180]   Ahead of it.
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:55.180]   Aww.
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:56.180]   Secrets gone.
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:57.180]   Aww.
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:58.660]   Well, wasn't the Fox...
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:00.660]   The Secret icon was a Fox.
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:07.220]   So there's the sad Fox wandering off into the sunset.
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:09.620]   Wow.
[01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:12.740]   When you see the app economy, it is just...
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:15.380]   We talked about the business cycle being 10 years and less.
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:17.540]   It's 10 months and less now.
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:19.380]   You look at apps just come and go.
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:20.380]   Like boom.
[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:21.380]   Yeah.
[01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:22.380]   Boom.
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:23.380]   Alright.
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:26.860]   I think we could do some picks, but you know, I think we should start with Aaron's arcade
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:27.860]   cabinet.
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:29.860]   This is really, really cool.
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:30.860]   You posted...
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:33.860]   You put up a Google Slideshow or what do they call it?
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:34.860]   I did that for you guys.
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:39.260]   You guys could show some of the pictures in case people want to learn how to do it.
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:43.980]   I'm going to actually be giving this presentation on the 6th of May in Benisha for one of our
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:44.980]   makerspace workshops.
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:49.940]   So if you want to learn more, we're going to have a pinball and video game night.
[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:50.940]   And that's...
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:52.740]   I'm going to talk about how I built this for that.
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:53.740]   Well, we...
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:57.580]   When we first built the studio a few years ago, and I wish I could remember his name,
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:00.540]   one of our fans brought by a cabinet.
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:02.540]   Full-size, four player.
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:03.780]   Very similar to the one that I did.
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:05.380]   In fact, there's a picture of the one that I built.
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:06.380]   Oh, you've done this?
[01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:07.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:10.380]   I built one very similar to the one you guys have in the basement.
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:12.580]   And that was the one I built.
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:13.580]   That's the original.
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.580]   Yeah, before I moved out to California.
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:15.580]   If standing...
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:17.620]   It's very much like a real arcade machine.
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:19.980]   And when you do this, you have to have roller balls.
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:21.380]   You have to have toy sticks.
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:22.380]   You have to have 18 buttons.
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:23.380]   Spinner.
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:24.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:25.380]   Absolutely.
[01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:26.380]   And you do it right.
[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:27.380]   The thing is, it's just too big.
[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.380]   And we live in California.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.380]   We don't have a lot of storage space.
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:32.340]   Plus, I wanted to be able to toot something around to Maker Fairs and show people what
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:35.060]   they can do with Raspberry Pi and use it as a learning tool.
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.060]   Well, that's the amazing thing.
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.540]   The one we have in the basement, I don't know about yours, how to Mac Mini.
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:39.540]   And it was the year...
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:41.540]   Mine had a full-size computer in it.
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:47.580]   You don't need that anymore because now you can do it with a $35 Raspberry Pi.
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:48.580]   That's right.
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:49.580]   It's from Marco.
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:52.100]   This is all powered with a Raspberry Pi.
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:56.300]   All the woodwork was just done out of a couple of two foot by four foot sections of
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:57.300]   plywood.
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:58.300]   Did you cut it yourself?
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:28:59.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:00.300]   You get a little shop in the ground.
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:01.300]   Yeah.
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:02.300]   It's perfect.
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:03.300]   It's a car with plywood.
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:04.300]   Yep.
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:05.300]   And you have, by the way, the...
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:08.140]   Now, some of these pictures are from an instructable which is linked in this presentation.
[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:10.140]   Yeah, this is the two-player bar top arcade.
[01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:11.140]   So, does the inspiration?
[01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:13.460]   This is the inspiration because this guy did such a good job.
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:18.780]   He even did... if you go look for two-player bar top arcade cabinet on Instructables, you'll
[01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:19.780]   find it.
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:24.740]   He even did... if you go to the next page, you'll see he even did the Ikea version assembly
[01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:25.740]   instructions.
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:29.740]   And these guys that overachiever for sure, I want to hire this guy, he did not have to
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:33.060]   do that for an instructable.
[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:37.020]   But anyway, so the great thing about this though is it's all reused components, mostly.
[01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:39.060]   So, the Raspberry Pi obviously was new.
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:40.060]   But that's cheap.
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:41.060]   You've got an SD card laying around probably.
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:42.060]   Right.
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:44.060]   And you've got an old power cable, an old power supply from a PC.
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:45.060]   And a bit of all these controllers.
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.540]   Yeah, they're pretty cheap these days.
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:49.540]   I got that whole set there for about $70 on eBay.
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:50.780]   Everything I needed to build.
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:51.780]   These are all LED buttons.
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:53.820]   Does it really require quarters?
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:55.260]   Well, I've got quarter buttons.
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:56.260]   Yeah.
[01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:57.260]   They're virtual quarters.
[01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:58.260]   I see.
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:29:59.260]   Virtual quarters.
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:01.580]   But you know, all this stuff is an old monitor of 5 by 4.
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:03.060]   That looks like a PC power supply.
[01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:04.060]   It is.
[01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:05.060]   Yeah, there's a PC power supply.
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:06.060]   That's pretty funny.
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:07.060]   That's pretty funny.
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.860]   All the LED lights that light up, the marquee on top, that's all being run off that...
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:11.740]   And you don't want a wide screen monitor.
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:12.740]   You don't want a wide screen.
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:13.740]   You don't want a wide screen.
[01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:14.740]   That's right.
[01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:16.460]   Because a lot of the old video games were vertical.
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:17.460]   Right.
[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:21.260]   You know, so the nice thing about this is it's almost square and you can play the early
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:26.180]   consoles, right, which were done on 4, 3 TV screens and you can play the old arcade games.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:27.180]   They both look great.
[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:28.180]   Are you running main?
[01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:29.180]   Are you running an emulator?
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:36.420]   So there's a project, and I believe Brian used this for when he did the SNES Raspberry
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:37.580]   Pi thing that he did.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:39.140]   It's called Retro Pi.
[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:40.300]   And it emulates just about anything.
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:42.900]   And if I had left all the emulators up here, you would have seen Apple too.
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:43.900]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:44.900]   You would have seen Amiga.
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:46.700]   You would have seen all of these cool emulators.
[01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.180]   But I took those out because this is mostly free.
[01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:50.140]   I gotta get a Raspberry Pi.
[01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:51.900]   It's gonna run Windows 10 too.
[01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:52.900]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:53.900]   That's amazing.
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:57.300]   It's supposed to run a developer edition of Windows 10, which is really cool.
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:58.300]   That's amazing.
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:30:59.300]   Now he did button decals.
[01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:00.300]   Did you do that?
[01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:01.300]   Yeah, you did the button decals.
[01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:02.300]   Get you.
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:04.980]   The button decals are great because they really give it a professional look.
[01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:06.740]   This is beautiful what you did here.
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:07.740]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:08.740]   There's Retro Pi.
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:09.740]   You can see all the different emulators there.
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:11.740]   You know, it's hard to see you have to squint.
[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:15.300]   Those are all the different emulators that Retro Pi runs.
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:18.500]   And so it's the easy button for doing something like this.
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:19.740]   They even have an SD image.
[01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:20.740]   So you just download the image.
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:21.740]   Look at him.
[01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:26.620]   Meghan asked me because her Meghan Moroni who hosts Technus tonight in iPad the day with
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:32.500]   me, her husband grew up playing Wizardry 1 on Apple II.
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:37.820]   And she said, Marco, you know, the kids, he's just got two 10 year olds, are very into
[01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:38.820]   Minecraft.
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:42.060]   Marco wants to play something older with them.
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:43.140]   How can he play Wizardry 1?
[01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:45.380]   And I said, I pointed it to an Apple II emulator.
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:46.380]   But this would be awesome.
[01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:48.140]   Have this play Wizardry 1 on this?
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:49.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:50.140]   That would absolutely do it.
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:51.140]   It's so much fun.
[01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:53.140]   It does a lot of early PC games too.
[01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.140]   Yeah.
[01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:55.140]   Lands of lore.
[01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:56.140]   I think it's on there.
[01:31:56.140 --> 01:31:57.140]   Commander Keen would be fun on here.
[01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:58.140]   Yeah.
[01:31:58.140 --> 01:31:59.140]   Yeah.
[01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:00.140]   Absolutely.
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:01.140]   By the way, that was a successful project.
[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:03.180]   Huck and Milo, his 10 year olds, loved it.
[01:32:03.180 --> 01:32:04.340]   I thought, oh, this one though.
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:05.340]   This isn't going to fly.
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:06.340]   Oh, this is going to fly.
[01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:08.100]   And now they want to build Wizardry 1 in Minecraft.
[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:09.100]   Yeah.
[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:10.100]   Yeah.
[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:11.340]   So total cost, 285 bucks.
[01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:12.700]   Now, that's with all the extras.
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:14.060]   You don't have to go to that extent.
[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:17.340]   But again, it could be a lot more expensive if you're not reusing all of the stuff that
[01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:21.100]   you would normally throw out, put in a landfill or send to someplace to be broken down.
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:22.580]   You can just reuse all that stuff.
[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:25.980]   Nobody sells the wood because I don't have any woodworking skills.
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:28.220]   I can't just buy the wood.
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:31.860]   You can't buy the wood, but what you could do is find a local maker or a local maker
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:33.900]   space, send them the designs.
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:36.020]   Maybe they'll cut it on a CNC machine for you.
[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:39.700]   And all you have to do is have this Wi-Fi dongle.
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:40.700]   So this has Wi-Fi.
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:41.700]   It has built-in Wi-Fi.
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:42.700]   Yeah.
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:43.700]   Why?
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:44.700]   So you get updated?
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:45.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:47.980]   So one of the brilliant things-- or not brilliant, but one of the nice things about
[01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:53.380]   RetroPy is it automatically does a sift share over your network with a link to all the
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:54.380]   ROM directories.
[01:32:54.380 --> 01:33:00.100]   So like when you need to import a game that you previously owned into this machine, right,
[01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:04.140]   you can just go to-- you can be on your Windows thing, open it up, copy the file over, and
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:05.140]   then go run it.
[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:12.820]   And we'll put a link to Aaron's slide show in the show notes here.
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:13.820]   Yeah, you can get all the details.
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:14.820]   Or just come see the presentation.
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:15.820]   There's a lot of pictures.
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:16.820]   Where are you going to do this?
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:17.820]   This is in Benisha.
[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:20.100]   So why no MDF or particle board?
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:21.300]   MDF or particle board.
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:22.300]   They're both awfully messy.
[01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:23.820]   Number one, they're not very strong.
[01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:24.820]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:26.380]   The first one I built out of MDF because it looked nice.
[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:27.380]   It's easy to route.
[01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:28.380]   Oh, man, what a mess.
[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:29.380]   I got some odd old--
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:31.380]   Hardwood plywood's like solid.
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:32.380]   Very solid.
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:33.380]   Very solid.
[01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:34.380]   And it paints well.
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:38.540]   Because you can get like a birch veneer or just the-- even the stuff you get out of Home Depot.
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:39.900]   How big does NST card?
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:41.140]   How much storage do you need?
[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:43.660]   I think this is only a 8 gig.
[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:44.660]   It's amazing, really.
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:45.660]   It's a big gig.
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:48.500]   I have every Atari game is on here.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:49.500]   It's plenty.
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:50.500]   That was made.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:54.940]   And it takes up, I think, you know, less than 10 megs of space or something.
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:55.940]   It's crazy.
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:56.940]   It's crazy.
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:58.140]   Now you can't run everything on here.
[01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:01.100]   Some of the newer arcade games and all that, you're not going to be able to run.
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:03.380]   We're talking anything that's 20 years old or more.
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:04.380]   Exactly.
[01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:05.860]   1990, you know, previous.
[01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:06.860]   You can run.
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:07.860]   I love it.
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:08.860]   So it runs really well.
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:09.860]   And do the kids like it?
[01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:10.860]   Oh, you kidding me?
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:11.860]   You put little speakers in there?
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:12.860]   Yeah, we've got those speakers.
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:15.300]   And good speakers so you can really make it sound like.
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:19.340]   One of my wife likes is that I actually-- I reuse these speakers that I bought on Amazon.
[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:24.580]   And if I point over to that one, you can maybe make out there's a little headphone adapter.
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:27.180]   So what my wife loves is the kids want to play their games.
[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:28.180]   Kids put up headphones.
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:29.180]   They can put up headphones.
[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:31.340]   What is the game selection interface like?
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:32.340]   Is it text or is it images or--
[01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:33.340]   Yeah, here it is.
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:34.340]   There it is.
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:35.340]   Oh, there we go.
[01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:39.100]   So you can go to whatever-- I don't know what people like to play.
[01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:40.780]   But you kind of scroll down.
[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:41.980]   There's so many games on here.
[01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:42.980]   You're still in the A's.
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:44.780]   You've been scrolling down for like half an hour.
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:46.180]   And that's just one emulator.
[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.180]   It's a big job for you.
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:48.180]   Oh, wow.
[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:49.180]   Look at that.
[01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:53.620]   Yeah, ours had a keyboard so you could simplify some of this stuff.
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:54.620]   But you know--
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:55.620]   You can't with this too.
[01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:56.620]   Yeah.
[01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:57.620]   I can go to--
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:58.620]   The Bluetooth keyboard you could use.
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:34:59.620]   That's good indeed.
[01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:02.780]   I'll pull up Donkey Kong just for fun.
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:03.940]   Oh, I love Donkey Kong.
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:08.180]   The first appearance of Mario, although he wasn't called Mario then.
[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:09.940]   I got an image on that one.
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:11.700]   Yeah, you can imagine that.
[01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:12.700]   Oh, look out.
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:13.700]   Oh, wow.
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:14.700]   You might have found this.
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:15.700]   Do you mind if I keep this?
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:16.700]   Does it make this?
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:19.100]   No, my initials are not M.A.R. but that was a nickname as a kid.
[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:20.100]   So those are my--
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:21.100]   Oh, look at it.
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:22.100]   Oh, look at it.
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:24.340]   See, there's Mario at the bottom though, although he was at the time not called Mario.
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:25.340]   I don't know what he was called.
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:26.340]   It was a little plumber man.
[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:28.620]   Little plumber man, I understand it like that.
[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:31.300]   Oh my god, that's such memories.
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:33.780]   And it looks exactly the colors and everything.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:36.900]   Yeah, it's emulating the exact machine.
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:39.340]   It's just emulating it in software.
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:41.500]   And the Pi is fast enough to emulate it fully.
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:44.260]   It's fast enough to run all of these old games like this.
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:45.260]   Like I said, not the new ones.
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:47.260]   One of these games were running on 6502s.
[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:48.260]   Oh, we're not.
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:49.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:50.260]   And this is running--
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:52.940]   I use the Pi 2, the Model 2 for this.
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:55.140]   So that's another thing to keep in mind.
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:58.260]   The Model 2 is going to run more games because it's a lot faster than the original.
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:01.780]   Raspberry Pi with single core technology.
[01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:03.260]   That is the thing of beauty, I tell you.
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:05.100]   Yeah, I am so impressed.
[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:06.100]   This is the unveiling.
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:07.100]   This is the first time I've had it out of the garage.
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:09.300]   I thought since I was coming over, I'd bring it.
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:10.940]   Also, well, we'll get to that in a minute.
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:11.940]   We'll get to that in a minute.
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:13.540]   But it's a lot of fun.
[01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:15.180]   The kids are burger time.
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:16.180]   You know, they're having burger time competitions.
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:17.980]   I don't know if anyone's been to that.
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:18.980]   Burger time?
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:19.980]   Burger time?
[01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:20.980]   Is that a game?
[01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:21.980]   Oh my word.
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:23.300]   Here we got a Paul Burger.
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:24.780]   It sounds familiar.
[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:27.260]   Are you throwing burgers?
[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:34.140]   It's kind of similar to Donkey Kong in the level approach, but there's little burgers
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:35.820]   and eggs and stuff.
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:36.820]   There it is.
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:38.740]   Walking around, you have to throw salt and pepper on.
[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:40.700]   You're making burgers by walking over them and making them drop.
[01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:41.860]   Oh yeah, it's kind of coming back to me.
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:44.700]   I think I was too old to play burger time.
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:46.780]   Oh, look at that.
[01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:48.540]   What was your game, Jason?
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:51.100]   Oh, I mean, too many to count.
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:52.100]   I was always...
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:53.100]   What was it?
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:54.100]   I loved...
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:55.100]   What was the one where you're climbing up?
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:56.100]   Crazy climber.
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:57.100]   Crazy climber.
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:58.100]   The only thing was that the one you were talking about?
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:36:59.660]   Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.
[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:00.660]   Okay, we were at the same page.
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:02.020]   You were climbing up a building.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:03.020]   Yeah.
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:04.580]   Now, didn't you have to adjust the problem with this?
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:07.860]   That's the problem with emulators on Crazy Climber, because if you do it on a PC, you've
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:09.620]   got one joystick and you need two.
[01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:10.620]   Here it would work.
[01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:11.620]   You got them.
[01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:13.620]   You could do joust.
[01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:14.620]   Yeah.
[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:15.620]   All the games that had weird control.
[01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:17.180]   Oh man, I want to set it be a track ball.
[01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:18.420]   I need to make this.
[01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:19.420]   Crazy climber.
[01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:20.620]   Oh man.
[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:21.860]   I loved Crazy Climber.
[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:22.860]   Yeah.
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:24.940]   Now, we should say these are totally illegal bombs, right?
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:25.940]   Absolutely.
[01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:27.480]   We've just told you.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.940]   I'm using this for demonstration purposes.
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:30.460]   This is for demonstration purposes only.
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:32.460]   If you were to do this, oh, that's the game.
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:33.460]   Yep, that's it.
[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:34.460]   That's so funny.
[01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:35.760]   You and I are both thinking of that game.
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:36.760]   Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot.
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:37.760]   Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot.
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.120]   It was a hard game.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:40.120]   Very hard.
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.940]   Yeah, it was in the pizzeria around near my house when I was a kid.
[01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:45.100]   I played it all the time.
[01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:46.100]   Oh no.
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:47.100]   Oh no.
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:48.100]   Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot.
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:49.100]   Oh no.
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:50.820]   'Cause you have to move around because there's window washers.
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:51.820]   Yep.
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:52.820]   Things happen.
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:57.820]   And you drop stuff, flowers.
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:00.820]   I don't know what the controls are for this one.
[01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:01.820]   I do.
[01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:02.820]   You move each different joystick up and down.
[01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:03.820]   In some of the games you have to manually specify.
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:05.820]   You use the controls this way to be on the play.
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:09.820]   And once you set that once, it's set going forward for that particular game.
[01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:19.820]   Do you see the archive.org has a lot of these runs.
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:21.820]   That's a nice thing about running the old ones.
[01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:25.820]   You're a little less likely to come under scrutiny if you're running the old stuff.
[01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:27.820]   Really, you're not going to come under scrutiny.
[01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:28.820]   People put them up on the web.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:29.820]   Right.
[01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:30.820]   Exactly.
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:32.820]   Yeah, don't sell them.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:34.820]   Yeah, don't sell them.
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:35.820]   No, that's fine.
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:36.820]   Yeah, that's fine.
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:39.820]   I'm going to make that one.
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:42.820]   I'm going to make that one.
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:44.820]   I'm going to make that one.
[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:45.820]   Right.
[01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.820]   I'm going to make that one.
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:49.820]   I'm going to make that one.
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:52.820]   I'm going to make that one.
[01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:55.820]   I'm going to make that one.
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:58.820]   I'm going to make that one.
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:38:59.820]   Okay.
[01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:00.820]   Yeah.
[01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:02.820]   I'm going to make that one.
[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:07.820]   Do I have any ability of actually making something that looks even nearly?
[01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:08.820]   Yeah, you absolutely can.
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:09.820]   There's enough tutorials.
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:13.820]   The tutorial that was in that presentation I linked to is full of great details.
[01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:16.820]   The only thing I would say that's different is he used MDF.
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:17.820]   Don't use MDF.
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.820]   You're going to ruin your own.
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:20.820]   Right.
[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:21.820]   Is it plastic?
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:22.820]   What's that?
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:23.820]   What's MDF?
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:24.820]   MDF, it's a medium density fiberboard.
[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:25.820]   It's kind of like a--
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:26.820]   Oh, it's a fiberboard.
[01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:28.820]   It's like more smaller particles than particles.
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:31.820]   Think of particle board, and then make the particles even smaller and glue them together.
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:32.820]   That's what MDF is.
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:36.820]   It does route well, but it's not going to be as strong as this.
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:41.820]   Archive.org has 80,000 ROMs, a 50 gigabyte download.
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:42.820]   That's the problem.
[01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:43.820]   There's too many.
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:44.820]   Yeah, there's too many.
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:45.820]   Go with the ones you want.
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:47.820]   So I want you to do this, Jason.
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:48.820]   I want to do it.
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:49.820]   Now I need to find the time.
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:52.820]   And Aaron, I want you to come on the screensavers and give us an even more in-depth.
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:53.820]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:54.820]   Yeah, love to do it.
[01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:55.820]   Love to do it.
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:56.820]   The screensavers.
[01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:59.820]   By the way, we do launch the new screensavers Saturday, May 2nd.
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:00.820]   That's the Saturday.
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:04.820]   To 3PM Pacific, 6PM Eastern time.
[01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:10.820]   It is not in any way related to any previous show, fact or fictional.
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:13.820]   That's going to protect us.
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:19.820]   We are looking for people who have ideas that want to show something, ask questions because
[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:24.820]   we're going to answer calls, email new screensavers@twit.tv.
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:25.820]   That's our email address.
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:29.820]   New screensavers@twit.tv.
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:30.820]   Join us on Saturday afternoon.
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:31.820]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:33.820]   I can't wait.
[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:35.820]   Mike, you got a tip?
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:36.820]   An item?
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:39.820]   First of all, I'd like to say thank you for making me follow Aaron's arcade.
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:40.820]   I know.
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:41.820]   That was a good one, huh?
[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:42.820]   I'm following you.
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:43.820]   So I'm the one.
[01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:46.820]   My tool is bogus compared to what I'm talking about.
[01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:47.820]   It is.
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:49.820]   It is what it is.
[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:52.820]   Okay, so this is a tool called Hunting Cabin.
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:55.820]   I assume that everybody uses Product Hunt.
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:59.820]   This is a great resource to find new products and miscellaneous things.
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:02.820]   However, sometimes you're looking for obscure things.
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:04.820]   You don't want to go there every single day.
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:07.820]   So Hunting Cabin is essentially like a Google alert.
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:09.820]   Yeah, it's weird.
[01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:11.820]   For Product Hunt.
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:16.820]   You go in there, you put the criteria in there and then when your criteria met, you'll get
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:19.820]   an email with a link to the Product Hunt product.
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:21.820]   Kind of a nice thing.
[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:26.820]   A lot of people do Google alerts, which is of course I'm a Google alert freak.
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:27.820]   I think I have like three or four hundred.
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:29.820]   Is it still around?
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:30.820]   Yeah, okay.
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:33.820]   And it's perfect as always.
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:37.740]   And what a lot of people don't know, and I'm not sure if I've mentioned this on this
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:40.820]   show before, but there's also a scholar version.
[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:46.460]   So if you like really obscure geeky stuff, you can go to googlescholar.google.com and
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:48.420]   click on the alerts button at the top.
[01:41:48.420 --> 01:41:50.580]   And that's a totally separate thing from Google alerts.
[01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:53.380]   Google alerts will not give you stuff from Google Scholar.
[01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:58.700]   So if you have very obscure interests, Google Scholar is one and if you like products,
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:03.420]   Hunting Cabin is another that you can use to sort of automate it and really go after
[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:07.380]   the obscure things because of course you don't want to be checking, I mean I check it
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:11.540]   every day, but most people probably don't want to go to Product Hunt every single day.
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:14.980]   So it's a great way to make sure nothing falls to the cracks.
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:21.540]   By the way, Tag Huar has announced a $1400 Android Wear watch.
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:24.140]   So get ready.
[01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:26.380]   It's modeled after the Carrera.
[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:29.580]   I think that's probably not the watch you're looking for.
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:32.980]   It's only twice the price of one of Apple Watch's bands.
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:35.180]   That's a good point.
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:37.580]   That's a good point.
[01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:43.820]   I think, you know, I am still not sold that a watch is wearable you want, but I think we're
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:46.020]   going to be in a golden age watch choice anyway.
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:47.860]   Yep, yep, we are.
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:52.060]   You mentioned, you know, I wasn't planning on doing this as a pick, but I am going to
[01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:54.820]   do it now because you mentioned Product Hunt.
[01:42:54.820 --> 01:43:00.700]   There is a, it has been around for a lot longer, a Product Hunt for Geeks called Hacker News.
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:06.100]   Now many people know about Y Combinator, Paul Graham's startup school and for a long
[01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:10.580]   time they've had a really great news feed.
[01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:13.780]   It's at news.Y Combinator.com.
[01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:16.100]   It's voted up and down.
[01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:19.780]   So the stuff at the top will be the highest votes.
[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:28.740]   It's also a great source, not just for news, but for geeky stuff, projects, ideas, a lot
[01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:30.180]   of programming stuff.
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:34.620]   There was a period where people started gaming Hacker News and thank goodness either they
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:38.660]   fixed it algorithmically or people just lost interest and moved on because it for a while
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:39.860]   was starting to turn into dig.
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:40.860]   And now it's not.
[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:41.860]   It's really great.
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:46.460]   I check it just like Product Hunt every single day.
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:52.220]   And if you want some really just kind of geeky news stories, I go through it and I get
[01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:54.980]   something almost every day out of it.
[01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:58.900]   Lot of it is for programmers and developers and geeks.
[01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:03.740]   But if for instance you want to, you know, secrets number three on the stories, the launch
[01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:09.220]   of Visual Studio Code is number one.net for Linux and Mac.
[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:10.220]   That's interesting.
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:11.220]   Number two.
[01:44:11.220 --> 01:44:15.860]   There's lots of stuff in there and I think a great way to get super geeky.
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:17.620]   Pretty darn quickly.
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:22.420]   A medieval English poet exposes the country's most corrupt industry.
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:23.420]   Wool.
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:24.420]   Fleeced.
[01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:25.420]   I like that.
[01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:26.420]   Fleeced.
[01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:27.420]   Fleeced.
[01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:30.300]   Some of this stuff is just geeky.
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:32.220]   This is from Lappoms Quarterly.
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:38.100]   Louis Lappoms kind of eclectic mix of interesting stuff.
[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:39.100]   Anyway.
[01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:42.340]   I think it was a lot of fun having you guys here.
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:44.140]   We didn't even miss Jeff and Gina.
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:45.620]   We did actually.
[01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:46.620]   I did.
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:47.620]   Aaron Newcomb.
[01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:48.620]   Love having you.
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:49.620]   NetApp.
[01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:50.620]   Thank you.
[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:51.620]   employernetapp.com.
[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:56.340]   We see Aaron frequently in all about Android and Floss Weekly and whenever we can get him
[01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:57.580]   up here, I love having you here.
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:58.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:59.580]   Thanks for having me.
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:00.580]   And what a great project.
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:01.580]   Please do come back and show us more.
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:02.580]   I will absolutely.
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:03.580]   I like to open it up and look at it.
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:04.580]   Yeah.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:05.580]   I'll have to show you the guts.
[01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:06.580]   Yeah.
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:07.580]   I want to see the guts.
[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:08.580]   That's what's fun.
[01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:09.580]   Beautiful.
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:10.580]   How long did it take?
[01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:11.580]   A couple months.
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:12.580]   A couple months of work.
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:15.700]   I've been working pretty heavily on getting all the difficulties.
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:18.820]   Once you got it going and you get addicted to this, like now you want to get like I
[01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:24.980]   brought my PS3 or DS3 controllers which play all the like the Super Nintendo and the ones
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:25.980]   that need the shoulder buttons.
[01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:27.780]   So you got to get those set up just right.
[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:30.940]   You know, and you can spend hours and hours tinkering with this getting it set up just
[01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:32.460]   the way you want.
[01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:37.100]   The nice thing about it since it's all in an 8 gig SD card, you can just take out the
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:38.740]   SD card, take it inside, back it up.
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:41.940]   And now you've got to back up image if you ever need to put the else with it.
[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:45.060]   I think you missed out on a monetization opportunity though.
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:46.060]   There should be a course.
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:47.060]   There should be a course.
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:48.060]   Real quarters.
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:49.060]   Yeah.
[01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:50.060]   You could admit it.
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:51.060]   I think I might have trouble for that.
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:52.060]   Apple pay.
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.060]   There we go.
[01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:54.060]   Apple, just come up tap to pay.
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:55.060]   Tap to play.
[01:45:55.060 --> 01:45:56.060]   Tap to play.
[01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:57.060]   Nice.
[01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:58.060]   Now we're cooking with this.
[01:45:58.060 --> 01:45:59.060]   Yeah.
[01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:00.060]   Yeah.
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:01.060]   Yeah.
[01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:02.060]   Mr. Mike Elgin is our news director, guy in charge of keeping us all up to date on what's
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:07.060]   going on every Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern time, 1700 UTC.
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:08.060]   He's going to see what's at news today.
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:09.060]   Sure.
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:10.060]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:12.060]   He's also nadily dressed and looks pretty good on a segue.
[01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:13.060]   Yeah.
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:14.060]   Yeah.
[01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:17.620]   I showed the news screensavers open to a number of people and almost universally they said,
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:18.620]   who is that Elgin guy?
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:19.620]   Where's a blazer on the segue?
[01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:20.620]   He is.
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:21.620]   He is dressy.
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:22.620]   He looks good.
[01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:23.620]   He looks mostly me saying it.
[01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:28.940]   But no, no, people who didn't know who anybody was said, hmm, they said Brian Burnett
[01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:35.420]   looks suave and they, we should play it because you can see Mike looks so sharp.
[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:36.900]   Jason Howell looks tall.
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:42.580]   Jason looks, everybody has evidence by my hunching while I rode the segue everywhere.
[01:46:42.580 --> 01:46:43.580]   You look good.
[01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:45.700]   Everybody looks good on a segue.
[01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:49.140]   Everybody looks a little bit dark in a segue except Mike Elgin who looks like James Bond.
[01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:50.820]   I don't understand it.
[01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:51.820]   It's a Google glass.
[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:53.780]   Thanks for being here.
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:54.780]   Do you want me to play?
[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:55.780]   No, it's all right.
[01:46:55.780 --> 01:47:00.620]   Everybody can go to inside.tv to find out more that shows coming soon and Saturday.
[01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:04.860]   If the good Lord is willing, the Creek Stone rise and Comcast doesn't sue us to death,
[01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:08.060]   but tune in on Saturday anyway.
[01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:09.060]   Thanks everybody for joining us.
[01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:16.340]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time, 2000 UTC.
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:18.380]   Of course, you can't watch our shows live.
[01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:20.220]   Every single one of our shows is available on demand.
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:22.460]   All you have to do is go to twit.tv.
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:24.340]   In this case, twit.tv/twig.
[01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:29.740]   We also put them on YouTube, youtube.com/thisweekengoogol and you can subscribe, which I would recommend.
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:30.740]   It's good for me.
[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:31.740]   Good for you.
[01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:32.740]   You get it each and every week.
[01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:36.260]   This is the episode where everywhere you subscribe your podcast apps.
[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:41.700]   I use dogcatcher on Android, but you can use iTunes, Xbox, music, whatever you use.
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:42.860]   Make sure you get every episode.
[01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:43.860]   You don't want to miss one.
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:46.220]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:46.720]   Bye-bye.
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:53.720]   (music)
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:56.800]   (upbeat music fades)
