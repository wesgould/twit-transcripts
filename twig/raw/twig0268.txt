[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.680]   A great show for you.
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.280]   Jeff Jarvis has a day off, but we've
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.920]   got a great feeling with Danny Sullivan from Search Engine
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.420]   Land.
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.480]   He knows all about those new Google snippets,
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.800]   why publishers might be a little bit upset,
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.600]   and the Google Change Log has some good news for Gmail users.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.480]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.480]   Netcast you love.

[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.000]   You had me at Blackberry.

[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.080]   Show that's all about Google, but not just Google,
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.360]   the Facebook, the cloud, the Twitter and all of that stuff.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.920]   Of course, Gina Trapani is here from thinkup.com,
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.520]   running at life hacker.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.360]   Hello, Gina, host of all about Android.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.640]   Android guru.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.760]   Also, Jeff Jarvis has the day off.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.000]   He's traveling, right?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.600]   He's in one of those travel loops
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.320]   that he gets in every once in a while.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.720]   It is a loop, though.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.360]   He flies to New York to Germany, then back,
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.360]   and then New York to Bahrain and then back.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.920]   And then New York to-- I mean, he's like, it's weird.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.320]   He's a travel animal.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.040]   He's a traveling man.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.440]   But he'll be back next week, I think.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.880]   I won't.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.240]   I'll be in London next week.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.320]   So-- Oh.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.760]   I'll take a week off.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.280]   Good for you.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.920]   Yeah, I'm excited.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.120]   But look who's replaced Jeff.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.640]   This is great.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.080]   Danny Sullivan is here from Search Engine Land.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.080]   Hey, Danny.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.600]   Hey.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.080]   He is obviously a skateboarder and a Twitter.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.680]   Oh.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.400]   I'm well-known.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.200]   Tony Hawk is always saying, dude, come on over.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.280]   Really?
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.120]   No.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.680]   That's pretty awesome.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.600]   Wow.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.680]   I bought it.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.080]   You should have rolled with that, Danny.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.720]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.080]   He doesn't live too far from you.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.680]   He's a San Diego, I think.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.640]   That would be pretty cool.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.520]   I actually did take a few skateboarding lessons
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.680]   because I felt like I should.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.040]   But I'm not very good.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.520]   You live in San Diego, I think everybody's
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.800]   supposed to skateboard there.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.200]   Yeah, we should all be doing that in something California.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.080]   But it's actually like-- it's a Google skateboard
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.920]   that they have in the company.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.760]   See it, see it.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.080]   Oh, listen.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.040]   So I liked the logo that was on it.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.600]   And I did like that it was a skateboard.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.440]   And then you have a snowboard, too.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.600]   That's a big snowboard.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   Is that a big board?
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.680]   Oh, sweet.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.680]   So you are being--
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.240]   You're going to have a lot of board meetings.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.240]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.240]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.560]   I'm being very fair.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.200]   Very fair.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.520]   But you can never see the Bing behind me.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.160]   So people are like, you got all that Google stuff.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.840]   And I'm like, but that was like a big--
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.240]   you just can't see the logo.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.760]   So there you are.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.680]   Hey, I got a little something in the mail today.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.000]   I'm a little bit excited about it.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.960]   Oh, is that the watch?
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.480]   Oh.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.960]   The 360.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.040]   No, I did order the watch.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.400]   I think it comes later next week or something.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.320]   Oh, you got the Moto Act.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.920]   This is the phone, baby.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.760]   Oh, I saw that.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.480]   You want to do a little mini unboxing?
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.560]   Actually, I already opened it up.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.400]   So it's not exactly a official box.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.120]   Let's do it.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.320]   Do it.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.800]   Let's do it anyway.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.480]   So I chose the Cognac Leatherback.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.040]   Nice.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.000]   And it is nice.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.280]   And it actually--
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.040]   it really does smell like leather.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.680]   I mean, it's got that leathery smell to it.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.480]   The dimples in it, really?
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.520]   The dimples changed a little bit, but it's still there.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.640]   I think it's very attractive.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.760]   And the flash is in the ring, although it's not
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.240]   a two-tone flash or anything like that.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.960]   It's just a dual flash.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   And now for the first time, a metal rim all the way around it.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.480]   Yeah, that's a good looking phone.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.240]   I think it's really gorgeous.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.080]   Now, compare it to the-- this is the iPhone.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.960]   It's 6, and you can compare the two there.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.160]   Now, they're similar in size.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.720]   The iPhone 6 is 4.7 inches, which
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.360]   is what the old Moto X was.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.240]   So this is obviously a little bit larger
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.480]   than the old Moto X.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.440]   Wow, they actually don't look that different.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.400]   Although the iPhone has those nice, those kind of shiny edges
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.680]   there.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.080]   I don't know how the way the glass sort of bends.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.960]   Oh, I love that.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.760]   It's a rounder.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.240]   But this has rounded glass, too.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.840]   I think this must be a new technique that everybody's doing.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.200]   So this has the--
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.240]   It's edge to edge glass, or it feels like it is.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.840]   I think it is.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.240]   And then it's rounded at the edge,
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.080]   which it would have to be.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.480]   Otherwise, it would cut you.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.800]   I like just a little touch.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.560]   This is the on/off button and the volume rocker
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.360]   on the same side.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.760]   So to distinguish between the two, you can't see it.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.400]   But they've scored the on/off switch.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.000]   You can easily-- it's like the edge of a dime.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.040]   You can easily tell when you're on the on/off switch,
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.680]   as opposed to the volume rocker.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.200]   That's nice.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.600]   I think that's a nice little touch.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   And of course, it's the talky version.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.360]   And you can this time program it, so I can say, hello, Moto X.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.520]   Hey, what's happening?
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.160]   Hey, you're doing it.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160]   Instead of OK, Google now.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.520]   And now it says, you know, you can say whatever you want.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.080]   That's boring to say hello, Moto X.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.960]   I should probably make it say something else.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.600]   Like, what's up?
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.520]   What's up?
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.040]   So yeah, I mean, it's 1080p now.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.960]   OK, thank you.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.320]   It's a talkative little.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.880]   It's-- well, I forgot what I was going to say.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.720]   It's a 1080p screen and the 13 megapixel camera, which
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.920]   is still not as great as the iPhone, but better.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.160]   After all the iPhone hype, Gina, now you're really solidly
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.320]   in the Android gap, you have to be.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.640]   Do you miss it?
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.560]   Yeah, well, you know the thing that I missed about it,
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.080]   and I was talking about this on all about Android last night,
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.920]   is I still have this creeping feeling
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.640]   that the iPhone camera is better, that the photos are better,
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.000]   without-- with less effort.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.080]   And in fact, Lisa Bettany just did a post.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.240]   Oh, gorgeous.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.600]   Did a great post.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.240]   Side by side photos in different lighting situations
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.600]   in every model of the iPhone.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.600]   And I got to tell you, the six photos, particularly
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.480]   like when she zoomed in on detail in low light,
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.640]   they were amazing.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.320]   You know, like the OnePlus camera's OK.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.400]   And I'm not a photographer.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.840]   I just want to press the button and get a good photo every time.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.400]   I'm not messing with settings.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.280]   But I take a dozen photos, a dozen shots every single time,
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.320]   and hope that one of them comes out well.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.560]   And I got to tell you, I think that the iPhone still
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.360]   has a better--
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.880]   That's the best.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.520]   --I think it's still producing quality photos.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.920]   And we were talking about this last night,
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.320]   and it was like, why is this happening?
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.040]   And I think it's because Apple makes the hardware,
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   and they make the software.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   And I think from day one, Apple just prioritized the camera
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.640]   in a way that Android didn't, partially
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.240]   because Google wasn't doing the hardware manufacturing.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.360]   So that's the only thing that makes me want an iPhone,
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.200]   I'll be honest.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.120]   But it's an important thing, because I think many people,
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.040]   because they're just their camera more than their phone,
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.560]   even.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.160]   Yeah, and I have a small child.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.640]   And I think to myself, like, are the photos
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.120]   that I have of my daughter when she's a baby?
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.400]   Should they be better?
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   20 years from now, am I going to hate myself?
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.560]   Retractively for not having a better camera on me.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.200]   I barely get out the DSLR.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.720]   So Lisa Bettany, who's, of course,
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.000]   a friend of the networks and a pro photographer,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   and the author of Camera Plus, which
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.840]   is one of the number one camera apps on the iPhone,
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.600]   had all the iPhones and took roughly the same picture
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.360]   with all of them, which is about, I think,
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.280]   seven different or eight different devices.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.200]   It's amazing that she had eight working iPhones for one thing.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.920]   But it's really valuable to see how they have improved.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.520]   But even more than that, in the industry,
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.080]   there's a company that makes software for Lightroom
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.680]   called DXOMark.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.880]   And they've become very well known for their acuity
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.840]   testing of cameras.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.680]   I think they're widely trusted.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:55.440]   DXO Labs, they're called, and it's DXOMark.com.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.680]   They gave the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus the highest rating
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.600]   of any mobile phone on the market.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.560]   The next one up is the S5, then the Xperia Z3, then the Z2,
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:13.320]   then the Nokia 808 PureView, which is that 41 megapixel camera.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.600]   So they, I mean, even better than the 1020, which
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.520]   is kind of middle of the pack.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.240]   So now people will argue this with you.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.240]   And in fact, whenever I say, I think the iPhone camera
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.880]   is the best camera, the Nokia people jump up and say,
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.000]   you're wrong.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.200]   But even DXOMark, based on clarity,
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.240]   based on color accuracy, exposure and contrast,
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.320]   accuracy of focusing, all the things
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.600]   that you care the most about, said
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.880]   it's really, really good, especially good in low light.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.280]   I mean, compared to other cameras.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.040]   So yeah, I missed that.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.920]   Actually, I don't miss it because I have it.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.280]   But--
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.240]   Well, I was going to say you have it, so I'm curious to know.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:50.760]   So--
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.520]   I wish you were in the Moto X because then I
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.120]   wouldn't need an iPhone.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.920]   Right, right.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.440]   So that's the 6, the 6 Plus.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.520]   This is the 6, which is really what people should buy.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.800]   The 6 Plus is like clown shoes.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.880]   It's too big.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.000]   And apparently, it bends like clown shoes as well,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.320]   which is another issue.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.280]   It's only the Plus bends.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:10.840]   Not the same.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.360]   Well, I think they're both bendable because it's metal
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.040]   and it's thin.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:14.480]   All right.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.880]   So I mean, one millimeter.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.120]   The 6 would be more likely to bend because it's just so much
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.760]   larger.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.520]   Exactly.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.040]   Right.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.520]   I mean, if I put the 6 Plus in my back pocket,
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.880]   first of all, someone's just going
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.720]   to steal it because it's just sticking out of the pocket.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.080]   But also, it's just going to crush if I
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.560]   were stupid enough to sit down on it.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.000]   But to wear his other phones at a little more compact,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.600]   they'd probably slide around.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.520]   And you know--
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.960]   Well, and this comes up because iPhone users
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.880]   have had a little phone that you could put in your back pocket.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.440]   And all of a sudden, they have this giant phone
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.280]   and they haven't changed their habits much.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.040]   So get a man purse or a woman purse
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.680]   and put it in there because otherwise you're going to squish it.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.840]   And I would say the 6 even will be prone to that a little bit.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.080]   It seems to bend right where the battery ends internally
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.400]   and the volume rockers begin.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.680]   That seems to be a very particular inflection point.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.520]   Yeah, that makes sense, right?
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.040]   Great.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.360]   The iPhone 6 is a good looking phone.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.360]   It reminds me of the HTC One, the M8 a little bit,
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.480]   that band across the back.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.000]   Yes.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.760]   It really looks like that.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.760]   And I love that phone.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.680]   But it's thinner.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.360]   Yeah, and it looks really thin.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.880]   So you got the Moto X and you've got the iPhone.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.880]   So what's--
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.600]   You know, me, I thought the Moto X was the best phone of the year
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.280]   last year, even though it didn't spec-wise compete
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.440]   with some of the other really high-end phones,
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.000]   including the ones that we use, the OnePlus One.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.160]   But I always felt like the Moto X was my phone.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.320]   The other ones were ones I was using.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.600]   But this was my personal phone.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.680]   And I think it's going to be the same with this one,
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.440]   especially since it smells like a men's club.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.960]   No, the high-end kind.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.800]   Not the sleazy--
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.560]   Yeah, not the sleazy kind.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.440]   It smells like leather chairs and cigars.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.640]   Gentlemen's club.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.800]   A gentleman.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   That's even worse.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.280]   Yeah, that's bad too, isn't it?
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.280]   That doesn't work either.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.600]   They spoiled the name, Gentleman's Club.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.120]   And I like the speech features on the Moto X. I--
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.960]   Sorry.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.200]   I'm going to have to change it to Jarvis.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.960]   Well, no, that won't work either.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.160]   And now they've got infrared sensors on the corner.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.400]   So when it's doing the sleep thing,
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.280]   you can wave over it.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:21.920]   I'll put it here.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.280]   I'll put it to sleep, and I'll show you.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.560]   So it's sleeping the screens off.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.360]   But if I wave over, it'll show me the time.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.360]   And if I have any notifications,
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.160]   they'll be available as well.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.560]   Does it not do--
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.640]   I read that it doesn't do the always-on fading thing,
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.240]   though.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.320]   Is that right?
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.040]   Well, it doesn't.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.520]   It waits till you wave at it, which I think
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.400]   is actually the right thing.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.960]   All right.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.840]   It's easy to wave at it.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.640]   It used to be it would pulse up and down, up and down.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.400]   And I imagine that would kill the battery life somewhat.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.880]   I don't know about battery life,
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.120]   because I literally just got it hours ago.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.400]   One thing I'm not-- because I'm a little concerned about--
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.760]   and maybe somebody in the chat room or somebody
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.760]   watching can fill me in.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.320]   Last year, Motorola, they had this Motorola skip,
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.680]   which was an NFC tag, either on a sticker
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.600]   or a little leather thing you could put on your pocket.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.680]   And you could tap a locked Motorola phone to the skip
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.200]   and say that one I want to unlock.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.880]   Either my skips are broken or it doesn't work with skip
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.480]   anymore.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.640]   I notice it's not in the copy anymore.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.000]   They may have turned that off.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.320]   You could still pair with trusted Bluetooth networks,
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.600]   which is really great.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.640]   And if you have the Moto 360, I'm thinking
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.320]   that's probably one of them.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.640]   So you could say as long as we're in proximity, I'm unlocked.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.560]   I'm not sure that's--
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.320]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.400]   That's really nice.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.640]   Yeah, because locking's a pain.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.840]   And you'd like to use a strong lock instead of just a swipe.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.320]   So if it's easy to unlock with a tap,
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.440]   then that would be pretty cool.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.400]   Screen looks good, not great good.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.920]   It's a super AMOLED like last year.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   But again, higher resolution.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.000]   You know, Drewie's out.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.560]   We'll see.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.800]   I just got it.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.440]   I'm going to London with both it and the iPhone 6.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.160]   Both would be on T-Mobile because T-Mobile offers unlimited
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.640]   international calling and text as well as 2G data for free.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.520]   So that'll be--
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.160]   All right, so you got this 6 unlocked
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.640]   and so you can pop in your T-Mobile card.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.080]   I didn't.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.640]   I got the Verizon 6, but it turns out
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.800]   you can pop in your T-Mobile card.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.320]   Oh.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.360]   Yeah, you know, that was the same thing
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.240]   that happened with me with the iPhones was that I was really
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.200]   surprised about the T-Mobile unlocked.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.080]   And I put my AT&T card in that work fine, which is what I expected.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.000]   But then I threw my Verizon sim into the T-Mobile iPhone
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.560]   and that fell T-E and data.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.960]   And I was all working as well.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.120]   Yeah, I remember you reading about it.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.360]   In fact, you were the one who inspired me to do it.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.760]   And the reason is that the new iPhones have all the bands.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.800]   And Verizon's doing voice over LTE.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.200]   And so everything now is--
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:53.640]   we're rapidly moving out of the battle CDMA versus GSM days.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.800]   Thank goodness.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.240]   Thank goodness.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.320]   That's such a difficult thing to explain to family members
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:58.680]   and stuff.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.760]   I was like, no, no, that's a different thing.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:01.560]   You need this thing.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.880]   I was like, what?
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.200]   You have mental maps of what carriers are what?
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:05.640]   Oh, it's crazy.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.400]   And normal people don't know that.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.040]   And they shouldn't have to.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:13.840]   So due to an FCC ruling when Verizon acquired the LTE bands,
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.160]   they're required to not lock their sim slot.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.240]   So the Verizon phone can be used with a sim from--
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.960]   at least from AT&T and T-Mobile as well as Verizon.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.040]   And also from international carriers,
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.560]   I think, because you've got every band in here.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.320]   Well, and that was the other things.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.520]   I took my old Verizon phone, which was on my iPhone 5S,
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.160]   which was Verizon.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.920]   So I threw my AT&T card into that,
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.040]   which I'd never done before.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.640]   And that completely opened up.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.920]   And it was fine.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.800]   So I was able to get LTE on T-Mobile on the Verizon, which
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.840]   is new, that you couldn't do that before.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.880]   And we'll see how it works in Europe, in England anyway.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.320]   So travel wise, I'm set.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.600]   Yeah, you are.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.080]   You are.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.920]   I want to see some photo comparisons.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:01.560]   You will.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.240]   That's one of the things I'll very likely do.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.440]   I'm also bringing a good camera.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.760]   And that's the other side of it is, while I do use the camera
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.200]   phone a lot, if I'm serious about where I am,
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.360]   I'm going to take a good camera with me.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.520]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.280]   All right.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.160]   So that's the story of the Moto X.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.760]   They did start shipping.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.240]   I changed the name.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:28.240]   And the Moto 360, they are back in stock.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.080]   And those are also shipping, I think, next week.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.360]   And I did order the hint, which is their standard Bluetooth
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:35.960]   earbud.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.720]   But it's designed to do some extra stuff.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.160]   I think it's touch free with Moto X.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.680]   Oh, so when's that come?
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.120]   I'm going to fix this.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.200]   Didn't get that yet.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.400]   I want to call it the her.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.000]   I don't want to--
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   I do do.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   I'm going to say--
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.760]   Oh, let me just say hello, Scarlet.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.800]   What was her name?
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.680]   I can forget now.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.400]   Her name was Samantha.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:53.400]   Samantha.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:53.900]   Samantha.
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.400]   Samantha.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   Samantha.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.400]   Yes.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.400]   No, I don't know.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.200]   I'm like borderline a little creepy if you call the phone Samantha.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.400]   I would like it because actually, if it had Scarlet's voice,
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.960]   because I don't know how you feel Siri's voice I've gotten used to.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.920]   But the Moto X Google Voice is strident.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.880]   Let me-- I'll give you an example.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.400]   Let's get out of this.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.400]   Let me think.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.720]   What am I going to do here?
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.400]   Hello, Moto X.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.440]   What's the weather in Petaluma?
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.720]   Unlock your phone to continue.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:32.920]   It's just a little-- I don't know, a little strident.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.800]   It's 78 degrees and overcast in Petaluma.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.280]   Siri just seems nicer.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.280]   You disagree?
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.280]   Do you agree?
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.880]   It's still a little robotic.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.560]   I think it's difficult to get it kind of softer.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.480]   But I haven't used Siri in a really long time.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.280]   Well, you want to hear Siri these days?
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.440]   I think she's sounding a little bit better.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.320]   I forgot what I do to start saying.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.440]   Oh, I have to press the button.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:05.240]   By the way, I have to be careful on the shows now because if people have their iPhone
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:11.600]   look to the power and you say, hey, Siri, it will actually wake her up and she'll start
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.000]   doing stuff.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.680]   How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.520]   Golden Gate Bridge is 8,981 feet.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.520]   Long.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.520]   Long.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.520]   Long.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.520]   Long.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.520]   Long.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.520]   She seems friendlier.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.520]   Yeah, yeah, she does.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.520]   Interesting.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.520]   And her voice is a little lower.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.520]   Now, we've got to get Cortana into the mix.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.520]   But I--
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.520]   I actually like Cortana's voice.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.040]   So my window's phone is in the other room, so I can't.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.720]   But I actually like-- you have it there.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.720]   There goes Danny.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.720]   He's going to get it.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.720]   Yeah, go ahead and turn it on.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   So he's a big board.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.080]   Can I-- I can upgrade the voice on this, right?
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.480]   I can download better sound.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.440]   So you need to have celebrity voices, right?
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440]   Like you'd have--
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.440]   That's a Tom Tom.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.440]   I used to have--
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.440]   I used to have great celebrity voices on my Tom Tom.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.440]   I had--
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.000]   Or my Tom Tom-- my Tom Tom won versions.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.320]   I had one great because you could have all the-- you could put your own voice and I had
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.800]   my kids do all the turns.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.680]   So they'd be like, go forward, make--
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.680]   Oh, you turn.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.680]   Daddy.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.680]   Go forward, Daddy.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.760]   Actually, whatever it was-- when I would have to do the U-turn, because that was usually
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:20.600]   a sign that I was lost, it would say-- my wife would go instead of saying, do you make
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.840]   a U-turn, it would say, why don't you pull over and ask directions?
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.840]   That's-- that's good.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.840]   I like it.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.840]   So let's hear Cortana.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.840]   You got Cortana?
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.840]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.840]   Okay.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.840]   What do you want her to say?
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.840]   Um--
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.840]   Oh, it's--
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.320]   Oh, I don't know if you'll be able to hear it.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.520]   And if you'll be able to hear it.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.040]   Oh, it doesn't have a speaker?
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.040]   But you-- I don't know if you can hear it through my headset.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.160]   Oh, hold-- just put it right up there.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.320]   Hang on, hang on.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.560]   There we go.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.080]   How big-- how long is the Golden Gate Bridge?
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   [PHONE RINGING]
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.080]   [PHONE RINGING]
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.080]   Oh.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.080]   [PHONE RINGING]
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.080]   Oh.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.080]   How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.080]   [PHONE RINGING]
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.080]   I like the musical tone.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:08.720]   It takes six hours and 51 minutes to drive to Golden Gate Bridge.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.720]   Did you hear that?
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   Yes.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.520]   I guess it'll be six hours to drive there.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.680]   It's not too long.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.680]   Let's go.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.240]   It doesn't sound at all like Cortana and the game.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.240]   No.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.240]   I'm not putting it to herself.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.240]   No.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.640]   They should have gotten Cortana from Halo to voice--
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.640]   ah, I'm so disappointed because I love Cortana and Halo.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.360]   And I know this is like a different Cortana,
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.120]   but I wanted the voice to be the same.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.880]   Ask Cortana what she thinks of Siri.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.160]   Does she say anything about that?
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.960]   Oh, she's got a whole series of things
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.160]   that she does.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.000]   That's one thing that both iPhone and Apple and Microsoft
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.680]   do is there's some personality.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.000]   What do you think about Siri?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.040]   Hard to say.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.160]   So far, our conversations have been kind of one-sided.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:52.840]   She's great.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.640]   I mean, there's inflection.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.040]   Of course, that was prerecorded.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.960]   So that's another thing that Microsoft's doing,
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.240]   which is intelligent.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.600]   These canned speeches-- and this is obviously one--
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.360]   are treated differently than synthesized speeches.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.560]   So that sounded great.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.720]   That sounded great.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.840]   Morgan Freeman would be good.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.080]   Oh, well, someday.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.680]   Ask who Bill Gates is married to.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.760]   Oh.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.240]   Who is Bill Gates married to?
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:32.560]   Bill Gates is currently married to Melinda Gates.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.000]   Well, I don't like that currently, but--
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.240]   I like that currently.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.080]   I like it out there.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.480]   Right now, this is the answer.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.680]   No, I fixed that.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   I'd fix that.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.680]   I would fix that.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.680]   I would fix that.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.320]   It's like that.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.160]   Holy cow.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.880]   She made a Christmas.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.960]   Well, we don't know what's going to happen in the future,
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.120]   but right now--
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.040]   Right now, things are good with Bill and Melinda.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.520]   Just the car, Bill.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.440]   Who is your father?
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:03.880]   Technically speaking, that would be Bill Gates.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.320]   I like that.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.760]   But again, you heard all that inflection technically speaking.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.400]   That's those are prerecorded, obviously.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:13.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.480]   They're not synthesized.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.120]   That's fun.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.400]   All right, enough.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.760]   You know, it's so--
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.600]   you know it is one thing.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.640]   Both Danny and I got kind of speaker's block
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.800]   when we have to think of what to say.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.280]   What should I say?
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.200]   What should I ask her?
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.800]   I think that's kind of a problem with these systems in general.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.720]   Do you ever use voice a lot?
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.920]   I've been using it more if I have something complicated
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.720]   and I want to annoy my wife.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.320]   She's like, this is always like, duh.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.120]   It doesn't do it.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.440]   I'm like, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.680]   She's like, just type it in.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.160]   But no, I was doing it yesterday and I
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.480]   was trying to look up something and I just spewed off
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.280]   a whole bunch of things.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.440]   And it came up with it.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:02.800]   I think this was on Google now.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.320]   If it's something complicated and I
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.400]   think I'm in a quiet environment and I just
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.600]   want a quick answer, I use it a lot more for commands
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.800]   that I'm really confident will work.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.080]   Like, it's very rare for me to set my alarm clock by hand.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:16.440]   I'm on--
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:16.720]   Yes.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.080]   --set my alarm clock 6 AM.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:18.560]   That's a great exam.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.200]   I set the alarm for 6 AM.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.200]   It's so easy.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:21.720]   It's so easy.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   It's time in the sleep.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.000]   It's great.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   I agree.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.800]   That timers-- in fact, I use--
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.000]   Five hours and reminders, yeah.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.960]   I use the Android Wear watch to do that.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.400]   And those are really good examples
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.600]   of something you could do.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.800]   Much more quickly with voice than you could do.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.720]   But searches and things like, how do I get here and stuff like that?
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.560]   I guess navigation is pretty good.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:40.520]   Navigation is good.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.880]   I do while I'm cooking while my hands are red or covered
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.200]   in breadcrumbs, set a reminder, how many cups
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.160]   and whatever, that kind of thing.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.880]   But not as much as I thought I would.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.680]   I thought the watch would make me do it more.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.960]   I really just still use the watch just to thumbs
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.680]   their notifications and dismiss them.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.840]   But I have friends who love it and reply to text messages
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.120]   and do the voice commands when they're watch a lot more.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:03.360]   I don't know.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.280]   I feel a little bit like a doofus.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.360]   So maybe that's just me being too self-conscious.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.560]   No, I think you're not alone.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.560]   I think that's part of the issue, isn't it?
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.600]   That's one of the things holding all of this stuff back,
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.600]   is that the voice interface is such a public thing.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.640]   Last night, we saw a new movie called The Drop.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.160]   And I really liked the actor in it.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.480]   But I didn't know who it was.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.880]   And so I used Siri.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.760]   And it worked quite well.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.680]   I said, Siri, who stars in the drop?
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.760]   She told me.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.600]   And one of the names was Tom Hardy.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.320]   And I said, Siri, who is Tom Hardy?
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.760]   And she read his Wikipedia article, including what movies
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.560]   he'd been in.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.000]   That was a very nice, very convenient interaction
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.280]   that worked quite well.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.640]   I think Siri is much better, by the way.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.080]   During a movie that you were watching?
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.000]   I got a few cat calls.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.160]   It's a pop-grant thrown at me.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.440]   But otherwise, I know it was happening.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.960]   It was happening.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.880]   By the way, it's an excellent movie.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.600]   Not what you think.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.520]   It's a really, really good movie.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.560]   Really, really good movie.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.400]   All right.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.000]   One of the reasons I wanted to know who the lead was
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.320]   is because he's so good in this movie.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.800]   Here comes Google 2.0.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.720]   According to Larry Page, in the future,
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.440]   Google will build cities and airports.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.440]   That line in the verge.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.880]   Anyway, the information-- actually,
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.960]   I should look up the-- I am actually a subscriber.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.960]   So instead of doing the meta reporting,
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.480]   I should actually--
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.760]   Oh, the information thing.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.440]   Yeah, it was good.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.320]   The problem with the information is that--
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.640]   it's 400 bucks a year, and a lot of people don't subscribe to it.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.720]   So all that happens is all the other--
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.040]   the verge just repeats it.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.480]   And all the blogs are important.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.000]   I kid you not.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.240]   My renewal thing for the information is on my screen.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.560]   It must have been a year because we need you to renew.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.240]   I renew.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.320]   Jessica Elasin deserves our support because I think they
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.400]   do a great job.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.240]   But is it 400 dollars worth great?
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:55.720]   I don't know.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.760]   100 bucks a year.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.440]   That's a pretty-- yeah.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.000]   And especially since you can read pretty much everything
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.720]   in-- or listen to Twit because I regurgitate.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:13.560]   Anyway, Amir Afrati, who has excellent contacts at Google,
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.920]   wrote the piece, Google 2.0.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.640]   So what does this mean?
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.280]   So, OK, Google's going to build cities and airports.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.240]   I mean, many a time I've been sitting on the tarmac,
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.800]   wishing that Google could point its smarts at making
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.760]   airports more efficient.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.000]   I just don't know what it would look like.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.040]   So maybe they could just make the security checkpoint more
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:37.560]   efficient.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.840]   Maybe they'd have to put your thing through the thing.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.640]   They could split into two areas.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.560]   I mean, God.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.200]   But OK, let's redesign the entire of the airport.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.840]   So this comes Amir and his co-author, Hunter
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.360]   Walk have combined a variety of sources.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.400]   This is in an interview they did with him.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.240]   But what I thought was kind of interesting,
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.520]   this Google 2.0 thing, which is absolutely happening.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.160]   Page cleared out space on his floor.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.080]   He has his own floor.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.800]   And at Google headquarters to oversee
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.240]   a series of workshops run by Google's vice president of business
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.760]   operations, Kristen Kill.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:21.400]   Apparently-- OK, this feels like that there might
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.120]   be between Larry and Sergey kind of something going on.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:30.040]   Because Sergey basically runs Google X. That's his R&D lab.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.760]   Apparently, Larry wants to start his R&D lab
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.480]   that he would oversee personally.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.640]   Some call it Google Y.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.640]   I wonder if it's like, Larry's getting all the fun projects.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.880]   I need my own.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.880]   And that does not bode well for a company.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.480]   When you've got the two founders, not feuding exactly.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.600]   But in a rivalry--
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.320]   Yeah, and for listeners, it's not Y-W-H-Y,
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.280]   although you might ask that.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.280]   It's not good.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.400]   It's a letter of the line.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.200]   Although I didn't read it so much like, oh,
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.080]   Sergey, you get to have all the fun with Google X.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.400]   I want to have Google Y so I can have fun.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.240]   I read it more like, Google X is doing these really long-term
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.320]   things that are not going to immediately change stuff.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:18.480]   So Google Glass is still lurking out there,
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.880]   but that's probably the closest thing
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.480]   that you have to a dramatic change that a consumer might do.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.360]   Isn't Glass even Sergey's thing?
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.800]   Well, yeah, but I mean, that would call it a Google--
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.720]   Yeah, I think it's still under Google X.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.680]   I could be wrong, though.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.840]   It might have migrated out.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.920]   But like the auto-driving cars, we're
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.560]   like five years, 10 years away from that really being
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.080]   a type of thing.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.480]   And my impression from the article
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.360]   was that Larry would like to have a Google Y to make moonsh--
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.600]   maybe not moonshots, but I don't know--
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.520]   Some orbital shots.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.880]   Shorter moonsh.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.200]   So Google X is on a 10-year time frame.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.400]   Yeah, but the idea-- although redesigning airports
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.320]   is not exactly something that happens tomorrow.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.040]   Yeah, but--
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:28:59.480]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.440]   This is even longer-term programs in Google X.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.360]   It seems to me like Larry's just obsessed
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.600]   with different problems than Sergey.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.600]   Maybe that's it.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.000]   We saw that-- have we seen Larry wearing glass in public?
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.240]   I mean, that's always been a surrogate thing.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.960]   Even with the IOs, we're sort of--
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.800]   the different years were led by different founders.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.880]   And we heard a lot from glass.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.960]   And Sergey was wearing glass.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.800]   And we had the crazy demo with the sky divers.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.640]   And then the next year, it was run by Larry.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.000]   And it was a lot different.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.160]   We didn't hear a lot about that.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.800]   He did the Q&A. It's kind of a different tone.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.400]   I hope it's not a competition.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.080]   And more just--
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.280]   these are just two different people
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.480]   with sort of different ideas of what the long-term problems
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.360]   to focus on are.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.080]   Although maybe if they're not on the same page--
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.400]   ha-ha, that's a bad thing.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.400]   I don't know.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.120]   Well, you're right.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.280]   If they have different portfolios, different goals,
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.880]   then it's not a rivalry.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.320]   Then it's complementary.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.000]   And maybe that's it.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.040]   Friday, some of the Google 2.0 workshops fizzled.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.160]   Say people briefed about the event or the effort.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.920]   One involved Mr. Page's desire to build up a subscription
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.240]   business so that Google wouldn't be so dependent on advertising.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.480]   Paid Gmail, for instance.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.400]   Page even discussed with colleagues, the notion
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.800]   that ad-supported services can sometimes be lower quality
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.200]   than paid offerings.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.960]   I guess Google apps is a paid offering.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.880]   That would be the example.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.960]   The problem, of course, is paid services have smaller reach.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.520]   And a Friday, Amir writes, and Google's all about reach.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:28.600]   Another Google 2.0 project involved location.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.320]   Larry determined that Google in the future
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.520]   should know a person's precise location down to the inches,
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.600]   not just that they're in a particular room or store.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.040]   That way, people might be able to know who else is in a room
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.400]   with them.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.000]   This is what Apple's iBeacon does, by the way.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   It describes exactly where you are in the room,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.120]   and that's useful for merchants, because they
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.360]   can have different things triggered on your phone,
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.600]   depending what you're standing in front of.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:54.640]   But by knowing which aisle a person was at inside of store,
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.600]   for instance, Google could potentially
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.080]   provide helpful information to the shopper
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:58.680]   about what's there.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.880]   This is exactly what iBeacon does.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.440]   Google could also let people care their smartphone
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.000]   and other device adds information.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.280]   Hey, I got some information for you.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.920]   You want a pizza?
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.040]   You know what that pizza--
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.080]   No, that pizza.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.480]   You've already got pizza at home.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:26.560]   So it's a great article and an interesting article.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.840]   New airports, he thinks that, for instance,
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.960]   ELOP's plan to create a hyperloop railroad
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.440]   between San Francisco and LA, so that instead of six hours
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.800]   and three minutes to get here, Danny could be here in seconds.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.560]   He thinks that's a terrible idea, but he says,
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.320]   planes work.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.680]   Why don't we have better airports, better flights.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.960]   A Friday writes in the comments, it didn't make the cut,
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.960]   but Larry Page also thinks Wall Street is broken.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.960]   Maybe a better way to do finance.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.080]   That's obvious, right?
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.320]   When you got a lot of money and you got a lot of power,
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:01.400]   and both these guys do, I think it's appropriate for them
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.120]   to think about it, as long as they don't stray too far
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.280]   from the business.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.840]   Pay stray all over from the business.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.760]   Well, yeah.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.880]   I guess the business runs itself nowadays, right?
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.720]   Google 1.0 is fine.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.800]   It depends on how you define the business, right?
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   Well, you got the auto-tour, not going to keep it on anything.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.160]   Cars don't make a whole lot of things.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.000]   There's not a turn-through.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.360]   It's not the business, right?
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.440]   What's that?
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.280]   Autonomous vehicles are not the business.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.160]   No, but they'll pour the money into it.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:36.120]   The business, sadly, is still largely people do these searches
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.080]   and they click on these ads.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:37.600]   Ads.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.440]   I mean, sadly, because that's much of a business.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.000]   Good business.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.160]   Search ads.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.680]   But I always joke every now and then on Twitter
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.200]   that all those self-driving cars are being paid for
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.640]   by a messothelium ads.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.560]   That's what's bringing you to the future.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.240]   That instruction settlement, and who knows what else.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.480]   That's true in any business, though.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.440]   I mean, we have our bread and butter shows,
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.320]   and those subsidize the newer shows that are not
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.160]   yet making any money.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.680]   I mean, that's how businesses work, right?
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.200]   Very common, right?
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:09.720]   A lot of businesses.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.680]   I reinvest 75%.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:17.240]   You know, we just did another article yesterday
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.480]   looking at the arbitrage that goes on with Google and say
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.480]   ask.com.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.640]   Ask.com CEO is about to run a counter saying, no, it's not
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.120]   like that.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.880]   But you search for something on Google,
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.560]   like what is messothelium or something?
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.240]   And you get these ads from other sites like ACT
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.800]   that when you click on them, jump you from Google search
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:42.240]   results to their search results, which have more Google ads on.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:46.320]   And it's all this sort of like--
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.840]   there's a lot of money being made off of stuff that is still
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.800]   very cruddy.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.840]   And yet it goes further up the chain
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.080]   into producing these things that seem very all pure and all
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:58.960]   clean or whatever.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.400]   And I'm perhaps too jaded or perhaps it's just
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.000]   but I've been watching too much of the wire.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.800]   Oh, you're going through a wire marathon.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.040]   Well, they'll be watching.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.960]   I'm in the middle of the series.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.480]   So everything's very fresh.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.480]   Which year are you in right now?
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.560]   Yeah, which season are you in?
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.880]   Which year are you in?
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.480]   Literally in the middle of season three,
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.320]   like an episode five or something.
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.680]   Three, was that the school one?
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.080]   I don't know.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.280]   They've just moved everybody into hamster dam.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.160]   Oh, hamster dam.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.160]   Oh, hamster dam.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:27.520]   The hamster dam.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.160]   OK, all right.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:28.880]   That's a good one.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:29.880]   No, that's a great job.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:30.520]   That's a great year.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.360]   Because there's the boats this season to--
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.200]   The first season is--
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:34.800]   Yeah, containers.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.320]   And then--
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.560]   I thought the third season was school,
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.200]   but maybe the fourth season is school.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   School?
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.040]   And then the newsroom has allowed me to show.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.160]   I'm waiting for the newsroom.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.360]   So I knew that's coming.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.240]   No, but hamster dam, that's a good one.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.800]   Hamster dam is a great one.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.240]   That might be the best year.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.680]   However, now I'm going to-- everything you're going to say
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.840]   is going to be filtered through that.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.720]   So now I understand.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:35:00.080]   I'm glad you gave us the disclaimer.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.480]   That's a great show.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.880]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.360]   When we come back, yeah, it's obviously-- obviously.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.000]   When we come back, we're going to do the change log.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.520]   Find out more.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.160]   There's lots more going on at the Google.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:15.680]   But first, OK, so Glenn, who is our TV expert here,
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:21.400]   Glenn Rubenstein in the network says that season four
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.080]   is the best year.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.240]   I didn't like the newspaper season.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.880]   But Glenn says that season four is the one to look forward to.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.200]   Wow, you've already--
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.480]   That's the school one.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.080]   Is that the school one?
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.800]   Is that the school and school one broke my heart?
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.400]   Anyway.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.760]   Oh, no, I got those spoilers.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.160]   Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:40.840]   Sorry, sorry.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.400]   Those spoilers.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.160]   Season four, season three is the second best.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.920]   So you're in for two excellent seasons.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:52.040]   According to Glenn.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:56.160]   Is Glenn at home or is he over there typing?
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:56.960]   He's over there.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.080]   All right, which is-- never mind.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:00.720]   Our show today--
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.640]   On the Wikipedia page.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.080]   Yeah, OK, you have time.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.960]   Go Wikipedia while I talk about treats for your dog.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.080]   You don't have a dog, do you?
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:08.880]   I'm allergic.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.600]   I have allergies, unfortunately.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.640]   Danny, do you have a puppy?
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.320]   No, we have two guinea pigs, that's it.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.400]   One of the best parts of the drop, which
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.640]   is a great-- the movie I was talking about earlier--
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.400]   is the dog.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.760]   There's a great dog in it.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.920]   Really sweet looking puppy.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.880]   And I wanted to just-- I wanted to send him a bark box.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.640]   It's not too late.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.200]   Bark boxes, treats.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.440]   Yes, treats for doggies.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.720]   We got our new box box, Bark Box with jerky burgers.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.560]   Dog treats, baby, with real duck.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.320]   Who wouldn't like that?
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.880]   These are from Yum Z's.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.760]   Smoke house-- so you see us talk about these boxes that
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.680]   come in the mail.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.840]   The bark box comes every month, but it's not for you.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.600]   It's for your doggie.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.000]   Indigo, smoke house strips.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.840]   Oh, Ozzy would love this.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.040]   Yummy.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:55.040]   Greening cuts, bacon for dogs, pure pork, fresh meat,
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.560]   vacuum sealed, and then when you get a treat--
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.080]   that's good.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.960]   That looks like a Green Bay Packers shirt.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.520]   That's good.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.760]   That's a little doggie chew.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.680]   And then what is this?
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.560]   Crunchy rabbit chews.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.320]   That's good for his teeth, keeping clean.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.680]   And a pennant from Berkeley University of California,
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.680]   at Berkeley.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.080]   Bark, bark, bark.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.400]   It's our Bark Box every month.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.480]   Treats for your doggie.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:26.160]   Bark Box is a wonderful way to celebrate your four-legged
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.320]   friend.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.200]   I think every dog should have a bark box in the mail.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.320]   It's a monthly subscription, high quality, fun and healthy
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.200]   treats, toys, and goodies.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.880]   Four to six awesome, full-sized products, everything from--
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.200]   well, you just saw mine, Bark Box.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.400]   I just got innovative toys and gadgets
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.400]   to all natural, healthy treats and more.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.440]   Each box is different.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.880]   It's a great way to discover treats your dog really likes,
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.960]   toys he or she really likes.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.320]   All the treats are US and Canada only.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.040]   I'm not saying anything, but that's
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.520]   where you want to get your treats from.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.120]   Choose or made in the US, Canada, South America, Australia,
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.760]   and New Zealand.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.840]   Good stuff.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.360]   Edible products do not include rawhide or anything
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.840]   processed with formaldehyde.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.120]   See, they really care about dogs.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.600]   The Bark Box folks love their dogs,
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.080]   and they want to love your dog, too.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.760]   No glycerin, no wheat, no gluten, no soy corn,
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.800]   or fillers, minimal processing, and whenever possible,
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.040]   organic.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.160]   Rest assured, everything is paw tested.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:28.000]   I love this site by the Bark Box office pups.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.800]   Go to Bark Box, B-A-R-K-B-O-X.com/twig,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.640]   and click Get Started.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.000]   You'll choose the size of your dog
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.400]   in between four different subscription plans.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.800]   No, I'm sorry, Josh.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.440]   They don't have a bird box.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.960]   Josh says, what about my birdie?
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.160]   No, you got to get a Bark Box.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:51.320]   Aussie-- do you have the B-roll of Aussie
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.880]   with the last month's Bark Box?
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:57.560]   We-- Burke-- we want to call it the Burke Box,
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.920]   because Burke gets the box and feeds it all to Aussie.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.160]   And Aussie loves his Bark Box.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.200]   Oh, is that a happy puppy?
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.320]   He is so happy.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.040]   He loves his Bark Box.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.400]   Hey, by the way, Bark Box also gives 10% of the revenue
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.680]   to local rescues and shelters across the US and Canada.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:21.920]   You can save 20% right now when you sign up at barkbox.com/twig.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.360]   Barkbox.com/twig.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.440]   Aussie loves it.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.360]   He's so cute that Aussie.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.800]   Isn't he a sweetie?
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.560]   He is.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.840]   I got to get him a chew those chew toys, though,
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.360]   because his teeth brushed.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:35.960]   The veterinarian--
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.280]   And those are the ones you put the peanut butter in?
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:40.400]   Well, you need a dog.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.040]   I'm sorry that you're allergic.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:42.920]   I love them.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:47.280]   I love them, but I just can't breathe around them.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.280]   That's not good.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:49.760]   He's not good.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.680]   No, Aussie, I was actually good with it.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.040]   I react differently to different dogs.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.200]   I should find one that I can't--
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.240]   There are hypoallergenic dogs.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:56.760]   There are.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.280]   There are.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.320]   It would be great for the baby.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.640]   Oh, you're going to get one.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.960]   That's why we have Aussie.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.600]   And the kids had no interest.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.920]   The kids said, oh, that's nice.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.560]   You got us a puppy.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.080]   See you.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.240]   Bye.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.720]   So I have Aussie.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.520]   You have Aussie.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.680]   But I love him.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.200]   So it's OK.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.640]   It's OK.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.960]   Barkbox.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.480]   Sebastian Thrun has left in his role
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.640]   as a Google Vice President and fellow.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.920]   He was the founder of Google X and did some really
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:31.480]   interesting stuff, including Udacity, which
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.480]   was his online learning startup.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.120]   And so apparently, this has been on his LinkedIn page
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.360]   since August, but somebody finally told TechCrunch.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.320]   He does have an advisory role in his LinkedIn post.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.920]   He says, well, I'm now just an advisor.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.720]   My enthusiasm for Google X is as high as ever.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:55.960]   But you know, I figure with Udacity taking off.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.600]   That made sense.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.720]   Oh, so that's his startup that he's working on.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.880]   Something can goop.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.480]   Yeah, Google spokesperson said, as the co-founder of Google
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.760]   X and our self-driving car project, Sebastian
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.160]   made huge advances in computer science and robotics
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.960]   that have paved the way for autonomous driving technology.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.800]   In his role as an advisor to Google X
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.440]   over the past couple of years, he's
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.480]   provided invaluable inspiration and perspective
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.520]   at a variety of projects.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:24.880]   In Udacity, Sebastian has his own more than a full-time job,
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.760]   moonshot to take, and we wish him well.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.320]   That's very nice.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.320]   That's a really nice farewell.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:30.640]   So obviously--
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.440]   That doesn't ask for a while.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.800]   Yeah, obviously.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.720]   It was all OK.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.840]   It was all good between them.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.400]   If you're Google, this happens all the time.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.920]   This is normal.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.520]   Yeah, I mean, when these stories happen, people are like,
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.000]   oh, is something wrong?
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:45.840]   Does something happen?
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.560]   But I think it was in Stephen Levy's book,
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.320]   where he interviewed Marissa Meyer, who ran that manager
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:52.880]   program.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.440]   And she said, we want people who want to leave Google eventually
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.600]   because we hire entrepreneurial types.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.840]   And entrepreneurial types want to build their own thing.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.920]   That's kind of a problem that you're facing, too, right?
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.840]   Leo, to some degree?
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.960]   You know, it's like the best people want the ones
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.320]   who take initiative and want to do everything
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.400]   and want to do it their way.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.160]   And this happens.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.760]   I don't know if you have this in the changelog,
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.640]   but I'm glad Danny's here to explain it.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.560]   Structured snippets.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.040]   What are-- they're now live.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:20.720]   I know that.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.360]   I know that.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.440]   Yeah, well, I'm looking at a search engine land article.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.480]   Mr. Carter.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.640]   Oh, oh, it's a car.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.640]   What?
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.120]   OK, what are--
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.480]   Do a search for, say, Wonder Woman on Google.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.480]   OK.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.520]   And you will see that you get a description that comes up.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.000]   I'm looking ahead of time.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.360]   This one's coming from Wikipedia.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.520]   And you'll see underneath it, not just
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.640]   are you getting a description with more about Wonder Woman,
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.600]   but underneath the description, you discover
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.200]   her first appearance, her alter ego,
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.040]   who she was created by.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.440]   Why am I not getting this?
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.320]   Look at-- look, you're missing it.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.600]   Go zoom right in on the very first listing.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.360]   OK.
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.520]   Oh, first appearance.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.040]   I'll start coming up.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:58.520]   There you go.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.200]   It's Danny.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.200]   OK.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.440]   And so you can see this for a lot of the superheroes.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.880]   The whole fact somebody was joking--
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.040]   somebody was joking with me on Twitter about how
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.680]   Google making sure that if Google's listing
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.000]   everybody's alter egos, aren't they
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.360]   revealing secret identities?
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.760]   Oh, spoiler alert.
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.320]   Princess Diana of Themesquera.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.320]   Themesquera.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.800]   But what Google is doing is they are understanding that
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.400]   from pages.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:30.000]   They have been doing over the past year to two years now,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.040]   understanding not just that you are searching for words,
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.480]   which are patterns of letters, but that you're searching
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:40.240]   for people, places, and things that are connected to facts.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.040]   And so this is Google saying, well, we understand that
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.920]   Wonder Woman actually has a thing known as an alter ego.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.000]   And in fact, we know what that fact is.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.360]   We know when she first appeared.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.480]   And they're getting that information by automatically
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.360]   extracting it from web pages.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.520]   And it's getting off the information.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.000]   Is it all from Wikipedia or is-- are they getting--
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.160]   It's not just from Wikipedia.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.760]   You can see it from like--
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.640]   let's try like Nikon.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.680]   Try to do a search for Nikon D7100.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:12.160]   And then you should see like the third or second listing.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.760]   You'll see that it pulled off of this page,
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.480]   like the sensor resolution type, the wave of battery,
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.800]   display size.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.040]   So it's in the page--
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.480]   so this is a DC review article where they do list
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.200]   these kinds of specs.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.720]   If you look at the page, you will probably find that these
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.400]   facts are on there.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.040]   But these facts may be also extracted from other pages.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.280]   And Google's starting to learn that these are facts
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.000]   from doing extraction.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.120]   So it's all part of the stuff that Google has been doing to
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.320]   have facts and just present facts when you search.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.960]   Another example, if you type in, this is before--
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.880]   so what you're seeing there with the Wonder Woman stuff,
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.280]   that is structured data being inserted right next to a
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.080]   listing.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.440]   But then other kinds of things that are related to this do
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.520]   search for like reset iPhone.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.000]   A lot of people doing that today, actually.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:02.560]   That's not due to that.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.640]   How do I--
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.040]   type in, how do I reset my iPhone?
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.520]   Let's see if that one does it.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.320]   So you know, is it better to do--
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.000]   I was searching for something today, and I couldn't find it
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.600]   giving it just basically words.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.840]   I think it was Moto X. And then I wanted to know if the
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:24.720]   skip worked in this-- so a 2014 Moto X skip.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.200]   And then I thought-- shut up.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:30.800]   And then I thought, maybe if I say, does the skip work with
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.680]   the 2014 Moto X would be better?
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.240]   Is that me or is that a reasonable thing to do with Google?
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.240]   Well, in the past, those kinds of searches weren't good to do
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:44.560]   because you're searching in a way that somebody probably
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.320]   hadn't written it.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.520]   Like, how does people had written stuff that way?
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.880]   They just explained it.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.400]   Then the search engine just got smarter.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.840]   But then the content forms got smarter and started writing
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.080]   all the content designed for the people who were doing those
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.320]   kinds of searches.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.760]   And now what's happening is Google itself has become
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.680]   smarter and is understanding this kind of
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.320]   conversational question better.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.520]   That is understanding how to parse it so that when you go
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.920]   in there and say something like, how old is Barack Obama,
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.120]   it understands you're looking for that person, you're looking
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.560]   for an age, and in fact, that I have the exact answer.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.920]   And so I can provide it out to you.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:21.200]   So that really changes--
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.280]   so you're confirming what I kind of observed.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.160]   But it changes the way I had used to think of a search engine.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.400]   I used to really think that the best way to get the result
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.640]   you wanted would be to actually match a string of text
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.360]   in the page.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.400]   And if you can't do that, then to use, as I did originally,
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.280]   skip Moto 2014 in any order.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.800]   But knowing that the best result would be one that combined
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.920]   all three of those.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.280]   So kind of trying to out guess what Google's going to do
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.240]   with a three.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.080]   Yeah, and so these days now, you don't have to try--
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.600]   I mean, that used to be good advice.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.400]   And I used to teach people on how to search.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:00.600]   And I would tell them, give them those kinds of techniques.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.120]   Like, try to think about the person who's
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.840]   writing the material and how you think they would do it.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.680]   But these days, really, just search,
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.160]   however you feel comfortable searching.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.920]   In terms of the search engine, we'll probably figure it out.
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.280]   To give you that other example, try
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.320]   to search for how to reset iPhone again.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.320]   OK.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.200]   Yeah, in fact, I'm getting the answer
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.920]   instead of the search result.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.160]   You get a big box with steps.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.120]   So that's another example of structured data
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.360]   and direct answers.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.680]   And this goes a bit further.
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.040]   This is becoming a concern for the content owners, right?
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:29.400]   Because--
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.200]   Well, I was just about to say that.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.600]   Because I don't have to now click on this link at imore.com.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.240]   I got what I wanted.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.240]   Exactly.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:41.200]   And so as Google's doing more of this,
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.560]   you've got content owners that are thinking like, hey,
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.360]   is this going to steal traffic away from me?
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.080]   And you're giving me credit.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:55.120]   But in the past, people were happy to be lifted by Google
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:57.520]   because they clearly got lots of traffic,
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.320]   because there wasn't enough just giving away for free.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.160]   And so that's part of the debate that's going on.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.240]   And this structured--
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.800]   I want to say, structured settlement.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.080]   But these structured snippets are perhaps more of that.
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.400]   Like, you don't necessarily need to go to those pages
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.160]   if you were looking for some of this information.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.800]   You just did the Google search and you were done.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.520]   And we'll--
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.520]   You're staying on Google's--
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.120]   That debate's going to continue on.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.000]   I understand what Google's thinking is here, though,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.520]   because they're trying to serve their customer.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.360]   And if a customer says, how do I reset an iPhone
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.680]   and you know the ants, or you should just put it there?
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.200]   And agreed.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.000]   And if they can provide it, that's great.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.600]   The problem is they're trying to serve their customer,
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.480]   even though they don't actually know anything themselves.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.520]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.280]   They're serving them with somebody else's content.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:41.880]   They're serving--
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.480]   And that is what their entire business model has been
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:47.360]   built off of, right?
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.400]   And again, to go back to those auto driving cars,
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.760]   and everything you want to go to at Google,
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.640]   the bulk of their funding comes off the fact
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.440]   that people search on Google and click on ads.
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.600]   And the content that surrounds those search results
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.280]   comes from other people.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.560]   And those other people have been happy to supply that,
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.840]   because the balance has been very favorable for a lot of them.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.880]   They get traffic that comes back to them.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.880]   But as Google starts to say more and more, hey, you know what?
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:15.760]   We don't even need to send you to these websites.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.960]   We already know the answer.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:17.840]   Here it is.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:20.880]   Yes, that's good for the user, but it's not so good for the websites.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.800]   And it hasn't come along with Google necessarily licensing
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.440]   that information from anybody, because Google's like, hey,
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.320]   that just backs.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:32.000]   And this is what the publishers and Rupert Murdoch are upset about.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.240]   It's here.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.560]   I just searched for how to make Jell-O shots.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:38.880]   I'm telling you, this is serving your audience right there
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.560]   in a medium bolster together the Jell-O and boiling water.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.120]   This is like--
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.480]   Well, this is the Hattie E. Sushi issue, right?
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.480]   Yes.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.480]   That we talked about last week.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:48.480]   It would come up.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.480]   I was trying to get it to come up against.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.480]   You could see it.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.480]   Well, they killed it.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:52.480]   They pulled it.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.480]   Here's one.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.480]   How to make Jell-O shots.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.480]   There you go.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.480]   If you go to-- you can see this example.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.480]   If you go to--
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   You must have--
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   I think Danny spends a lot of time trying queries.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.480]   You don't want to know the stuff I try.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.880]   I always feel like I'm going to get, like, abreasted for the things on my computer
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:11.480]   that I've searched for.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.480]   It's terrible.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:20.480]   But do a search for how to eat sushi and then see if you find my article coming up.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.040]   Yeah, because you wrote about it.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:27.080]   So do the search for on Google for how to eat sushi and you should just get a set of
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.080]   search results.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.080]   I do now.
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:30.080]   I get YouTube.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.080]   I get wiki how.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.480]   Then click on my listing because my listing should be in there.
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.280]   It says like the NSFW.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:38.480]   Do you see my article in those listings?
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.280]   Yes, there it is.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.280]   And not safe for work advice on how to eat sushi, right?
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:46.280]   Roll down a bit further and you will see what Google was showing.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.280]   Right.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:51.880]   And you see that when you read it the fourth-- the fourth tip on how to eat sushi was like,
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.880]   you know, and don't shake the soy sauce off.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.880]   That's like shaking your wanker in public.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:02.080]   Which isn't exactly correct, British English for shaking your, you know, thing.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.080]   That's what they mean.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:07.480]   And it's because-- so you're like, really Google, you're kind of giving that advice.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:08.880]   It's not that bad.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.680]   I've heard worse.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.680]   And-- but the reason is it's because that's not Google's advice.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:14.680]   Right.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:18.480]   That was Google extracting the advice from someone else and offering it up as a direct
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.480]   answer.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.480]   Right.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:25.680]   And the concern really is down the line if Google just takes all the answers and isn't
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:29.120]   giving enough back to support the sites that are producing them, the sites that produce
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.480]   them no longer exist.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:31.480]   And guess what?
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.480]   Then Google has no answers to provide.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.480]   Here I'd search for--
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.580]   Unless the store is small and some database but they, you know, things change--
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:38.580]   Right.
[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:39.580]   People need to make content.
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:40.580]   They want to make content.
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:41.580]   And they want to make it.
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:42.580]   And they want to make it up.
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:43.580]   And they want to make it up.
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.580]   So they want to make it up.
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:45.580]   And they want to make it up.
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.580]   And they want to make it up.

[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:59.580]   >> Well, if you're wondering about what's going on with Google Plus these days, Google
[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:00.580]   isn't saying much.
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:04.580]   But at least one new change might be an indicator.
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:10.580]   Google is no longer requiring new Gmail users to connect their account to a Google Plus
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:11.580]   profile.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:17.580]   So when you sign up for a brand new Gmail account, you'll get to a page which says create your
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:18.580]   public Google Plus profile.
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:21.580]   And there is a no thanks option.
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.580]   >> That's wild.
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:24.580]   >> There you go.
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:29.580]   I remember when everyone was up in arms because you had to create a Google Plus profile.
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:34.580]   If you had a Google account period, this is kind of a big turnaround.
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:35.580]   >> I think so.
[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:36.580]   >> But there you go.
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:39.580]   Google Plus profiles no longer required for Gmail.
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:46.580]   Another nice, I think I would say user friendly change, Google Play is going to start listening
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:49.580]   in-app purchase price ranges for apps.
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:55.580]   So starting September 30th, Google start to display the range of prices and app can charge
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.580]   within app purchases on the Play Store.
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:01.580]   >> That's because they lost the court battle in Europe, I remember.
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:02.580]   >> Exactly.
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.580]   Yeah, this is no doubt response to that, right?
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:09.580]   There's a dust up over children racking up in app purchases and their parents footing the
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:10.580]   bill.
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:14.580]   So this is nice because when you download an app currently on Google Play, it just says
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:21.580]   in app purchase, you don't know how much or if you can use the app without buying an
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:23.580]   app purchase or if not.
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:28.580]   So this is a nice step toward letting consumers know what they're getting into.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:31.580]   >> Actually, Leo, you could probably speak to this.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:35.580]   Chrome for iOS now added support for app extensions.
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:40.580]   And this is a new iOS 8 thing, which I actually haven't had time to play with very much.
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:45.580]   But so if you've got Chrome installed in iOS to share a website from Chrome to another
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:51.580]   app, you tap the hamburger menu, then you select share and then you can send pages to
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:53.580]   any app that supports extensions.
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:55.580]   Now, extensions are new in iOS 8, right, Leo?
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:59.580]   >> Yeah, in fact, there are a couple of ways they're used as a little surprising.
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:03.580]   For instance, the password managers, like one password and I just learned LastPass does this as
[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:07.580]   well, will add themselves to the share menu.
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:12.580]   But when you share, you're not really sharing, you're going to get a password, which is kind
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:13.580]   of cool.
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:17.580]   Before with Apple, I'll go back to the share menu.
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:22.580]   And this is, of course, with many Apple apps, all the Apple apps and many third party apps
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:27.580]   and the good news is Chrome has added this because of the capability, which was added to iOS 8.
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:33.580]   Previously, you could basically email Twitter, Facebook, you could message.
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:36.580]   Now, you've got a, this is just like Android, right?
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:42.580]   So as you add apps, this list will get longer and you could turn it off or on.
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:45.580]   So you get a share capabilities, which is great.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.580]   >> Right, so similar to Android's Intense.
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.580]   >> Very much like Intense.
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:56.580]   I'm not clear because on one of my phones, it seems like the list is automatically populated
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:58.580]   and quite long.
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:03.580]   I'm not sure exactly when it does that and when it just gives you a chance to turn it on.
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:07.580]   I don't know, but yeah, this is very much like what Android does.
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.580]   The Android does it automatically.
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:12.580]   And in fact, that's a detriment because you can get an awfully long list.
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:17.580]   >> You can get a very long list and then you have apps that help you manage the list, right?
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:18.580]   >> Right.
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:25.580]   >> Extensions are iOS 8's response to all of the capabilities, the inner app capabilities
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:26.580]   of Android.
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:32.580]   Apple, which has traditionally sealed each application hermetically, is now finally letting applications
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:33.580]   go.
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:34.580]   That's huge.
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:35.580]   >> Right.
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:36.580]   >> And they've done it right to their credit.
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:39.580]   They understood that that was a security risk and they didn't want to do it.
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:43.580]   They've done it now in a way that's much more judicious and just one step at a time.
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:44.580]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:46.580]   >> Yeah, it's very nice that you can turn them on and off.
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:47.580]   >> Yeah, things like that.
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:49.580]   >> But by default, that's very nice.
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:53.580]   Life Hacker reports that apps like LastPass seem to work some of the time, but not all of
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:54.580]   time.
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.580]   Apps have to update iOS 8 to enable the hooks to share.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:00.580]   So you might not see a whole lot right away.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:05.580]   It sounds like this is still for new and some apps are working out bugs, but nice to see.
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:06.580]   Anyway.
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:09.580]   >> An iOS 8 is very buggy in general.
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:10.580]   >> Is it really?
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:11.580]   >> Oh, God, yeah.
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:12.580]   >> Is it?
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:15.580]   I'm fielding a lot of bug reports about my iOS app.
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:16.580]   >> It's not you.
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:17.580]   >> It's not you.
[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:18.580]   >> It's not me.
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:20.580]   I'm going to tell all my anchors.
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.580]   It's not me.
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:22.580]   >> It's not me.
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:28.580]   >> No, but everybody who does apps for iOS is going to have to address it because there's
[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:29.580]   issues.
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:31.580]   >> Yeah, and it's going to go out to everyone.
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:32.580]   Yeah.
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:33.580]   Or it already has.
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:34.580]   >> Yeah.
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:37.580]   Well, adoption traditionally is very high in iOS.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:39.580]   This one's a little slower than iOS 7.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:41.580]   I think it's 43% now.
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:42.580]   That's still pretty high.
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:43.580]   It's only been a week.
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.580]   >> It's only been a week.
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:46.580]   Wow.
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:52.580]   And then there's the people who have 8.0.1 who won't be reporting bugs for some time now.
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.580]   >> Because they don't have any internet access.
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:56.580]   >> Oh, right.
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:58.580]   This is what you were talking about earlier.
[01:11:58.580 --> 01:11:59.580]   >> Yeah.
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.580]   Actually, there's a -- say again?
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:02.580]   There's a fix.
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:06.580]   >> The update 8.0.1, cut off your internet access.
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:13.060]   >> They cut off your LTE, your voice, on not all, but some iPhone 6 is apparently, and
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:17.580]   it cut off your touch ID, your fingerprint reader.
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:18.580]   But that's all.
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:19.580]   >> The fix is out.
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:20.580]   That's it.
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:21.580]   >> There isn't a fix out.
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:25.420]   They pulled it right -- you know, they pulled it pretty quickly, like within an hour.
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:31.420]   And the fix is kind of a restore your iPhone fix.
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:34.420]   You press the option key and you can reinstall 8.0.
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:35.420]   >> Wow.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.420]   >> Yeah, it's pretty ugly.
[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:39.420]   It's about as ugly as you can get, frankly.
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.420]   >> Sorry, iOS user.
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:42.420]   >> Yeah.
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:43.420]   >> Yeah.
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:44.420]   >> Wow.
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:48.420]   >> Although the last -- last -- last -- last -- >> It will slow down the adoption rate, I
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:49.420]   think.
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:50.420]   >> Yeah.
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:51.420]   >> I think so.
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:52.420]   Go ahead, Danny.
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:57.060]   >> I was just saying MGC where it tweeted something like, good job putting out an update that
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.020]   takes everybody's minds off of Ben Gate.
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:00.020]   >> Yeah.
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:01.020]   Hey, your phone bends, who cares?
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:02.020]   You can't use it now.
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:03.020]   >> I think it's an issue anymore.
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:04.020]   >> Yeah.
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:05.020]   >> Wow.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:06.020]   >> You think they have that in their back pocket?
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:08.020]   Just think this antenna gate happens again.
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:09.020]   >> Yes.
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:10.020]   >> You should just update.
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.020]   >> Unfoldable.
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:12.020]   >> Come up with something that really screws things up.
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.020]   >> Really amazing.
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:14.020]   >> Yeah.
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:15.020]   >> It's amazing.
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:16.020]   >> Yeah.
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:18.660]   All right, last item in the change log, Google Maps update.
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:23.180]   There's in 20 new countries around the world just got navigation in Google Maps.
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:27.860]   The expansion is aimed primarily at navigation coverage in Africa, the Caribbean and South
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:32.460]   America, and there are a few outliers in Nepal and Malta.
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:38.780]   Long list of countries here, which I'm -- my computer is currently loading, Angola, the
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:41.300]   Bahamas, Bolivia, Nepal, Trinidad.
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:44.820]   >> I didn't realize you couldn't navigate the Caribbean.
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.820]   >> That's because you are -- >> Here.
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:48.820]   >> -- an American just like me.
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:49.820]   Yes.
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:51.460]   It was like, oh.
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:55.940]   >> So what did you -- if you're in the Bahamas and you fire up Google Maps, it just says,
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:57.140]   "Well, you're here.
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:58.140]   Good luck getting there."
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:01.780]   >> Yeah, because it was just maps pre-navigation.
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:02.780]   >> Wow.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:03.780]   Wow.
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:06.940]   >> So it was something, but it just wasn't everything that we're used to getting.
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:07.940]   >> Wow.
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:08.940]   Okay.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.580]   >> Sorry, I'm so pixelated.
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:12.980]   >> You're fine.
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:19.860]   And you are Gina Trippani, and that was the Google change log.
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:27.020]   >> So it's funny because as we see the Apple users who have been in their little cocoon
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:33.140]   of Apple, happy, secure, happy land, get these new features like extensions to third-party
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:38.780]   keyboards, the shock and horror with which they're greeting these is interesting.
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:39.940]   And maybe we should address this.
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:45.140]   You know, you can now use SwiftKey, which we've been using for years on Android and love.
[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:47.300]   Swipe, same thing.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:52.980]   FlexKey and a bunch of other keyboard alternatives in iOS, including one that I wish we had on
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:57.060]   Android, which allows you to respond not with text, but with animated GIFs.
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:58.060]   >> [ Laughs ]
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:02.820]   >> It's an animated GIF keyboard.
[01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:05.420]   And it's got thousands.
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:06.940]   It's amazing.
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:14.100]   But when you just as an Android, when you install a new keyboard on iOS, you get a big,
[01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:17.460]   bad warning that says, "Hey, watch out this keyboard.
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:23.620]   Third-party keyboards can transmit all the data that you type to their servers, and you
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:25.620]   should be wary of that."
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:27.980]   And it's scaring Apple users.
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:30.980]   The warning on Android, I should compare the two because the warning on Android isn't
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:34.140]   is similar, but not terrifying, right?
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:35.580]   I can't remember.
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:38.060]   >> Yeah, I mean, I don't even know.
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:40.020]   >> Let me read the Android warning.
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:42.380]   >> Is there a key logger-specific warning message?
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:43.380]   I don't think so.
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:44.380]   You know, it's funny.
[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:49.900]   I've been watching iOS users try SwiftKey, and one of my friends was like, "This prompted
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:54.900]   me to sign into Facebook, and it uses my Facebook status updates to figure out how I write."
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:56.340]   >> Yeah, isn't that great?
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:57.900]   >> Like, use it like mind blown.
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:58.900]   >> Yeah.
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.740]   >> And it's like creepy.
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:01.740]   This is too creepery.
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:02.740]   Like, "Why is it doing this?"
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:03.740]   It should have told me that.
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:04.740]   Like, "This is SwiftKey.
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:05.980]   It's been around for a long time."
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:06.980]   This is what it does.
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:07.980]   >> This is a good thing.
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.460]   >> That's weird that you sign into Facebook with your keyboard.
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:12.980]   It is a very unexpected thing unless you know how to know about it, right?
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:16.540]   But it was an interesting sort of wake up call like, "Oh, this is a keyboard that has
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:20.620]   to tell you why it's asking you to sign into your social networks."
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:21.620]   >> Right.
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:23.980]   >> But you do get a...
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:28.380]   I'm pretty sure, and I'm going to install SwiftKey on my new phone because it's not installed
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:29.380]   yet.
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:30.380]   I'm pretty...
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:35.260]   I think the thing about the Android phones too that's different is that even if you don't
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:39.780]   install SwiftKey, most of them at this point will have swipe typing of some sort built
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:40.780]   into them.
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:42.020]   I assume that they've licensed technology.
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:43.020]   >> The Google keyboard does.
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:44.020]   >> Right.
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:45.020]   >> Right.
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:48.420]   But I mean, like every phone that I have right now, I can swipe type if it's Android,
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:51.980]   and I didn't have to install anything, and I didn't have to worry about any security issues
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:52.980]   that were coming along.
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:57.340]   Plus, I didn't have to kind of lose one of my keys so that I could switch back and forth
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:00.700]   whereas when I did it with the iPhone, it was like, "How will you?
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.380]   I could finally do this swipe typing."
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:05.900]   But it's a little awkward at times that I have to...
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:09.420]   If it hasn't come up with the SwiftKey, I've got to push a thing, and then I have this little
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:12.780]   globe thing that's kind of there in my way.
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.260]   It works.
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:17.780]   It's not as polished as I think it is when you're using Android.
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:21.140]   And then all the security stuff that comes with it, you're just kind of like, "Apple,
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:24.820]   why didn't you just find a way to make that native, this swipe typing?
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:25.820]   How difficult was that?"
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:29.260]   Well, do you think that that's why people are using third-party keyboards on iOS?
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:30.780]   They just want swipe.
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:32.900]   They want SwiftKey flow or the equivalent.
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:33.900]   There may be other reasons why.
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.900]   I think there are other reasons.
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.780]   I'll tell you the other reason.
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:38.180]   I'll give you the other reason.
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:43.160]   Apple still refuses to do anything but uppercase letters on its keycaps, even when you're
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.160]   in lowercase.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.340]   What do you mean uppercase?
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:48.340]   The letters are always uppercase.
[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:51.020]   It's like a typewriter.
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:55.180]   Even if you're typing lowercase letters, the keycaps of the keyboard are uppercase.
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:18:00.220]   Yeah, it's one of the first questions I got from family members who got iOS.
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:02.660]   They're like, "I don't understand why is this a letter lower.
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:03.660]   How are the letters lower?"
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:08.260]   So that's another reason too that I immediately wanted to change the keyboard.
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:12.460]   So, many of you guys don't remember, but when you install a third-party keyboard on
[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:17.820]   Android like SwiftKey, which I do on every Android device, you get this warning, attention.
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:22.260]   This input method may be able to collect all the text you type, including personal data
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:24.900]   like passwords and credit card numbers.
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.460]   It comes from the app SwiftKey.
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:29.260]   Use this input method, okay or cancel.
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:31.340]   It's very similar actually to what Apple's saying.
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.580]   Yeah, that's the right.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:38.420]   For some reason, we Android users just go, "Oh yeah, whatever," and say, "Okay."
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:40.580]   And Apple users are terrified.
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:41.780]   I'm getting calls.
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:43.300]   People always say, "Oh, is it safe?
[01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:47.420]   I heard SwiftKey say I have stuff to the servers."
[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:51.020]   And then Steve Gibson said yesterday, which I didn't want to say anything, but he said,
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:54.140]   "Well, SwiftKey says stuff to the servers, but swipe doesn't.
[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:55.220]   How do you know?
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.220]   You don't know."
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:19:00.940]   Well, yeah, you'd have to set up a network sniffer, right, and use it to see.
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:01.940]   Right.
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:02.940]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:06.100]   I mean, in a way, I feel like Android users to some degree have been sort of windows visted,
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:07.100]   right?
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:10.300]   Like, you just masked them so many times, and we just give it, give it, give it.
[01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:19.780]   And you tweeted the iOS prompt that said, "Hey, Facebook has been collecting your location
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:20.780]   data at the background.
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:23.500]   Do you want to continue to keep doing this?"
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:26.740]   Every app will do this once, Danny, every single one.
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:27.740]   But you know what?
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:31.300]   And somebody tweeted back to me how they liked that it didn't all happen at once, and
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.300]   I had degree.
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:35.580]   Every time I turned on my phone, I got a different reminder, and I didn't mind it.
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:37.980]   It was like, "Oh, wait a minute.
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:40.260]   Or it could just honor your..."
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:42.540]   Because it asks you the first time.
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:43.540]   It says...
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:45.020]   And you say yes.
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:48.380]   And then a little later, a day or two later, it says, "You know, it's still doing that.
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:49.700]   Is that okay?"
[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:51.220]   I thought that was fine.
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.020]   I thought that was totally cool.
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:54.860]   Yeah, I mean, I actually kind of liked it.
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:59.500]   I appreciated the reminder that Facebook's doing this because, you know, I just appreciate
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.500]   it.
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:01.500]   Maybe I'm not using Facebook.
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:02.500]   Maybe I decide, "Oh, you know what?
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.500]   I don't need this to be using my location data in the background.
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:05.820]   I'm going to uninstall this, right?
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:06.820]   Like, this is the issue.
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:09.820]   It's like, if you want to use an app, you have to grant it these permissions.
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:10.820]   Maybe I try the app.
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:14.340]   I try apps all the time and then don't need them later, but they're running in the background.
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.740]   I kind of want to be like, "No, let no."
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:21.180]   But yeah, this issue of constantly being prompted for permissions or being prompted with this
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:27.220]   huge wall of permissions with subcategories that have supposedly been made simpler.
[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:30.060]   There's got to be better way.
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:33.100]   Well, the choice is clear.
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:38.500]   Android asks you once when you install the app and then presumes that you've read that
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.580]   and you've approved it and that's that.
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:45.020]   Now you can get a list, can't you, of all the apps using fine location.
[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:46.020]   That's all it is, by the way.
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.020]   It's fine location.
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:48.020]   Yeah.
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:49.580]   And on an Apple, same thing.
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:51.460]   You have to approve it when you install the app.
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:54.340]   The first time you use the app, not instead when you install it, but the first time you
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:58.620]   use it, it'll say, "Hey, you want to give this app location permission?"
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:02.660]   You say yes, you still can go in the settings and see who's getting location.
[01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:07.180]   But for some reason, Apple's decided that a few days later, it wants to warn you on each
[01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:08.180]   app doing this.
[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:12.860]   Now, I'm hoping that's not going to happen every few days because I have 159 apps and
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:15.420]   it's happening a lot.
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:21.380]   But it was interesting to me also that I'm assuming there's some kind of logic that's
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:26.780]   going on because I did not get hit with every app that I've authorized to do that.
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:27.780]   I can't do that.
[01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:28.780]   No, you will.
[01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:33.540]   But the things that came up immediately were the things that I probably are using them
[01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:34.540]   most.
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:35.540]   Right.
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:36.540]   And so that made sense.
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.140]   So maybe it'll come down the line.
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:40.020]   I'm wondering what the trigger is.
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:44.460]   Like, "Hey, we've noticed that Facebook has now done its 100th update of your location."
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:46.460]   Yeah, something like that.
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:51.260]   To where you installed Emoji Keyboard.
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:55.140]   Let's talk next week, Danny, after you've seen the 50th one of those.
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:56.140]   All right.
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:57.140]   There's two problems.
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:22:00.380]   One, it's annoying, but two, there's fatigue.
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:03.060]   And as you pointed out, we Android users are so used to it.
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:04.580]   We go, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:05.580]   There's a risk.
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:06.580]   You warn people too much."
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:08.020]   I think it's sufficient to warn.
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:12.700]   I like what Apple does, which is it warns you not on install, but it warns you the first
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:14.220]   time it needs those permissions.
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.220]   You have to explicitly say so.
[01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:21.860]   But that seems to me sufficient to continue to warn you is a little nanny.
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:23.860]   But that, you know, I don't, you know, whatever.
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:26.860]   You don't seem to believe it.
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:27.860]   I do.
[01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:28.860]   I do.
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:29.860]   I agree.
[01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:32.540]   It's very easy to ignore the permissions you're giving an app when you're installing
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:33.540]   it.
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:34.540]   Because it's a long list.
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:35.540]   Just give me the app.
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:36.540]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:41.060]   So many apps, for instance, want location information, your contacts, and your photos.
[01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:46.460]   On Android, you'll see all three of those requests only once when you install the app.
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:51.660]   On iOS, you'll see it when you, when it actually asks for those permissions, when you first
[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:55.380]   run the app and you want to access the camera roll, say, hey, do you want to give this permission?
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:57.420]   I think that's exactly the right time.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:02.500]   Because you know right then why it's wanting the camera roll and what it is.
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:05.220]   And I think that's when you can best make that decision.
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:09.380]   But I question the need to continue to remind me.
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:10.380]   But you know what?
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:15.020]   This is Apple saying, and by the way, I guess this is a story for us because it's very clear
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:19.540]   in the last few interviews Tim Cook's given, this is Apple saying, oh, we've decided to
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:21.740]   be the privacy security company.
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:26.820]   And other companies are, you know, our business is selling you hardware.
[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:29.420]   Other companies is selling your information.
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:31.380]   You know, we would never do that.
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:33.300]   We would never do that except with iPads.
[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.300]   But that's another story.
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:36.860]   That's the marketing opportunity for them.
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:37.860]   Huge.
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:40.220]   They're capitalizing on the people's fear about that.
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.660]   Yeah, about what Google knows about them.
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:44.780]   So I think frankly that's a good, that's a good positioning.
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:47.420]   And you know, Apple has done some things to make it better.
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:53.700]   Or, you know, we would never, you know, target you with ads or anything.
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:59.540]   But we would partner with a big company that pays us lots of money to be the default search
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:05.380]   engine and probably gives us 90% of all the revenues when you do a search on our device
[01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:06.380]   and go over there.
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:09.580]   How much do we know how much Apple gets from Google every year because it's the default
[01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:10.580]   search engine?
[01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:13.340]   I saw some estimate that it might have been like two billion or so.
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:14.340]   Two billion.
[01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:15.340]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:16.340]   But.
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:17.340]   It's a lot.
[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:19.460]   And they're going to get a lot off of it.
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:25.660]   And they never disclosed to you that they have paid or are getting paid from Google to
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:26.660]   do that.
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:29.660]   You barely even know that there was a deal that was ever struck.
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:30.660]   So I.
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:33.900]   So that's when you're using the Google search in Safari.
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:35.620]   That information is being leaked.
[01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:39.620]   When you use it in Siri, it masks that information.
[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:44.380]   All of the, I was told, and I may be wrong, that all of those searches are coming from
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:45.900]   Apple, not from you.
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:47.780]   Well, they're going to come from Apple.
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:48.780]   Yes.
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:53.260]   Although when you click to go through to a particular site, if you do that, it might
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:54.260]   change.
[01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:58.540]   And eventually maybe Siri will happen where they don't, they don't target you in any
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:02.220]   sort of way, you know, with the third parties or whatever.
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:06.180]   And I wonder though, doesn't so so far, I thought I remember the Safari was doing this
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:07.180]   too.
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:08.660]   But that would be giving for going to.
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:10.460]   So far he is doing.
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:17.100]   I think Safari has moved to by default, HTTPS searches, but that just means you're going
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:20.300]   to have a secure connection when you do your search with Google.
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.580]   Google still knows who you are.
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:24.460]   In fact, you'll probably be logged in, you know, with Google.
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:25.820]   You might be logged in with Safari.
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:30.540]   So, you know, even if you're not logged in, Google is probably still going to cookie
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:34.900]   you, even if you're on a secure thing, because it's not like your next time you go to Google
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:36.340]   it says, oh, you're still on a secure thing.
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:37.340]   I'll throw away the cookie.
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:38.860]   I assigned you the last time.
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:39.860]   Right.
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:43.860]   I appreciated what Apple said.
[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:47.300]   But what they didn't say was, but we also have deals with these big companies that make
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:51.420]   a lot of money off of them, because they in turn are making a lot of money off of you
[01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:54.660]   in turn by doing that stuff that we said we don't do directly.
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:57.780]   So, that's a good point.
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:02.620]   I would hope here, by the way, is the Apple warning just so that you can compare it to
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:04.540]   the Android warning.
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:05.740]   I've turned on swipe.
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:08.180]   It says, allow full access for swipe keyboards.
[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:12.100]   Full access allows the developer the keyboard to transmit anything you type, including the
[01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:14.060]   things you have previously typed with this keyboard.
[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:17.940]   This can include sensitive information, such as your credit card number or street address.
[01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:22.420]   The Google warning is a little more clear it's coming from, but it's pretty much the
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:23.420]   same, isn't it?
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:25.100]   Yeah, they're pretty similar.
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:26.100]   Yeah.
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:28.300]   But it scares Apple people more because they've never--
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:29.300]   They haven't seen that.
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:30.300]   --confronted this before.
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.300]   I love it.
[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:34.460]   Somebody in the chat room saying, why are you always banging on Apple?
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:35.460]   Can't you just be--?
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:37.900]   It's like, excuse me?
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:42.900]   I think Apple people sometimes say, no, let's-- I don't want to--
[01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:43.900]   [SINGING]
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:46.100]   I don't want to hear it.
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:47.580]   Everybody says that.
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:49.900]   You can have Android people do the same sort of thing.
[01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:51.380]   Why do I always pick an Android?
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:53.220]   Oh, no, no, I hear it from everybody.
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:54.220]   Absolutely.
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:55.220]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:57.220]   The people take these things very personally.
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:58.220]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:01.380]   Because there's the three people still using BlackBerry who get really upset.
[01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:02.380]   Does--
[01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:04.380]   Well, you're saying there's only three people using BlackBerry.
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:06.140]   I'm just going to see real quickly.
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:14.020]   If I do a search on the new iPhone, if the default search is Google, by the way, immediately
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:16.020]   before-- yeah, it's a Google search.
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:18.180]   Before it does the search, pulls up a Wikipedia entry.
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:22.980]   It does a search snippet right away before I even hit go.
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.340]   That's the Google search app?
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:25.340]   No.
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:26.340]   This is Safari on iOS.
[01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:27.340]   That's Safari.
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:28.340]   iOS.
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:32.060]   And then if I hit return, then I get the Google results.
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.060]   So it's actually doing it on Google.
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:35.420]   I thought it was going to use Bing too.
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:38.300]   I think Bing is available, if you wish.
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.940]   But that's $2 billion worth of revenue.
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:42.140]   It gets complicated.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:47.540]   Bing is available for spotlight searches and in Siri.
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:51.460]   But Safari still defaults to using Google.
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:55.180]   Although I'll have to go back and look because that's interesting that if they're pulling
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:28:00.740]   in Wikipedia as you type, I don't know if that's Google doing that or that Safari doing
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:01.740]   that.
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:02.980]   I wonder too.
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:03.980]   Right.
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:06.340]   I'm going to have to go look into that now.
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:07.820]   That just blew my afternoon.
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:10.260]   Thanks a lot.
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:12.660]   And we trust SwiftKey, right?
[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:14.820]   Apple users, if you wish to trust SwiftKey, you can.
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:16.940]   I would trust Swipe.
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:18.420]   Here's to me the bottom line.
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:19.980]   These are all well-known big companies.
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:23.980]   It is possible with a packet sniffer to see what's being sent back.
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:28.980]   And I think they would be discovered if they were to do anything nefarious, they'd be discovered
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:30.700]   quite quickly.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:33.620]   So I wouldn't worry too much about it.
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:35.180]   Can I just say those?
[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:39.900]   When I was typing in G-bag, that was just because I was trying to under a G-pack.
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:48.500]   I was trying to understand some of the dope lingo from the wire.
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:52.020]   If you look at my search history right now, have you noticed?
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:55.620]   I think I'm like a startup in the heroin trade or something.
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:57.460]   What the hell is that?
[01:28:57.460 --> 01:29:00.500]   I'm just trying to understand the wire.
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:07.860]   So you guys noticed that it seems like Google's doing a better job of catching the stuff I
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:14.300]   search for and populating the ads in other pages as I search around.
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.100]   It seems like it's really working well lately.
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:20.100]   I search for something and I see ads for it all over from now on.
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:21.100]   Yeah.
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:22.100]   Yeah, I have noticed that.
[01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:24.100]   It seems like it's working better, doesn't it?
[01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:25.100]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:26.100]   Yeah.
[01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:27.100]   It follows you around.
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:28.100]   The stuff that you're interested in.
[01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:34.540]   I continue to get that feeling of like, "Oh, Google knows a lot about me from now and from
[01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:40.260]   ads and from search suggestions of things I searched for before."
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:41.260]   Right.
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:42.260]   Yeah.
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:43.260]   Yeah.
[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:44.260]   Very smart.
[01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:45.260]   It's easier.
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:47.300]   That's why they have enough money for Google X and Google Y.
[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:49.260]   They're doing a good job.
[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:51.060]   They're doing a good job with their job.
[01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:52.060]   Yeah.
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:53.060]   Let's see.
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:58.060]   What else before we wrap things up, we're getting to the end of our program schedule.
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:04.700]   You can tweet a Wolfram Alpha language program, tweet a program and it will return.
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:06.660]   What is that?
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:07.660]   Where did that come from?
[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:08.660]   Let me try it.
[01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:09.660]   Yeah.
[01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:10.660]   You can so.
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:11.660]   Tweet Wolfram Alpha.
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:14.220]   Wolfram Alpha is the coolest.
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:15.220]   I love it.
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:16.380]   It's such a cool product, right?
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:18.660]   That nobody knows about or uses.
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:19.660]   Nobody knows about or uses.
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:21.700]   But there's a thing I know about it and I don't use it.
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:24.540]   Although until something like this happens and I'm like, "Oh, cool.
[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:25.540]   Let me try this.
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:26.540]   I try it and I'm impressed."
[01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:27.540]   Oh, I get it.
[01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:28.540]   Awesome.
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:34.620]   So you can tweet code in Wolfram Alpha, obviously 140 characters or less.
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:41.780]   And Wolfram TAP and it will run your program and tweet the result.
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:43.780]   Which is pretty awesome.
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:46.980]   Now have you played so this is a really good one.
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:50.300]   Geographics, text, style, hello, 150 geo range world.
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:53.820]   We'll put hello on a world map and it'll tweet it back to you.
[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:58.820]   It tells you two things.
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.820]   Have you played with this language?
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:01.820]   The Wolfram language?
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:03.980]   Look at this one.
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:06.820]   This is kind of like Mathematico, which is Wolfram's.
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:07.820]   Right, Mathematica.
[01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:11.780]   Yeah, that cube of spheres is amazing.
[01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:18.860]   This is the RGB colors in a cube of spheres and it tweets it back at you.
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:21.740]   I haven't actually done this, but I am now.
[01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:23.380]   You're a programmer.
[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:24.380]   We count on you.
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:26.380]   Yeah, this is neat.
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.380]   And they attach this is cool.
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:30.900]   So they attach the results as an image kind of as a Twitter card.
[01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:32.660]   Yeah, that's very cool.
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:35.100]   Wow, look, you could do fractals.
[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:36.100]   Nido.
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:42.860]   But again, it's like I just want, Wolfram just seems like a thing that I want to use every
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:43.860]   day in my life.
[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:49.220]   I just, I'm just never rendering cubes of spheres and the RGB scale.
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:50.220]   Very awesome.
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:51.220]   You know what I mean?
[01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:52.820]   It's just not something I need to do that often.
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:53.820]   I know, but it's fun.
[01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:54.820]   Well, here's one.
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:55.820]   It's fun.
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:32:00.340]   All the flags of Europe sized by population.
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:02.740]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:03.740]   Wow.
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:04.740]   It's really cool.
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:06.580]   With 140 character tweet.
[01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:11.820]   All right, we send this tweet as your best Wolfram alpha language.
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:12.940]   That's just crazy.
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:17.860]   I want to, it makes me want to learn the language, which is obviously the intent.
[01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:23.660]   Are we still waiting on a Nexus seven phone or six or whatever it would be?
[01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:24.660]   Nexus six would be.
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:25.660]   I don't know.
[01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:26.660]   What do you, what do you think?
[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:27.660]   What do you guys think?
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:29.460]   This is the one, right?
[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:30.460]   You're the one who'll be waiting.
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:31.460]   Oh my gosh.
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:35.300]   The rumors, there are no solid great rumors.
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:37.540]   Every one, every one expects.
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:38.540]   Sorry.
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:41.300]   I don't know if I can in this office.
[01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:44.180]   You got to rename it as you've demonstrated.
[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:46.500]   What's the next Android versus?
[01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:47.500]   Isn't that Android elder?
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:48.500]   Well, the L word, yeah.
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:49.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:52.300]   So we have to get a phone that comes out with Android L.
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.300]   Well, it's due next month.
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:56.020]   According to the Washington Post.
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.020]   Right.
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:33:01.420]   And we might be looking at new phone running the L.
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:03.460]   And by the way, default encryption.
[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:06.380]   Remember, this is something Apple announced.
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:11.540]   The Apple used to have a waiting line for law enforcement to decrypt phones and you'd
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:14.580]   fill out a form and you'd send the phone to Apple and within a few months you'd get
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:16.380]   it back decrypted.
[01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:18.060]   Apple's announced we can no longer do that.
[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:21.060]   There will no longer be a line because we don't have the capability.
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:24.060]   We've changed the default encryption and it's strong encryption.
[01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:27.500]   And now L will do that too, which is good.
[01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.500]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.700]   This is where the companies influence one another.
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:32.900]   I love it.
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:33.900]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:35.460]   So, yeah, you're right.
[01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:36.460]   They have to release.
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:37.460]   Do they have?
[01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:38.460]   Is that right?
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:42.220]   Do they always with a new version of Android have a new phone, a new Nexus?
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:46.340]   That's what some of the developers tweeted was that listen, if we're going to release
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:52.020]   a operating system, you need to release some sort of hardware, we're going to have a hardware
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:54.660]   to bundle with which was from a tweet.
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:55.660]   That makes sense.
[01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:57.180]   Yeah, I mean a reference device, right?
[01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:58.180]   Right.
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:03.060]   A reference device about what the default Android L, Limoncello or Lollipop or whatever
[01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:05.060]   it is experience is going to be.
[01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:09.300]   Well, you could just update the Nexus 5 and say that's it.
[01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:16.300]   You could, but then you wouldn't get all those, the money coming in in the holiday season.
[01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:17.300]   On hardware.
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:19.300]   Oh, it's a profit thing.
[01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:24.420]   Oh, but I don't know how much they sell for the Nexus 5, but yeah, I don't think it's
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:26.340]   a big money maker.
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:32.340]   You know, it's nice having it, but I could see is the Moto X out unlocked yet?
[01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:34.820]   Yeah, this is unlocked.
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:39.780]   And it's, it's, it's, it's, it's not exactly pure Android, but all the Moto customizations
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:43.020]   are in Moto programs, the connect program, for instance.
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:44.020]   So that's what I'm wondering.
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:45.300]   So it's pretty pure.
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:51.380]   What I'm wondering is whether they just put out the Nexus 5L or something and it's just
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:53.940]   the, the Moto X or whatever.
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:56.860]   So nice and fun.
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:34:57.860]   I like it.
[01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:02.220]   It'll be interesting about, you know, potentially they could just put the Nexus 5 back out,
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:05.900]   you know, it's actually maybe it's time for a tablet.
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:09.820]   Maybe they're, they're desperately coming out with the 5.5, the Nexus 5.5.
[01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:12.660]   The Blackberry Passport L.
[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:13.660]   Yeah.
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:14.660]   Right.
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:15.660]   What?
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:16.660]   What?
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:18.220]   This just came out.
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:21.100]   Would you pay $5.99 for this unlocked?
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:25.580]   It is a passport size Blackberry full physical keyboard.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:26.580]   Nice screen, actually.
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:31.220]   Oh, no, you have me at Blackberry.
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:33.060]   We shouldn't mock it.
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.900]   I want them to succeed.
[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:39.380]   This is a product that some have been very interested in.
[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:43.300]   You know, they'll such a limited store compared to the androids to compare to the windows
[01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:44.660]   phone stores he limited.
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:48.740]   So it's also kind of a weird form factor.
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:51.020]   It's like that.
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:52.380]   It's like a pop tart.
[01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:57.980]   It's like you got to have, they have a picture of people trying to hold it.
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:35:58.980]   It's not good.
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:35:59.980]   No.
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:02.140]   Leo, the Wablets are going to be great.
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:03.140]   What?
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:04.140]   Wablets.
[01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:05.140]   What's a wablet?
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:06.140]   What's a wablet?
[01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:07.140]   The wide.
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:08.140]   The wide.
[01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:09.140]   Fablet.
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:10.140]   Yeah, you'll see.
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:11.140]   They're going to be the leaders in wablet technology.
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:13.260]   And you're not going to be talking pop tarts anymore.
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:15.460]   You'll be going every phone should be wablets.
[01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:16.460]   Last wave of wablet.
[01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:17.460]   Wablets.
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:18.460]   Anybody done that?
[01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:19.460]   Yeah.
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:20.460]   Wablet.com.
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:21.460]   You just invented it.
[01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:22.460]   Go get it, Danny.
[01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:23.900]   Now I'm sure someone's done it.
[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:24.900]   Oh, no.
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:26.260]   I'm in the middle of that many wablets.
[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:29.700]   I'm going to give you a time to register that domain name and then we come back.
[01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:32.500]   We're going to get our picture of the week.
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:36.660]   Danny Sullivan, that waskily wablet from search engine land.com.
[01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:39.380]   Gina Trippani, one of our regulars.
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:43.020]   Do you shave Danny or are you just naturally boyish?
[01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:44.900]   No, I shave for the show.
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:45.900]   Thank you.
[01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:46.900]   Thank you.
[01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:47.900]   I appreciate that.
[01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:49.820]   Did you use your, you know, I was like, stumble over my face.
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:51.620]   Did you use your Harry's?
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:53.420]   You know about Harry's?
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:54.500]   I love Harry's.
[01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:56.260]   This is, um, oh my goodness.
[01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:57.260]   Yes, I do.
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:36:58.260]   Do you?
[01:36:58.260 --> 01:36:59.260]   Yeah.
[01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:01.420]   Harry's is a shave, shave club, basically.
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:05.620]   I get my blades every other month and the fabulous Harry shave cream, which is a really
[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:07.420]   critical part of the whole thing.
[01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:10.980]   You know, if somebody could go on my desk, I don't know if they've announced it yet,
[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:16.340]   but there is a new, a couple of new Harry's products you can get from Harry's.com, the
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:21.500]   new foaming shave gel and the aftershave are here.
[01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:26.900]   Harry's is founded by one of the founders of Warby Parker, Jeff.
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:32.220]   He said, you know, just like Warby Parker, here's a business, the shaving blade business
[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:38.220]   that is dominated by monopolies effectively that are keeping prices artificially high.
[01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:41.680]   So high that now when you go to get razor blades at the drug stores, not just New York
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:46.740]   City, Gina everywhere in the country here in Petaluma, they're locked up.
[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:50.780]   You have to get a clerk, you know, and he'll check your ID and your passport before you
[01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:53.140]   can get the shaving equipment.
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:54.140]   They're so expensive.
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:57.660]   Well, share, Harry's is better for less.
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:01.540]   They actually bought, they looked around, they said, who makes great blades?
[01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:06.660]   They found a company in Germany that makes, like the only company that makes really great
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:09.460]   blades, this is the Truman set.
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:14.860]   I have the Winston at home, which is an engraved metal, but some people prefer the Truman, you
[01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:17.620]   know, they're, but the handles aren't really the key.
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:22.780]   The key is this amazing blade made in Harry's own factory in Germany.
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:25.500]   They own the factory in Germany.
[01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:30.060]   Andy and Jeff said we could do better than those eight dollar blades.
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:34.060]   If you visit Harry's dot com shop around, pick a set.
[01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:37.260]   I actually have to say, I kind of like this Truman.
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:41.780]   It's pretty nice, but the Winston is good to and you can get that engraved and then
[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:45.620]   you're going to get with the kit, you're going to get the shave cream, the two blades.
[01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:50.060]   So you're all set to go and then you can have your blades and your cream delivered monthly.
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:53.620]   I haven't tried the new shaving, foaming shave gel.
[01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:57.460]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:01.220]   Oh, it smells good too.
[01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:02.220]   Harry's dot com.
[01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:03.220]   Here's the deal.
[01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:09.260]   You get $5 off your first order when you use the offer code twig, T W I D G. You will.
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:12.620]   This will be the closest shave you've ever had.
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:15.220]   Harry's dot com.
[01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:16.900]   Now what do I do?
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:17.900]   Shave.
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:19.460]   I couldn't resist.
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:25.660]   I have to finish the show this way.
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:27.660]   I have to finish the show.
