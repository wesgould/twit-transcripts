[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.720]   This week in Google, episode 47.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.800]   And joining us now, we have a course
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.280]   from her home in San Diego, the Bicycle Factory.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.120]   Gina Tripani.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.000]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.520]   Hey.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.120]   How's it going?
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.120]   It's actually the PHP factory, isn't it?
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.480]   It's the PHP factory these days.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.880]   Yeah, but my bike is--
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.640]   Still there.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.360]   Yeah, my bikes are on the wall there.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.720]   But yeah, right now it is the PHP site.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.360]   PHP and bicycles, together at last.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.120]   Also with us from Berlin, where he is on assignment.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.800]   I like saying that.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.960]   Nothing.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.240]   Jeff is the author.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.640]   No, not of the complete wave guide.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.200]   That's Gina Tripani, completewaveguide.com.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.280]   Jeff is the author of what would Google do?
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.400]   And blogs@buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.240]   And why are you in Germany?
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.200]   I'm giving talks to a whole mess of publishers here.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.600]   Ah, how fun.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.880]   Doing the good work of educating the world.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.680]   That's right.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.600]   About media.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.400]   How screwy they are.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.760]   How deep-- what deep doo-doo they are in.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.480]   And we have a special guest with us today.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.160]   I'm really happy to welcome Chris Messina, factory Joe,
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.680]   who is here.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.480]   Howdy.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.840]   Drew Dust recently became Open Web Advocate at Google.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.080]   We first met when you were working at Mozilla.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.560]   And you've done a lot of advocacy for OAuth
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.800]   and other open standards.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.280]   And I think it's really cool that Google has hired you
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.040]   to continue that work.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.920]   FactoryJoe.com is his blog.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.640]   So how has it been working at Google?
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.040]   You enjoying it?
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.560]   Yeah, it's terrific.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.120]   It's a lot of work.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.560]   But I was sort of anticipating that.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.440]   And I think it's really nice that Google's brought me in,
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.080]   specifically to keep doing a lot of the work that I was
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.080]   already doing.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   And what I find is very interesting about the job now
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.440]   is that I'm actually doing a lot of work
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.240]   on internal evangelism, I guess.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.720]   Sort of bringing a lot of the ideas
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.200]   that a lot of folks in the grassroots web community
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.480]   have been working on for the last couple of years
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.360]   and socializing them internally, getting people
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.440]   to find out more about them, and then
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.520]   working with the folks at Google who are already involved
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.720]   in things like OAuth and OpenID to, I guess,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.480]   have a way of reaching out into the community as well
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.600]   and making that give and take happen a little more fluidly.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.920]   I mean, I think it's really encouraging
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.400]   that Google has somebody in this job.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.000]   I hope so.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.440]   That's pretty important.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.480]   Well, but you see companies like Facebook--
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.640]   and I know you were pretty happy when Facebook decided
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.960]   to start using OAuth.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.320]   But you look at a company like Facebook,
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.320]   it really does seem to want to create its own standards
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.840]   in some ways.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.000]   It wants to do its own way.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And comparing contrast that to Google
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.320]   that says we're going to support these open standards
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   so that everybody can play.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.080]   Yeah, it's an interesting challenge.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.000]   I've personally, I think, been developing a more nuanced
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.320]   understanding of how a lot of these things both play out
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.960]   in the real world and how you can get big companies to move
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.080]   to adopt things that are more conventional.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.360]   I think the name of the game over a good amount of time
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.640]   is figuring out the right story for interoperability.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.320]   And what that means is that you have
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.360]   to find the right balance between inventing
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.640]   something that's brand new and imposing that
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.440]   upon the world versus adopting or making use of technologies
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.240]   that already exist, that have communities that are built
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.040]   around them, and that have gone through a lot of the,
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.160]   as we call, bike shedding process of figuring out
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.480]   what to call this variable and what to call that protocol
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.800]   and things like that.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.240]   But what I also am finding is that--
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.480]   and I train as a designer in college--
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.960]   that we also do a lot of work to make these technologies easier
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.280]   for people who are new to developing on the web platform.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.800]   And they don't want to spend their time reading
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.880]   all these mailing lists.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.400]   So on the one hand, you can give Facebook some slack
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.240]   for inventing some things.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.520]   On the other hand, they've done a pretty good job, actually,
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.040]   with a lot of their developer documentation
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.000]   and making it very clear and very simple.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.480]   So it sort of puts a charge, I think,
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.320]   to the open web community in general to figure out
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.080]   how we can make our things as approachable and easy
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.880]   to implement and adopt as some of the things that
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.720]   are more proprietary or single company oriented.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.480]   Right.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.440]   I know Gina probably has a few things
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.000]   that she would like to ask and say, so Gina, ask away.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.760]   Yeah, I mean, I guess I was just curious about sort
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.600]   of the current, like, what your thoughts are on the Facebook
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.480]   sign-in issue.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.640]   So they're implementing OAuth or not.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.280]   They are.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.800]   OK.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.360]   Facebook Connect is OAuth.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.280]   What Facebook is doing-- and I can only
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.800]   speak in terms of what they've publicly said, of course--
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.040]   they're basing the next rev of Facebook login.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.680]   And I guess they're deprecating the Facebook Connect brand
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.200]   on OAuth 2.0.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.080]   And there's some important distinctions
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.800]   that are worth bringing up in terms
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.440]   of understanding the difference between OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.920]   And it's probably even worth providing
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.480]   a little bit of background and history about where
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.280]   OAuth actually came from.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.040]   Specifically, it's a good example of a grassroots community
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.000]   coming together to solve a problem that a number of it,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.720]   in this case, startups had, and working together
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.640]   to solve a common problem that none of them really wanted
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.400]   to compete on.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.600]   We could go back in time and look at single sign-on solutions
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.040]   from like Microsoft, like Passport.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.360]   You could.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.720]   It's a little bit different than that, though.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.520]   Actually, some of the early OAuth stuff
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.000]   actually came from a problem that we had with OpenID.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.480]   So I've been involved with the OpenID community for some time.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.200]   And of course, OpenID is a technology that
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.560]   allows you to use an account that you have on one website,
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.240]   on another website, without having to create a new password.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.920]   And it does it in a secure way.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.000]   However, it requires a browser.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.440]   And that meant that if you wanted to use OpenID with,
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.560]   let's say, an API.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.200]   Or if you wanted to use your OpenID
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.040]   to sign into a dashboard widget, for example,
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.200]   it didn't work.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.280]   So we needed a way of essentially getting another way
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.800]   to identify users in APIs and things like that.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.240]   And the solution that seems to be the common one
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.520]   is to substitute tokens, essentially keys and secrets,
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.720]   in place of a username and password for people,
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.800]   so they can actually access things via APIs.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.760]   So this is where some of my confusion.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.560]   So OpenID does not equal OAuth.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.160]   OAuth is not a tokenized version of OpenID.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.120]   They're completely separate.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.400]   They are completely separate.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.720]   They are complements.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   And the way that OpenID works is that you have an identity
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.600]   provider on the one hand, and you have a relying party
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.280]   on the other hand.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.320]   And the terminology is a little bit dorky.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.240]   But the basic idea is that you have some other website
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.600]   that you want to log into that is
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.580]   willing to rely on the identity provider, the one who
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.360]   basically says, this is factoryjo.com.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.120]   You should trust me, because I'm asserting
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.200]   that that's his identity.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.520]   And the other site basically says, OK,
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.240]   I'm willing to rely on you to tell me who the user is.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.160]   And it's all done using math and crypto and all this crazy
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:08.760]   stuff.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.760]   But it's just an identity solution.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.760]   It's an identity technology.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.240]   So it's basically a way of uniquely identifying people.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.480]   On the other hand, OAuth ignores the identity piece.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.960]   It doesn't care who is involved in that transaction.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.640]   Instead, it's a way of securely sending messages back and forth
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.680]   using tokens and signatures as a way of verifying that, yes,
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.560]   this message that was sent from point A to point B
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.960]   is actually from that original place.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.200]   It hasn't been tampered with.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.280]   And we can send messages back and forth in a secure manner.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.280]   And it's not decentralized.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.480]   The way open-- I'm sorry.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.600]   Like OpenID, you have a website.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.360]   There's a third party involved, which
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.320]   verifies your identity.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.000]   But with OAuth, the tokens are from an originator,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.880]   one single centralized originator.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.560]   It's not a sign that you can use around the web.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.760]   Correct.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.800]   The way that I'll describe, I guess, the difference there.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.200]   And this is kind of an interesting--
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.680]   there's a lot of very interesting and deep conversations
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.280]   about this now, because I think both OAuth and especially OAuth
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.920]   2.0 and OpenID 2.0 are at a crossroads,
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.320]   where we're very quickly trying to define
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.480]   the future of these technologies and how they complement
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.600]   one another.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.040]   Because what we found, to your point about OAuth,
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.160]   is that most implementations, of course,
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.600]   they rely on preregistration.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.600]   What that means is that if you have a web application
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.280]   or if you have a desktop application,
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.760]   you have to go to, let's say, Twitter and get a unique key
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.680]   so that whenever people use your application,
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.640]   Twitter can know, OK, this is that application,
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.720]   making a call on behalf of this user.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.400]   And so we're going to look up those tokens
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.840]   and make sure that it's all good,
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.240]   and we're going to let that tweet go through, or what have you.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.720]   And if anything goes wrong with that application,
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.880]   then Twitter has the ability to revoke the unique key that
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.240]   identifies the application.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.600]   So it is centralized and it's sort of a pairwise coupling
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.960]   in that sense.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.640]   OpenID, in contrast, has a feature called Discovery.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.000]   And what that means is when I type in a web address
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.840]   into an OpenID box, let's say, that website will redirect me
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.560]   back to whatever I typed in the box to essentially log
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.720]   into that website.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.880]   And then my identity provider will then bounce me back
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.080]   with the right encryption stuff that says,
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.720]   yep, that person logged in, it's cool.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.080]   This is the user, and this is the ID that you should use.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.560]   You should know them by.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.280]   So what we're seeing happen, though,
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.320]   and I think this is the thing that's very interesting,
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.600]   is that people are starting to use OAuth
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.760]   for identity-based transactions.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.480]   So what that means is that when you go to a website
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.240]   and it says, signing with Twitter,
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.600]   they're actually using OAuth.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.640]   They pre-registered, that website is pre-registered
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.240]   with Twitter, and when Twitter signs you in,
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.360]   basically, Twitter passes back your unique Twitter ID
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.200]   so that that website basically has your unique identifier,
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.640]   which could have been an OpenID being sent through OAuth.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.560]   - So just to make it so that people who are listening
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.000]   or are a little confused as not as developers,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.720]   my experience has been, now that Twitter has adopted OAuth,
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.680]   if I want to use a third-party Twitter client,
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.600]   I no longer enter my Twitter credentials
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.760]   into that third-party client, I request authorization.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.720]   It sends a token to Twitter, or actually logs me,
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.400]   it sends me to the Twitter site.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   And then Twitter says, okay, well, you know,
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.920]   Twitter later or TweetDeck is asking for authorization.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.720]   Is it okay? You say yes.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.360]   It then sends you back to the third-party client,
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.520]   which says, says, you're authorized now.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.120]   - Yes, and what's happening in the background there
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.680]   is that, you know, all these applications need
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.200]   some sort of username and password,
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.280]   essentially, again, a key, which uniquely identifies you
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.520]   and a secret, which only you should know
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.920]   or only Twitter should know.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.920]   So in the case of using OAuth and providing authorization,
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.160]   what you're essentially doing is you're saying,
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.520]   hey, Twitter, there's this application
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.800]   and it's TweetDeck for the Mac or something.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.720]   Which, of course, doesn't use OAuth yet, but anyways,
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.320]   pretend it does. - That choice.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.520]   - Pretend it does.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.520]   The idea is that Twitter will then say, okay, cool,
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.920]   do you wanna authorize that application?
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.320]   You're like, yes, I do.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.160]   And in the background, of course, the user doesn't see
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.440]   this part, Twitter.com then sends a token
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.520]   and then a key or whatever back to the application,
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.400]   which substitutes for your username and password.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.640]   So that way, you as a user can actually deauthorize
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.160]   that application at a later point without having to change
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.040]   your master password for your account.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.520]   - Love that. - So it's, yeah.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.480]   - You have real control and that's been very useful
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.360]   when I quit Facebook, for instance.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.320]   I can eliminate any connections to Facebook
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.520]   by going to these other sites.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.560]   - But the issue is now that people are using that,
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.280]   now you're seeing that sign in with Twitter
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.800]   kind of around the web, Twitter is becoming
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.040]   the arbiter of your identity, right?
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.280]   Like you're saying, Twitter is the one asserting you are,
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.360]   who you are, which is fine, which is cool.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.680]   - Only when you want to use a Twitter service though, right?
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.600]   - So Flickr does it when I want to use a Flickr service.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.640]   - Right, right.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.640]   - This not like Open ID, I still have my Open ID on my site.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.560]   - Right, and that's what I really like about Open ID,
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.480]   is that it's your domain, the problem is that people don't
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.640]   often don't have their own identity and so set up.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.480]   - Right, what do you do, right?
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.560]   - You know, Open ID, so.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.400]   - And this begs the question,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.680]   why isn't Google doing this in Google profiles
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.000]   or something like, this would be a very logical place
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.400]   for Google profiles to step up and say,
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.560]   hey, you could put your Open ID here.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.640]   - Explain what you mean by that.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.960]   - Well, I don't know what I mean by that.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.440]   Actually, 'cause I'm using, for Open ID, I'm using claim ID.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.400]   You use a third party authorizing site
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.640]   and then on your own site, you put a link back to that.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.560]   Maybe what Google should be doing, maybe it does.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.840]   I don't know, does Google act as an Open ID provider?
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.680]   - It does.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.520]   - It does.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.080]   - In fact, you can use your own domain as your Open ID,
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.000]   but then you can do what's called delegation.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.120]   - So I could delegate to Google then.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.520]   - That's right, so it's sort of like, you know,
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.040]   saying redirect, whenever I try to log in with this domain,
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.440]   redirect to Google.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.840]   And then Google will actually do the authentication bit
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.920]   and then allow you to sign in,
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.040]   but you're still identified as your domain.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.280]   - So that was a crazy thing I just asked.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.760]   - No, no, it was perfectly reasonable.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.800]   It's just not a football site.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.640]   - No, it was reasonable.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.480]   I didn't realize that you could.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.720]   I actually haven't set up.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.360]   I'm using claim ID or something like that, like you, Leo.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.600]   Like I haven't set up an Open ID on my own domain.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.160]   - Where do I go to do that?
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.800]   - Well, so if you can edit the source code on your website,
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.080]   then you can add essentially two meta tags.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.080]   If you search for Open ID delegation,
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:28.920]   you should be able to find it.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.760]   It's very simple.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.360]   It should take you like five minutes, maybe at most.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.440]   - So I can replace claim ID with Google.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.280]   - Yes, you want to.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.040]   - And my Google credential becomes my Open ID credential.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.680]   - Not exactly.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.480]   It's, and this is where it gets a little hokey.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.040]   It actually is quite simple in terms of the actual practice
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.440]   and how it works, but what you're doing is you're essentially
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.720]   saying whenever a relying party sees this Open ID,
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.560]   I want you to bounce over to this other website
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.560]   to get the actual authentication verification, I guess.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.960]   So yeah, you are kind of using your Google credential
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.680]   as your account, but you're still logging in
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.360]   with your Open ID URL.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.760]   So let me let me finish on the point.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.040]   What that allows you to do is to own your own domain.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.520]   And if at one point in your life,
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.120]   you choose to point to claim ID
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.880]   to be your Open ID provider.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.720]   Some time later, you might choose to delegate to Google
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.440]   or to somebody else entirely,
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.200]   and you still use the same Open ID login
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.800]   all these different services.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.600]   So that's one of the things that I really liked about Open ID
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.600]   from the very beginning is that it allows me
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.520]   to own my own domain and sort of have a choice
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.360]   of who provides my identity,
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.560]   and I can swap it at any time that I want to
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.040]   without having to go and change the account
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.680]   that I'm using on all these other remote websites.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.960]   - So I send, when I log in, I send, I add leoville.com,
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.680]   my personal domain, but I can change at leoville.com
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.480]   who the delegated Open ID provider is.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.960]   - Can you have multiple, can you have multiple,
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.600]   or you can only have one at a time?
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.880]   - You can do what's called creating fallbacks.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.960]   So if for whatever reason, claim ID is down,
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.200]   then the idea is that the site that you're signing into
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.640]   would then ping the next one in line.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.360]   So maybe after your claim ID is down, it goes to Google.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.760]   But you're still verifying that you own your domain,
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.320]   and that's the whole sort of design principle.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.480]   - Chris, is there any kind of higher level
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.240]   than of identity verification such that, let's say,
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.760]   Twitter verifies that Roger Ebert is Roger Ebert,
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.880]   and that they've gone to that effort to know
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.480]   that it's a real name with a real ID, with this ID?
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.640]   - Yes, there are a couple different ways to do this today.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.640]   Unfortunately, OAuth is, I don't wanna say it's lacking
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.920]   in this, but it hasn't really gone in this direction yet.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.120]   But for Open ID, there's an extension
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.640]   that's called the Polish Assurance Provider Extension.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.640]   PA, PA, it's PAP, it's again, naming is not our forte,
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.480]   apparently.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.440]   Anyways, with PAP, what you can do is you can essentially
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.280]   allow the identity provider to assert
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.280]   how the user was authenticated.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:06.040]   So it can say things like, we used a phishing resistant
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.040]   mechanism to authenticate this user,
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.360]   or this user used biometrics to log in,
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.920]   or this user used a one-time password,
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.600]   and you can do things like that that provide a mechanism
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.160]   to at least have some sense for the level of assurance,
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.640]   essentially, that the identity provider is offering.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.880]   Now, it's up to the relying party, of course, to trust
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.720]   that the identity provider is not lying,
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.440]   but that's what makes it a relying party.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.720]   - Well, the question is that if we got to a point
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.000]   where somebody, let's say, I don't know, the post office,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.720]   or a bank started to verify to real name
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.680]   or a credit account or a dress or something like that,
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.720]   then if we trusted that party, the rest of the system works
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.200]   so that we know how that party operates.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.320]   - Yeah, so there's a couple of pieces that you're asking there,
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.480]   and there's some mechanisms that are also in place
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.320]   to do this too.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:00.000]   There's an organization that was started,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.680]   I believe it was last, maybe last summer,
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.560]   or maybe it was, anyways, recently,
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.640]   called the Open Identity Exchange.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.360]   And this was an initiative that was started
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.400]   by the Open ID Foundation and the info card foundations,
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   together working with the federal government
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.880]   to create what's called an Open Trust framework.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.800]   And an Open Trust framework essentially is kind of
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.800]   an agreement, a deal that identity providers
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.920]   could essentially sign up for and opt into on a voluntary basis.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.160]   And they can say, we do these various things
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.840]   to make sure that our users have gone through a process
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.560]   of either validation or verification
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.200]   or whatever it happens to be.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.680]   And in that case, those identity providers
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.680]   that have gone through that trust framework,
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.800]   and they also, of course, say,
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.480]   we won't monitor what our users are doing
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.240]   or whatever it happens to be, those accounts in that context
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.960]   will be able to be used to authenticate
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.040]   to government websites and government services.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.680]   Now that's one piece of the puzzle.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.160]   The other piece is something that's called,
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:02.480]   I guess, attribute exchange, or the ability to
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.080]   have verified attributes that are attached
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.480]   to an identifier of some sort.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.280]   And there might be attribute providers, of course,
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.120]   that can basically say, with some authority,
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.720]   yep, this person is a US citizen,
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.720]   or yep, this person lives in California.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.000]   And those things become very valuable, of course, over time,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.920]   but we're not quite there in terms of where,
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.600]   where maybe we'd like to be.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.000]   But it's definitely coming, I think,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.440]   and it's pretty exciting stuff.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.680]   - That makes sense. - This is great stuff,
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.040]   and I would like to continue with it,
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.560]   but I also want to make sure we get some other stuff
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.560]   in here as well. - For sure.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.280]   - It's so great to have Christmas seen on it,
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.440]   and actually hear this story directly.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.200]   You guys, we can do a couple more.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.000]   If you're, Jeff, you or Gina have additional questions,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   but...
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.840]   - No, I'm good.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.880]   I'm actually, I'm setting up my meta tags now,
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.680]   and I'm moving to the new Facebook API,
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.280]   because I was using the old Facebook Connect,
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.760]   but now I have a reason.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.080]   (laughs)
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.920]   So I'm good.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.260]   - So you're saying you're using
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.800]   as your OpenID provider Facebook,
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.640]   or you're saying...
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.840]   - I was using, I think Yahoo.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.680]   - Yahoo, okay.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.480]   - Yeah, Yahoo is a provider, and it was a while ago,
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.200]   and I always wanted to just use my own domain,
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.960]   and I never took the time to look up how to do it,
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.720]   'cause I thought I was gonna have to install some sort of server.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.160]   I didn't realize that you could do the delicate thing,
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.000]   which is very, very cool.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.200]   - It's just some... - And it literally is
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.520]   two meta tags. - It's exactly,
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.320]   it's just two meta tags in the HTML.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.000]   - You can even literally go to my homepage,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.400]   and you could view source and see the tags
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.880]   that I've got there, and basically,
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.720]   just make sure that you use your own OpenID provider,
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.160]   'cause you won't be able to authenticate as me,
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.760]   but that would be where to go to find out how to do this.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.600]   - I was just looking.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.800]   - Is there a plugin for WordPress,
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.840]   or something like that for us more?
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.320]   - In fact, there is, there's a very good one,
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.520]   and the person who wrote that plugin
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.040]   is sitting next to me now, actually.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.040]   - Oh, that's not.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:45.880]   (laughs)
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.120]   - Yeah, if you search for the OpenID WordPress plugin,
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:47.960]   you can find it.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.440]   It acts both as a OpenID provider, which is pretty cool,
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.880]   but it also acts as a relying party,
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.560]   so that means that people can use their OpenIDs
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.720]   to sign into your website and leave authenticated comments.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.040]   Ah, that's interesting.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.000]   This is it, Will Norris and Factory Joe,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.560]   in fact, are the authors.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.000]   - That's right.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.920]   - Oh, that's cool.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.480]   So I've just been doing it with meta tags,
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.040]   but this sounds like this would add some features
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:11.880]   that I probably--
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.200]   - So now this is interesting,
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.400]   and this is sort of an interesting point
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.720]   about OpenID as well.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.880]   If you want to provide your own OpenID, great, do it.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.880]   However, for me, and I'm not really the developer at all,
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.720]   I just play one on the internet.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.840]   - I would prefer to have someone else actually be responsible
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.600]   for managing my OpenID credentials and login
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.120]   and security and things like that.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.600]   The delegation thing is a very simple, very low cost,
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.000]   very easy way of actually relying on someone else.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.360]   So you can totally run your own OpenID provider
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.880]   with the OpenID WordPress plugin,
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.560]   and if you want to do that, do it,
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.520]   but I would recommend getting SSL in your site
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.800]   and making sure that you're pretty confident
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.960]   about being able to manage WordPress
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.280]   and keeping all the security at post.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.680]   - So this is not delegation,
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.600]   this is actually making you an OpenID provider.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.680]   - That's right, so you can come in OpenID provider
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.640]   for many people if you have a multi-user blog for example.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.600]   - What's the four dummies version?
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.560]   - You don't want to do this, Jeff.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.400]   - No, you look at the four dummies version.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.480]   That's why I want to be able to go to Google
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.520]   and say, "Identify me, brand."
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.520]   - Yeah, you want to delegate to Google.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.400]   - Yeah, you want to delegate,
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.240]   so you want to use the--
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.080]   - I have to do that with the--
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:21.960]   - An attack.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.760]   - Yeah, that's just two lines, it's pretty easy to do.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.600]   - I know, but I need to--
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.360]   - And if you're doing it in WordPress,
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.520]   you put it in your template
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.560]   and something that gets loaded every time the word gets--
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.400]   - Right, that's not--
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.240]   - The template gets loaded,
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.280]   usually that would be your header.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.120]   - Yes.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.000]   - And it's just two, I can email you,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.760]   I could type it into a text message, it's that simple.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.680]   It's very cool, and we will put in our show notes,
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.520]   Ken Shepherdsen just posted a blog
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.840]   post from robboke.com.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.320]   But this is one of many links,
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.200]   there's a lot of them on using your Google account
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.800]   as your open ID provider for your blog,
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.160]   it's very straightforward.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.000]   - Super cool.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.080]   - Yeah, he's got just all the text you need in here.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.360]   That's cool, that's a very simple thing to do.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.440]   All right, but we do need to move on,
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.480]   we will get to some of the weeks, Google news,
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.080]   in just a little bit, I was able,
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.680]   a little earlier to order an iPhone, I'm sad to say.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.840]   - You actually got to the process?
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.560]   - I actually got through it, well I want to see.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.400]   - Good for you.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.560]   - I'm on my wallet's lightened by $761,
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.760]   'cause I didn't qualify, 'cause I make the mistake
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.280]   of buying one every time Apple dangles it in front of my eyes.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.240]   We'll talk about that in all the Googly news,

[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:15.880]   We thank you so much for their support for this week in Google.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.400]   So we were, I see a post here from a,
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.280]   you Jeff on the Google operating system, Chrome OS.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:29.280]   It's Google's done so well with Android.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.800]   You often wonder with their Chrome OS,
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.440]   but they're still going full speed ahead with this thing.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.400]   - I still wonder if it's not just right-hand left-hand.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.680]   - Just too many, two different groups.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:47.240]   - Yeah, I don't know that I get the strategy, but.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.440]   I just, we become such Android fans.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.960]   In fact, one of the reasons I ordered the iPhone
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.320]   is only because my HTC Nexus One, hands-on.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.680]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.320]   - Well I can't say I'm going to the iPhone
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.280]   'cause we talked to you out of yours, Jeff.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.760]   - It's off, eat my Android.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.760]   (laughing)
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.960]   - I'm just gonna try it, Jeff.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.080]   I'm just gonna try it.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:11.240]   If, I still love my Nexus One, in fact, running for you,
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.600]   2.2 is just awesome.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.160]   - I still don't have it.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.240]   - It didn't push it out to you?
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.600]   - No, it hasn't pushed out yet.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.200]   It should, it should.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.320]   - Well that's weird.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.160]   - It should stand.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.680]   - You're on T-Mobile, right, Jeff?
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.880]   - Yeah.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.520]   - By the way, T-Mobile should work very well in Berlin.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.640]   - Well, 'cause my account doesn't really do that,
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.320]   so I signed on for Truephone.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.640]   - Ah.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.080]   - And I'm gonna try that here.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.600]   - Ah.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.360]   - But otherwise I'm using the iPhone.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.520]   - Interesting.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.000]   Yeah, no, my problem with Nexus One
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.040]   and others have had this problem is that the,
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.800]   and I think this is the one thing I don't like about Android
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.240]   is this top switch that you, you know,
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.040]   wake the thing up with, it died.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.880]   And of course I can't wake the phone up.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:53.960]   (laughing)
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.160]   Wake up, I know it's there.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.560]   I know it's alive, the little ball will blink.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.320]   If I connect it to USB, my--
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.200]   - Oh.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.480]   - So it has powered everything.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.520]   - Well, yeah, so what I used to pop the battery,
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.240]   'cause I thought, well, maybe it's a software thing,
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.600]   pop the battery, and now I can't turn on the phone.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.560]   It won't go on, so now I know it's a Switch-Scent software.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.040]   - I gotta do a sign in your Evo and everything will be there.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.040]   So that's the good news.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.680]   - I do love that feature.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.800]   I do love that feature.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.640]   So are you using the Evo now more?
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.880]   And Gina got both, of course, from Google.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.600]   - Yeah, no, I'm actually still,
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.920]   I'm sticking with the Nexus One for now.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.280]   I really like Froyo and a friend of mine
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.080]   is sticking up buying Evo, so I gave him the Evo
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.960]   to kind of test drive for a little while, yeah, so.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.840]   - I like the Evo, but same with you,
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.520]   as you say, I decided to stick with that next time.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.920]   - Still wait for, did you really ever play
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.640]   with the incredible, you know?
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.160]   - No, and I think if I had,
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.560]   if I were gonna go with Verizon,
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.760]   I would absolutely get an incredible,
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.920]   but I need GSM.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.760]   - Yeah.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.600]   - You know, I really need GSM.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.280]   - That's the thing, if you travel, for sure.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   - Yeah.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.040]   - So it looks like Chrome OS is coming out Q4 this year,
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.720]   and did you hear about Cremoting?
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.600]   This is a word that I'm kind of obsessed with.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.040]   - Cremoting, what is that?
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.640]   - Cremoting.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.640]   Someone dug up on one of the Google mailing lists
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   about Cremos that it's gonna have this feature
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.760]   that they're calling right now, Cremoting.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.320]   It's not the official feature name,
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.000]   but it's basically Remote Desktop.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.640]   So you can Remote Desktop into another PC
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.560]   and use applications there.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.400]   - Built in?
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.400]   - From Chrome OS, yes.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.240]   Yes.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.800]   - I think that's interesting.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.720]   - Yeah.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.560]   - Yeah.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.720]   - What's another kind of cloud thing,
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.320]   except your cloud is in your whole machine, not in the cloud.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.560]   - Yeah, it's an internal, personal cloud.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.400]   - Yeah.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.240]   - Right.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.080]   - Right.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.080]   It's interesting though, 'cause it kind of makes,
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.760]   it makes devices that run Chrome OS kind of a compliment
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.360]   to another device, kind of,
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.800]   this is kind of my thing with the iPad,
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.280]   is that it's a peripheral, you know what I mean?
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.640]   You have to connect it to something.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.600]   I mean, at least initially, right?
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.720]   I mean, it's kind of built to sync with another machine.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.160]   It's not like you could buy an iPad
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.080]   and you necessarily and just use it,
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.960]   although if you synced it once you could.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.240]   But Cremos kind of struck me too,
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.600]   is like, did, you know,
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.600]   is Cremos one of the options for a new Google employee
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.560]   as like one of their, you know, operations?
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.200]   - Yeah, what's the story there, Chris?
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.760]   - But which part about the new options?
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.240]   (laughing)
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.200]   - What operating systems were you offered when you started?
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.360]   - Chris is like me tonight.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.800]   - I was offered a PC, Mac or Linux.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.640]   - Oh, you did have a choice.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.400]   And Colleen and whatever they just a month ago said
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.280]   she was only given Mac or Linux as a choice.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.120]   So I guess that's--
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.880]   - And a Cremos wasn't a choice.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.840]   - It's not mature enough.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.280]   You couldn't do anything with Cremos, yeah.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.120]   Really?
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.880]   I'm glad it's coming along.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.720]   Why not?
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.080]   The more the merrier.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.920]   But I'm still--
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.760]   - That's great.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.600]   - Yeah, I love it.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.520]   I use, by the way, it's just, it's basically Crem, right?
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.880]   I mean, it's just, you do everything through Crem, no?
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.760]   - Yeah, I mean, this is sort of like the story
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.960]   of the web as platform.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.800]   - Right.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.960]   - I think it's pretty exciting to see that.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.800]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.840]   And it's kind of worth bringing up.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.920]   I did some work last fall with Mozilla before I joined Google.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.800]   And this has been something that's been very challenging
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.080]   and a lot of the stuff that I've worked on.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.520]   I don't know if you know, but I was one of the co-founders
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.320]   of Flock, the social browser, which I guess is just Flock.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.400]   - I've came out with a new story today,
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.320]   which is actually being, you know,
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.840]   another being built on Chromium.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.800]   - Oh, 'cause they were a Mozilla browser.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.640]   - Yeah.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.480]   - Oh.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.320]   - That's a big story.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.160]   - I'm very happy about that.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.520]   - That's a huge shift.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.360]   - It is.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.560]   You can actually download the new beta,
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.040]   which is Windows only, unfortunately, so I can't try it.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.080]   But actually, if you go to beta.flock.com,
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.280]   you should be able to find it.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.760]   But anyway, the point is that what I think
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.600]   is interesting about what's going on with this stuff
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.440]   is this confluence, or I guess the nexus
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.520]   of the browser and the OS.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.960]   And one of the things that I've been working on a lot,
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.960]   and we started the conversation with this,
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.000]   is around identity and where identity should sort of exist.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.080]   Should it live in a browser or should it live in the OS?
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.600]   And what is the difference between the two?
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.800]   And especially if you have a shared computing device,
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   you log into the browser,
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.720]   which then logs you into all your web services,
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.800]   or do you log into the operating system,
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.640]   which then logs you into the browser,
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.560]   which then logs you into all your web services.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.000]   So with Chrome OS, I think one of the cool ideas
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   is to be able to log into the OS,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.760]   which also logs you into all your web services.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.000]   And now you can sort of not worry about
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.720]   managing passwords and all that other stuff.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.280]   - It kind of like how Android works, right?
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.640]   I mean, you kind of design it with different accounts,
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.120]   your Facebook account, your Gmail account,
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.120]   your Google account, and then things just work, right?
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.680]   'Cause they know it logs you in automatically, yeah.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.920]   - Yeah.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.920]   - I wanna try the new flock.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.960]   I was always a fan of flock.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.960]   flock is a social browser that is at browser level,
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.360]   logging you into all your accounts.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:42.080]   But that's how you use Friend Feed Facebook, Twitter,
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.680]   Flickr, you use it in a browser.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.080]   It's the only way you would use it, really.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.480]   - Well, that's the thing about the browser too,
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.120]   is that it's of course the one application that you use
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.560]   that kind of knows all of your accounts,
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.480]   knows all your passwords.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.160]   So you have to trust it a whole lot.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.280]   And the fact that the browser hasn't really changed
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.840]   in even the last decade,
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.720]   I mean, even since Firefox came out,
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.160]   to try to understand you and your profiles
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.040]   and your personas as you go across the web
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.200]   and how you behave differently and use different accounts
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.040]   or different names in different places,
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.520]   I think is a huge opportunity.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.880]   And something that I hope we see, I guess,
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.960]   more thought and more innovation on.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.040]   Especially with mobile devices, whether it's a Chrome OS
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.240]   or Chrome tablet or it's an iPad or whatever it's gonna be,
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.960]   the ability to just pick up a device,
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.080]   sign into it and have all of your friends
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.480]   and all your services available to you
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.680]   without having to sign into each one incrementally.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.120]   I think it's gonna be a major innovation
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.440]   and something that's extremely important
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.320]   for the future of making this stuff more accessible
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.120]   to a wider audience.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.400]   - I guess I was the last person in the world
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.440]   still using Google Web Alerts.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.440]   I don't, I don't.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.760]   (laughs)
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.480]   - No, I use them, I use them.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.960]   - That's my vanity search.
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.960]   It's how I check to see how I'm doing in the world.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.160]   - What people are saying about you?
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.320]   - What are they saying about me?
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.920]   So it turns out it was just you and me, Gina.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.520]   (laughs)
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.480]   - I actually use it, a friend of mine is involved
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.400]   in a court case and I have a news alert
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.840]   for any news around it.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.840]   So I actually don't use it just for ego stuff,
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.560]   although I do use it for ego stuff too.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.200]   - So last week Google announced
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.360]   it's not gonna offer alerts for web search results.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.560]   We'll replace them with comprehensive alerts.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.300]   That includes web and Google News and blog.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:26.160]   Marcel Gordon, who is the project manager for Google Alerts
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.080]   says, "Web alerts weren't very popular."
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.120]   So what's the difference?
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:33.840]   So it's a very, very subtle difference, right?
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.200]   So it's just web search results
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.520]   versus results for everything, news, blog.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.360]   - Oh, okay.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.520]   Well, that's what I was getting anyway, was everything.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.000]   - Yeah, I mean, if you had your alert just set to web,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.200]   it's gonna get switched to everything,
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.360]   which means you might get a few more alerts.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.320]   And if you do, you can just adjust the frequency
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.560]   or whatever, but yeah, I mean,
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.240]   they're just kind of pairing down the options,
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.920]   which seems reasonable.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.840]   That's really just a simplification.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.520]   It's not really a loss of functionality.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.640]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.760]   This implication is good.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.960]   - I was scared for a minute.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:07.600]   Yeah, I've had it type everything I think anyway,
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.560]   'cause I wanted everything anybody says about me.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.560]   - I wanna know.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.000]   It's the conversation.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   It's not pure ego, it's conversation.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.200]   - Well, my case is pure.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.040]   - It's how I justify it.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.400]   - Yeah, it's kind of a situation, it's what it is.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.080]   - You know, what makes sense to me is
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:27.120]   that there is absolutely no way that I can find
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.080]   to use Tectorati the way I used to use it,
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.080]   which was just that.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   - Yeah, I missed that.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:32.920]   - Yes.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.760]   - Oh, I do too.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.600]   - Why does it exist?
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.440]   What does it do?
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.280]   I have no idea.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.120]   - Yeah.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:37.960]   - Yeah.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.480]   - We should get Gabe on and he could explain it to us.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.360]   - Google researcher gives Microsoft five days
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.360]   to fix XP zero-day bug.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.560]   We were talking about this on security now, yesterday.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.040]   Now we should let you know it's only Windows Server 2003
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:55.160]   and XP, but a Google engineer today published an attack code
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.880]   that exploits a zero-day vulnerability.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.880]   I don't think he did it under the auspices of Google.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.880]   Travis Ormondy is a security worker
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.320]   for Google in Switzerland.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:09.000]   He says, "Hey, I told him five days ago,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.800]   "this has always been an issue in the security community
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.680]   "is how long you give an operating system or company
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.280]   "to fix the flaw before you publicize it."
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.880]   And in some cases, it could be six months.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:24.880]   I know when I was talking to Matt Conier from WOOO.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.400]   He said, "There's been, we, we,
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.240]   "I love the name of these companies."
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.240]   - Yeah, how could you say that with the stream list?
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.080]   - WOOO!
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.960]   - I think they were selling apps from WOOO!
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.360]   They're good security companies.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.240]   He said, "We know of an Apple flaw
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.720]   "that they haven't fixed in a year."
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.560]   This was some years ago,
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.640]   but they haven't fixed in a year.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.560]   And I think there are considerable Apple flaws
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.880]   that partially from the open source software
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.960]   and the Darwin layer that just have been hanging out there
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.960]   for ages, everybody knows about them,
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.800]   but Apple just doesn't fix them.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.240]   We just got a big Apple 200 megabyte push today.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:01.200]   So, nothing much to say about it.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.800]   I guess that's not really a Google story,
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.600]   but except for this connection to it.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.680]   - But it's not really Google versus Microsoft, right?
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.360]   I mean, this person didn't post as a Google employee
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.600]   trying to shame Microsoft, right?
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.640]   I mean, he's a security guy.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.480]   He just happens to be a researcher for Google.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.960]   It seemed, I mean, you know, he let them know,
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.840]   I mean, you have to kind of assume that people
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.880]   who are trying to exploit Windows PC
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.720]   - They must know by now.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.720]   - know about the exploit.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.560]   They already know.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.400]   - That's the theory.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.440]   - So it's kind of better, right, that everyone knows.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.880]   - After a while, the bad guys know,
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.080]   so now it's really time to step up.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.760]   - Well, there's a protocol for this too.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.080]   I mean, and I think that the protocol was more or less
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.360]   followed where you do give proper notice
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.880]   and enough time so that changes can be made
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.960]   and fixes can be rolled out.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.440]   And then if they don't, then that's more and more time
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.640]   where that vulnerability is kind of out there unpatched.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.320]   So it's hard to say that they did anything wrong.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.160]   - Right.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.600]   Five days is fast, but that's the only issue.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.120]   Google said his personal views and disclosure
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.920]   don't reflect the views of his colleagues
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.080]   or Google stance on disclosure as a whole.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.720]   So he's working on his own.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:07.800]   Much more serious headache for Google,
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.360]   the issue of this, and I think it's a bogus issue.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.960]   I think every security expert agrees
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.560]   of this collection of private data from Wi-Fi networks.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.560]   Google, just to update you,
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.560]   if you haven't heard the story,
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.840]   Google, when it was sending its Street View cars around,
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.000]   was also mapping Wi-Fi access points,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.560]   as you would completely expect it to do,
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:33.760]   matching SSIDs to MAC addresses.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.360]   And in the process gathering some data,
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.520]   only on unencrypted Wi-Fi access spots,
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.920]   that data being useful in this process.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.560]   However, when they were doing a survey,
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.800]   an assay of what they were up to in Germany,
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.880]   I think it was, where there are serious
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.320]   anti-Street View privacy concerns,
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.760]   they discovered this was being snapped,
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.680]   these snippets of data were being collected,
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.520]   they revealed it, had they turned the information
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.360]   over to Germany?
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.280]   I'm not sure yet if they--
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.520]   - I think they finally did.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.280]   Part of the problem was that evidently,
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.320]   the way I heard it in Germany was that Google was first asked
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.640]   and said they didn't respond,
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.040]   and then it came up later,
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.560]   and they're wacky about this here,
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.440]   they're just wacky.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.240]   - Well, we're about to be wacky here in the States.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:25.280]   30 separate States attorneys general are now,
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.040]   looking into whether Google violated any laws
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.080]   with this Street View mapping.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.440]   - Well, this is the thing, they're all like,
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.520]   we just, we, there better be a law here that's getting broken,
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.720]   we just have to figure out what it is.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.440]   - And we should point out, first of all,
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.160]   that this data is very fragmentary,
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.320]   because it's-- - There's no vehicles.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.400]   - Yes, yes.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.120]   - Or the chances that there's anything
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:52.000]   that's personally identifiable and informative in that,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.840]   is nil.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.640]   - And incidentally, these were all unencrypted,
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:59.560]   I mean, this data is being sent out in non fragmentary fashion
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.800]   all the time by these access points.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.480]   Anybody wanted to sit outside and camp outside,
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.240]   I could capture it easily.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.640]   Richard Blumenthal started this Connecticut attorney general,
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.560]   he says violating legitimate expectations of privacy
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.560]   on the part of both homeowners and business people
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.280]   is an extraordinarily serious issue.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.320]   This is all just campaigning.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.800]   - I mean, okay, fine, I mean, I get the point,
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.000]   it's like you don't expect that a car driving by your home
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.320]   is recording the data, being transferred
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.480]   over your open network, fine, that's true, okay.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.320]   You have that expectation, that's not happening.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.200]   And there was one issue that was brought up
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.800]   that the code, the mistaken code that dealt with this data,
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.640]   dumped the encrypted data, but logged the unencrypted data.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.080]   - 'Cause the encrypted data is garbage.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.280]   - Well, right, it's just garbage.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.080]   - It can't be used in any way.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.040]   - It can't be used in any way, but this is the point
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.520]   that someone, you know, this new story is making,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.800]   was like, if this was really just a mistake, you know,
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.520]   why was the code even differentiating
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.880]   between the encrypted and unencrypted?
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.520]   - Because that's the sensible thing to do,
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.880]   if I think they were using, well, not wire shark,
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.520]   they were using, what was the program they were using?
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:08.240]   - It's just a common open source capture program for--
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.120]   - Perfect genius saying that why would you--
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.200]   - Because the program knows that the encrypted data
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.600]   is random nonsense.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.800]   - Yeah, but why would you keep the unencrypted data?
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.640]   - Why would you keep anything?
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.240]   - Well, because SSIDs, you need the packets
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.000]   for SSIDs and other information is in the packets.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.240]   So you could, what's happening is you're driving along.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.600]   - So you're coming along with ride.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.600]   - Yeah, you're driving along very fast, taking pictures.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.440]   And--
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.760]   - I hope you don't drive like that, like--
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.920]   (laughing)
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.480]   - It's like Mr. Toad's wild ride.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.680]   - There's some trap off.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.080]   - You're driving along.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.280]   And so what you're also doing is you're saying SSID,
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.040]   you know, I see an access point, access point.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.320]   By the way, for purposes of geolocation,
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.800]   which is what this is all about,
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.040]   encrypted or unencrypted doesn't matter,
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.320]   but you capture these packets and apparently,
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.160]   it was a Kismet, yeah, it was Kismet.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.280]   Apparently, you know, what they were doing
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.600]   is not trying to match the GPS information
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:06.080]   to the SSID or MAC address information in real time.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:06.920]   Why bother?
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:10.200]   Just you record to the hard drive GPS, GPS, GPS,
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.720]   what kind of garbage is coming in?
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.040]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.600]   as you're going down the road.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.480]   Now, maybe Kismet's smart enough to say,
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.320]   well, I know I'm not gonna get any good information
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.800]   out of the encrypted packets,
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.280]   so I'm just not even gonna save them,
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.120]   not gonna waste the hard drive space.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.440]   Then they later, now the mistake,
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.520]   they probably should have thrown this data out
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.080]   after they did the crunching.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:29.920]   - Right.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.960]   I think that was an error.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:32.960]   I don't think it was like,
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.120]   - Well, what about this report that it was a rogue employee?
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.800]   - This was the thing, right?
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.560]   They're saying it was a rogue employee,
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.400]   it wasn't just some sort of,
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.960]   it just wasn't an innocent mistake
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.800]   because it was dumping the encrypted data,
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.240]   but not keeping the unencrypted.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.800]   So, you know, that was kind of the action issue.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.200]   - And anybody who's smart enough to use this
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.880]   knows that they're not getting anything of value at all.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.400]   - Well, well, this is the issue, right?
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.800]   It's like what, you know, I mean,
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.520]   if I were Google and I really wanted to record
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:41:59.920]   what people did on their networks,
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.480]   I would do it through like Google DNS.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.720]   I mean, I would do it in a much different way.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.560]   - They have Gmail.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.640]   - They have Gmail.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.640]   - Right, they have Gmail.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.640]   I mean, they have so much,
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.480]   they have your history.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.280]   There's so many other better channels to collect data
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.880]   about you if they really want to do.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:12.760]   And it does seem like,
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.760]   what could they possibly do with these fragments of data
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:16.600]   from these networks?
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.080]   I don't know, I don't know.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.640]   I mean, I suppose while--
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.640]   - You are in the PRP kits.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.120]   - I have to.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.800]   - Over here in Germany, it's just awful
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.720]   because I'll come in defending Google and get shot at
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.920]   every meeting I go to and media is just Google mad.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.160]   Even though, again, Germany has the largest penetration
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.520]   of anywhere in the world, 90 some percent penetration
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.360]   by the actual people,
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.640]   but media and government are going Google wacky.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.280]   - Yeah, I mean, who'd be as if the Google Street cars
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.280]   rolled down the street with an open microphone
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.880]   and recorded ambient sound, right?
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.720]   I mean, what--
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.520]   - Well, they go wacky about that here.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.880]   (laughs)
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.920]   They go back, last night I gave a talk in Munich
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:00.000]   and some guys said basically,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   they were looking at somebody's iPad and said,
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.560]   "Well, I see my picture is there on the iPad
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:04.400]   "and it was transmitted."
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.800]   I said, "You're in a public place!"
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.640]   - Yeah, come on.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.240]   - I didn't get the rights to do that.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.200]   (laughs)
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.040]   - I think--
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.560]   - So what are you gonna require that you can't take a picture
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.080]   of anyone anywhere on life now unless you go up
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.600]   and get their legal sign off and some sir?
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.040]   - Well, apparently somebody took a picture of Marissa Meyer
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.200]   and it's true, we'll talk about that
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.200]   in just a little bit, there's a tease.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.320]   There's a tease for you, before we do that.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.400]   (laughs)
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.480]   - Talk a little bit about one of our great sponsors,
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.640]   a new sponsor, we're really glad to have them.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.560]   I've been looking for a while for the best place
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.760]   to do domain name registration
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.080]   and I know that for a lot of people,
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.320]   that's something that we're looking for
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:41.560]   a better company to do this with.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.240]   Not the cheapest necessarily,
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:46.240]   although it is the same price as most of these other guys.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.200]   But one that's gonna give you great service
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.680]   that's gonna not bog you down with 50 clicks
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.320]   before you can buy, and I found it, hover.com.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.360]   They've been around for a while.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.680]   I've used a two cast registration before.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:02.680]   This is two cast news site, hover.ver.com.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.880]   It's all about making domain registration
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.440]   and service absolutely easy.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.280]   You don't get barraged with pages and pages
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:15.040]   of upsell offers, they make it easy to register.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.600]   They used to be domains direct.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.560]   They rebranded it to hover.com.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.120]   And if you use hover Monday through Friday,
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.600]   9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern,
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.680]   and you want to get customer service,
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.560]   there is a new no hold policy.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.200]   You will call and someone will answer.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.240]   And that's it.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.120]   They won't put you on hold.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.480]   That's Monday, during business hours,
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.760]   Simple name, simple place to go,
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.280]   twit.hover.com and get 10% off your next domain name
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.480]   registration if you use them.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.440]   And we have moved all of our sites over
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.240]   and I have to say clean, easy to use,
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:54.240]   twit.hover.com.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.960]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.000]   These are great people.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.640]   I've known these guys for a long time
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.520]   and I was really glad that we could get them on the shows
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:09.520]   and on the Twit network, twit.hover.com, 10% off your next
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.280]   domain name registration and none of that up selling garbage.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:18.320]   So Marissa Meyer is riding in a limo,
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.240]   limo coach.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.240]   A bus?
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.240]   A bus?
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.240]   A bus?
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:24.240]   A limo?
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.240]   It's a bus.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.240]   And somebody snaps her picture.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.240]   And then somehow it gets into a stock photography.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:36.240]   And it's now part of an ad for a 14 passenger stretch Hummer.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:42.240]   She was a bridesmaid at her brother's wedding in Minneapolis.
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.240]   Like she's part of the wedding party.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.240]   So somehow one of the photos turned up in like an ad.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.240]   It's an ad.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:54.240]   The funny thing is you cannot, there's no an anonymity anymore.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.240]   Your picture snaps.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.240]   Somebody will see it somewhere saying, "Hmm, that looks like Marissa Meyer."
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.240]   And they tweeted it.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:05.240]   The tweet was something like, "Pretty sure I just spotted Marissa Meyer in a stock
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.240]   and wedding photo on a website."
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.240]   And Marissa admits it.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.240]   Yeah, that was me.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.240]   Yeah, she handled it really well.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.240]   What are you going to say, right?
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.240]   Yeah, what are you going to say?
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.240]   She said, "You know, nice spot, smiley face."
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.240]   Best live-oh ever.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.240]   She's seat.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.240]   I think that's good.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.240]   I think that's just great.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.240]   I just, you know...
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.240]   I'm great too.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:27.240]   That's just, she's a real person.
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.240]   Yeah, she is.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.240]   Let's see.
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:34.240]   Google Music Store, are we excited about this?
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.240]   It looks like fall now for the Google Music Store.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.240]   If it makes music on Android better, then yes.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.240]   Very excited.
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:45.240]   And that's probably the best way to use it, right?
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.240]   It'll be an Android feature or what?
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:52.240]   It seems like streaming to Android would be a really huge big exciting deal.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:56.240]   I still haven't moved podcast to Android.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.240]   How is that?
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.240]   Easy.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.240]   I mean, this is the thing.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.240]   I use Double Twist, which is free.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:05.240]   Mac or Windows, DoubleTwist.com.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:07.240]   By its DVD, John's new business.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.240]   It looks just like iTunes.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.240]   It does podcast.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.240]   It does audio.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.240]   It does video.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   It gets your iTunes playlists and even syncs those.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.240]   And you can buy music in Amazon.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.240]   '73, yeah.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.240]   So it's, you know, got a store.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.240]   I don't know.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.240]   What more could Google Music do?
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.240]   I don't know.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.240]   It just seems like this is, to me, this is all I really need.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.240]   And see, you can subscribe to PyX.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.240]   You can even install Android apps from here, which I really like.
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.240]   Oh.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:39.240]   So the Android market is there and there's apps and you just install them.
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.240]   It's just like iTunes.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.240]   Anyway, that's--
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.240]   So now you manage your podcast through Double Twist, Leo?
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.240]   I mean, I know.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.240]   I use Listen.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.240]   I use Listen too.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.240]   Just because--
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.240]   This is all I need, really.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.240]   I just don't connect my phone to my computer very much because I don't really have to.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.240]   The only time I do it, actually, is when I need to sync music.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:03.240]   Well, the reason I do, because the USB charge port here at the office is connected to the
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.240]   computer.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.240]   So--
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.240]   And if you put Double Twist--
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.240]   By the way, this should be my tool of the week, but it isn't.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.240]   But if there's an Android app called Double Twist.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:14.880]   And if you put that on, then it automatically goes into USB mode when you connect.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:19.520]   The Double Twist app on the Android is a very nice music player, but it also just kind of
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.160]   says, wake up Double Twist.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.200]   And so it gets more and more like iTunes all the time.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.200]   I like it.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:29.240]   And by the way, one of the reasons I like it for podcasts is because one of the most popular
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.240]   podcasts on here--
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.240]   Nice.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.240]   --have to read it.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.240]   --twig.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.320]   --twig is on there as well.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.360]   So we have friends.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.720]   We have friends at Double Twist.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:44.720]   I just typed in Double Twist into my ender phone, and it suggested Socialist.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.720]   Socialist?
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:48.720]   My--
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:55.320]   I downloaded an earthquake app this week because, you know, my house was shaking and I was like,
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.320]   "Well, you're standing angle.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.320]   That's right.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.320]   You had an earthquake."
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.320]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.200]   And the earthquake app is very good, by the way.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.000]   And there are a lot of earthquakes around the world.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   Often, I wasn't aware of this until I installed the earthquake app.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   It's very cool.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.640]   I'm a Google Android developer advocate.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.640]   Oh, me?
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.800]   --vio hire, I think his name is.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.920]   But yeah, it's a pretty cool app.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.640]   So yes, that's what I was doing as the earth was shaking.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.120]   I was like, "There's got to be an app for this.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.920]   I heard that there is an app for earthquake detection."
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:23.920]   There's an app for that.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.920]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:25.920]   Trade Mark Apple, never mind.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:26.920]   Forget I said that.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:27.920]   Yeah, we said that.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.920]   Forget I mentioned that.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:30.920]   No, it's not.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:35.400]   You know, the really number one reason to use-- the thing I will-- if I end up using
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:40.200]   the iPhone that I will miss the most is the integration of Google Voice with the Android
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.200]   operating system.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.960]   It just becomes the voice mail.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.840]   You can make Google Voice calls.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.640]   You can even say, "I haven't set for any international call I make goes through Google
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.640]   Voice, but you can have all your calls go through Google Voice.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.640]   It's just as nicely integrated."
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:56.360]   Ikeena Witch, one of the stories is Google Voice is integrated with Gmail as a web service.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.360]   Now, how's that going to work?
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.240]   Apparently, this is inside the firewall at Google right now.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:05.240]   I won't put Chris in the spot, but that's what that story says.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.240]   Have you tried it?
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.240]   Chris doesn't know nothing.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.240]   I know nothing.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:13.120]   This is always an issue when we have Google employees.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.480]   We should say that when you're a Google employee and you come on the show, you come as a private
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.920]   individual and we won't put you on the spot that way.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.920]   So you don't have to--
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:21.920]   You should put a gag.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:22.920]   You should just put in your mouth and--
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.920]   Yeah, there should be a universal signal.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.120]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.120]   Zippit.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.120]   Zipp.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.120]   Zipp.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.120]   Zipp.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:33.120]   You know, nothing.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:41.960]   It's the Google system.blogspot.com blog, the unofficial Google operating system blog.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.920]   Google tests a new feature that makes Gmail chat more useful.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:48.040]   Users are able to make and receive Google Voice calls from Gmail.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.040]   So I guess it uses the chat that's in Gmail.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.520]   Well, it says here I just didn't realize this is fairly obvious, I guess, but if you
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.280]   want to call someone using Google Voice, you need a phone.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.280]   Right.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.280]   Now--
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.280]   Oh, but that's key.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.280]   You later not do that.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.000]   That's the weird thing about Google Voice is that what it does is it calls you.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   It places--
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   It's like your secretary.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.520]   It places a call and then calls you with the call.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.480]   So if you don't have a phone, you can't--
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.480]   Right.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.760]   So this obviously needs for having the phone, which is great because I never have my phone
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.760]   at my desk and I always--
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.880]   I'm like running-- dashing across the apartment because I hear it ringing in the other room.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.760]   So it calls your Google chat?
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:25.200]   So yeah, it looks like the way this would work is that it would-- yeah, ring your Google
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.200]   chat.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   So I mean--
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.200]   That's the great.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.200]   It's great.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.200]   I mean, Google Chat has voice chat now, right?
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.200]   This would just--
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.200]   This is Gizmo.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.200]   Gizmo 5.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.200]   The other thing--
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.200]   I can't find the darn clip.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.200]   I was looking for it again.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:40.760]   But what a report had it and right now Chris is going to swallow his tongue is that there
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:47.480]   was an effort to do a Gizmo desktop app, but that the founders didn't want to do anything
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:48.480]   that was outside of browser.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.480]   They only wanted to do browser stuff.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.560]   It would have been separate apps.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:56.920]   So maybe this is a way to still handle the problem by incorporating with Gmail.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.360]   Now, I still have Gizmo 5.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.360]   I still have--
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.360]   Does it still work?
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.600]   I still have my Gizmo 5 app.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:04.600]   I should try it.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.720]   I haven't logged in in a while.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.200]   They didn't shut it down, did they?
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.440]   No, I don't think that was the issue.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:16.440]   Gizmo is great because it's a SIP client, which means you can use it with asterisk or,
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:19.160]   you know, it's a SIP phone basically.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:26.120]   And I presume then that means that Google Chat now is a SIP client, which means maybe
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:33.680]   I'm reading too much into this, that you could use it with any SIP provider.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.680]   We're in an interesting world.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.680]   I'll tell you when it comes to telecommunications.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.160]   Yeah, we're in a scary world.
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:45.720]   Are you starting the rant I did last week about AT&T I did on NPR's on the media this
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:46.720]   week.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:52.520]   It just-- I'm really just upset that the clock is back on the internet.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:57.280]   Now I was talking to some publishers here in Germany and they're doing paid iPhone apps.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.280]   And I said, watch out.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:03.880]   What's going to happen is if somebody really loves your iPad app rather and uses it a lot,
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:08.320]   they're going to go over their limit on their phone bill and they're going to blame you.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:16.240]   Well that's why I love things like Google Voice and SIP and Gizmo because it's going
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.120]   to disintermediate all this and all these big telcos.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.040]   It's all going to be-- it's got to all be data at some point.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.040]   I know they don't like that.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.840]   Yeah, but you're going to get charged extra for the data at AT&T.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:25.840]   Oh.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:28.080]   Are you still getting your service from your telco?
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.400]   Yeah, I guess you're right.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:31.160]   Yeah, so you're still screwing with--
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:34.400]   This is why I was very disappointed that Google, even though they could have did not
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.840]   bid on that 700 megahertz spectrum.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:40.640]   I want Google to go into the ISP business.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.000]   Do you think-- I mean, would that make sense at some point?
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.120]   Would that be-- that's really the thing that needs to be disintermediated.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:51.120]   We need to take it out of the hands of these private providers.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.160]   Is that the white space space?
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.160]   No.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.440]   What's the white space spectrum?
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.520]   It's not the white space spectrum.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:00.200]   It was the-- it was that old television, the UHF--
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   Right.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.200]   VHF spectrum.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:08.280]   But the white space is what Larry and Sergey have been talking about as Wi-Fi on steroids.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:14.800]   When is the fate of that settle as to whether it's going to be unlicensed or sold?
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:15.800]   I don't know.
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:16.800]   That's a good question.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.400]   What is the frequency of this white space?
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.040]   Where are we?
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.760]   Where are we talking about?
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.440]   FCC pressed to move on white space spectrum.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:32.760]   So the FCC is obviously going to have to do something about this.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.880]   Senators from both sides of the aisle pressuring the FCC to stop talking about what should
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:41.160]   and could be done with the unused white spaces of unused spectrum and start enacting policy
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.160]   to take advantage of it.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.320]   It is part of the national broadband plan.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:53.760]   They wanted to get this done in one of 360 recommendations in the broadband plan.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:55:00.040]   That to me is the key, is so key because what we had, the solution to this is competition.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.040]   Right.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.840]   But should the government go into this competition?
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:03.840]   No.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.800]   No, they should open it up so that we have open competition and that's what Google's
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.800]   been saying.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:10.840]   Right now we have a quadropply.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:11.840]   Right.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:18.440]   By the way, a new version of iTunes just came out moments ago.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:24.520]   iTunes 9.2 designed a sync with the iPhone to enjoy your favorite music, movies, TV shows,
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:25.520]   books and more on the go.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.040]   I don't know if that means Wi-Fi sync.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.560]   Sync and read books with an iPhone or iPod touch, organizing sync PDF documents.
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.960]   No, this is all the stuff they've been talking about.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.960]   I would love to see you.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:40.280]   This is another advantage that Android phones have is the ability to sync over Wi-Fi with
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.040]   things like Google listen.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:45.480]   You don't have to cook it up to a computer.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.120]   I like that a lot.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.120]   You know what?
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.120]   Maybe I'm not going to use that piece of crap iPhone.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.120]   I'm going to stick with my next one.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.840]   I'm going to get it fixed.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.320]   The hell with it.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.320]   The hell with it.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:56.320]   Apple.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:57.320]   I'm going to come to the cottage.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.800]   I just want to see the display.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:03.360]   Yeah, come over and see the display and then leave without my iPhone.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:10.240]   Apple pre-orders for the iPhone on day one, which was yesterday, hit 600,000.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:15.880]   That's more orders than ever in the history of mankind, the largest Apple pre-order, single
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.080]   day pre-order ever.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:25.040]   AT&T sold out all the devices that it allocated for early ordering, so they turned it off.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:28.040]   I was just able this morning to buy one from Apple though.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.400]   On their site?
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.400]   It was back up now.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.600]   I don't know how many sales they lost yesterday because there's stuff.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.600]   I tried to get through yesterday.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.800]   Couldn't get through it all.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.280]   So July 14 is the ship date before.
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.280]   That's what it says on mine.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   What does that mean?
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.280]   Does that mean I'll get it?
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:49.440]   No, they always do that.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:55.840]   They ship it and then it sits in the UPS facility until when they're good and ready.
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:00.960]   So it's still the 25th before we'll get it, I imagine.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:04.480]   Apple stores at San Francisco and New York staff recommended customers try ordering the
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:06.480]   device later.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:13.000]   They ordered it to pick up at the store, but the fear is we're still going to have to
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.200]   go wait in a stupid line even though it's pre-ordered.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.840]   Stores will open at 7 a.m.
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:19.880]   In case you want to get the line early.
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:20.880]   Apple loves this.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.880]   They love this.
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:22.880]   They want you to wait in line.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:23.880]   And you just do it.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:27.080]   Yeah, you guys just do it.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.880]   It's amazing.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:34.160]   The power of this company to market is just truly amazing.
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:39.720]   We're going to take a break, come back with our picks, our tools and our tips.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:44.600]   I should mention that this is actually an appropriate story about the Ford Sync ad that
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:50.280]   Ford, according to CNET, Ford owners like me with Sync-enabled vehicles will be able
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:55.760]   to tap into Google Maps to download directions to their cars before months end.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:04.520]   You know, you should run out and buy a Mustang right now.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.080]   Get a fusion if you're sensitive to the environment.
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:10.480]   If you need something big, get one of those flexes.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:14.360]   The free Send to Sync feature announced Tuesday by 4-wheel at drivers send Google Maps data
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:19.160]   from their Bluetooth-enabled computers or mobile phones to their in-car sync systems.
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.160]   The electronic directions are done.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.120]   But see, now I already have turned by turn directions.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.240]   I'm not sure how this changes it.
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.040]   But I guess I get it from Google.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:28.760]   The route is calculated on the spot using the latest traffic information.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:32.320]   That's one of the neat things about Sync is it has the latest traffic information as
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.720]   well.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:37.600]   So I have to say, I still, you know, sometimes people will do this.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:42.380]   They'll say, my producers when we were in the Los Angeles yesterday for E3 printed out
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:43.480]   Google Maps directions.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:47.640]   Well, now you just send them to the Sync.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.440]   Map a destination at home at work wherever you have connectivity when you get in your
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.720]   car and already knows where you want to go.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.080]   Boom!
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:59:02.280]   If I might borrow a phrase from Steve Jobs, boom!
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:04.120]   Yeah, baby, I love this thing.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:08.760]   Now if you haven't taken a look at Ford Sync, I want you to go to SyncMyRidepodcast.com.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.120]   You can see all the features.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:15.120]   Of course, you have to have a Ford Lincoln or Mercury vehicle.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:18.960]   You can't just, you know, they don't have a third party aftermarket sync.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.280]   You got to buy it in the Ford.
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:23.520]   But if you're in the market for a new car, make sure.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:28.720]   You take a look at the Ford Sync in the car and or go to SyncMyRidepodcast because it's
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.720]   just great.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:30.720]   I mean, it's true.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:34.320]   And by the way, it works with Android, two hands-free calling.
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:37.040]   So you know, one of the problems with the Android phone is it doesn't have built-in voice
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.040]   calling.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:41.520]   They've got that voice calling application, but you still need to do the phone.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.720]   And a lot of Bluetooth stuff doesn't, a lot of cars don't do, you still have to pick up
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:45.720]   the phone.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:48.520]   That's not hands-free in the, in the sync, in the Ford Sync.
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:49.640]   No, you don't have to touch.
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.680]   I don't touch the phone.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:56.440]   I just, I just pair my Android phone with sync and then from then on, I don't take my hands
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:58.080]   off the wheel or the eyes off the road.
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.280]   It downloads the phone book so it knows all my contacts.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.800]   I press the button on the wheel.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.800]   I say phone.
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.600]   I say call Jeff Jarvis in Berlin.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.600]   Boom, bam.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.840]   Just like that.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.840]   It's there.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.440]   We all have to podcast for more cars.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.240]   From now on, we could podcast for a car.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.240]   Exactly.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.240]   All for Ford Mustang.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.480]   Well, you know, it's kind of cool.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:24.720]   It's kind of cool, and I talked to Alan Malali, the CEO at CES, and he kind of made a good
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.720]   point.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.840]   I think Walt Mossberg made it first though, that when you get into a car, you're kind
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.680]   of, you're suddenly disconnected from the world.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:34.120]   You go back to the, you know, the 1950s where you're just not connected.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.200]   You're driving along.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.200]   That's fine.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.920]   You know, in terms of safety, we, we, one of the problems is all these distractions.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:44.080]   So Ford wanted to make it possible for you to get in the car, still be connected to Twitter
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:49.800]   and to slacker and Pandora, to still be able to participate in the world, you know, get
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:53.640]   traffic directions, turn by turn directions, make phone calls, but safely without going,
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.600]   you know, while you're driving.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.440]   So keep your hands on the wheel.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.440]   You're eyes on the road.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.440]   You press that button on your wheel.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.440]   You could do almost anything.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.440]   It's just incredible.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.440]   Let's see.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.440]   Let me ask a question even though I know you're in mid commercial.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.440]   Yes.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.000]   So this means that unlike on Star, which has to have a separate cell account basically
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.480]   with the Ford, you're just using your cell phone.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.640]   Yes.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.480]   So for instance, okay, so, you know, that's the thing about orange stars.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.680]   If you have a, this is what they sell on all their ads.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.640]   You have a record, you know, you can call emergency.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:24.560]   Ford has this 911 assist once it's paired with your cell phone.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.040]   If the airbags are deployed, it makes a call to 911.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.280]   It sends the GPS data to the 911.
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.040]   Many 911 centers are able to get that.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:38.600]   So immediately, you know, this is one of the problems with the 911 with the cell phone 911.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.640]   They don't know where the hell you are.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:45.120]   So with this, the GPS data from sync goes to the 911.
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.200]   It sends a recorded message saying airbags have been deployed and then gives you the opportunity
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.280]   to speak if you can.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.440]   So architecturally, the one that makes so much sense about that is that you don't want
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.120]   to have to have five separate SIM cards.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.120]   Precisely.
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.120]   Right.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.120]   Precisely.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.520]   You want to be able to have one phone and use that subscription fee.
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:06.320]   You don't have to do your laptop tethering to all this stuff.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.320]   Exactly.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.320]   It's true hands free calling.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:14.840]   It's not my dual SIM for your car and your phone, but if either both are on, not neither
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.840]   works.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.840]   Right.
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.840]   So no, it's just whatever my phone is.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.120]   And by the way, it can be whatever your phone du jour is.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.120]   I pair it.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:25.840]   You compare it up to 99 phones and so if you're something like me, I even paired my iPad
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:26.840]   to my sync.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:31.640]   So I listen to music on my iPad and the phone still works.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.200]   I still have the phone capability with my phone.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.400]   So I've got two things paired.
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.400]   It's very cool.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.520]   You probably paired your newton with it.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.520]   I'm an over-pearer.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.520]   Over-pearer.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.280]   So that's enough of that.
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:50.920]   Sync available exclusively for Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:56.960]   Check it out or go to Sync My Ride podcast.com and send us to e3 sponsor.coverage and
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.320]   we have some great coverage of e3.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:01.320]   You can see more of that on the specials feed.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:08.320]   It's available there.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.320]   It was kind of fun.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.720]   You know, one of the things that was needed and this has nothing to do with Google but
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:15.720]   it was cool, the Microsoft Connect thing which seems dorky.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.600]   Were you dancing in front of the Xbox?
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.920]   But it's actually really fun and very sweaty.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.880]   Can only imagine.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.200]   Well, this is, you know what?
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.440]   In a way, I think this is good news because there's quite a few people in this country
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:36.840]   anyway who spent a little time in front of the screen.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:41.080]   And this gets you jumping and moving and it's hard work.
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.120]   But they have some good exercise stuff.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:47.360]   If you do yoga on the Connect, it looks at your pose.
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.360]   It's got two cameras.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:53.560]   It's got a Z-axis camera, an RGB camera and it's got a ray.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.800]   Yeah, and a ray microphone.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.800]   So it can see, it knows where you are in space, it knows what your face is, it recognizes
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.800]   your face.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:04.180]   So when you step in and assigns an avatar to you, you step out, somebody else steps in
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:05.680]   their avatar comes up.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.880]   Two people step in and says, "Oh, there's two people there."
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.960]   puts both avatars up, you can play.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.320]   It's really pretty sweet stuff.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:17.640]   And it, so if you're doing yoga pose, it actually analyzes and it won't go on until you get
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.640]   the pose right.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:19.640]   Nice.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:24.880]   That sounds really neat.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.640]   We did, there were two games I played.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.200]   There's a River Rafting game and an obstacle course.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.120]   In the obstacle course, you have to duck under things, jump over things, dodge out of the
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.120]   way.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.120]   It's very physical.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:38.200]   I worked up a sweat, but it was actually kind of strangely fun.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.200]   You look like an idiot.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.400]   You should only do it with friends and family.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:46.800]   I think you should record this as raw video feed of you and just put it up.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.280]   Without knowing that I'm doing it.
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.280]   Right.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.280]   Well, that's the other thing.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.280]   It takes pictures of you.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.320]   You are on the water slide at Disneyland at the end when you're screaming and you're really
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.200]   unhappy and it takes a picture of you and they sell it to you for $25.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.360]   This does the same thing.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.920]   It snaps a picture of you going like this and this.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.520]   And then at the end of the game, you see all the images of you?
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.520]   It's pretty fun.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.520]   You're like, "I hate this thing."
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.520]   "I hate this.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.520]   I hate it.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.520]   I hate it."
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.560]   It was pretty fun stuff, I have to say.
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.320]   And of course, Sony's doing the thing with his Sony move.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:21.800]   And you know, Nintendo's got 3D games.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.800]   There's so much money in games.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.320]   Time for our tool.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.240]   Tip and number of the week.
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.240]   We'll start with Gina's Tip of the Week.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.240]   All right.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.240]   All right.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:37.160]   You know, I talked about this Android keyboard called ShapeRider, which you kind of swipe
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.880]   your finger back and forth type if you're not good at the touch keyboard.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:45.280]   And it's not in the Android market anymore, but the other product, which is similar, which
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:50.280]   is the keyboard is called Swipe with a Y. They are offering an official beta for the
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.280]   next couple of days.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.640]   So if you go to beta.swipe.com, you have to register.
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:58.680]   You have to put in your email address and they email you a link to download the beta,
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.440]   but it's available to try out.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:04.200]   So right now, Swipe and ShapeRider are not available in the market, but if you sign up
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:08.080]   for this beta now and I think it probably won't be around only this week, I think,
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.720]   you'll be able to try it out.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.480]   I get a few emails about ShapeRider.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.320]   People are saying, "Well, why isn't it in the market anymore?
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.200]   I'm not really sure what happened to it."
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.800]   It looks like Swipe is getting ready to do a full release, but you can try out the beta
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.800]   now.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.880]   Back story on this, of course, you outed Swipe.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.880]   I did.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.640]   I mentioned an unofficial download of Swipe and they weren't too happy about that.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.200]   So you switched to ShapeRider, and you liked ShapeRider, right?
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.200]   Yeah, I did.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.200]   I did.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:39.000]   ShapeRider was felt just as good as Swipe, but I'm happy to see that Swipe is opening up
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.280]   the beta to folks and doing an official beta and having people test.
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.760]   So you can get in on that now.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:47.440]   Basically right now, if you want to try one of these keyboards, Swipe, the Swipe beta
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.400]   is really your only option as far as I know.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.400]   Did you move?
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.400]   Did you try it?
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.400]   Did you view it?
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.880]   I still use ShapeRider, but I just actually submitted my email address.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:57.880]   I'm going to try.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.880]   I'm going to give Swipe another one.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.640]   Some phones, we should say, some phones do come installed with Swipe.
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.640]   Yes.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.040]   In fact, I think some Windows mobile phones have Swipe.
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:08.120]   I think it is a sense, it's a better way of doing it.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:13.640]   So instead of trying to hit that key, you slide your finger around and it's got a smart
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.640]   algorithm.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.320]   Essentially it says, "Oh, that's Shape.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.320]   That's this word."
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.320]   Exactly.
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.320]   You're drawing a Shape.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.320]   It's a very clever idea, I thought.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.880]   Yeah, I've been using it for a long time for months now.
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:28.120]   I'm a lot faster doing it that way with ShapeRider.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:32.680]   Now I just wish I could turn it on my Nexus 1 because I'd really like to install this.
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.640]   So blind, blind, blind.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:39.560]   I literally, I went from somebody with eight phones to somebody with no phone.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.560]   I have no phone.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.560]   Did you get the Evo?
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.480]   The Evo was a sprint loner which went back.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:51.640]   My iPhone, I went to Abby when she left her back east and she lost it.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:54.720]   I guess I could take the SIM out of this and put, "I have a Nokia N900."
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:57.920]   But I don't know, that thing is carrying around a suitcase.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.600]   People are going to laugh at you on the street now.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.600]   They will.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:01.600]   What is that monster phone you'll use?
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.280]   You'll be driving down in your Mustang and they'll be hooting at you.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.280]   It's from Sweden.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.160]   No, it's not.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.200]   It's from Finland.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:13.200]   Our number of the week, Mr. JJ.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.200]   9.5 million.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:23.840]   Piper Jeffery's Gene Mustard the analyst upped his estimate of iPhone sales in--
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:24.840]   iPhone or iPad?
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.120]   And it's in 30.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.120]   iPhone or iPad?
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.840]   Phone for sales.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:30.840]   9.5 million.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:31.840]   Wow.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.200]   It's by June 30 estimates.
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:39.640]   Well, after 600,000 of the pre-orders in the first day, Apple-- the rumor is Apple ordered
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.920]   more of these made than they've ever done before.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.920]   Why?
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:43.920]   What's the deal?
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:47.040]   Does everybody who has one have one?
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.040]   What's the deal?
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.040]   It's crack.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.040]   It is crack.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.920]   It's time to upgrade.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:57.160]   600, 700 bucks for me to upgrade.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:00.040]   We should always ask anybody who's on the show.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.520]   What do you use, Chris?
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.920]   Well, actually, I'm still rocking the iPhone 2G.
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.160]   It's got four gigs of RAM.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.160]   Wow.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:11.600]   It's kind of like having a four megabyte hard drive.
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.600]   Grandpa.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.560]   It's a good discipline.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:19.240]   It is actually-- it's kind of like I test all the Google web apps and the mobile apps
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.240]   on it.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.160]   And I provide plenty of feedback to the team to let them know ways in which they could
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.560]   be improving these applications and making them faster.
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:31.400]   It's actually really good that somebody takes a bullet for the team that way and uses
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.400]   older slower--
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.400]   It hurts.
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.400]   It hurts.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:39.080]   But you need to use older, slower hardware so that people who have 2G's don't get left
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.080]   in the cold.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.600]   Yeah, we get spoiled a lot.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.440]   You know, because we get to upgrade whenever we want.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.880]   So, well, not whenever.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.040]   But we get to upgrade, let's say.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.200]   And it's not always the case that everyone has that ability.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.840]   Well, that's a really good point.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:56.120]   I should maybe break out my old flip phone and just see how it feels.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.120]   It's like normal people.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:01.040]   What is the oldest phone?
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:05.640]   Actually, I had a G1, but I lent it to a friend who lost his phone.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.520]   But when I get the G1 back, maybe that's what-- I mean, literally, I had eight phones
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.520]   in here two weeks ago and I have zero now.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.320]   That's going to say for someone with someone's cat that's already gear.
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.320]   You're homeless.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.320]   They can't get the iPhone out soon enough.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:23.480]   My tool of the week-- well, I mentioned one, which is a double twist.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.600]   And everybody should get the double twist application on your Android phone.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.960]   It really is a great phone.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:32.560]   This is kind of a fun one, if I can find it here.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.400]   It's kind of chat roulette for Street View.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.120]   There's actually two ways to do this.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.680]   There's a plug-in you could use in Google Chrome.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:44.120]   Unfortunately, my experience with the plug-in is that it's so randomized.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.560]   It randomly pulls up a Street View.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:50.360]   It's so randomized that it pulls up a lot of places, at least when I was trying it,
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.160]   that didn't have a Street View.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.960]   So you get a lot of blanks, which is kind of not fun.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:03.280]   And then there's one called StreetViewFunny.com that they must be somehow vetting the Street
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:07.600]   View because it's just like chat roulette, but you get a Street View every time.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.800]   So I said, there it is.
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.880]   Now these seem to be all in the UK, unfortunately.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.360]   Maybe that's why you get a Street View every time.
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.560]   So I'll put links to both of those in our friend feed feed.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.800]   It's kind of fun to just randomly see a Street View.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.240]   Okay, I'm easily amused.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.560]   It's like touring the UK on a budget.
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:35.880]   And the good news is no male genitalia pops up.
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.360]   It's just amazing.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.360]   You could try and try.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:45.880]   Did you see that the guy who wrote chat roulette is trying to write a plug-in that auto senses
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.080]   male genitalia and blocks it?
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:54.920]   Well, somebody I think Business Insider did a contest, try to find the means to solve
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:55.920]   it.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:59.240]   And the winning suggestion was that you do face recognition and you figure if there's
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:01.040]   a face, there's no penis.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:05.800]   Oh, unless your penis looks like a face, but that's another matter entirely.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:09.880]   A subject for another show, I believe.
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:13.760]   Chris, I'm so sorry we degenerated to this point, but we do thank you so much for being
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.760]   here.
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.760]   That's what the Internet's for.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:22.360]   Yes, and he should know he's open web advocate at Google and I didn't know what he was advocating
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.720]   and now I have an idea.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.880]   If you want to find out more about Christmas in a factory Joe.com is his website.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.880]   Follow him on Twitter.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:29.880]   I do.
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:33.120]   It really is a worthwhile feed at factory Joe.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.880]   Actually, no, you got me wrong.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.200]   It's at Christmas in and out.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.600]   Oh, you changed it.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:39.600]   Yeah, I became me.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.600]   Did you do that automatically?
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.760]   Because I know I'm senior.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.760]   It must have.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.560]   Every now and then I see you give me a little out reply in factory Joe.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:47.560]   Oh, I got to fix that.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:48.560]   Yeah, no, I'm following you.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:49.560]   I just.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.360]   Huh, there you go.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.200]   I always think of you as factory Joe.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.200]   It's all right.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.200]   It's all right.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.200]   It's a legacy thing.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.400]   Do you stay in touch with the flock folks at all or?
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:04.160]   Every now and then, you know, not too often, but I sometimes do those guys out and about.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.960]   And it's really interesting that, of course, you know, as we said before, they're built
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.960]   on chroma.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:08.960]   I'm so happy.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:09.960]   I'm going to move.
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:10.960]   We've got some DNA strands in common now.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:11.960]   Yeah.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:13.480]   No, I'm going to move because I have to say I love flock.
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:17.080]   And I used flock for a long time, but I was kind of getting off that Firefox platform.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.880]   I just it's such a pig.
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.520]   And I'm a chrome fanatic.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:27.200]   So yeah, I'll absolutely well, they have to do it on the Mac, but I'll put it on my
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.960]   Windows machines anyway.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:29.960]   Thank you, Chris.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.240]   Chris Messina from Google.
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:35.480]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis in Berlin today, where it is late at night.
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:37.080]   So I'm going to let you go to bed.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.080]   Good.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.640]   No, but Jeff's book is what would Google do?
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.400]   His blog is Buzz machine.com.
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.400]   The new book, are you working on an array?
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.080]   Yeah, I'm trying to.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.920]   I was trying to remember the name of it.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.320]   Do you have public parts?
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:50.320]   Public parts.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.320]   Yeah, that's the opposite of private parts.
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:54.200]   I should be able to remember that.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.200]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.200]   Always great to have you here.
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:00.900]   Couldn't do the show without you or Gina Trapani, who is the author of the complete
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:08.520]   guide to Google wave, complete wave guide.com also blogging at smarter where.org.
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.520]   What are you excited about right now?
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.520]   These days, what anything?
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.840]   Because you're always, you have this passion for what you do.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.760]   And I'm always curious, what is getting Gina interested today?
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.240]   I'm morphing from a blogger to a coder again.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.800]   So I'm just really excited about like design patterns and object oriented design.
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:29.920]   Patterns that I can't really tweet about because people will just be like, "I think
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:36.800]   patterns, you know, I did all my programming way back when patterns is very interesting.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:37.800]   I love that.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.440]   I'm starting to buy patterns books.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:40.440]   Factory patterns.
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.440]   You collect patterns.
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.440]   I used to buy the cookbooks, right?
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.320]   You know, the pro cookbook, the Python cookbook.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.400]   Now you buy patterns books.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.400]   I love that.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:54.160]   So I'm just, I'm sort of relearning a bunch of coding things that are like whatever people,
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.960]   actual coders are like, yeah, that was like so five years ago.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.760]   And I'm like, what are you talking about?
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.760]   So whatever.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.280]   It's like saying, I just discovered this thing called bubble sort.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.360]   It's amazing.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.360]   Just incredible.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:09.240]   Do you have a Gina patterns account on Twitter?
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.240]   You should.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.240]   Seriously.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:16.360]   This is a new thing that I, you know, people are starting to do where you have your main
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.320]   Twitter account, but you realize that if you start tweeting about patterns, people are
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.320]   going to glaze, right?
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.320]   Right.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.320]   Right.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.360]   So you make up the like, yeah, like I can tweet about anything I want, you know, coding
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.360]   wise.
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.960]   Steve Gibson does that with the pads with slates.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.360]   He says, I'm going to have a slate.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.880]   Anything, anytime I want to mention a slate, I won't do it on my main account because I
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:35.160]   know that's going to make people crazy.
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.160]   I'm a pattern.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.600]   You could have Gina's pattern of the day.
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:41.600]   I won't mock you.
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:42.600]   I promise.
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:47.120]   I don't know if I need another Twitter account, but yes, I like that idea.
