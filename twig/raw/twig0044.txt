[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.380]   This week in Google, the show that covers the Google

[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.400]   And we've got a great panel lined up for you

[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.120]   Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, cutie.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.920]   Ah, cutie.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.480]   Let's not--
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.000]   That was a surprise.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.640]   Let's not get that wrong.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.280]   Let's not get that wrong.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.760]   Jerry.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.040]   Jay Rosen is also here.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.760]   He's from NYU.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.840]   And it's good to have you, Jay.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.680]   Hello, everyone.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.600]   Thanks for inviting me, Leo.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.520]   Thanks for being here.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.240]   A longtime blogger and the observer
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.040]   of the press scene and really--
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.600]   somebody I'm really thrilled to get on the show.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.240]   We've been wanting to get you on for some time.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.960]   So I'm glad we could finally get you in here.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.480]   Excellent.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.120]   Yay.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.080]   And of course, Gina Trapani from smarterwear.org.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.560]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.560]   Hello.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.240]   Hi.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.480]   And Gina and I were talking before the show began
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.840]   about Android development.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.560]   Because we're both kind of intrigued by this platform.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.960]   Yeah, so we'll talk.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.680]   Java and XML, baby.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.640]   Can't we get your Android tablet and replace that closed
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.680]   beast you have, now Leo?
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.080]   You know, I did that with the iPhone already, right?
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.160]   I'm doing a nice one and I can't wait to get an Evo.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.440]   I'm really excited about the Evo.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.040]   I'm jealous of your Evo, Gina.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.280]   She got one on at Google I/O.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.640]   And you've been loving it, haven't you?
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.120]   I don't normally review handsets.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.920]   And I feel kind of funny because it was a freebie.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.520]   But man, it is nice.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.920]   So it's really nice.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.040]   Well, it's that screen, I think, that puts it over the top.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.640]   It's the screen.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.200]   Yeah, the screen is the thing, right?
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.680]   It's just bigger.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.680]   It's better than the Nexus one.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.160]   It's definitely better than the Nexus one.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.000]   Wow.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.960]   It's got this kickstand, which is like--
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.200]   this is my favorite part about the phone.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.960]   It's got this little flip out thing on the back.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.920]   You can kind of prop it up on your desk
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.360]   and you've got an alarm clock, a desk clock.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   You can watch YouTube videos while you kind of two hand
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.400]   your lunch.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.040]   It just makes the phone stand up.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.360]   It's almost-- you know, it's funny.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.360]   A little bit more real estate makes it almost a pad.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.440]   It does.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.800]   And it's not even higher resolution, is it?
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.040]   No, no, same screen.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.560]   But it's just a step below having a tablet up to your face.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.560]   It's just to that point of like, if there was any bigger,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.360]   it would feel awkward to your ear.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.520]   But yeah, it's a really great handset.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.360]   I'm digging it.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.480]   Front-facing camera, FM radio.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.480]   Can you call anybody with that front-facing camera?
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.200]   You know, I haven't tried that yet.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   I haven't tried video-computing.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.600]   How would it work?
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.640]   They got kick installed quick.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.880]   Quick, QIK.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.640]   OK, yeah.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   QIK.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.600]   So you can livestream video, but I haven't actually
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.400]   tried a video conference call.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.600]   I think it's a video-computing.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.480]   As I remembered, because I had the front-facing camera on N900.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.080]   I think Fring does it.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.520]   I should try-- yeah.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.560]   Ouch, when I get my Evo, I'll get Fring on it,
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.600]   and we'll just call each other.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.400]   We'll just call each other.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.160]   It'll be fun.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.480]   That's a problem.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.760]   It's like having a video phone.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.120]   There's only three people in the world you can call.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.120]   Right.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.720]   Someday.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.840]   I mean, the big thing about the phone is that it's 4G,
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840]   but there's no 4G support.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.920]   There's no 4G.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.280]   And so I turned on 4G for five minutes.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.680]   My battery was practically gone.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.200]   You know, that was in San Francisco.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.160]   So we'll see how that goes.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.800]   But to your point, Jeff, I actually
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.400]   am now thinking that what makes the iPad successful
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.320]   is the hardware.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.600]   And I do think an Android tablet might be a very compelling
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.000]   product.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.680]   And so-- and this is what Gina and I were talking about--
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.440]   I was learning iPhone--
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.920]   I paid $99 bucks and joined the developer program.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.840]   I was going through the tutorials.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.760]   And I decided, no, wait a minute.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.480]   I would prefer to develop for an open platform.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.360]   And I think if you take an Android tablet from the things
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.400]   that announced at Google I/O between 2.2 and Google TV--
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.960]   because when you develop for Android,
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.520]   you develop for all of those platforms.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.920]   But what really strikes me is that I've said it before.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.360]   But what the hell I'll say it again.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.120]   Mobile-- we see the death of mobile.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.120]   Let's declare it dead already.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.880]   Because it's-- it's--
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.880]   It's dead.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.800]   Well, because the same stuff will be on all these platforms.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.600]   You're sitting on the couch.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.840]   You're not mobile.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.280]   Watching Google TV or not mobile.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.800]   But you'll be using apps the same way across all these things.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.520]   John Doar at Disrupt, didn't he say that mobile was
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.880]   the third wave of computing?
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.760]   You had-- first you had computers then the internet.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.480]   Now you have mobile.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.840]   And now you're trying to name it.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.600]   He's trying to name it something new.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.120]   He said it was a combination of mobile and social.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.000]   And new e-commerce all mixed in together.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.880]   I think that's several things, not just one.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.600]   I think it is, too.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.360]   It's just 3.1, not 2.3, yes.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.560]   Right.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.240]   But he's right.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.040]   I mean, that is clearly where everything is kind of what
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.400]   is happening right now.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.240]   So let's talk briefly about the Facebook announcements,
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.360]   because as we go to press to use an inkedained term,
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.920]   Facebook has just completed its press conference, Mark Zuckerberg
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.120]   and Elliot Shrig taking the stage to explain that they--
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.000]   Mayakalpa, we blew it.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.160]   Again.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.800]   We were just trying to do the right thing.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.000]   And we're going to do the right thing this time
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.320]   by simplifying the privacy settings.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.160]   And now it looks like, although we haven't--
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.160]   it's not rolled out yet.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.200]   But it will be rolled out in the next, I don't know, week or so,
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.200]   that there will be one-click privacy settings,
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.560]   kind of some defaults-- friends-only, friends and friends
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.200]   of friends and public or everyone.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.080]   And while Facebook has a recommended--
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.040]   which is basically they recommend,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.400]   they would like everything to be public,
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.200]   because there's more future for them there.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.400]   They do give the opportunity of pressing it looks like.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.200]   We'll see one button that says, friends-only.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.920]   Is that satisfying?
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.680]   Anybody--
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.920]   This vision of steel walls coming around you,
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.080]   as that happens, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.120]   It's like, get smart.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.080]   No one can see you now.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.440]   Yeah, I think it's a smart thing to do.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.200]   It's a meta layer on top of this.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.880]   The more I think about it, the less--
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.240]   as everyone else is getting more vitriolic about Zuckerberg
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.160]   and Facebook, I'm getting less upset about him.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.520]   And I'm not--
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.960]   You were appeased by their statements today.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.560]   I think I was even before that.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.840]   I think that I do take Zuckerberg at his word
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.720]   that he believes that a connected world is better.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.640]   And that we--
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.400]   and it's part of what I'm going to write about in my next tone.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.320]   But I think he really means that.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.920]   And all this talk about it being business oriented, well,
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.000]   what isn't?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.720]   NPR sells ads, too.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.640]   Oh, we saw ads.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.280]   I mean--
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.960]   So I think they screwed up, and they've
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.520]   made a business strategy of screwing up.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.000]   And when it was just geeks back when they could do it,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.160]   he said today in the press conference
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.920]   that the fuhrer over News Feed was still many times bigger
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.440]   than this fuhrer.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.840]   And then I think 10% of the audience ganged up against him.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.800]   But in fact, he was right then.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.080]   And I think that's what affected him.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.640]   Is it all right?
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.760]   They yelled, but I was right.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.240]   Right.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.920]   I don't see the venality in this.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.760]   Tell me where I'm wrong.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.400]   No, I have to admit, I felt a little appeased by this, Jay.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.040]   Well, I didn't see the press conference,
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.080]   but I did read the statement.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.120]   And it seems like if the changes that are described there
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.480]   go through, that will be good.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.560]   And I think they made some smart moves.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.640]   But what strikes me, Leo, is I always
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.360]   feel when Zuckerberg is talking and Facebook is talking to me
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.200]   that I'm being infantilized.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   Yes.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.080]   They refuse to treat anyone, really, as adults.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.240]   If you look at the rhetoric of this statement,
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.320]   if you look at the way that it's written,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.080]   there's this funny use of the word you, where they're telling us--
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.080]   he's telling the users how the users feel
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.600]   and what they wanted in this language of you said to us
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.480]   that we asked each of you to look and you
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.600]   chose what you wanted, where they're
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.880]   preempting how I think they're not addressing me as an adult.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.040]   The other thing I don't understand is--
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.680]   and maybe you guys can enlighten me about this--
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.320]   Facebook is a company that depends completely on users
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.400]   and good relationships with users.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.440]   And where is the Facebook ombudsman?
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.200]   Where is Facebook's Robert Scoble
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.240]   back when Scoble blog from Microsoft?
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.440]   Where is the panel of users who advise them about things
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.160]   but don't work for the company?
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.040]   Where are any of the kinds of measures of openness
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.960]   that you would hope to see in a company so
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.360]   dependent on the goodwill of users?
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.120]   I just don't get it.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.600]   I don't get any of Facebook's public facing strategies at all.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.160]   And I feel like I'm being talked to as a child every time
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.800]   they open their mouths.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.880]   Is it anything like the way Apple treats its users?
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.880]   It strikes me lately that I've seen a certain commonality
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.800]   between Facebook and Apple that they decide what they want
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   to do for business reasons.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.240]   This is what you were talking about, Jeff.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.760]   But then, because they don't feel comfortable saying,
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.360]   well, this is good for business, they somehow try to say,
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.960]   but it's what's good for you too.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.880]   And that strikes me as what Apple's doing these days
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.400]   a little bit too.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.280]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.320]   I think that there's a slightly different relationship
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.680]   here, though, in the past has been.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.720]   They have a product.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.520]   You don't buy it.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.840]   Facebook is absolutely in your junk.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.480]   Where Facebook is the only choice we have for our social graph.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.600]   And Apple creates just better products
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.200]   that were an emphasis on simplicity.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.680]   I mean, the whole thing with Facebook
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.280]   is that there are 170 options.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.000]   And Zuckerberg's-- I think he did a piece in the "Wash to Post."
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.200]   He said, like, we thought you wanted granular controls,
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.520]   but so we gave you granular controls.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.680]   But I guess we were a little too ahead of our time.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.120]   And that's not exactly what he said,
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.360]   but that was kind of the--
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.480]   I felt like that was the implication.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.560]   You're not there yet.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.000]   So we'll dumb it down for you.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.160]   And we'll kind of usher you along to the real truth.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160]   And that bugged me.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.560]   It's when the airline person says, let me explain our policy.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.360]   Yeah, sir.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.320]   They talk--
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:08.880]   No, I don't want--
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.240]   I was talking--
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:09.920]   Talking down to you.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.000]   --what I want you to do.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.080]   Yeah, listen to this, Leah.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.480]   Listen to this sentence.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.640]   Just pitch your ear to this.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.360]   Unless you feel in control, then you
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.560]   won't be comfortable sharing and our service will be less
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.400]   useful for you.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.800]   Do you hear how they're telling us how we think about them?
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.280]   Right.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.640]   Instead of telling us what they're going to do and what they want.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.960]   But maybe their only crime is a tin ear.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.360]   I mean, maybe it's just--
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.360]   Could be.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:40.920]   Or maybe not.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.360]   I mean, I'm not sure.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.040]   I've been grappling with intent.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.960]   It's very hard to determine intent.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.480]   It is.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.880]   But you know, Jay's point that they don't have very many kind
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.040]   of people within the company who--
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.480]   I could attack conferences all the time.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.840]   I meet people from Microsoft, from Google, especially.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.400]   And even a couple Apple employees.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.680]   But I don't know anybody from Facebook.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.280]   I don't know anyone who works at Facebook who's like--
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.840]   maybe you do, Leo, who's like writes about who does kind
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.360]   of better public relations, who explains things like mat cuts.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.360]   I feel like I can go to math.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.160]   That's true.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.200]   So I'm kind of answering about something
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.600]   that Google's doing or are scobled from Microsoft.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.240]   And I don't feel that way with Facebook.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.040]   I feel like it's this.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:16.520]   We're going to--
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.680]   Chloe Sladden from Twitter, who's in charge of relationships
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.080]   with the media.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.360]   Who is that person for Facebook?
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.480]   All right.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.320]   Dave Recording is going to be at food camp.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.840]   I'm going to food camp at the end of the months.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.000]   And that's one of the-- I'm hoping--
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.840]   I don't want--
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.840]   He may not-- he may like avoid me like the plague.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.800]   But I'm hoping I could just sit down in a nice congenial way,
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.520]   because food camp is congenial.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.920]   Who is the place to do that?
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.720]   Friends of a ride.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.880]   And you have all the record competitions.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.880]   Exactly.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.840]   And I'll tell him this is completely off the record.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.480]   What do you think?
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.080]   What's going on?
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.040]   You're inside.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.280]   What's your sense of it?
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.880]   So I have to say, after these moves--
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.160]   one thing they did, which I think was really, really good,
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160]   is they let you completely close off access
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.280]   to third party applications.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:00.760]   That's good.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.240]   This was a huge problem.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.760]   This Yelp, Pandora, Farmville kind of access to your guts,
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.320]   you can just say no.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.320]   Not now, not ever.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.160]   Not now, not ever.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.280]   And it's future proof, right?
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.800]   So you say, this is my setting now.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.880]   And any news partners that you partner up with,
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.720]   you're going to assume that that's my setting until--
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.880]   They said it.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.080]   That's what they said.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.080]   They said it.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:22.560]   They said it.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.840]   That's the key to me.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.240]   Because opting out one by one as they create new partnerships
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.840]   was just total BS to our size concern.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.320]   Right.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.800]   Can I identify another dynamic here, Leo?
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.160]   Yes.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.160]   And I've seen this in other places in the tech industry, too.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.080]   You have these companies, and they
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.960]   do things that are kind of hard to figure out.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.680]   And the people who get onto what they're doing first
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:53.280]   are naturally the pundits, bloggers, techies, early adopters.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:53.720]   Right?
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.280]   And they blamed us.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.560]   And so then what happens is that as that
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:04.880]   din from the more sophisticated users grows,
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:11.440]   they try to split off that group from the larger user base
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.520]   and say, well, that's actually just the techies.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.520]   That's just--
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.920]   They explicitly did that.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:19.640]   They said, oh, no.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.320]   It's the media and the techies that don't like.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.000]   Is everybody else loves us?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.520]   Right.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.160]   And so-- but if they're making it hard to understand,
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.120]   then the only people who are going to be upset
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.480]   are the people who put the extra effort into understanding.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:32.920]   Exactly.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.800]   Yeah, I never bought that.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.960]   And it was perfectly willing--
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.880]   I've been accused of grandstanding
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.360]   and being a publicity hound and so forth.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.040]   But I was perfectly willing to suffer those slings and arrows
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.080]   because I thought it was important to raise the issue.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.720]   And by the way, my Facebook account is gone as of now
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.480]   because I deleted it two weeks ago on Twig.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.000]   And I'll be honest.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.560]   I don't really miss it.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.480]   It's like--
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.360]   So what?
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:00.840]   You know?
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.200]   You know?
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:01.760]   I'm the same way.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.520]   I think Twitter replaced the functionality of it
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.000]   to a great extent for me.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.560]   But what did you think about--
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.280]   Twig, I think things about this is--
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.000]   I think Jay's right about the ombudsman.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.280]   I see my editor at HarperCollins, Ben Loughton,
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.960]   just put in Twitter that he likes the idea.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.600]   He agrees.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:15.960]   Yes.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:21.560]   And I wonder if what Scoble did wasn't really new,
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.040]   that we in newspapers had ombudsman,
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.200]   but they were there to act as a kind of a wall more
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.360]   than a bridge in some cases.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.640]   And Scoble was just a guy walking through the company
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.600]   and creating a human relationship with the company.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.640]   So there is great irony that it doesn't exist.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.600]   But the irony further is that I think Facebook operates
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.000]   like a very old company.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.520]   Which is ironic, isn't it?
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.480]   Exactly.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.480]   The other thing is that at TechCrunch,
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.080]   just rubbed Michael Laryton who always
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.360]   tries to get numbers out of people who will talk about it.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.640]   By the way, he did a really good job.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.760]   It was a really good car.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.600]   I loved the Carol Bartz interaction.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.200]   That was a scary car.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.520]   I loved to talk about that.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.960]   I watched the video.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.640]   Oh my god.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.720]   We'll talk to that.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.360]   But Chris Cox, he asked Chris Cox
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.640]   had a privacy, I think, right?
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.640]   He said that Facebook for numbers on how many have quit
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.280]   and didn't get any.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.280]   But part of what Zuckerberg said today in his talk
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.400]   was that when a million people complained
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:21.160]   about newsfeed going back in the day,
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.560]   that was a huge proportion of Facebook.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.880]   But Facebook is now many, many, many times bigger.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.200]   And so a huge number could complain.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.480]   And it might be the size of New York,
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.960]   but it's a smaller proportion.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.640]   That's one of the things they said today at the press conference
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.880]   was we have this net meter that shows
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.400]   our what's going on.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.520]   We haven't seen anything from these Facebook quitters.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.440]   I think it's a real problem for them because--
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.040]   That's a bad thing to say, by the way.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.720]   That's really not a bad thing to say.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.200]   Oh, it doesn't hurt our business.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:47.880]   Go ahead and quit.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.320]   See you.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.480]   We don't hear you.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.240]   We don't care.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.640]   Oh, you don't matter.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.140]   Right.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.840]   That's a challenge that you don't fully see.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.040]   You don't matter.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.720]   That is the problem with success.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.200]   You think that a group doesn't matter,
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.720]   and you can't listen to them.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.280]   It's like becoming the public sphere.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.840]   They're as big as the whole public now.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.960]   And they've got to recognize the groups within
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.120]   and respect the groups within.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.240]   And it's a real challenge for them.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.120]   I don't think they're recognized still.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.360]   Yeah, I mean, that net meter doesn't show them
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.520]   what the influencers are doing.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.680]   I mean, Leo's an influencer.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.200]   Baratunde is an influencer.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.680]   These are people who have great reach and are explaining
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.800]   to the folks who aren't the geeks.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.920]   What's going on?
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.520]   I don't know.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.080]   That bothered me, too.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.520]   We didn't feel it.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.720]   When they say-- when Zuckerberg says
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.880]   he did an statement, we've listened carefully in order
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.480]   to figure out the best and next steps.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.400]   What is this listening process about?
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.840]   Where does it happen?
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.080]   Where is the ear?
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:45.560]   Where is the ear?
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.600]   Anything about it?
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.440]   Yeah, where's the ear of this company?
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.560]   Well, the prior--
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.120]   You did?
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.240]   In the prior kerfuffle.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.000]   Jay and the prior kerfuffle, they had--
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:55.520]   Remember this?
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.320]   I think they had a page.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.280]   They had a poll.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.760]   And they had a poll, and they had people try to write it.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.600]   And I forget who it was at the time.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.640]   It was you, Leo, that suggested a constitutional convention
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.360]   for Facebook.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:05.880]   Yes.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.080]   Yeah, I wasn't me, but that's a great idea.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.320]   Yeah, but that's not going to do that.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.240]   I mean, the ear is-- the New York Times made fools of us
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.800]   by pointing out the length of our privacy policy
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.280]   and the fact that there are 170 privacy options.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.360]   That's what I feel like it is.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.960]   And I'm supposed to believe that nobody at Facebook
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.480]   knew that they had 170 privacy options
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.200]   and that it was a complicated system.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.880]   And they-- oh, they just-- you know what?
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.920]   We just took a look at it.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.920]   Wow.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.320]   It is kind of-- it is bad.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.040]   You're right.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.680]   I just don't buy that.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.520]   Well, their argument back is you want to control--
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.640]   damn it, we gave you control.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.920]   You want to leave the vowels out?
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.360]   You can leave the vowels out.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.840]   You know?
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.520]   They didn't think with any sense.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.920]   They didn't think like they're people.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:50.800]   All right.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.720]   All right, enough Facebook.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.280]   A couple of other things going on.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.200]   You were at Disrupt, which is the Mike Errington--
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.360]   I guess it's the replacement for TechCrunch 50 in New York
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.400]   City.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.320]   Nice that it could be out your way.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.160]   And that was a beautiful thing.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.720]   Mayor Bloomberg came and talked.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.360]   And it was interesting to hear him
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.480]   because he spoke not as a mayor, really, but as an entrepreneur.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.600]   He was among entrepreneurs.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.600]   And of course, there was a mayoral message here,
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.200]   which is entrepreneurs come to New York,
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.360]   follow the light, children.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.920]   And he announced some different--
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.080]   Do you think that's credible, by the way?
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.120]   Is everything tilting to the left, to the west coast?
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.720]   Yeah, you got a problem with that?
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.880]   It's really interesting to watch.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.720]   Silicon Alley versus Silicon Valley.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.240]   There's a lot of talk about that.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.920]   It is a different culture, damn it.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.000]   And I think there is something--
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.880]   Which is great.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.880]   Freshly different here, yeah.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.200]   There should be an Austin culture.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.640]   There should be a Seattle culture.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.320]   There should be a New York culture.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.560]   God, if everything were like San Francisco,
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.760]   I would cry for the future of this industry.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.760]   The other issue you're thinking about--
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.560]   this is going to Jay's heart, I'm sure,
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.840]   about Errington is that he and I--
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.040]   he and I were walking down the hall
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.120]   and reminiscing about how we got into a huge fight
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.520]   at an online news association.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.520]   You too, huh?
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.760]   From years ago, oh, yeah.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.200]   And the thing is that Errington was acting very
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.120]   journalistically through this whole thing.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.280]   He's asking good questions.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.920]   He's asking the questions you want to know.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.160]   He's probing and doing things.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.400]   He's bringing in the interesting people you want to hear.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.640]   And he really has-- his journalism, I think,
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.160]   has matured a great deal.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.560]   Not that I don't mean by that that he's followed the old ways.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.320]   He does things his own ways still.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.200]   But he's now figured out what his way is, I think, better.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.200]   Well, I would agree 100%.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.560]   And it's very clear that he started
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.200]   to realize that his job is as a proxy for his audience.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.760]   And it feels that loyalty, that he feels that as a mission
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.120]   to do that, and a great journalist always does.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.840]   Yeah, and I think that's really great.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.480]   And that's a maturation process.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.760]   This is what happens when people don't go to Jay's school.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.240]   And they have to learn this in the world of hard knocks.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.480]   And Mike has taken a lot of knocks.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.160]   And I think he's really learned from it.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.280]   This sounds very patronizing.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.840]   I don't mean to sound patronizing.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.720]   He's huge.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.640]   But I would agree with you.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.760]   I really enjoyed the conversation.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.360]   And I particularly enjoyed that Carol Bartz back and forth.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:06.920]   And you know what?
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.280]   That's vintage Arienton.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.840]   That more power to both of them.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.520]   I like her response.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.760]   She basically said F you, Mike, which is something I've said.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.360]   And--
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.440]   But it was-- it didn't seem disrespectful.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:20.920]   I don't know.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.400]   You were there.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.360]   It was disrespectful.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.880]   It seemed like it was a very nice--
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.720]   It became a joke the rest of the time.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.480]   But I think it's funny.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.720]   Listen, Yahoo deserves ridicule.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.240]   It does.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.520]   But she made a good point, which is you're a tiny company.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.200]   We're a big company.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.760]   It's hard to move on and die.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.240]   And I think that was a reasonable point.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.000]   There was a great moment today with Nikesh Narora from Google
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.840]   was there.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.880]   And Arienton played back that line about how Google has
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.680]   to grow a Yahoo every year.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.120]   And Aurora just said, well, I don't know what their strategy is.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.600]   It depends on what Yahoo's going to be as to whether we have
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.480]   to grow one of them or not.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.080]   I think that there's a lot of questions about Yahoo.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.520]   And there's a lot of questions about AOL.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.720]   Tomorrow's starting once there are two.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.520]   And I think tough question and tough answering
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.600]   is exactly what we need more of.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.320]   I didn't like the interview.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.840]   OK.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.000]   Tell us why.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.640]   But I watched it on video.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.280]   I didn't think it was appropriate for Arienton
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.720]   to start by saying how the fuck are you.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.120]   And I don't think he would have said that.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.120]   I missed that.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.400]   I only watched the exchange.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.200]   I didn't see that point.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.400]   That was the first line of the year.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.800]   Well, no wonder she swore out of it.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:29.280]   She's up three to a--
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.160]   How the fuck are you?
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.200]   Which I don't know.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:31.600]   I don't know.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.800]   No, that's not appropriate.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.880]   But I didn't think he would say that to Eric Schmidt.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.360]   You know?
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   No, that's not appropriate.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.240]   She's known for being kind of foul-mouthed.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.560]   And maybe that was--
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.960]   I didn't really mind that so much.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.320]   But I think it was a license to her there.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:45.800]   Maybe.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.920]   I didn't--
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.800]   One way I judge an interview is whether I
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.480]   believe the interviewer is asking questions that come out
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.480]   of what he just heard as opposed to what's on his notebook
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.760]   that he thought of to ask before.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.480]   And I didn't hear or see Arienton asking questions
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.600]   based on what he heard her saying.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.600]   I heard him list some of the things
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.120]   that he had already in his notebook.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.440]   I also wanted him as my representative
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.800]   as a tech crunch reader to ask her about Yahoo's new editorial
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.160]   push.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.960]   They're hiring all these journalists.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.720]   Well, this associated content deal is--
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.240]   And associated content also.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.520]   He didn't ask about that either.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.120]   I would ask about that because that's a--
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:37.720]   And I would--
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.480]   I'd love to know what the strategy is.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.000]   Right.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.840]   Well, that's the funny thing going on here with AOL
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:48.880]   versus Yahoo is the two last old-style media companies
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.960]   are digging in to dumbly down the old-style media.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.680]   Which is-- I mean, I'm sure you guys consider that anathema
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.520]   to journalism.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:05.040]   I mean, it's not-- I mean, these $5 bloggers--
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.960]   That's not exactly our view.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.320]   No, it's OK.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:08.560]   Good.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.000]   This is good.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.280]   I want to talk about this.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.040]   Actually, we've had this conversation a little bit, Jeff.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.640]   In fact, we started one at the end of a show, which I cut off.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.120]   So maybe we can get back into that.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.760]   Let's hold that thought, though, for a moment,
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:23.120]   because we do want to pay a bill, because we pay people more
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.280]   than $5.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.800]   And so in order to do that, I'm going
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.040]   to do a commercial now for GoToMeeting, our friends
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.920]   at Citrix, who will make it easy for you to meet online
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.280]   without all that travel that will just kill your bottom line.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.160]   GoToMeeting is the way business gets done these days.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.600]   We use GoToMeeting a lot.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.480]   I think we have several GoToMeeting accounts,
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.080]   because it's gotten to the point where we frequently
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.840]   will have two meetings on at the same time.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.800]   So we need multiple accounts.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.920]   If you go to GoToMeeting.com/Twig,
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.160]   if you haven't tried this already,
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.880]   you can try it absolutely free for 30 days.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.600]   Here's what'll happen.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.200]   You'll go to GoToMeeting.com/Twig.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.200]   You'll sign up literally a minute later, probably
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.160]   before I'm done talking.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.720]   You will have it installed.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.040]   And now the next time you're on one of those long, boring
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.080]   conference calls, or you're challenged to go across town
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.520]   to meet a client or across the country,
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.160]   or cross the world to meet a client,
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.760]   you say, now let's do a GoToMeeting instead.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.640]   You can show them your notes, your spreadsheets,
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.440]   your PowerPoint presentation, or your keynote.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.360]   It's Mac or PC.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.640]   Any kind of meeting.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.640]   They now have an iPad app that is so cool.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.600]   It uses the built-in microphone and speakers on the iPad
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.160]   and the voice over internet that's built into GoToMeeting.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.800]   You don't even need a phone call.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.680]   I went out in the backyard using Wi-Fi
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.320]   and I'm having a meeting.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.640]   Go toMeeting.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.680]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.320]   G-O-T-O, meeting.com/Twig.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.000]   T-W-I-G.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.520]   It is the future, I think, of a business.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.320]   Eliminate all that travel, all that, you know,
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.240]   just expensive pain in the butt stuff,
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.440]   and make those conference calls much more engaging.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.000]   Go toMeeting.com/Twig.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.160]   We thank you for their support of this week in Google.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:01.600]   So, Jeff, would you tell me what demand media is
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.120]   before we get into this conversation?
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.640]   Demand me, Jacob, I could do a better job,
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.800]   but I'll give it a shot.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.320]   Demand media does a few things.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.160]   One is that it listens to search requests
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.720]   to see what the public wants,
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.280]   which I think is a key insight for demand media.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.720]   That's not the way it works in the news.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.480]   We decide what the questions are and the answers are.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.840]   This is a way to listen to that.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.320]   They listen at the same time to the ad rates,
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.040]   and ad demand, and an algorithm spits out a headline.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.640]   It says that basically, if you write something
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.160]   under this headline, you will make money.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.280]   - I think the example you gave was
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.520]   Harley-Davidson belt buckles.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.520]   - Ah, me and Ben.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.960]   - I don't know if it was you, but somebody did.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.400]   So, if you check search keywords,
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.720]   and you see a ton of search keywords
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.600]   for Harley-Davidson belt buckles,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.160]   you say, aha!
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.560]   - And there's ad demand for it.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.400]   It makes it.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.880]   Now, they tried this with editors,
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.960]   and they found that the algorithm's 4.1 times more effective
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.920]   than the editors at picking winners.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.840]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.080]   - Now, what is a winner, though?
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.040]   Winner means to ad sales.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:03.040]   - A winner is their arbitrage in Google juice.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:03.880]   - Hits.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:04.720]   - Right? That's hits hits.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.120]   If you write this the right way, it'll get Google juice,
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.320]   and we know there's an ad demand,
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.480]   and we'll leverage that to the highest value we can.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.880]   But it is the two of them together.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.080]   If there's no ads, okay.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:15.920]   - Okay, right.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.040]   So then they turn around,
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.080]   and the other controversial part about this,
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.160]   the most controversial, is they put it then up
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.080]   in an assignment board, and anybody can come in
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.840]   and write that piece for 20 bucks.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.320]   They sliced up the function of creating content
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.720]   into 11 pieces.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.080]   So, somebody makes 20 bucks.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.080]   A human looks at the algorithm and says, yeah, it's right.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:33.920]   They may be right.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.760]   They headline a little bit.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.920]   They then write the piece.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.600]   Somebody copy edits the piece for $2.50,
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.440]   and so on and so on.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.520]   And it gets up.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.560]   And it's a machine.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.280]   And they say they are using, in their words,
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.160]   the spare cycles of writers out there.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.000]   Who could earn?
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.760]   If you go to a box, yeah, it's a little money,
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.520]   but it's a resource that's waiting for old print editors
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.080]   to answer queries.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.920]   So while you're waiting, make a few bucks
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.520]   and do these things.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.680]   Now, I think that it's,
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.360]   and they're going for an IPO, no doubt.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.320]   The one thing I think about it is that
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   as search becomes more personalized,
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.200]   as Google gets more signals to location and activity
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:13.120]   and all that, the ability to play this game of arbitrage
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.080]   on Google juice, I think, is going to go down and down.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.880]   The dark art of SEO, I think, goes away
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.640]   and with it some of demand's efforts.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.840]   But again, there is a model here in terms of listening
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.760]   to what people want and then coming up with a structure
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.120]   without ciders to do it.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.640]   And there are others doing this.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.480]   AOL Seed is one associated was not doing the same model.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.400]   Associated on a society--
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.000]   - Oh, I thought they were.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.840]   I thought they were kind of--
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.480]   - No, it's associated.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.800]   The writer decides what to write.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.480]   It's not as successful.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.720]   - And they say they have like 38,000 writers.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.600]   - Right, that's a problem with it, I think,
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.080]   is a business model, but they have so much stuff
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.040]   and you're motivated, in a sense, it's a manual sense.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.440]   You're motivated to write things that are going to make money.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.520]   So you do that.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.000]   And there are some newspapers now
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.360]   that have hired demand media to fill sections
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.920]   like, I think, travel sections and stuff with stuff.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.200]   So journalists don't like it mainly
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.480]   because in their view it lowers the value
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.880]   of what they do, but welcome to a competitive open marketplace.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.880]   - They have nothing on Harley-Davidson belt buckles.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.000]   I just want to point that out.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.840]   - Ah, yeah.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.080]   I didn't think I said that.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.560]   - You didn't say that?
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.160]   Somebody did.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.320]   I thought that was a really apt--
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.280]   'cause it's such a narrow niche
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.200]   and yet there's huge advertising money in it.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.040]   So anything to add to that, Jay, is that--
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.640]   - Yeah, well, another way to look at demand media,
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.520]   Jeff's description is good, is to say that
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.200]   they start with the revenue that is available online
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:41.720]   and they try to invent the editorial routines
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.880]   that work for that kind of revenue,
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.880]   as opposed to starting with what it costs to have
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.640]   quality editorial workers
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.600]   and trying to figure out how to get the revenue to pay them.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.600]   - Well, Jay, it's no different from starting a food section
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.120]   or starting circuits of the New York Times
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.000]   when there was that demand
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.560]   and then killing it when there isn't.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.880]   - Yeah, sort of.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.720]   - Same world, different--
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.520]   - Which is exactly what happened at the New York Times.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.600]   - Yeah, exactly, yeah.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.960]   - Also, another way to look at it is
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.840]   because everything that we do online is recorded,
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.640]   because there's all this data about how people
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.600]   who use the internet,
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.600]   they are trying to integrate that knowledge
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.600]   into editorial production.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.560]   That's the part that I feel, and Jeff, I think,
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.200]   who agrees with me is in fact innovative
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.080]   about what they're doing,
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.880]   and that's the part that journalists
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.200]   and news organizations should learn from.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.200]   But the other thing,
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.080]   this is why I wanna talk about it on this show
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.000]   that really interested me
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.920]   and I'd love to get Gina's take on this
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:49.920]   or yours, Leo, is by encouraging demand media
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:55.480]   to become a big producer on YouTube, for example,
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.680]   and by seemingly allowing them to game search
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.360]   with their kind of low quality content.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:08.120]   It seems to me that Google is kind of shooting it itself
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:13.120]   in the foot, because if this low quality production routine
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:20.280]   successfully clocks up Google with content farm produce,
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.560]   how is that good in the long run for Google?
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.800]   I don't see how it's good for Google
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.600]   in any sort of longer term future.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.880]   - Well, I mean, so this conversation is interesting to me
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.280]   because when I think about demand media,
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.560]   my first reaction is like yuck.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.320]   - Me too, I think it's cynical.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.520]   - Yeah, but when I think back to my four years
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.920]   running Life Hacker and--
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.040]   - That's what you did.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.920]   - Surf results all the time.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.760]   - Sure. - Absolutely.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.840]   And we tried to write articles that people wanted
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:50.680]   and that people were--
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.000]   - I did the same thing, I don't want to show
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.640]   if I don't think anybody's gonna listen to it,
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.760]   of course not.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.480]   But I do the editorial judgment
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.760]   as opposed to the mechanical.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.000]   - Right, right, I mean, this process
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.640]   that we're describing with demand media
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.680]   just does sound particularly kind of awful.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.520]   But I mean, so the question here is the quality of the content.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.480]   Like Jay was just saying, stuffing the internet
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.200]   with low quality mediocre content
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.480]   is gonna be bad for Google and bad for the internet.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.160]   But I mean, who judges what's low or high quality content?
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.800]   The fact is if there's better,
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.200]   Google has to get so good that if there's a better article
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.720]   than a demand media article,
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.360]   then it should be ranked higher in Turkey.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.440]   - Exactly, that cuts-- - Someone else
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.080]   has written an article about Harley Davidson belt buckles.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.280]   If the demand media article is the first one
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.840]   that comes up 'cause there's nothing else,
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.760]   that's good for Google,
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.160]   even though it's kinda crappy content.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.960]   - How does Google do that objectively, not subjectively?
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.880]   - Well, Matt Cutt said on this show
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.880]   that they were looking for two things, right?
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.760]   One is a signal of originality,
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.800]   which is also an issue in news, right?
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.360]   The 43rd Associated Press rewrite of a story
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.320]   cuts off the links in the link economy
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.040]   to the original Washington Post story.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.560]   That's kind of unethical.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.560]   You shouldn't lose the provenance of the original journalism,
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.160]   I think, and the old system wasn't set up for that.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.880]   So Google's gonna look for more signals
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.840]   of original content.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.880]   They're doing that in Google News now, Matt said,
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.720]   where they look,
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.080]   if there are a lot of attributions,
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.600]   the Washington Post said they'll give more credit
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.720]   to the Washington Post.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.320]   - Yeah, I think Google has the capability to do this.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.160]   For sure. - And then they also
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.480]   are looking for signals of quality,
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.320]   and I don't know what those are.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.760]   Do you have any idea, Gina?
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.280]   - Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.640]   I mean, I think that authority,
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.400]   you know, the PageRank or some sort of authority ranking,
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:27.320]   citations, inbound links, reputation over time.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.240]   I'm not sure.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.120]   I don't know how an algorithm would judge quality.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.040]   - This reminds me of the free market dogma,
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.840]   that the free market can do everything,
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.440]   and it will never break.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.880]   And there's this dogma that PageRank can do anything,
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.200]   that PageRank is an algorithm that,
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.720]   no matter what, will come up with the best content.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.520]   And this is a really interesting challenge case.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.760]   - Because-- - But demand doesn't try,
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.560]   demand doesn't depend on PageRank.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.960]   They depend on-- - Well, don't they?
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.320]   - Neverly, not really, because if they cared about that,
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.200]   they would care where they place these things,
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.480]   but on a whole, they don't care--
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.960]   - Well, I disagree, yeah, I think they do care.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.080]   They find ways to-- - They need to come in first
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.400]   and the search, or they don't make money.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.600]   - Yeah, they care like about.com.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.520]   All either was automate the structure about.com, hence.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.360]   - Right.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.400]   - Well, why aren't they trying to build,
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.720]   this is the key to me about demand media.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.840]   Why aren't they trying to build a brand,
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.640]   demand media, out of what they do?
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.400]   - Because they don't think that will help with Google juice.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.280]   - They don't need to, because their ads don't come
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.720]   from sales to brands, their ads come from--
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.880]   - They're automatic.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.080]   - It's like about.com.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.600]   - It's all about Google juice and nothing else, right?
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.760]   So if reputation doesn't help Google juice,
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.960]   then they don't need to worry about reputation.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.760]   - It's the tyranny of good enough.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.640]   If they're good enough and they don't like game,
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:45.920]   the system makes higher. - But this is the test
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.960]   of PageRank, because if PageRank really is good,
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.120]   it should recognize reputation, authority,
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:52.960]   and all of these things.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.160]   But these are ineffable qualities that are very difficult
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.320]   to objectify.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.280]   - Can I tell you something that happened
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.800]   when I interviewed Richard Rosenblatt,
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.560]   the CEO of demand media?
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.400]   - Yes.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.600]   - I asked him, what happens if your algorithm tells you
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.160]   there should be an article on belt buckles
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.760]   that are Holly Davidson inspired?
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.440]   And your other algorithm tells you
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.280]   there's a certain amount of search revenue available
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.440]   for that article.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:25.160]   But in order to produce a quality article on that,
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.080]   it costs you more than the available revenue.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.600]   What do you do then? - Interesting.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.440]   - Like what happens?
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.400]   What is the company's philosophy?
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.000]   - Well, you don't do it.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:33.840]   - Well.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.920]   - You don't do it.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.360]   You're in business.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.000]   - He was. - You're not a charity.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.320]   - Unable to understand my question.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.840]   I had to keep asking him. - Oh, interesting.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.280]   (laughing)
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.200]   He understood it perfectly well, Jay.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.520]   - Yeah, that sounds super interesting.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.920]   He's a good question, but I'm not.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.760]   - I got it.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.600]   - But I got it.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.920]   (laughing)
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.640]   - He understood your question.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.400]   - So that's to me is.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.840]   - That's the cynical part.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.240]   - Yeah, that's the cynical part.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.600]   - But he's not doing news.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.960]   This is part of the reason they say
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.720]   that they're not doing news, they can't do news,
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   they won't do news.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.560]   - Right, that's why they do.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.880]   - That's why they do.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.760]   So that's their solution is, they're saying,
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.720]   no, they're filling a store shelf with content.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.560]   - We grew up in an era where news was pro bono,
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.600]   where Edward R. Murrow said we do the news
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.120]   because it's right to do the news
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.960]   and it was a loss leader for networks for years,
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.200]   but it was the right thing to do.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.320]   That era is clearly dead, all you have to do
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.200]   is watch the network newscast for a minute
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.160]   and you realize that is.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.440]   - It was a false market anyway.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.880]   It was the price of your spectrum in the day.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.040]   - Right.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.800]   You had to do this. - Yes, but demand media
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.000]   takes it one step further, which is,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.680]   CBS decided a long time ago that the news isn't a loss leader
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.560]   anymore, the news must profit.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.640]   But demand media pushes it one step further
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.480]   because now the only articles worth doing are the ones
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.600]   that are profitable, which is one step further.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.000]   - There's no public interest involved at all.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.440]   Well, there's public interest in the sense
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.040]   that they're interested.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.760]   - Well, it's no different though, morally
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.440]   than this old house magazine.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.280]   - Right.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.120]   - No, it's fine.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.680]   I just wonder who's gonna cover the story
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.880]   that the public isn't interested in,
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.560]   but is in the public interest?
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.520]   - We'll train those poor suckers.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.920]   - We're counting on you two.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.600]   (both laughing)
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.920]   - The honor, bigger story to me is that you,
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.920]   again, you have AOL, it's where we got us here.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.960]   You have AOL and Yahoo.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.040]   Each saying they wanna be the premier creator of content,
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.040]   the biggest creator of content on the internet.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.920]   And Tim Armstrong says quality content.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.320]   I think that in a new Google world
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.040]   where Google figures out quality, that will matter.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.680]   But to the content business, it's such a great business.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:47.080]   The real message of demand to me is that
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.200]   we're in a world of unlimited content creation.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.440]   And that's where I think the value shifts
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.280]   to the curator, to the filters.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:58.960]   - Well, what strikes me about the demand model
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:03.760]   is that it isn't pointed at creating trust.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:08.800]   And that's what I don't know is whether editorial brands
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   that are focused on creating trust in the product
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:19.480]   will be able to realize a market differential
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.960]   over an operation like demand
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.200]   where trust is not a factor at all.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.120]   - That's, I love that because that's exactly
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.120]   what we try to do here.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.880]   We still make the calculus, though.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.880]   Can we make money on a show before we launch it?
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.840]   'Cause it costs money to make a show.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.360]   - Right, but we aren't asking,
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.880]   are we making money on this 15 minutes?
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.880]   - No.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.840]   It's a question that actually we've been talking about today,
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.560]   our salespeople are in town.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.320]   And it's a big question, but I think that ultimately,
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.920]   I would hope that in the long run,
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:57.440]   trust and quality would in the long run beat these things.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.280]   Why does Yahoo buy associated content?
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.200]   - I don't know.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.320]   I would love to know the answer.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.680]   - That's where I can't figure out.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.600]   They see it as a volume game.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.640]   - Just more. - More we have.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.480]   - More is better. - Yeah.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.080]   - Well, they're already, by the way,
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.200]   I mean, we talked about this a few weeks months ago,
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.400]   that they're already huge in terms of content volume.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.000]   They're one of the biggest content companies in the world.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.400]   - A lot of growth in them.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.240]   - Yeah. - I don't think it's
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.080]   one of the other things else.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.360]   The way I put it in a really dorky blog post
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.360]   with a diagram I did a few weeks ago
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.440]   is that I think that media,
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.240]   we assumed that brands were the magnet.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.760]   We came to buy the paper, we come to watch the show,
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.520]   and that's still gonna be true to some extent,
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.400]   but through both search and through the human links
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.360]   of Facebook and Twitter and such,
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.320]   and algorithms, all of those, means of discovery,
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.080]   the brand instead becomes a label.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.680]   And once you're there, once you see all these
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.320]   research results on Google,
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.320]   then the question is, is the brand enough to push you over
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.920]   to click on the second or third link,
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.920]   and so the first one, that's what we're doing.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.080]   - I think it's a person.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.600]   I think it's about people.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.080]   People come to Twitter to watch Leo.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.080]   - And you. - And you.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.600]   - And I think it comes down to people.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.520]   And I trust Google enough that I think that if Jeff
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.560]   does a blog post about Harley Davidson belt buckles,
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.720]   that it will beat any demand media article
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.600]   in search results, hands down.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.600]   - And they can do that, actually.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.080]   - Because you're a trusted blogger who have been doing it
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.120]   for years and years, you have authority as a person.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:24.120]   I mean, I think that it's easy for Google to grok.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.560]   People who have been doing quality work
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.280]   that has consistently had authority over the course
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.440]   of years versus some non-brand.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.200]   - Algorithms, algorithmically. - Non-aimed,
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.520]   freelanced, algorithmically.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.320]   - What's what you know, a place where he wants.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.320]   - It has to be algorithmically.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.520]   - The next big challenge is algorithmic authority.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.760]   - It has to be.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.520]   Reputation and authority are very difficult,
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.720]   but if this is to work, it has to be solved.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.840]   - It won't be one size fits all though.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.080]   That's the key to this.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.080]   - Exactly, you know, we interviewed the guy
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.440]   who founded Mr. Tweet, which is the presumption of it is
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.080]   that we are gonna show you who's got authority.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.480]   He said, well, to my kids, I have a lot of authority,
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.400]   but I may not to you.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.960]   It is totally subjective.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.800]   - Right.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.200]   - And how does Google do that?
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.040]   I don't know.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:08.280]   What about Jim Fallow's article in the Atlantic
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.080]   about Google's saving journalism?
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.260]   Is this part of that?
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:17.160]   Is this what Google needs to do to make that effort succeed?
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.040]   - There was no news whatsoever in that piece.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.720]   Everything in there was old.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.040]   - Well, that's 'cause you wrote the book.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.640]   - The editor. - Jeff, come on over.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.960]   - The editor was new.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.280]   That's what was important.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.400]   The presumptive relationship of Google to news
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.040]   has been one of hostility and blaming Google
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.400]   for news's problems.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.120]   And Fallow's, I was delighted to see, came and said,
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.040]   whoa, no, they care.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.640]   And let me tell you what they're doing.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.560]   - Well, not just Fallow's.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.840]   I mean, Eric Schmidt said, we're all in this together.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.800]   - Yeah, but he's been saying that no one--
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.920]   - No, we believed him.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.760]   - But tend to sneer when they were quoted,
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.720]   and Fallow's took him at his word and his level
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.160]   and admitted that they were personal friends in doing so.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.600]   And I think that's what was important.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.720]   Jay, what did you think of it?
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.760]   - Pretty much the same.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.520]   It was a tone poem.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:05.440]   It wasn't a information-filled article.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.640]   But I think the way I read it was,
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:13.120]   Fallow's was talking to the professional fraternity
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:16.440]   of journalists and telling them,
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:21.440]   look, you think you understand Google as a threat to news,
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:26.720]   but you don't really understand how they think about news.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:31.560]   And it wasn't so much informing Atlantic readers about Google.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.000]   It was signaling to his peers in the profession
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.800]   that they did an attitude adjustment
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.800]   that their presumption about the company was off.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:48.840]   - Gina, did you learn anything?
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.120]   Did you see the piece that you learned anything new
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.720]   about what Google's doing in news?
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.240]   - I'm embarrassed to say that I saw the piece
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.320]   two minutes before we started it,
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.840]   and my immediate thought was too long later.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.360]   (laughing)
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.200]   - Sorry, which-
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.360]   - Kim's Fallow's never wrote an article.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.560]   It didn't take a day to read.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.040]   That's just the thing it is.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.360]   - But I also have to say that I think Fallow's
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.280]   is pretty much my number one guy in journalism.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.000]   - I've loved him for decades.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.480]   I mean, I think he's fantastic.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.160]   - I would name him the number one journalist in America.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.960]   - Wow, that's pretty high-quality.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.160]   - But he did a test, but we talked about this
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.560]   on the air once of Google versus Bing.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.520]   And so he is an old-style journalist.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.560]   He was coming at this new stuff,
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.760]   and by the way, he gave up because he
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:29.960]   kept on going back to Google.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:30.800]   (laughing)
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.880]   - As have we all.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.560]   (laughing)
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.400]   Let's talk about some of the announcements at Google I/O,
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.360]   'cause unfortunately, our Twig show was after day one,
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.640]   which turned out to be not the day.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.480]   - Not the day.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.320]   - The keynote. - Not the day.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.120]   - The big keynote was the next day.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.120]   That's where Android 2.2, where Google TV,
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.760]   and I think some under-reported Google announcements.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.800]   There were so many at Google I/O.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.440]   - There were.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.240]   - And there was some stuff that I would like to highlight
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.120]   that maybe wasn't highlighted in the mainstream.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.640]   So we'll do that. - That's good.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.440]   - Yeah, we'll do that in just a second,
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.080]   but before we do, just one more commercial
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.680]   before we get into that, and it's for Carbonite.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   My friend's at Carbonite.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:13.680]   I, David Friend, happily named, is a friend.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.480]   He's the guy who created Carbonite,
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.880]   and we have a little bit in common.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:24.480]   Among other things, he started Carbonite
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.960]   when his daughter went off to college.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.720]   Well, you got Jake going to college in the fall,
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.760]   and I've got Abby going to college in the fall.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.880]   And of course, Abby's saying,
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.720]   okay, you're gonna get my laptop right.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.400]   I said, yeah, but I'm gonna tell ya,
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.840]   and I may not tell her this.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.360]   I'm putting Carbonite on it before she leaves.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.640]   Carbonite is back up, done right.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.120]   I'm not, there's no way at this point,
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.680]   I'm gonna be able to train Abby to back up her system.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.360]   It's just not gonna happen.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.760]   She hasn't backed it up all year.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.600]   She's not gonna back it up when she gets to school.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.680]   However, if I put Carbonite on her laptop,
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.640]   and this is PC or Mac,
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.480]   whenever she's within access of the internet,
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:03.640]   which is probably most of the time at school,
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.520]   and the computer's not busy doing something else,
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.280]   it will back up her files automatically.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.640]   Her personal file's unlimited amount from that hard drive.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.240]   And whenever she calls saying,
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.920]   "Dad, I threw out my thesis,"
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.240]   or, "The dog ate my homework,"
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.800]   I could say, "Oh, good news."
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.560]   Lock into Carbonite, and it's all there.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:23.320]   And best of all, $55 a year,
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.040]   less than five bucks a month for unlimited backup
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.280]   for any PC or Mac.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.120]   Great for a laptop 'cause they do get lost,
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:29.940]   they do get stolen.
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.200]   Great for a student, or maybe you,
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.400]   if you're one of those people who just forgets to back up,
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.960]   frankly, if backup's not automatic,
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.560]   and if it's not offsite, I don't consider it a backup.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.720]   Carbonite is back up, done right.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.480]   Free for you, you can try it.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.440]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.000]   If you go to Carbonite.com
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.680]   and use the offer code TWIT right now,
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.360]   15 days free, just to give you,
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.480]   and I do recommend this book,
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.320]   don't run out and buy it just 'cause I said so.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.760]   Try it first for 15 days
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.640]   because it does rely on your upstream bandwidth,
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.240]   and you know what, if you don't have a good connection
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:01.400]   to the internet, this is not gonna be a good choice for you.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.960]   It also takes a little while to backup
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.320]   if you've got hundreds of gigabytes,
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.200]   and you could on your internal drive these days,
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.880]   it may take a while to backup, you wanna understand that.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.080]   So try the trial, go to Carbonite.com,
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.280]   use the offer code TWIT.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.720]   If after the trial you say, you know what, I do need this,
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:19.080]   then what I suggest you do is you use the coupon code TWIT
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.560]   to sign up 'cause you'll get two free months,
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.280]   and that really reduces the cost.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:27.160]   13% of hard drives crash in the first year.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.800]   43% of people lose files they consider irreplaceable
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.200]   every year, this is from a CMU,
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.940]   Carnegie Mellon University study.
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:40.280]   Over 600,000 laptops lost or stolen at US airports every year,
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.720]   600, that's 10,000 a week.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.200]   If they bulb it backed up by Carbonite,
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.480]   it'd be a lot less anguish in the world.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.360]   Carbonite, backup done right.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.320]   You gotta back it up to get it back.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.400]   Carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIT.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:56.600]   So we were talking before the show,
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.240]   and I said after Google I/O, Gina,
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.880]   I was learning how to write software for the iPad,
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.360]   'cause I'm a hobbyist, I'm never gonna write anything serious.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.440]   I got so excited by the notion of open,
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:08.440]   by where to Android is going,
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.600]   the notion of an Android tablet,
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.840]   the notion of Google TV running Android apps,
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.160]   they showed an Android app just running out of the box.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:16.600]   On Google TV I said, "This is,
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.040]   "who wouldn't wanna write for this platform?"
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.680]   You were there, it was a developers conference,
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.840]   were developers stoked?
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.280]   - I, they were, they were.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.680]   I was gonna say, you know, in retrospect,
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:27.280]   and they kind of proved the point
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.520]   when they launched the Pac-Man thing,
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.320]   it's like Google is incredibly good
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.120]   at winning the hearts and minds of developers.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.720]   I mean, it was just like a wonderland,
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.880]   every five minutes, it was like,
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.040]   "Oh, there's this other API
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:36.880]   "that lets you do all this cool stuff."
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.160]   - They know their audience.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.000]   - They know their audience.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:39.840]   - They know their audience.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.240]   - And despite the kind of awkward nerdy
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.640]   and sometimes there are problems during the demos,
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.200]   you know, some of the speakers weren't the best,
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.600]   although Vic Condotra was awesome.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.400]   - Vic is the new Steve Jobs.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.800]   - Yeah, Vic is the guy.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.000]   But there are some other demos that weren't so good still.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.680]   It was, it was really, it was awesome.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.400]   And the general feeling was total excitement
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.640]   and kind of just feeling a buzz.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.080]   And definitely, you know, you don't hear conversations like,
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.360]   "Oh, I'm gonna take another look at buzz."
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.760]   Or, "I'm gonna take another look at the camera."
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.080]   This phone is really cool, wow, okay.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:10.040]   So, yeah, it was a really good conference.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.880]   And so, yeah, I'm excited that you're developing for Android.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.200]   That is very tight. - Well, I mean, I'm not.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.760]   You're never gonna see an application for me.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.960]   - I know, but you're trying it out.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.240]   I'm fun.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.240]   - I'm really excited about Android now with 2.2.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.120]   I really like the phone. - You won me over.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.800]   You know, I was fighting against this idea
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.160]   that Android versus Apple in this open versus close.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.760]   I was fighting it, I was really fighting it.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.600]   And I've been one over, and I think it's chiefly by you, Gina,
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.040]   because, but I've always been a believer.
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.680]   I've always been a believer in open, you know?
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.880]   But I always thought, "Well, there are times
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.840]   "in proprietary and closed, makes sense."
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.680]   And Apple, because it's a closed space,
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.240]   could do such elegant things,
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.760]   2.2 for one thing is pretty amazing.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:51.280]   When I can take my Nexus One and turn on Wi-Fi access
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.040]   and turn it into a Wi-Fi for no additional cost,
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.400]   and have all these devices using Wi-Fi off of this.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.240]   - That's great.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.540]   - You can't do that. - Apple Mode saves me
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:02.880]   $80 or $60 a month.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.440]   - Yes. - Mm-hmm.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.120]   - That's what Open does.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:09.120]   That's, to me, that's kind of in a nutshell.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.680]   - No, we were really gonna be able to do that
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.960]   in extra cost, or is that gonna be a good game?
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.160]   - I did it, I've been doing it.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.560]   T-Mobile has instead of thing.
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:19.400]   - T-Mobile, no extra cost, but you know other carriers,
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.840]   like Sprint, I'm sure is gonna--
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:21.920]   - They charge 30. - They charge 30.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.260]   - They charge 30. - They charge 30.
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.480]   - Yeah, yeah, so, I mean, it's gonna depend
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.840]   on the carrier, but right now T-Mobile's just like,
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.640]   yeah, I mean, it's unlimited, you can do what you want.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.040]   I mean, it's obviously, it's very slow.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:35.560]   - How would they have-- - My question is, how would they know?
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.960]   They would have to get the handset.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:37.800]   - Well, why, how would they know?
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.440]   - It just looks like more data access to them.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.160]   They don't know that I'm tethering.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.240]   - Right, right, so then, right, exactly.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.600]   So these unlimited data plans,
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.400]   are they gonna throttle you at some point?
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.080]   I don't know, it'll be interesting to see.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.040]   - As you rise, it already has a throw on it,
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.440]   right at five gig. - Five gig,
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.560]   most have five gig, and I think T-Mobile does.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.240]   Now, I have to say, this is going to hasten something
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.520]   that's bad, which is the, we're gonna start seeing pay
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.880]   as you go, not flat rate plans.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.560]   It's funny because the same thing happened
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:08.400]   in the desktop space where internet service providers
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.280]   have for a long time said, oh, we wanna charge
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.120]   for the amount of bandwidth they use in there.
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.160]   They're starting to do tiering,
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.880]   Comcast has different speed tiers.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.640]   They are putting caps on.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.080]   They really don't like all you can eat.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.440]   And I have to say, this is just gonna hasten the death
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.360]   of all you can eat on the unsullen mobile phones.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.720]   - Yeah, with 4G, like coming in with really good speeds,
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.840]   people are gonna do it more often, so yeah.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.160]   Yeah, it'll be much more usable.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.920]   - There was a little talk about this as it's erupt.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.880]   It really goes to what I keep arguing
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.880]   that mobile becomes irrelevant,
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.560]   and one panel was pushed on the idea
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:42.920]   of where does this stuff go?
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.360]   And finally, I think Dennis Crowley from Four Square said,
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.720]   well, yeah, you'll end up with something
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.640]   that's attached to your head all the time.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.360]   - Well, let's call this cellphone.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.000]   Well, it's gonna be my belief, wherever you are.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.280]   And when you have that, you start to ask,
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.520]   he talked about this stuff, and why use ITP,
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.440]   and you ask new questions.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.480]   Who's in this room now?
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.040]   Who do I need to get in touch with?
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.920]   Who knows friends of mine?
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.240]   Who has answers to my questions?
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.400]   What's around me?
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:12.240]   Ubiquitous connectivity becomes so wholly different.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.880]   And so I think at some point then,
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.040]   to try to throttle, to put the clock back on that?
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:17.920]   - It's hard.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.200]   - It's gonna be really, really hard.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.600]   The guy, I don't know if I mentioned him before
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.360]   on the show, named Tom Evslyn.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.800]   You ever heard of him?
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.640]   - I have.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:28.080]   - He's the unsung hero of the internet.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.800]   Tom was the head of AT&T WorldNet,
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.200]   and he was the guy who created 1995 flat rate pricing.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.360]   First AOL did, and took the ticking clock off the internet,
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.120]   and then's when we started to browse.
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.760]   Four was tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:41.840]   Are you still on that damn thing?
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.680]   Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:43.680]   - You're right.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:47.360]   - So as the clock went off, look at what exploded.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.200]   - Very interesting.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.040]   - The clock got back.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.640]   - So he's saying it would be retrograde to do that,
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.560]   and we can't. - Oh, horrible.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:53.640]   Horrible.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:54.480]   - I hope so.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.040]   - And they'll, but it'll be no different
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.720]   from Rupert Murdoch putting his paywall up any day,
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.720]   and he'll learn the hard way.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.000]   - Right.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.600]   - We all suffer because we don't,
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.000]   you can not buy the Times of London,
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.280]   you can buy five other papers in London.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.680]   - Well, you know, I don't really have to--
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.520]   - I kinda had this epiphany because what I realized
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:14.480]   is that we're the reason that the PC space exploded,
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.640]   the compute, you know, the desktop computer space exploded,
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:17.720]   is because it was essentially open.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.320]   Anybody could develop for it on any platform they wanted,
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:21.640]   anything they wanted.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:24.040]   You didn't have to go through anybody to buy it.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.640]   And we're going exactly the wrong direction
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.120]   with these closed platforms.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.960]   It's not good for innovation.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.920]   And if you want the same kind of explosion
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.360]   that you had in the desktop space, on the mobile space,
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:37.440]   you've got to be open.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.280]   So--
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.880]   - I keep complaining about the idea that apps
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:43.000]   are gonna close down data from things like Search.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   - I thought it was very interesting, John Dorr,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.680]   when he talked to Charlie Rose at Disrupt,
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:50.800]   was really saying it's an app world,
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.640]   and he was really--
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:55.000]   Now he's got certain investments that involve apps.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:55.840]   - Huge.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.320]   - So it's in his best interest.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.600]   And I was saying, no, I really bugged me.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:01.840]   I didn't feel like that's--
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:02.680]   - Yeah, it scares me.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.520]   - Yeah.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.520]   - Really, honestly scares me.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.600]   - It's too close.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:06.600]   - That could be exactly.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.800]   - You guys have run me over, I have to say.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.180]   - That Google is, it's StationEml5World,
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:13.920]   it's an HTML5World, and the people with the fastest browsers
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.960]   that can render, you know, web content well in a browser
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:17.880]   are gonna run, you know, that's--
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:18.800]   - That's our best hope.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.640]   - Yeah.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:20.480]   - That's our best hope.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.480]   - Scribb showed amazing work with HTML5 at Disrupt.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.960]   - Isn't that the coolest thing?
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.800]   - Oh!
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.680]   - Because what it can take a magazine that still looks
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.880]   like a magazine with every fancy font in it,
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:33.760]   but now the font is seen as a font and it's searchable.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.080]   - This to me is one of the--
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.720]   - So it kills the PDF, God bless 'em.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:39.080]   - Yeah, I thought, when I saw this,
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.360]   I thought Jeff's gonna love this.
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.120]   Because it means that anybody can publish
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.320]   in an open way on any platform, it's web browser.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:50.800]   - Jared Friedman from Scribb said, you know,
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.480]   they're amazed at how wonderful this is on HTML5.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.920]   It only makes 'em think how the last version was crappy.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.920]   - Right.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:58.240]   - They didn't know it was crappy at the time.
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.320]   It's quite amazing.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:02.840]   So that frees up content to be searchable,
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.560]   linkable again.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:05.520]   That's what we gotta go with.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.480]   That's what we gotta fight for.
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:09.240]   - It's back to the open world.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.080]   - Definitely.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:10.920]   - Yeah.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.920]   - Can I say something about that Leo?
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:12.760]   - Go ahead.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:16.280]   - I've noticed this dynamic in this tension
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:19.200]   between open and closed systems where
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.120]   some of the children of openness,
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:25.520]   people in the tech world who've benefited hugely
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:29.080]   from the web and from the open web.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:34.520]   After a while, they begin to think
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:37.840]   that their own religion as it were
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.880]   isn't as savvy and realistic as they wanna be.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.200]   And so they start to turn against it,
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:49.360]   not so much because they are against it,
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.520]   but because after a while,
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:55.960]   they sort of fear that they're beginning to sound like
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:00.120]   like apostles, like--
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.040]   - Like hippies.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.400]   - Like hippies, exactly.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.400]   - Gosh darn hippies.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.400]   - And it's the fear.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.720]   Yeah, and there's this fear of,
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.400]   I don't wanna be, you know,
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.920]   I don't wanna be with the hippies.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.920]   I don't wanna be cool people, the savvy people.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.240]   And what happens is that then they begin to say,
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:22.880]   they begin to find appeal in arguments
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.560]   that they used to reject,
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:27.880]   like it's too complicated for the users, you know?
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:30.040]   And people want protection.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:33.040]   And maybe in the end, that's just the way
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.040]   the internet's gonna be.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.360]   And I just find it really fascinating
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.240]   that after a certain point,
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.560]   the very people who have benefited from openness
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:47.280]   in order to be savvy start to turn against it.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.200]   And then they start kind of--
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.200]   - Have you thought of it?
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:55.200]   - Well, they start ridiculing their former colleagues,
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.120]   as kind of these clueless hippies
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.480]   who have a religion that--
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.400]   - They're gonna be savvy for--
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.480]   - For investors, for stockholders, for--
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.960]   - For grownups.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.560]   - I think it's more self-image than anything else.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.560]   - You know who's the poster boy for this is Steve Jobs,
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.480]   who is absolutely the ultimate hippie
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.040]   and still thinks of himself that way,
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.200]   but is in fact an incredibly savvy capitalist.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.880]   I mean, there's no question about it, right?
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.680]   And he is totally built in Empire,
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:26.080]   OS X is built on open source,
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:28.480]   totally built in Empire on open.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.320]   - It's true.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:30.440]   - And is now saying, okay, thanks,
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.560]   we'll pull the ladder up here.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:34.000]   - So will Larry as he grow up?
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   - Guys, I hope not.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.240]   - Is that the problem?
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.840]   - That's the big question, you know,
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.480]   to this morning, by the way, one of the announcements
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.000]   which was so exciting is that there's finally
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.360]   an API for Google Buzz.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.360]   And you're now already seeing third party--
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:51.400]   Seismic, immediately Seismic Web immediately adopted it.
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:53.880]   You're gonna start seeing third party apps.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.320]   Gina, can you comment on the API?
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:58.080]   It looks very nice to me, but I'm not an expert.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.640]   - Yeah, I just started actually looking through it
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:00.880]   this week and it looks really good.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.160]   I haven't written anything against it yet,
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.480]   but I'm gonna write a think tank plugin for it very soon.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.440]   So I'll be able to tell you more.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.960]   I mean, it seems like it's in its beginning stages,
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.480]   but it looks really good and I'm using it,
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.080]   I think TweetTek.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:13.200]   Does TweetTek have it yet?
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:15.760]   - TweetTek Web has it and Seismic Web has it,
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.560]   but not the apps. - Right, Seismic Web has it.
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:18.960]   Yeah, those guys are super fast.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.440]   It looks really good, I'm just glad.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:23.040]   I'm glad that it's out there and now, and now,
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.120]   and now possible.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:25.880]   - So people understand the import of this.
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.560]   One of the things that really put Twitter over the top
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.080]   is it's third party applications.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.960]   In fact, few people use the web to tweet.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.520]   They use third party applications.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.320]   And the lack of third party applications
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:37.520]   was severely hindering Buzz, in my opinion.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.960]   - Definitely, Twitter was like, is it a case study
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:43.080]   in how to launch a very simple API
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.560]   that for better or for worse, I think it was for better.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.040]   You could authenticate just passing in
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.680]   a clear text user name and password just to try it.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:51.120]   Having that API front and center,
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:53.600]   and it was so easy to implement,
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.280]   that developers just jumped on it.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:58.280]   And I think other web apps should be launching
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   with an API that's simple and that easy from the get go,
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.240]   just like Twitter did.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.000]   - So here's my-- - Do you think that
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.680]   the thing we've talked about before of Twitter
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.720]   now competing with those developers,
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.280]   does that affect Buzz in developers' views?
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.680]   Does this make Buzz perhaps an alternative platform?
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:18.640]   - I mean, I definitely heard,
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:22.520]   kind of overheard a lot of renewed interest in Buzz at IO.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:26.080]   But I don't know that Twitter necessarily triggered that.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.960]   I mean, I think that the feeling is just like,
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.360]   we can all work together.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.440]   You have these aggregators like TweetDeck and like Seesmik
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.760]   who are saying, you know, here,
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:34.200]   some of my friends are here, some of my friends are here.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.920]   It's kind of a bad reality for users, right?
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.200]   'Cause it's just like fragmented communities of friends
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.240]   across other communities.
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.720]   But it lets developers create products that are open to all,
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:45.880]   whatever network that you like.
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.040]   And that's a good thing.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.480]   So I don't think that people are jumping ship from Twitter.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.200]   I mean, I love Twitter and I'm kind of--
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.840]   - You still tweet first Buzz last.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:55.680]   - Yeah.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.880]   - See, I buzz first tweet last.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:58.160]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.760]   But I'm definitely taking a look at Buzz
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.280]   and especially now that I'm gonna do some development
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:03.360]   for Think Tank too.
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.760]   So at the API, certainly will be a good thing.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.360]   - That'll make a big difference.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.680]   So this morning I'm on Buzz and I thought,
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:13.480]   well, maybe I'll use Orkut instead of Facebook.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.040]   And people asked quite reasonably,
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.600]   well, what makes you trust Google more
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:18.840]   than you trust Facebook?
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:20.680]   Isn't it all the same?
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:24.120]   - We keep coming back to that question on the show.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:25.360]   - It's a fundamental question
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.680]   and I don't know if I have a good answer for it.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.120]   Maybe Jake can help us.
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:34.800]   - Well, when you decide to trust or not trust,
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:40.520]   I don't think you look at this policy and that policy,
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:47.640]   you make a overall judgment about the company
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:50.920]   in which every interaction that company has with you
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.720]   is factored into your judgment.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:58.720]   And the reason I trust Google is not that I'm unaware
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.520]   that they're just capitalists like everyone else.
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.800]   I know that.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.680]   I know that they put their own interests first.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.520]   I don't buy, don't be evil.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.000]   I'm not a victim of their public relations.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.240]   I don't think, I think instead it's that
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.280]   in the full range of their interactions with me
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:25.000]   as a company, they justify a certain amount of trust
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   more so than other companies that I deal with.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.600]   And that's what I don't understand about Facebook.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:37.600]   Facebook is never actually does anything
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:43.320]   as a public facing company that causes me to trust it more.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.320]   It just doesn't.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.760]   It doesn't have any ear for that whatsoever.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.040]   - Jake, let me ask you this.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.800]   When Gina described how developers were walking around
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.640]   all excited and saying,
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.760]   "Oh, I'm gonna build things on this and this and this."
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.520]   My dream is that a news company
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.400]   should be operating the same way as a platform.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.360]   And that relationship and that mood
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.960]   is what we should have and we just,
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.560]   our culture doesn't have it.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.960]   Facebook at the same time has the same developer community
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.680]   building tons of apps,
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.960]   but it just seems such a different,
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.360]   even with just developers alone,
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.280]   it's such a different ethos now.
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.680]   - Well, Jake, your son was a Facebook developer.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.880]   What's his attitude these days?
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.800]   - He thinks that people have been overly harsh on Facebook
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.760]   and that he kind of gets what they're doing.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.560]   And the problem was simple to him.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.680]   They were too granular, okay.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.160]   Now they have something so poor, all right, let's move on.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.400]   - Will he continue to develop for Facebook?
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.400]   - I think now we gotta wait till the last finals are done,
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.360]   but I think he's also interested in Android.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.880]   - I'd be very scared to develop for a platform like Facebook.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:43.720]   I mean--
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.960]   - I think that's per vision now.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.440]   - You don't know, you're really.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.640]   - Jake gets it.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.160]   I mean, Jake is younger than all of us
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.240]   and Facebook was part of his life.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.080]   You know what I mean?
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:53.920]   In a way that probably,
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.360]   I assume wasn't part of any of our lives.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.200]   You know what I mean?
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.020]   - Right.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.160]   - Like he trusts it because it's like the telephone
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.840]   that he uses to call his friends, you know,
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:01.680]   all of his friends.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.840]   So it's kind of different.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.880]   So I can see him having, you know,
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.320]   being a lot more forgiving than we are.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.480]   I mean, I never really quite was embedded in Facebook
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.120]   the way I have been in Twitter or--
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.960]   - Even as a developer, you know,
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.440]   but just look at that subset,
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.000]   that public for each company.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.600]   You have the developers now, I think,
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:22.800]   trusting Facebook less than Google
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.880]   and trusting Facebook less than Twitter,
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:25.880]   even though Twitter was recently
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.880]   done in competition with them.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:32.080]   Is that fair?
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.680]   - You know, I wasn't on F8.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.960]   And I don't really don't know very many Facebook developers.
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.880]   It's hard to say.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.040]   I mean, I think that the notion is that
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.040]   Facebook has all the users.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.160]   They have the social graphs.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.560]   You can build things that, you know,
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.760]   connect people to their friends easily.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.320]   I mean, I think it was really exciting for Pandora and Yelp
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.080]   and all those, you know, partner sites to build those things.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.760]   I mean, I think some developers got really excited
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.240]   about writing apps that showed you how not private
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.240]   your profile was or like all the people
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.560]   who were going to a strip club and had no idea
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.360]   that you could search their status updates.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.680]   I think that was, there was some excitement there.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.520]   But that's just kind of like the zing got ya.
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.760]   Gotcha, you know, of the kind of particular
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.240]   part of a developer community.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.280]   But I mean, yeah, I would say the developers trust me.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.400]   - There's also a good group.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.640]   There's a large group of developers
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.520]   who will go where the money is.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.080]   So, you know, they may not love Apple,
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.160]   but they love the revenue potential.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.200]   They may not love Facebook.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.480]   I mean-- - This is what people say.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.760]   Oh, you want to develop for Android?
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.200]   Go ahead, we'll take all your money.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.560]   Like, it's just like, we'll take all your revenue,
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.880]   which drives me wild, by the way,
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:37.960]   because you can sell apps in the Android market.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.240]   And now that Leo has shamed me
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.600]   into the fact that all my apps are free,
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.560]   I buy Android apps now.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.720]   - I buy all my Android apps.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.560]   - I buy all my Android apps.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.600]   Yeah, and there are lots of apps that I actually wish
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.040]   I could buy that are just free.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.320]   - Like to support, yeah.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.200]   - Yeah, I mean, it's true that the open source culture
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.600]   does emphasize free.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.120]   That is true.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.880]   But yeah, so there definitely is this perception
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.000]   that the app store, the iTunes store,
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.320]   is where you go if you want to make money.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.880]   But I think that is total BS.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.480]   I think people make money out of open source software
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.880]   all the time.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.320]   I have my full-time job as developing an open source project.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.880]   There's ways to make money, you know, that--
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.440]   - Well, Android is a mix,
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.600]   'cause I mean, it's a commercial,
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.280]   I mean, it's open in the sense you could develop for it,
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.160]   but it's certainly on commercial platforms.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.480]   People buy the phone, they buy the service.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.800]   There's money being exchanged.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.960]   I don't think that it's somehow some magic, you know, money.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.400]   - This is, I go back to what I was asking,
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.080]   yeah, I think this is exactly what should be going on
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:30.640]   in the news industry is that when we push newspapers
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.360]   to think of the blog network around them,
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:35.400]   they should be looking at them as Google does developers
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.360]   and Facebook does developers.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.320]   How do we make them succeed?
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.840]   If they succeed, we're better off.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.840]   Life is cheaper for us.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.760]   They'll spread our message, they'll spread our software.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.320]   But-- - Well, the Guardian hit way ahead
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.160]   on this, Jeff.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.320]   I mean, did you check into what the Guardian is doing
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.520]   with their API now?
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.360]   - What are they doing?
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.720]   - I know, well, yeah.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:57.720]   - Well, they just announced an open Guardian program
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:01.360]   in which not only do they let you have access
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.680]   to almost all their data,
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.440]   but they'll build businesses with you.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:09.160]   And that's how they hope to make money
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:12.800]   is they will either give you a syndication deal
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:16.040]   if you use their content or they'll do a revenue sharing
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:19.960]   thing with you, but they expect people to build businesses
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:24.400]   on what they publish and they're trying to make it
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.880]   as easy as possible to do that.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.600]   And they are all in, unopened.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.960]   That's basically what it comes to.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.840]   - I love it 'cause now you have something to compare
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.960]   against Rupert Murdoch.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.960]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.560]   And Emily Bell, who's soon to depart
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.360]   and compete with Jay and me when she goes
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.400]   to Columbia University, who's the head of digital there,
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.040]   has said it well that the Guardian sees they need to be part
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.760]   of the fabric of the web.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.520]   It's this idea of trying to get people to come to a brand
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.200]   as a magnet doesn't work for them anymore
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.840]   and they've got to go where the people are.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:54.200]   And then develop a product. - Meanwhile,
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:58.560]   meanwhile, it's becoming clear to me that
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:03.200]   the New York Times is gonna try and do something hybrid.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.800]   It's not really correct to call what they're doing
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.020]   a pay wall.
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:14.360]   I think that they believe that a lot of people
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:18.080]   will pay for the times voluntarily.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:24.440]   And they're clearly gonna design their metered system
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:28.000]   so that if you really don't wanna pay, you won't have to.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.720]   And it's not what a lot of people thought originally.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.640]   They're not really going down the same route as Murdoch,
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.640]   but they are also not going down the all-in,
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.680]   not open route of the Guardian.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.440]   - Boy, this is such a great discussion.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.520]   I hate to cut it off, but we're running out of time.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:51.120]   I think we gotta do our tool and tip and number of the week.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.640]   But can we do this again next week?
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.480]   (laughs)
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.320]   - Yeah, this has been great.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.200]   - I just find this so fascinating.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.720]   There's so much more to say about Google I/O.
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.320]   We didn't really talk about Google TV.
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:06.320]   And one of the little things I loved was the support for fonts.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.760]   - Yeah.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.000]   - I just think that's fantastic.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.680]   - Yeah, as one of those little API things,
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.520]   you're like, oh, better what I mean,
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.360]   that's for everybody.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.200]   - Yeah.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.360]   (laughs)
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.680]   - Just so many little things like that
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:17.880]   that came out of Google I/O.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:21.280]   It's just, I don't know if Google's evil or not.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:24.760]   And I guess it's a silly thing to even ask the question,
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.040]   but I like where they're going.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:27.880]   I really like what they're doing.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:30.120]   - I think the fact that they ask is the key, Leo.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.400]   The fact that they give license to their employees
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.200]   to question the company and try to define evil
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.320]   every day there.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.840]   At TechCrunch, I got into an air-ranging moment
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:40.680]   where I was in line.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.840]   And the question I wanted to ask Chris Cox from Facebook,
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.880]   somebody said, ask, I got up and said,
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.800]   is Facebook evil and sat down?
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.440]   And I said, don't wanna ask it.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.280]   (laughs)
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.320]   - No, next question.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.440]   - What's your definition of evil?
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.280]   - There you go.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.480]   - That's the key is what's the thing that you have to do
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.240]   to maintain the trust of your public?
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.600]   Say that.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.320]   And then that gives principle to everything else.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.800]   And Zuckerberg started to say it in his Washington Post piece.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.360]   I don't think he rose high enough,
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.120]   which I think was Jay's complaint too.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:11.040]   - That was a piece of crap, that piece.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.880]   (laughs)
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.680]   - That's a little bit to look at.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:18.280]   - Mark is not the guy to explain what he's up to.
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:19.120]   Clearly.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:19.960]   - Neither is Eliot Trag.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.520]   - Neither is Eliot.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.520]   - No, definitely.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.040]   - You hit the nail on the head, Jay,
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.840]   when you said they need an ombudsman.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.760]   They need a public face.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:28.600]   - Somebody who's wearing a--
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.040]   - He's funny and charming.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:30.880]   - Yeah.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.720]   - Yeah. - It's serious.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.480]   - I'll do it for 50 million a year.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.320]   (laughs)
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.480]   - I know you wouldn't.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.640]   (laughs)
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.800]   - I'd have to think about it.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.640]   That's a lot of money.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:40.720]   - You'd have to think about it, but you wouldn't do it.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:41.880]   - No, you're right.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:44.760]   I don't know if I could face myself
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.160]   in the mirror in the morning.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.000]   (laughs)
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.360]   - We need mirrors when you got 50 million.
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:50.680]   - Well, that's my point.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.160]   (laughs)
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.200]   - That's like the old advice.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.120]   If you can sell out, you should sell out
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.600]   because you will sell out.
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.440]   - Oh, that's good.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.760]   - And you can't, you won't.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.240]   - Do you tell your students that I like that?
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.720]   - Yeah, if you can, sell out, sell out
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:04.960]   'cause you will anyway.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.200]   - Eventually, they're gonna get you.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.040]   - Yeah.
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.640]   - You can't sell out, that's the point.
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.560]   And they don't.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:14.160]   - So I've had, I think I could sell out.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.320]   I don't know, I'll have to check.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.160]   (laughs)
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.360]   That's my wife.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:19.720]   Jay Rosen is a professor of journalism at NYU
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.880]   and just a great guy to have on this show.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:22.720]   Please come back.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:23.560]   - Have a great day.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.400]   - Follow him on Twitter.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:27.560]   It's @jrosin_nyu.
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:32.400]   And his website is W, you have to do the www, by the way,
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.800]   www.pressthink.org.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.600]   If you wanna read more of his stuff.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.760]   And Jay, if you wanna stick around too,
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.000]   but it's time right now for Gina's Tip of the Week.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.320]   - This is a really simple one.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.640]   Next time you're in a coffee shop
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.160]   or on an open Wi-Fi network
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.520]   and you have to search for something kind of embarrassing.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.360]   Like, yeah.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:54.120]   - Oh, I love it, I'm so glad you did this, I forgot.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:54.960]   - That's huge.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.800]   - That's huge.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.640]   - That's huge.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:57.480]   - That's huge.
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.320]   - Whatever.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.720]   Add an S after the HTTP when you hit google.com.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.280]   They just launched Google searches
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.360]   over in encrypted connections.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.120]   So, https colon slash slash google.com.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.800]   And all your search terms will be encrypted over the wire.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.040]   So, if you're on an open network,
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.080]   people can see what you're searching for.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.680]   - Well, you still be in the history, Gina.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.520]   - No.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:20.160]   - Oh, it's completely blank, isn't it?
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.800]   - And I think it's still in your history.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.160]   - It's in your web history.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.200]   - And your computer is history.
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.200]   - Not that it matters.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.400]   My life is an open blog and I don't care.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.800]   - Of course it is, of course it is.
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.520]   - Unless you're in incognita mode or security.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.720]   - It's just advice to our secret abusers.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.000]   - But yeah, if you use Chrome,
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.720]   which by the way is all I use now,
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.000]   they've now released the Mac and the Linux version.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.280]   - Right, those were out of data.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.800]   Yeah, you can go in incognito mode,
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.840]   which won't save things to your history.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.320]   So, you use the encrypted version,
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.880]   no one on the network can see what you're searching for
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:51.320]   and it won't be in your history.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.920]   And actually, Matt Cuts did a nice write up
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:57.040]   about how difficult, it doesn't sound like a big deal,
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.160]   but it's kind of a difficult feature to roll out,
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.600]   for a company like Google, it's got so many servers.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.440]   And so, that's linked on the friend feed.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.080]   And also, if you want your Google searches
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.160]   to default to HTTPS all the time,
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.240]   there's a Firefox add on that will do that.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:12.120]   And I believe away in Chrome as well to do that.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.240]   So, anytime you hit google.com on the search,
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.800]   it'll just redirect to the HTTPS version.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:17.920]   Those are linked on the front feed.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:22.920]   - To me, this is a perfect example of Google not evil.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.600]   I mean, this harms their ability to track
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.120]   what you're doing, it's private-serve.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:27.960]   - Well, it doesn't really,
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.000]   they still have a record of what you're doing,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:30.960]   they don't think?
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.240]   - They would still have a record, right?
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.440]   They're like, no one in between.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.000]   So, like no, you're the router, you know what I mean?
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.040]   So, it prevents people from sniffing your searches
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.080]   while you're on a network.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.360]   So, but Google definitely, Google still has the,
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.120]   because it hits their servers and they decrypt it, right?
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.720]   They decrypt their request on their end.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.920]   - Well, I'm gonna give you, my tool will be something
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.560]   that proves Google's not evil, but first.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.160]   But, and by the way, HTTPS searches from now on,
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.000]   that's awesome.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.360]   Just for the principle of it.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.200]   Yeah, it's like encrypt all your email just 'cause you can.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.720]   - Yeah, yep.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:04.720]   - Heck with you cable company.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.600]   (laughing)
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.480]   - Well, that's what I've always said.
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:08.720]   You know, many people talk about privacy,
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.240]   say, well, you know who knows everything.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.000]   Your internet service provider.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:12.840]   - Yes.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.280]   - You see everything you do.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.240]   Are you worried about them?
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.920]   They've got a box in there, the FBI put in there.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.920]   - That's what I have on my Google.
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.280]   - Yeah, yes.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.280]   - That's why you use SSH tunnels and VPNs, kids.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.200]   - There you go, there you go.
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:25.040]   There you go.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.560]   And now only the Google will know.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:31.560]   Our number of the, our number of the week, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.920]   - I think the numbers, I see the obvious one
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.320]   that I had to do, of course, is that the Pac-Man wasted
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.720]   according to rest of the time.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.320]   You know, point eight million hours of time,
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:42.760]   which added up to a $120 million of productivity,
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.920]   which also shoots down Google's announcement this week,
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:48.680]   that they did a study and found that they believe
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.560]   they've added 54 million, sorry, $54 billion
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.400]   of economic activity for American businesses.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.760]   And one of them just note on that.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.760]   I just from a higher level here.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.280]   I think it's interesting that they've added up
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:04.320]   what they feel businesses have made because of Google.
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.640]   There's some argument in some quarters
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.720]   while they would have made it anyway.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.840]   I've got beside the point.
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:11.320]   But to me, there's another economic impact of Google
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.840]   and the internet that's huge,
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.280]   which is how much money we save, the internet dividend.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.720]   That's what's throwing the economy into craziness now,
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.360]   I think because innovation doesn't necessarily yield growth.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.240]   It yields efficiency now.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.080]   - Yes.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.480]   - It's just enough.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.200]   And that's a huge impact on the economy.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.160]   But we don't know how to measure,
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.280]   because we always measure growth growth growth.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.280]   So anyway, Google came out with a $54 billion,
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.320]   then took some of it back with wasted efficiency,
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:42.360]   but I think also causes untold uncounted efficiency
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.880]   in the economy and so think it has an even bigger impact.
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:50.880]   And by the way, Pac-Man is now permanent at Google.com/Pac-Man.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.640]   - With the ongoing quality, by the way,
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:56.640]   Ms. Pac-Man on the two player, yay.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.400]   (both laughing)
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.960]   - If I joined the show, I would add clown of the week.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.480]   - What's the clown of the week?
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.400]   (both laughing)
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.160]   - The tip of the week, the number of the week,
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.520]   and the clown of the week.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.400]   - Oh, you'll just, you will be the clown of the week.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:15.840]   - No, I will, if I were a regular on the show,
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.480]   each week I would come to you with--
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.320]   - Do you have a nominee?
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.160]   - No, it is.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.120]   - Yeah, Cara Swisher.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.320]   - Oh, wow, okay, Cara's gonna be on Twitter this week.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.520]   Tell me why she's the clown of the week.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.680]   - Well, I got highly annoyed with her last night
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:35.320]   because she published a post about Rob Glaser
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:38.040]   getting a new job as a venture capitalist.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.560]   - Yeah, he quit real networks shortly.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.280]   - You did real networks are quit.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.880]   - Quit or whatever, something.
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.920]   - For, and I just felt that as a journalist,
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:50.680]   if you write about Rob Glaser and you do not mention
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:54.360]   that his product, real player, was one of the most hated
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:55.440]   products on the level.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.960]   (both laughing)
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:01.960]   And that it was almost the definition of bloatware
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:05.600]   that if you just pass over that,
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:10.600]   you're revealing yourself as an industry-centric journalist
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:15.600]   and you don't have users in the center of your consciousness
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.320]   when you're writing that because from a user's point of view,
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.080]   that's who Glaser is.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.680]   - Well, maybe she assumes we all know that.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:28.760]   - Well, maybe, but there are a lot of things in that piece
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.840]   that we all would know.
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.280]   Anyway, I was very annoyed by that.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.120]   - I should from now on, when I say Rob Glaser, comma,
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.720]   the jerk who brought you real player, comma.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.320]   - I just want you real player.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.160]   - Why not?
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.320]   (both laughing)
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.520]   That's what I would do, absolutely.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.120]   - Well, I should disclaim this a little bit.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.320]   Rob is a college classmate of mine and I know Rob somewhat.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.440]   And, but I agree with you.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.320]   - And he repents.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.920]   - You want to repent?
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.400]   - Then we can stop saying that.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:00.040]   - He did inflict a nasty thing on us all.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:00.880]   - Thank you.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.440]   - Yes, I will buy that.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:06.400]   Now, I really should make my two tools.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.680]   One, of course, is that Chrome is now out now
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:11.800]   on all three platforms out of beta.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.320]   And I have to say, because of the,
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.000]   for a long time, I continue to use Firefox.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.920]   Just because of the rich set of extensions available,
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.000]   there is a very rich set of Google Chrome extensions out now.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.040]   And I would say that Chrome has parity in that respect.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:29.040]   And my God, it is so much faster and better and lighter.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.080]   And I just love Chrome.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.400]   - I did something really stupidly.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:35.080]   Oh, I saw, oh, it's out.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.960]   So I downloaded, installed it and realized
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.160]   that I had installed the old beta.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.280]   Of course, Chrome had already updated it for me.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.520]   - That's, yes.
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.880]   Some might say that's not a good thing, but I like it.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.720]   - Yeah, it's fine.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.360]   So I double installed it, but I'm fine now.
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:47.360]   I like it.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.640]   - It's the easiest upgrade in installing history.
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:50.840]   - So before you do anything, folks,
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.840]   look at your version.
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.560]   - I'm probably happy. - I'm out today.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:54.400]   - Yeah.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.840]   And anytime I install Linux, the first thing I did,
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:56.960]   was put Chromium on there.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.960]   And I, now maybe you can clarify this for me.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.120]   Is it still called Chromium?
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.760]   Or are they gonna call it Chrome now going forward in Linux?
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:03.600]   Do you know Gina?
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:04.800]   - I think it's Chrome.
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.040]   I think Chromium is the open source project, right?
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.000]   And then Chrome is the Google product.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.840]   So I believe that they're calling Chrome on Linux.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:11.680]   - Okay.
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.320]   So when I guess I'll go get Chrome, I don't know.
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.160]   I use Chromium.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.280]   I mean, I don't know what their difference is.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.320]   It seems to be functionally identical.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.840]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:19.840]   - Pardon me?
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:20.680]   - I have to go.
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:21.520]   - Okay, Jay, thank you.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.400]   Great to have you on J. Rosen.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.680]   Oh boy, when he went.
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.520]   (laughing)
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.600]   - This is a determined man.
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.080]   - Pish!
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.280]   Well, and he's right because I've been dawdling.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.120]   And here it is.
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:32.320]   This is my tool of the week.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.720]   And this shows that Google is not evil.
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.520]   The Google Analytics opt out browser add on.
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.440]   Ladies and gentlemen, if it bugs you
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:44.000]   that sites like mine collect analytics, which we do,
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.200]   you can now opt out by just adding this browser add on
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.600]   available not only for Chrome, but for Internet Explorer
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.440]   and Firefox.
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.080]   - You do it like it or not.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:52.920]   - Yeah.
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:53.760]   Right.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:54.600]   - Right.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:55.880]   - Yeah, and there's no business case for them to make this.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.000]   - There's no business case.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.680]   Except that maybe trying good win goodwill.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.640]   - Mm-hmm, but right.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:03.080]   - And some journalist said, oh, well, this is in response
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.280]   to complaints about privacy from the EU and so forth.
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.040]   I don't know, maybe it's proactive, but just seems like
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.480]   this is a kind of thing a company does that says,
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.640]   okay, you don't want us to do this, we won't do it.
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:14.960]   I like it.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.480]   I can't see Facebook ever releasing something like this.
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.960]   I'm gonna opt out Facebook.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.200]   The Google Analytics opt out browser, just search for
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.560]   tools.google.com.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:27.680]   And it's called GAO output, you could better opt out.
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.440]   - Oh, Leo, I forgot the other numbers I should have done
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.400]   real quick, real fast.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:31.240]   - Yes.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.560]   - Google released the AdSense share this week.
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.640]   They've been saying since January they were gonna do it
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.840]   and they did and they give 68% of revenue on content ads
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:42.720]   to the publisher site and 51% of search to the publisher.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:43.960]   - They're telling people now.
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.680]   - They're telling people that.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.640]   Italy kind of wanted to, but they said since January
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.560]   and Davos when I asked about this among other people
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:52.240]   asking about this of course, that they were thinking about
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.840]   doing it and they have now revealed that.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.640]   - You've not revealed the YouTube split because they say
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:58.320]   it's too new or the game split, they've revealed this.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.720]   - You're never gonna pry the amount of money I give back
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:03.000]   to you guys out of me, so I'm pretty impressed.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.320]   (laughing)
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:07.160]   I'm impressed, they're less evil than I am.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.360]   Let's put it that way.
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:12.160]   That's really good news, that's really great stuff.
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:15.960]   And by the way, Google was a plotting when Apple bought,
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.480]   what is the other company because it meant that Google
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:21.960]   didn't have a monopoly with AdMob and in fact,
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:25.400]   they got approval now from the FTC because of it.
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:27.760]   - Other reason to write apps for Android.
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:28.840]   - They got it.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.000]   - They're gonna make money.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.640]   - In fact, that ad platform looks surprisingly like I ads,
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:33.480]   I have to say.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:35.200]   - Oh, it's almost identical.
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.480]   Hey, thanks for being here.
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.800]   Jeff Jarvis is of course the author of
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:40.920]   What Would Google Do?
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.240]   You must buy it and read it and understand.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:46.320]   He also blogs at buzzmachine.com
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.680]   and is a professor at Cooney.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:49.520]   I'm gonna get it right this time in journalism
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.160]   at the City University of New York.
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.320]   Does that make you an arch rival?
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.160]   - Oh, absolutely.
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.000]   - All right.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.440]   - We're good friends, our daughters are good friends.
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:57.280]   We have barbecues together.
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.360]   - Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.040]   - Our daughters are the same age.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.160]   - Oh, how sweet.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.240]   That's great.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.600]   Gina Tripani, who is much beloved by Geeks everywhere,
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:09.080]   is the blogger who created Life Hacker.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:10.840]   Continues to blog at smartaward.org
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:13.800]   and is the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave.
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:16.600]   Now, much more interesting, thanks to Google.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:18.960]   - Everybody can get in.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.360]   - Yes.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:21.200]   - And I'll be very interested.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:22.200]   We didn't really talk about Wave
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:23.320]   in the Google announcements.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.560]   Maybe next week we can do that.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.080]   - I used Wave to interview Scoble for my book.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.160]   - Did you really?
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.000]   - Oh.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.040]   - That's a perfect use for it.
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:31.880]   - Interviews and stories.
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:32.960]   - I thought Gina would be proud of me.
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.720]   - Yes, I am proud of the heart swells.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:36.560]   - Why is that cute?
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.680]   - They keep telling me that.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:38.520]   - Thanks for joining us.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:41.360]   We'll see you next week on This Week in Google.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.940]   (upbeat music)
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:46.520]   (upbeat music)
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:49.100]   (upbeat music)
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:51.680]   (upbeat music)
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.260]   (mellow music)
