[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.640]   It's not as easy as you think.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.080]   How a nine-year-old got rich on YouTube,
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.200]   and Mark Zuckerberg throws the internet to the wolves.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.440]   It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.840]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show we cover the Google verse,
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.040]   which includes, at least in my view, the Twitter verse, the Facebook verse,
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.600]   the journalism verse and all the other verses.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.120]   Here's the man who is the master of verse.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.120]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.120]   Ah, he is.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.960]   For me, I'm getting ready for the show today.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.240]   Wow, he's got a book called Moral Panics.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.920]   If you didn't write it, they picked the wrong person.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.360]   He's the Leonard Town Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.200]   of Journalism at the City University of New York, who wrote Moral Panics.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.680]   It's one of the classic texts, Eric Goode and Nachman Ben-Yuudah.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.680]   Wow.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.280]   I didn't realize there was a whole book dedicated to Moral Panics.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.280]   Oh, I've got a whole shelf here on it.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.280]   I'm researching.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.280]   I'm researching.

[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.600]   You have the book, Jeff, but he's got a title card.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   I'm his cheerleader.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   Yeah.

[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   No, no.

[01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:04.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:07.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:09.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:11.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:12.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:15.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:17.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:18.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:21.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:23.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:24.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:25.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:31.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:34.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:35.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:36.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:38.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:40.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:45.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:51.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:52.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:53.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:54.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:55.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:57.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:00.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:01.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:04.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:05.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:07.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:10.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:11.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:13.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:14.440]   I'm going to be with you.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:22.440]   They realize very quickly this nine-year-old labor laws would prevent him from working 24/7.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:31.440]   They created additional channels with animated characters and so forth.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:35.440]   I haven't watched it, but I could lord $30 million.
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:42.440]   Now he says, "Whenever I was much younger, I liked to play with toys, so we do lots of
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:47.440]   toy videos, but now I like to do gaming videos, science, arts and crafts, exercising."
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.440]   Well, I'm glad to hear that.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:52.440]   There's Ryan's Toys Reviews.
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:58.440]   There's animated characters, including combo panda and Gus the gummy gator.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:01.440]   What is his parents' jobs?
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.440]   Apparently this.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.440]   Management.
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.440]   No.
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:05.440]   No.
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:06.440]   I mean, like, how did they get to the...
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.440]   They actually have a manager.
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:11.440]   They have pocket watch, which is a former YouTuber created.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:17.440]   They created a pocket watch who's been making a lot of these deals.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:22.440]   He was at Maker Studios and has now branched out.
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:29.440]   There's something that I think gets overlooked in, particularly with the people wanting to
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:32.440]   be a big YouTuber.
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:37.440]   It's not always just getting those funds from the Google Ad service.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:38.440]   What's it called?
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:39.440]   AdSense.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:40.440]   It's getting paid from Google AdSense.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.440]   It's more than that.
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:47.840]   It's about your brand and getting it in front of millions of people to pay you directly,
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:50.440]   not pay you through YouTube.
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:56.960]   People like Gary Vee and Roberto Blake, they get a lot of flack for their hustle, hustle,
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:02.880]   hustle talk, but they also try to tell you, "Look, it's not just putting all your eggs
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.840]   in one basket of YouTube.
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:11.160]   It's taking your brand to YouTube and growing beyond that and just using that as a bit of
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.160]   leverage.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.040]   If you've got a lot of subscribers, you're going to get a lot more eyeballs, but you've
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.840]   got to go beyond YouTube."
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:25.480]   Well, to that point, you remember last year YouTube, which was getting in a lot of trouble,
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:33.440]   got a $170 million fine because of advertisements targeted at children, demonetized all the videos
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:34.440]   of the kids.
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:39.840]   Apparently, that cost Kaji 50% in his sales.
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:41.480]   That's why it's so important not to be.
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:45.800]   You don't want it to be dependent on somebody else's platform ever.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:51.640]   The more you can branch out and diversify, this is a line you'll like, Jeff.
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:53.320]   This is from Bloomberg Business Week.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:25:00.080]   There are six-year-olds on YouTube who draw larger daily audiences than Tucker Carlson.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.080]   That makes me hairy.
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:10.200]   Koko Mellon, the most watched channel on all of YouTube, launched a line of toys in September.
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.800]   They have licensed episodes to Netflix.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.760]   Yeah, that's the key.
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:22.440]   The problem is, I don't know how anybody knew that this kid would be the thing and that
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.080]   it would make it.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.360]   Obviously, he must be very charismatic.
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:31.520]   I wonder how he's going to do it in adulthood.
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.520]   What happens to him when it goes away?
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.920]   I mean, it's just like every child's start ever, but this is a child's start $30 million.
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:44.120]   I hope he's afraid that he can just- Hopefully, he can just- I would love to give my daughter,
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:48.280]   let's say, $20 million of the $30 million and be like, "Hey, you know what?
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:49.280]   Go to college.
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:50.280]   Find yourself."
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.280]   Your college is paid for, kid.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.280]   This is here.
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.280]   This should be a 16-year-old VC instead.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.920]   I don't know why.
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:02.920]   It's also bad, though, to peak too early because then you spend the rest of your life wondering
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:03.920]   what happened.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:08.880]   Well, I mean, is it a peak to be analyzing toy videos?
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.200]   I mean, think about it.
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:15.240]   It's a peak in terms of, yes, that's a heck of a lot of money, but you could go and then
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.240]   peak in a completely different career.
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.880]   I would just say- I never liked the term.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.880]   Sorry.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:21.880]   Go ahead.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:22.880]   Peak?
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:23.880]   Yeah.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:24.880]   Be either.
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.880]   No, I've never liked the term viral.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:31.320]   Someone's video went up on YouTube and it went viral.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:38.960]   It's great for that moment, but I want longevity for the content that I personally create.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:44.120]   If you go and watch Hands-On Photography right now, I want you to be able to look at it a
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:49.240]   year from now and it still be just as useful and important to you.
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:53.520]   Not something that just fades out like a fad, which is typically what happens with a lot
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:55.480]   of this viral stuff.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.000]   I can remember, what was it?
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.920]   Harlem Shake, was that the name of it?
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:26:59.920]   Yeah, I still remember that.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:03.840]   I remember you breaking a table in the school court.
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:04.920]   Was it about a month later?
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.400]   We all forgot about it.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:13.800]   It was just, you know, if TikTok's even worse, like these trends go come and go like in minutes,
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:16.880]   it seems like, but everybody does it briefly.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:19.880]   So how about this young lady?
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:22.440]   Interestingly named Stephanie Jarvis.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:27.560]   Yeah, I wish it were a lot of lost cousins, but I would have to fix that.
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:32.960]   She realized, along with her friends, that for the amount of money they pay for their
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:42.240]   flats, they could buy a Chateau in France and create a YouTube channel called the Chateau
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:47.800]   Diaries about their life living in the castle.
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:53.640]   So I ended up watching an entire hour, almost about how YouTube saved her with the pandemic
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:58.960]   and everything and how she now it's her full time job.
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:01.360]   The fans help her redo the Chateau.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.560]   You think, well, she's making a fortune.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:06.880]   No, the Chateau is worth as much now as it was when she bought it.
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:11.240]   But she also in season, we'll have a bed and breakfast and have events and stuff.
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:21.240]   But she's charming and because every Jarvis is, and it's kind of mesmerizing how she
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:24.720]   has her kickstarter fans and YouTube fans.
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:26.600]   And this is her life now.
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:28.680]   This is her living.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:38.520]   There must be a thing going on with Tiktakers and YouTube's who have houses designed for
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:43.320]   Tiktocking and YouTubing.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:55.120]   I was watching, there's an 18 year old Tiktoker, Julia Graf, who has the strangest house ever.
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:56.640]   It's got a slide in it.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.760]   It's got a drive in movie inside drive.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:04.280]   It's the craziest thing ever.
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:08.360]   And I realized, I mean, I think about I Justine, I mean, I think you at some point in your
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:15.000]   life, you decide I'm going to be an event.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.480]   That's how you succeed on these things.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.520]   I'm going to be an event.
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.080]   But it must be exhausting.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:25.240]   I would be exhausted by the whole thing, right?
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:29.560]   Well, it's not much older than the event crowd.
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.760]   I guess if you're young, yeah, maybe.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:37.680]   I mean, I would be, you know, I wouldn't do it now, but like when I was 23, sure, I'd
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:38.680]   be in a minute.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:39.680]   Did you have the energy to do that?
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:41.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.680]   Yeah, maybe that's it.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:47.560]   I mean, I had the energy to start twitting my 40s or was it my 50s?
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.560]   No, my 40s.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.560]   No, it wasn't your 50s.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.840]   I don't think I could do it now.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:53.840]   That's for sure.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:54.840]   Yeah.
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:57.040]   All right, Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.040]   Green stories.
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:00.040]   Section, section 230.
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:01.040]   Turn it.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:04.040]   I put this one up.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.040]   I'm pissed.
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.520]   I'm pissed.
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:14.120]   So tomorrow, all of the executives are coming back to testify for Congress, including Sundar
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.120]   Pichai.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:19.560]   We'll talk about what he says, which is a lot more tenable, if you ask me.
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:22.720]   Jack Dorsey of Twitter, Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:27.760]   We have their written statements ahead of time.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:36.560]   Mark Zuckerberg basically pulled the rug out from under section 230, which protects platforms,
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:41.760]   allows them to moderate, says they can't be sued for stuff people put on Facebook or
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.880]   Twitter or our chatroom or our forms and that kind of thing.
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:48.000]   We're not liable for that.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000]   We can.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.440]   We can moderate it without becoming a publisher.
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:55.960]   It's really the, as you say, Jeff, what is it, the 13 words that created the Internet?
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:56.960]   26.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.960]   It's some number of words.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:00.800]   You're almost there.
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.040]   I only read half of it.
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:06.040]   I got to read the snippet posted on the Google site.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:07.520]   That's all you need to know.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:08.880]   That's all I need to do now.
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:16.800]   So Zuckerberg, now he's not saying abandoned section 230, but he said, you know, what we
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:22.080]   should do is you should earn your right, or there's a problem right there, earn your
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:28.960]   right section 230 by showing that you have a good moderation scheme.
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:31.960]   And that's exactly not what section 230 is all about.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:38.240]   Yes, I'm going to attempt to moderate our chatroom or moderate our forums.
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:42.640]   But the reason Mark likes it is because he's a winner.
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:47.280]   You know, anybody with the money that Facebook has can sure easily show a best practices
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:50.000]   plan to moderate, whether it works, whether they do it.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.400]   That doesn't matter.
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:57.120]   But if you're a small, you know, some guy wants to start a forum about opening toys,
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:02.320]   you may not have the means to do full moderation, something that would satisfy Congress.
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:06.160]   You shouldn't have to earn 230 is, I guess, the point.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:07.160]   Thank you.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:08.160]   Well said.
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:10.800]   Can you make a bumper sticker out of that?
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.160]   Let's hope Congress does not listen.
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:25.000]   Now, Pachai, I thought was good at defending the free internet and the N230.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.840]   Let's see.
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:32.280]   Without section 230 platforms with either over filter content or not be able to filter
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.480]   content at all.
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:34.480]   Perfect.
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:36.760]   Exactly.
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:40.760]   So he said, you know, you should have a content policy that's clear and accessible.
[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:41.760]   We have that.
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:42.760]   That's you can.
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:44.200]   That's not hard to do.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.360]   Should notify people when content is removed.
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.360]   Yes.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.000]   And give them ways to appeal.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.680]   Okay, maybe.
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:56.920]   But of course, section 230 may or may not be under attack.
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:01.920]   You know, who will be under attack, not only at this testimony tomorrow, but in general,
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:06.960]   we're seeing strong signals from the Biden administration that he is very much interested
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:12.160]   going after big tech, the latest, they're floating a name.
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.560]   Let me, it's not.
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:14.560]   I don't see it.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.560]   He's sitting there.
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:16.560]   What line number is that?
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:17.560]   Is this Leena?
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:18.560]   I don't know.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:21.840]   You have the magic radar where you can find this stuff.
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:24.240]   I'm not giving you another line number, man.
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:25.240]   Leena.
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:27.440]   Leena Khan.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:35.560]   Who is this is the headline from the Verge Biden to nominate tech antitrust pioneer.
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:39.000]   Leena Khan for FTC commissioner.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.560]   She's very well known.
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:42.560]   She is.
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:43.920]   She's very interesting.
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:47.040]   She came to the four, like just four or five years ago for it.
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:48.040]   She's young.
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:56.880]   She wrote us her thesis, which is, I mean, so really good paper, all about evaluating
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:59.880]   how we think about monopolies with Amazon.
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:01.880]   Yeah.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:04.200]   And talk about, to me, this is very inspiring.
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:09.400]   This is like this idea that if you are truly deeply passionate about thinking about a big
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:15.240]   issue and you delve into the research and you create something, she's really moving the
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:16.240]   needle with this.
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.840]   I just, I think it's kind of an inspiring story.
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:19.840]   Good.
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.840]   Nice.
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:22.840]   And we want thoughtful people.
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:25.680]   We don't, I mean, this is the problem with the Section 230 regulations.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:26.920]   It's very knee jerk.
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:31.280]   It depends on, you know, what you, how you feel about deep platforming conservatives
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:32.600]   and things like that.
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:37.280]   We want people who are thoughtful who are really saying, what can we do to do this right?
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:42.520]   And she may be all wrong and who knows, but, you know, I think she's thinking about it.
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:43.520]   Right.
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:44.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:47.760]   But now, so that's Tim Wu, Lena Kahn.
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:52.760]   Tim Wu bothers me more because Tim Wu, as I think I said last week, you know, he, he,
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:56.920]   I read a paper of his from 10 years ago and people have been sorry in talking about this
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:01.640]   too, is that he, he says he questions whether the first amendment is obsolete.
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:05.960]   He questions whether the platform should be held to a journalistic standard.
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:07.360]   All right.
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:08.960]   This just doesn't work.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.560]   Well, again, I mean, he's a smart guy.
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:12.920]   Well, we have isn't working.
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:15.280]   And I think we need to think about what we want.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:18.360]   Well, the first, the first amendment, I'm not giving up on the first amendment.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.360]   Sorry.
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.360]   I'm not giving up on the, but, but, okay.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.600]   Well, that's what he's, he's ready to give up on the first amendment that puts my alarms
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:29.560]   going, maybe it's just a way of saying everything is up for grabs.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:30.560]   We should really.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.560]   All paper about it.
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:32.560]   Yeah.
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.320]   It wasn't just for 10 years ago.
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.080]   That way he's told has been saying it.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:37.080]   Oh, okay.
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:39.000]   It's not, it's not an instant decision.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.960]   Like I just wrote a tweet saying, maybe it's obsolete.
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:41.960]   Oh, what do you think?
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:42.960]   Oh, trust.
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:43.960]   I'll just be provocative.
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:45.960]   No, just he's been talking about papers.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:46.960]   A big deal.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:49.960]   Well, I'll see what happens.
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:53.920]   You know, one, one cabinet member does not a summer make.
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:56.320]   Uh, let's see.
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.320]   All right.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:00.360]   What about, let's talk about medium a little bit because it's not completely.
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:09.320]   Clearly clear what's going on there, but this morning I woke up to news that that, um,
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:14.220]   and this is, I think, I think you can safely say this is anti union sediment, uh, from
[01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:20.180]   F Williams, the founder of medium that they've decided not to continue with their own in-house
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:22.440]   journalistic endeavors.
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.040]   They have quite a few one zero debugger.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:26.040]   You've written for debugger.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:27.960]   I know Jason's written for one zero.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:30.280]   Megan Maroney is an editor at one zero.
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:31.280]   One zero.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:37.400]   Uh, all the people who work for one zero were offered buyouts and the impression I got
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:44.360]   from the internal email was that those publications were just going to go away and that those
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:48.500]   people who currently worked for those publications would be allowed to continue on as editors
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:53.760]   for people like Jeff contributors to medium, but not for in-house publishers.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.360]   Don't you edit my post.
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:57.360]   Don't you touch on me.
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:02.000]   Team writes F we are making some changes to our editorial strategy and leadership and
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:08.920]   giving a voluntary exit option to employees who would like to take different paths.
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:15.560]   Jeff, what, what does this mean?
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:20.320]   Some people are saying we have to point out that there was a unionization effort and medium
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:27.320]   that failed by a very close vote by one vote and that all of the people who just got paid
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:32.560]   in the pink slips in effect were very strong advocates of that kind of unization.
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:36.480]   So but the, but the union did fail and so it wasn't there.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:42.200]   So it couldn't be cune firing people who, um, no, it's, I saw a labor lawyer say, no,
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:44.080]   this is perfectly within his rights.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.760]   Uh, and he wasn't firing people for organizing.
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:48.840]   He the vote went through the vote failed.
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:49.840]   He's not firing people.
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.600]   He's saying I'm giving you buyouts if you want.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:52.600]   Here they are.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:53.600]   Yeah.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:54.600]   And he is.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:58.000]   But I think I think it's more likely.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.680]   Ev is the pivot Meister.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:04.320]   He is pivoted this sucker a number of times because Ev is trying to find a model and he
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:06.360]   still frankly hasn't found it yet.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:07.360]   Right.
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.520]   So he started off journalism is expensive.
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:12.160]   Well, it's time to just journalism.
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:13.560]   You can be right in anything you want.
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:14.560]   It's a blog platform.
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:19.080]   It's a pladdish or as some horrible word, but what these things were like one zero.
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:20.440]   These were really like journalistic entities.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:21.440]   They were good journalistic efforts.
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.840]   Yeah, very good.
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.600]   But he's trying to make a business.
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.840]   He started trying to do a new kind of advertising.
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:29.280]   He gave up an advertising entirely.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.960]   He's rejected advertising entirely.
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.320]   So everything we talked about before, hey, get rid of advertising.
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.320]   Okay.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.320]   Ev did it.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:41.000]   So Ev says to people pay was a five bucks a month and Leo the port riled about that.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:47.520]   And then he splits it up against all the parties and the more audience he gets to pay, the
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:52.680]   kind of better he is, but was the investment in those efforts worth it or not.
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:56.640]   And the other part that people are talking about is this may be a very sub stack reaction
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:03.400]   that that past publications is the what you call it, not the solitary writer, the sovereign
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:04.640]   sovereign, right?
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:06.640]   Right.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.040]   That's where I'm going to say the future is.
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:09.040]   That's ridiculous.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:14.240]   But at least the current fad is the individuals and that that's where they have the money and
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:15.240]   opportunity.
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:18.040]   I don't really know.
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:24.280]   He's offering lump sum payment of five months salary, six months of health benefits.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:25.960]   Health care is the big one too.
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:28.000]   So that's generous.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.080]   It's certainly time to find another job.
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:31.720]   He says, what about our pubs?
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:36.760]   Honestly, I think we'll take a lot more experimentation to find out what their role is on the platform.
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:39.680]   So this is not like he's shutting them down.
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:44.120]   He does say we need to experiment more efficiently in than we have been to date.
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:49.920]   I can see more focused high affinity publications working while as part of the medium bundle.
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:50.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:55.400]   The way I've always said, I have has changed the world twice, right?
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:40:00.560]   He started Blogger, which was the first major kind of retail blog I've owned by NoBees the
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.560]   first.
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.760]   And you ask guys here, Stacey.
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:08.520]   Could they be bringing?
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:09.520]   And I think it was really important.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:13.560]   It brought me into blogging and changed my view of media and my career in life.
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:18.280]   And then Twitter, of course, co-founder of Twitter, which changed the world again.
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:21.640]   And my joke is that I have his pain penance by trying to start medium where people write
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:23.320]   at length without the time crush.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:25.400]   But he's trying to make this work.
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:27.480]   He just hasn't hit the right formula yet.
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:30.600]   But he couldn't give it up a couple of years ago.
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:35.080]   He says this means identifying writers, you're right, this sounds like a sub stack play.
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:39.960]   This means identifying writers both already on medium or not and offering them deals,
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:43.880]   or editing and feedback to help them tell great stories and find their audiences.
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:49.560]   So instead of focusing on publication, focusing on the bylines, the individuals, that sounds
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:51.240]   sensible.
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:56.640]   That's acknowledging that we live in a sub stack world where people pay money for a particular
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:00.240]   person's work as opposed to a publication's work.
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:03.880]   Is that Stacey, you kind of have gone through this transition.
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:08.720]   Do you think that that's really the future of journalism or writing?
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:12.000]   Okay, this almost prompted me to drink last night.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.760]   I was so sad about everybody I know.
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:20.600]   So I don't know what the future is for journalists.
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:28.960]   I know that not everybody can do what I do because I have a niche that is enterprisey.
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:34.480]   And if I only did the smart home stuff, I couldn't do what I do.
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:42.840]   So I don't know what the future is.
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:48.240]   I wonder if maybe Jeff, you can comment too, but I wonder if being a journalist going forward
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.680]   means not getting the skills, the chops, and then working your way up through a different
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:58.680]   or different publications until you get the New York Times job or the Wall Street Journal
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:07.480]   job and an employee your whole life to more like, and this kind of seems like the world's
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:15.120]   working a little more like this, working on your brand and working your brand up.
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:20.200]   I think it's more entrepreneurial than trying to work for the dream job.
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:26.360]   But as Stacey points out, not everybody is entrepreneurial except maybe that's what
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.360]   they call your department is the odd.
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:30.360]   It's a little entrepreneurial journalism, right?
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:32.480]   Yeah, but then we've changed that view, right?
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:37.960]   And I think it's right, but I had to change my view of entrepreneurship.
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:41.000]   Your employee or your freelancer was the world we had.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.880]   And on the other end, it's entrepreneurial.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:44.560]   I'm going to start a new company.
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:45.960]   I'm going to start Fox.
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:49.280]   Well, that's really, even though that's not an easy local blog.
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:50.360]   It's the sovereign.
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:51.360]   It's the sovereign.
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.360]   This is right.
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:56.000]   So what we're doing now is we changed our entrepreneurial program completely.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.360]   Used to be a certificate and a degree.
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:03.320]   Now it's a 100 day only online, which pre-COVID we plan it that way, run by Jeremy Kaplan.
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:08.000]   And you learn how to do your own thing using the platforms that exist using medium and
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.120]   sub stack and YouTube and Patreon.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:15.800]   And you directly serve a market or community.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:16.800]   And that's the key, I think.
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:19.640]   To be a podcast, it could be book contracts too.
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:22.200]   It could be speaking gigs.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:23.200]   Lots of different things.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:29.680]   If you're Daniel Steele, let's say, or some massively successful novelist, should you just
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:32.480]   publish your own novels and hope that you can find an audience?
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:34.200]   No, no, I don't think you're there.
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:40.760]   In fact, in fact, at the end of the good parenthesis, which is the book I'm hoping somebody will
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:46.240]   actually respond to me about, I recant my view about books.
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:50.040]   I said in what would Google do, that books should be updateable, unlikable, and clickable,
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:53.400]   searchable, and I say, I was wrong.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:57.320]   I think books took a long time to get to be what a book is.
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:58.560]   And there's value in the piece of value.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:05.360]   But also more than that, Stacey, I think you'd agree, the skill of a writer is writing,
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.160]   not business.
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:11.280]   The skill of a journalist like you, Stacey, is digging, finding the story, doing the research
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:13.440]   and writing the story.
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:19.920]   Why should you also have these unrelated skills of, I can start a business.
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:23.040]   I can market myself and I can build a brand.
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:25.240]   Those are all unrelated skills.
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:28.040]   Do we have to have all the skills in one now?
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:34.360]   I wonder if the future economy, you need to have that like, like you have the ability
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:35.920]   to pay your bills personally, right?
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:38.400]   Like everybody has to, you may not be great at it, but you have to do it.
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:44.720]   So like some entrepreneurial, so even more important, I would say than coding is an understanding
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:51.840]   of the basics of how to build a business in terms of like, you know, how to create an
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:57.360]   LLC for yourself, how to invoice people, how to run the basic accounts.
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:06.560]   And because I think, I mean, even if you're like a fiver or a door dash delivery person,
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:08.320]   you have to like track your own expenses.
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:11.880]   You have to manage your own, you know, 10, whatever.
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:16.280]   And I think those are skills that they suck.
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:18.160]   They're no fun, but you got to do it.
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:19.360]   It's part of life.
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:20.360]   Right.
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:22.360]   Yeah, you have to pay your taxes.
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:26.680]   Nobody wants to be, wants to be, I mean, you can hire an accountant, but at some point
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:32.520]   in time, you know, so I feel like you may as a journalist, we're going to have to build
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:35.840]   that into the curriculum, not just as journalists.
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:38.400]   I think this is going to be is going forward.
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:42.360]   I used to argue for this in high school when I was a trustee at the high school.
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:47.720]   I used to argue that the new way of work was going to be gig working and, you know, and
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:52.440]   then that you really needed to develop it on, not to print out is not the right thing,
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.600]   but an independent mindset.
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.600]   Independent.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:01.160]   And what's interesting is how people like Ev are saying, well, we can or Jack Conti at
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:05.680]   Patreon, we can create the backbone that will facilitate this.
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:10.280]   So you don't have to do it all, but what you are responsible for is creating, creating
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:11.280]   your brand, your persona.
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:14.720]   I guess you always, I think, Daniel relationship with your, with your, with your public, your
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:16.200]   relationship with your audience.
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:18.240]   And Daniel Steele had to do that.
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:22.480]   You know, the publisher provided her with an editor and a print, a printing press and
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:29.000]   distribution and a bookstore, but she still had to do all the hard work of creating Daniel
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.600]   Steele.
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:34.680]   So last week we talked a little bit about Facebook, trying to serve these folks.
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:37.400]   And I heard some more sense about this.
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:42.680]   And interestingly, like my presumption was, okay, it'll all be in the Facebook wall garden.
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:43.680]   Uh-uh.
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:47.920]   They want to help people start their own websites independently on their own.
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:52.040]   And then use Facebook in ways that are beneficial as promotional material.
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:53.040]   Yeah.
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:54.040]   Yeah.
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:57.560]   And I think the other benefit of Facebook too, that I wish media companies would get their
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:00.640]   heads around is community, obviously, right?
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:01.640]   Yeah.
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.640]   That you could have a place where you can talk with people that can ask you questions.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:07.000]   And I've always said that that's what Twitter was about community.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000]   Community is king.
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:14.840]   It's about like, I believe you said this last week of having not saying having a hundred
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:21.200]   thousand subscribers, but having that 1000 really, really loyal super Kevin Kelly's 1000
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.200]   fans.
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:24.200]   Well, you do this.
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:26.600]   I mean, every photographer kind of in that photographers have been on the leading edge
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:32.200]   of this because you haven't been able to make a living working for a newspaper magazine
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.680]   in some years.
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:38.240]   So if you're a photographer, you've been on your own, at least in the last 10, 15 years,
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:39.400]   you've been on your own.
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:45.520]   And every photographer I know has a variety of skills, a variety of things they do to support
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:46.680]   themselves.
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:52.560]   Seems like every photographer I know is a former IT person on some right.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.320]   Trey Radcliffe, you're right.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.320]   You're right.
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:56.320]   Chris Marquardt, you're right.
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:58.440]   So I don't think I've ever asked you, Ant.
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:02.040]   What do you want to be when you go up?
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:07.480]   One of the things I used to want to be a scientist was I too late.
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:08.480]   Too late.
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:09.480]   Too late.
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:10.480]   Watching cartoons and watching cartoons.
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.480]   Too late.
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.080]   No, there's no beaker in your future.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.400]   No, no.
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:21.920]   Chemistry made me want to retire from the science world, but seriously, do you see yourself
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:27.720]   as a podcaster or as a writer, as a photographer?
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:30.360]   I think maybe even those labels don't apply anymore.
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:31.360]   Do I see myself?
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:35.920]   As my bio says, a digital content creator.
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:36.920]   Yeah, that's probably--
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:41.640]   I am never going to sit here and say that I am just solely a photographer because I
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:44.680]   can do more than just click the shutter.
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:49.880]   I can also do retouching and finishing of photos, even though I didn't take the photograph.
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:51.760]   I can also edit video.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:54.920]   I can write a little bit.
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:59.960]   So I'm a digital content creator because I didn't want to lock myself in and be out
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:00.960]   of work.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:02.880]   So, and Stacy, you had to do that.
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:07.760]   You had to figure out what you brought to the table, what your skills were and what
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:11.160]   people would support you doing, right?
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.160]   Sort of, yes.
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:14.160]   Yes.
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:17.840]   Or did you just say, "Here's what I want to do," and that's what I did, by the way.
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:18.840]   I didn't think about it.
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:20.000]   I just said, "Here's what I want to do.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000]   I hope it works."
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000]   Yeah.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:29.280]   I mean, there was a little bit more planning, but yes, I did kind of just say, "It was less
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:30.280]   that."
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:32.720]   Here's what I want to do, but also just here's what I can do.
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:33.720]   Right.
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:34.720]   Like, I know I can't.
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:35.720]   Yeah, that's very realistic.
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:36.960]   That's practical.
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:41.080]   You can't buy a chateau and become a 24-hour day YouTuber.
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:42.080]   Right.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:43.080]   I die.
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:44.080]   Right.
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:47.280]   Like, that is like my nightmare.
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.280]   You're describing.
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:50.280]   Right.
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:52.000]   I mean, to actually share your life.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.880]   Well, yeah.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:55.840]   And yeah.
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:02.280]   I think about my kids who are really struggling, but honestly, I think I ill-prepared them.
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:05.920]   And God, if anybody should have prepared them better, it would have been me for this
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:07.080]   world.
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:08.080]   You know?
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.240]   Same here.
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:15.920]   They didn't, they don't, I think kids coming out of college in the last five years are,
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:18.480]   you know, rubbing their eyes going, "What the hell?"
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:19.480]   Yeah.
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:22.280]   This is what they told me to expect.
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:26.280]   Well, the other problem is that old farts like us stick around.
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:28.160]   Yeah, we're getting in the way.
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:29.160]   That's all right.
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:31.160]   I hope you hear much longer.
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:32.160]   No.
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:35.160]   Relatively speaking.
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:37.280]   I think, so what?
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:41.640]   You would teach a kid, so you, so you, you and it states you both have children still
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:44.360]   young enough to be molded.
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:46.200]   Teach a kid how to do a website?
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:48.800]   Well, I would teach her how to.
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:49.800]   How to edit video?
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:50.800]   No.
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:51.800]   Yes, yes, and yes.
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:52.800]   I have.
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:54.560]   Yeah, my daughter knows how to create a website.
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:58.560]   She can create, she can edit video, she can edit audio.
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:50:59.560]   That's good.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:00.920]   She's well prepared for something.
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:05.680]   Then you also have to teach them how to market.
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:12.640]   My youngest hard head is a really good photographer and he got started, you know, five, six years
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:17.120]   ago as a middle school or an elementary school kid.
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:22.160]   I got him a very, very inexpensive point and shoot camera because he saw a dad with a camera
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:27.280]   and he wanted one and I went to the pawn shop, got him a little cheap camera and he loved
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:30.680]   it and he still shoots to this day in his free time.
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:34.800]   He does a lot of fashion stuff, if you will.
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:38.680]   So he's, he's, he's been able to get into that world and understand how to get in the
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:41.120]   lightroom and Photoshop and work on things.
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:47.440]   And now he's doing this, this brand called provider where he's doing some embroidery stuff.
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:48.440]   He bought himself a.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:49.440]   Oh, that's so cool.
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:50.640]   You must be really proud.
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:51.640]   That's awesome.
[01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:55.520]   And he sees, he's, he's knocking it out in addition to platform.
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:58.280]   What platform does he use?
[01:51:58.280 --> 01:51:59.280]   What's it?
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:01.280]   Snapchat and Instagram.
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:02.280]   Yeah.
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:03.640]   Snapchat and Instagram.
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:07.840]   My daughter's really in the Instagram, my son more into TikTok.
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:11.440]   But actually now that I think about even though I did not prepare them, well, they have managed
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:15.560]   to figure out that they're going to have to do their own businesses and they really have
[01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:16.560]   to.
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:22.760]   So I think your hard head, you know, he's, he's signed to sign a letter of intent to go
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:27.360]   to college because he's wanting to get into kinesiology.
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:32.320]   So he's thinking, he's playing and, and, and, and our thinking on that is, hey, you really
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:38.120]   need to dig deep on this stuff right now and get as much information as you can because
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:42.440]   I want you to be prepared before you go to college and while you're in college and when
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:45.920]   it's time to get out of there, you're going to be even more prepared because you got more
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:50.640]   skills and understand entrepreneurship just in case you were able to go out and just start
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:54.440]   your own practice and get picked up somewhere else.
[01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:56.960]   And he's been, they've been pretty diligent about that.
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:52:59.880]   So yeah, right now I'm going to pat myself on the back.
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:00.880]   Good job, man.
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:06.600]   Because I've been in their heads for a very long time and we just had a conversation a
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:12.880]   couple weeks ago, um, back before COVID really, really kicked off here in this area.
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:19.600]   I remember telling them one morning, Hey, I need y'all to get on a, get in habit of
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:20.600]   working from home.
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:23.760]   I said, I've been working from home for most of your life.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:24.760]   You're not used to that.
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:27.560]   Most people in our family is not used to the work from home life.
[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:29.040]   I want you to get into a habit.
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:34.680]   So I got them up every day for their class and make sure they were certain spot, you
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:37.800]   know, it was routine and now they're used to it.
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:40.880]   And when we talked about this a couple of weeks ago, I said, you know, that was a year
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:41.880]   ago.
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:43.440]   And now think of it.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:48.120]   This year hasn't been wasted for that generation because it did teach them that at least, right?
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:53.480]   Come to think of it and how to be a self starter, how to get up in the morning and go to sit
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:54.760]   down with the computer.
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:57.440]   I do not check on them for school.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:00.480]   I don't even think they should not because I know they're up.
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:04.160]   They have to learn how to do that by themselves because you won't always be there to do it
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:05.160]   for them.
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:06.160]   That's right.
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:15.460]   You know, we're also speaking from a privileged position because a lot of kids should get
[01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:19.920]   a trade should go to trade school should be a carpenter or a plumber or learn how to,
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:24.080]   you know, ho a ho a field or something because we need that too.
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:25.080]   God knows about that.
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:29.480]   We need a lot more farmers than we need web developers come to think of it.
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:33.160]   I have a washer and dryer that's as old as they are.
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:34.160]   Yeah.
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:35.520]   I refuse to buy a new one.
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:36.520]   Keep it work.
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:37.520]   Those things can be fixed.
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:38.520]   Good for you.
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:42.400]   So when something goes wrong, they're in there with me figuring out how to fix those
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:43.400]   things.
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:45.800]   So yeah, I teach them that too.
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:46.800]   Yeah.
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:54.400]   It's been a while since, I mean, for the longest time in history, I guess you just did what
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:56.480]   your parents did.
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:57.480]   Right.
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:58.480]   Right.
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:54:59.480]   Right.
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:02.480]   And then in the last or whatever neighbor had an apprenticeship.
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:03.480]   Yeah.
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.560]   Frankly, you know, you got a job.
[01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:10.200]   You got an apprenticeship with a printer and you learned how to do that.
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:14.080]   Then in the last hundred years, that started to become more fluid, but there was still
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:15.880]   always the notion of you'd get out of college.
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:21.360]   I remember when I got out of college, there were recruiters from DuPont and Dow and other
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:23.040]   companies living through chemistry.
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:24.040]   Yeah.
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:25.040]   BASF.
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:27.040]   There was your major.
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:28.040]   Jim with a table.
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:29.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:30.040]   My major was really useful.
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:31.040]   Chinese studies.
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:32.040]   Well, that's right.
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:33.040]   That's right.
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:36.240]   There would be Jim and there'd be tables and you'd go around and the recruiters would be
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:39.840]   there and you'd try to get a job with a company and spend the rest of your life there during
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:41.160]   the Gold Watch.
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:42.560]   So it's, what did this change?
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:44.080]   It's changed with the internet.
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:45.080]   It's pretty recent.
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:46.080]   I think so.
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:47.560]   Yeah, I changed before the internet.
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:52.480]   You started seeing layoffs prior to that with the deaths of pensions and corporate buyouts
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:53.480]   and that sort of thing.
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:56.640]   I mean, think about the 80s and the financial markets there.
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:03.000]   I will also say, I don't know that everyone in like my daughter's generation so far,
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.480]   is oriented around money in the way that...
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:08.480]   No, that's true.
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:09.480]   Yeah.
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:10.480]   That we were in different.
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:13.720]   It's definitely different for us.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:14.920]   What does she think about it?
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:16.760]   Does she think I need to make a living?
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:17.840]   Well, yeah.
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:22.800]   She knows she needs it, but she also, you know, her highest goal is to live in a forest
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:27.120]   in a cottage and like, yeah, okay.
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:28.120]   That's her highest goal.
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:29.120]   That's not bad.
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:31.120]   That's your special place?
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:32.120]   It's not bad.
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:39.960]   She's like, she needs a broadband connection, but she doesn't really like clothes.
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:43.520]   She doesn't really like a lot of things.
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:46.120]   So she might actually be just fine doing that.
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:47.680]   I don't know.
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:48.680]   The other thing is...
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:49.680]   So I just bought a...
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:50.680]   Go ahead.
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:51.680]   Sorry, she's here.
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:52.920]   Oh, I was just going to say is, you know, we...
[01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:54.960]   She hasn't wanted for things in her life.
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:57:00.520]   So if you have wanted for things in her life, money is obviously going to be much more of
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:01.520]   a priority.
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:02.520]   Yes.
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:03.520]   That's absolutely true.
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:06.520]   The people I know who are best at money are people who had no money as kids and made
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:11.720]   the decision, I am not going to go through that.
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:14.960]   So I just bought a book called The Sovereign Individual.
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:15.960]   Oh, perfect.
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:16.960]   1997.
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:26.480]   It's coming tomorrow, but I saw a Twitter stream about it saying that darn, these guys
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:33.080]   predicted all of this, including gig work, including the challenges to the nation and
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:35.200]   the nation's state.
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:40.040]   And I take that kind of prediction with a grain of salt, but it's interesting because
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:44.600]   it came from 20 years ago about it.
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:51.160]   And it'll be interesting to see how people interpreted the beginning of the net age and
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:55.560]   what's coming up from it.
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:58:04.920]   Or you can just sell your first tweet as an NFT and then you'll never have to work again.
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:05.920]   Jack Dorsey's...
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:07.720]   Does he work now?
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:11.920]   You can grow your beard and live in a house in the forest.
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:15.440]   Jack Dorsey's first tweet sold.
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:16.440]   It was 20...
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:19.160]   It was 2.5 million the last time we checked.
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:21.440]   Apparently, the bidding went a little higher.
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:25.000]   The same guy who was on top for weeks, Cina Stavi got it.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:33.680]   For $291583547, which I'm guessing was his childhood phone number or...
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:36.640]   I don't know what it was.
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:41.120]   But it's an oddly specific number.
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:44.200]   He held the high bid for quite some time.
[01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:45.960]   I guess there was a little flurry.
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:46.960]   And the money's going to what?
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:48.160]   Jack's donating the money.
[01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:52.800]   Jack's donating it to a charity.
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:53.800]   I forget.
[01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:55.800]   It's online something.
[01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:56.800]   It's online something.
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:00.080]   Donate it to give directly for its Africa response.
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:01.080]   So, give direct...
[01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:03.440]   Jack was going to move to Africa, remember?
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:05.440]   And then the pandemic.
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:06.440]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:08.720]   So, it goes directly to people living in poverty.
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:13.520]   It's kind of one of those kind of charities that says, "No, the best thing you do is just
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:16.160]   give people money and let them get on their feet."
[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:17.160]   Well, don't figure it out.
[01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:19.160]   Let them figure it out.
[01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:20.400]   So, Leo, can we do the Twitter survey?
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:21.800]   I'm curious to hear your answer.
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:23.800]   As long as we're talking about Twitter...
[01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:26.120]   Do you want me to do an ad first or read the read?
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:27.680]   I think I'm caught up on ads.
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:28.680]   I think I've got one more.
[01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:33.600]   I would tell you the line number, but I'm glad you could find it.
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:36.480]   So actually, the link you put in doesn't have the survey.
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:38.360]   I had to read this.
[01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:39.360]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:43.360]   It's the calling for public input on our approach to world leaders.
[01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:47.720]   Of course, the world leader they're talking about is Donald Trump.
[01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:49.920]   But you put my English in that one works.
[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:53.760]   So, by the way, I have to point out, the world has been a much calmer, kind of...
[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:55.640]   Quite a place since he stopped tweeting.
[01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:56.640]   Indeed.
[01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:00.800]   In fact, now, the Donald is according to his spokesman starting his own social platform.
[02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:01.800]   Can't say that.
[02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:02.800]   No, you don't think so?
[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:03.800]   I can't say that.
[02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:12.760]   I think that daily 40 tweet stream has really put us all on our tippy toes every day.
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:13.760]   I don't know.
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:20.560]   But then again, I'm also the person that never really saw activity from that guy, unless
[02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:21.920]   people brought it to my attention.
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:22.920]   Yeah.
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:23.920]   And so, after a while, but...
[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:24.920]   And stuff.
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:26.840]   But how could you not get it brought to your attention?
[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:30.280]   That's all the news talked about is the latest tweets from the president.
[02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:33.880]   It just got very quiet and it's been very pleasant.
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:35.160]   So here we go.
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:36.560]   We are going to do the survey.
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:40.480]   Twitter wants your input on how we should shape our policies and enforce our rules about
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:43.760]   world leaders participation in the public conversation.
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:48.840]   And I think some of this is maybe they're stinging a little bit because after they did
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:53.240]   a ban, President Trump, the world got to be quieter and better.
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:59.120]   And maybe some people I certainly thought Twitter was a little bit to blame for what
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:00.120]   happened over the last few years.
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:01.320]   Should they have done it earlier?
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:02.320]   Yeah.
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:03.320]   Should they have done it earlier?
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:04.720]   Or are they wrong and bring them back?
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:05.720]   So I take it.
[02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:08.840]   No one here is under 16.
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:15.520]   Now here's a random sample of hypothetical situations.
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:17.160]   Consider the following hypothetical situation.
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:23.720]   You see a treat from a regular Twitter listener, a user, I mean, who's located in your country.
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:24.720]   Big podcasted log?
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:27.000]   I have been doing this a little too long.
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:32.880]   The tweet contains misleading information about COVID-19 in a different country.
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:34.520]   It's from their personal account.
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:37.520]   This is their third violation of the Twitter rules.
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:40.040]   What action should Twitter take?
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.040]   Should it take no action?
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:43.760]   Should it not delete the tweet but apply a label?
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:47.160]   Should they not delete the tweet but block others from liking, retweeting, or commenting
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:48.160]   on the tweet?
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:50.840]   Gosh, I want to do both of those.
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:54.360]   Should require the account to delete the tweet before they tweet again or permanently suspend
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.280]   the account immediately.
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:57.280]   Stacy?
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:59.440]   Your survey looks different from mine.
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:00.440]   Yeah, each one is-
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:01.440]   Yeah, it's right.
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:02.440]   It's right.
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:03.440]   It's right.
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:04.440]   It's right.
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:05.440]   It's right.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:06.440]   It's right.
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:07.440]   It's right.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:08.440]   It's right.
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:09.440]   Okay.
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:10.440]   Great.
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:11.440]   So you'll get a different situation.
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:12.440]   What would you do?
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:13.440]   Okay.
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:14.440]   I was front.
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:15.440]   I was front.
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:16.440]   I was front.
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:17.440]   Ant, what would you do?
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:18.440]   You're talking?
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:19.440]   No.
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:25.800]   Phoenix Morpin on chat room says, "It's simple.
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:29.960]   If they violate the TOS, ban them."
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:31.760]   What do you say?
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:38.040]   I think they should both apply a label describing the rule of violation and block others from
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:39.840]   liking, retweeting, or commenting.
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:46.560]   Because you want to damp down the spread of it and you want to give people the information,
[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:52.240]   I'm not sure I would delete the tweet because it's misleading information about COVID-19.
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:59.640]   It's not- I think this is based on the content of it, not on the rules violation or whatever.
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:03.600]   Ant, what do you say?
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:09.800]   I'm pretty much right there with Mr. LaPorte because don't necessarily want it deleted.
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:18.960]   I think there is value in knowing what's said and how- if someone says something just
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:24.760]   absolutely heinous, it's nice to know that you know who that person was that said it.
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:26.080]   I think there's value in that.
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:28.800]   So I wouldn't say it deleted, but definitely label it.
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:32.440]   By the way, if you delete the account or delete, then he's just going to create another
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:34.440]   account or whatever.
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:35.440]   Yeah, there's that too.
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:36.440]   Or really part of it.
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.080]   I'm talking for the you guys.
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:40.920]   I would require him to delete the tweet before he can tweet again.
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:44.080]   But you would not suspend him.
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:45.440]   Not on this case, probably.
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:46.440]   Okay.
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:47.440]   Let's try another way.
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:50.040]   I presume it was a him, by the way, because misinformation comes from men.
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:51.040]   But keep going.
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:52.040]   Miss you.
[02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:53.040]   Take in, both of them.
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:54.040]   If you'll pay attention now.
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:55.040]   I am now paying attention.
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:56.840]   I'm teasing you.
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:57.840]   I don't blame you.
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:03:59.360]   I lost interest years ago.
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:01.800]   I completely understand.
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:05.800]   I was trying to find the survey and I was-
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:06.800]   It's lying.
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:07.800]   What line is it, Jeff?
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:09.440]   I gave her the line, apparently.
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:10.600]   It's a line, 69.
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:13.960]   I need the line for life.
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:15.760]   Line 69.
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:20.920]   You are a regional state governor in our country.
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:21.920]   You are tweeting misleading.
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:23.960]   This is the same one.
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:26.880]   Misleading information about COVID-19 in another country.
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:29.960]   But this is from an official government account.
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:31.960]   And it's your first violation.
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:32.960]   First violation.
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:36.440]   So you see you go first.
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:37.440]   Yeah.
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:40.240]   You should- Ooh, not delete.
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:41.240]   Okay.
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:42.240]   Same choices.
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:43.240]   Definitely.
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:44.240]   Okay.
[02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:45.240]   Not delete.
[02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:46.240]   Oh, you went away from the choices.
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:47.240]   I was reading them.
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:48.240]   Show the choices again, John.
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:50.320]   The middle choices, I think.
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:51.320]   Not delete.
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:55.360]   I think you should not delete, but you should label and then block everybody from working,
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:56.360]   retweeting.
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:57.760]   So far you agree with me on both of those.
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:59.760]   I think that's the right to do.
[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:00.760]   Yeah.
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:04.520]   Because it's a governmental account, I'm going to say you should delete the tweet.
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:06.200]   You should require me to delete the tweet.
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:10.400]   Because it has a more significant- Oh, that's interesting.
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:12.800]   So that's very important because of the reach.
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:13.800]   That's important.
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:16.680]   You're saying that government should be held to a higher standard than users.
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:17.680]   Absolutely.
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:18.680]   Okay.
[02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:20.720]   But they're not talking about their own stuff.
[02:05:20.720 --> 02:05:25.520]   Like if this government were like, if it was like the state of Utah talking about things
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:29.080]   happening in Utah, I'd be like, yeah, you should delete that tweet.
[02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:31.200]   Well, that's the state of Utah.
[02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:32.200]   Yeah.
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:36.000]   Talking about Spain, I'd be like- Why is he tweeting about Spain except to send a
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.000]   message to Utahans, Utonians, right?
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.600]   He's the governor.
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:46.360]   Anything he tweets on his official account is a message from the government.
[02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:51.200]   And if he's tweeting about COVID somewhere else, there's a point to that to say it's
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:53.440]   a communication to his constituents.
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:54.440]   Okay.
[02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:58.920]   Well, let's say Joe Biden is tweeting something about maybe it's not COVID-19 related, but
[02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:04.400]   maybe he's trying to tell us something about China that isn't actually true, but you know,
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:06.040]   sometimes do lie to this.
[02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:07.040]   That's interesting.
[02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:08.040]   Okay.
[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:10.640]   But it's a formal policy decision.
[02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:13.320]   Maybe Utah wants to go to war with Spain.
[02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:14.320]   Yeah.
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:15.320]   Okay.
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:16.320]   No, no.
[02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:17.840]   Then in that case, I don't think you do anything.
[02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:20.760]   No, no, you I still think you should label them.
[02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:21.760]   Label, say.
[02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:22.760]   Yeah.
[02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:27.360]   Well, Mr. LaFora, you mentioned what then being government having more.
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:29.800]   It's a higher responsibility.
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:30.800]   Did my camera die?
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:31.960]   No, I'm seeing you.
[02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:32.960]   I don't know what happened.
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:33.960]   Sorry.
[02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:34.960]   Our button failed.
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:35.960]   There it is.
[02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:41.440]   You were speaking about being in government and having a bigger, you know, a large reach
[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:43.400]   and more important, I guess.
[02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:50.240]   But what about these celebrities that have way more following and just this bigger reach?
[02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:51.240]   Is it?
[02:06:51.240 --> 02:06:52.240]   That's that nine year old kid.
[02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:54.240]   Or Christy Tegan?
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:56.320]   Yeah, Christy Tegan, you know.
[02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:57.680]   Yeah, but it's Chrissy Tegan.
[02:06:57.680 --> 02:07:02.280]   I mean, I don't think people take what they what those celebrities say is gospel.
[02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:03.920]   That's not their fault every day.
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:04.920]   That's people's fault.
[02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:05.920]   They're stupid.
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:07.920]   They shouldn't pay attention to you just because they're famous.
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:09.360]   Tell us how you really feel.
[02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:10.360]   Stupid people.
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:11.360]   I don't care.
[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:12.360]   I don't want to protect them.
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:14.320]   Yeah, Matthew McConaughey is going to be the governor of Texas.
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:15.800]   Yeah, there's that.
[02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:16.800]   All right.
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:17.800]   All right.
[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:18.800]   All right.
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:19.800]   Something else I'm not going out.
[02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:20.800]   Yeah, he is.
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:22.800]   He just said he hasn't ruled out.
[02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:23.800]   Yeah.
[02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:26.440]   Well, Stacy, you're from the great state of Texas.
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:28.680]   You think he has a chance?
[02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:33.720]   I mean, I honestly think he couldn't be worse than Abbott because Abbott doesn't.
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:38.280]   I mean, I think we need to make a rule in this country.
[02:07:38.280 --> 02:07:40.120]   Stop electing celebrities and billionaires.
[02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:41.120]   Yes.
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:42.120]   Hold up.
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:43.120]   It's a bad idea.
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:49.240]   I'm assuming that because Matthew McConaughey is kind of a vapid celebrity, he may not
[02:07:49.240 --> 02:07:50.240]   actually be that.
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:52.160]   He is in a van by the river.
[02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:54.800]   No qualifications.
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:08:00.200]   I'm just I'm just saying being a celebrity does not mean you can't be smart enough.
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:03.560]   But it's not a qualification on it's not on the face of it.
[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:04.560]   Yeah.
[02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:06.840]   But do I back back to the survey?
[02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:12.200]   I'm curious to see when you all get this question because the first two that popped
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:17.440]   up on my survey, they both says the tweet contains an ethnic slur about a group or people
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:18.680]   of the country.
[02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:20.240]   We didn't get that.
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:22.680]   My very first two, they have that in.
[02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:23.680]   They knew you were black.
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:27.240]   They just they're gone after you.
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:28.600]   What's your flock cohort?
[02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:29.600]   That's the question you.
[02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:31.800]   Oh, I think I'm B48.
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:38.400]   Oh, we're going to get it for that one.
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:42.800]   If it were a hate tweet, take it down and no, suspend the account.
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:44.360]   Hate tweets, period.
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:45.360]   Yeah.
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:46.360]   Yeah.
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:47.360]   Yeah.
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:48.360]   It's zero.
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:50.360]   Well, but it depends on who you're hating on is part of the argument.
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:51.360]   Right.
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:52.360]   This is part of what's your hate on Nazis.
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:54.120]   I guess it's okay to hate on Nazis.
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:55.120]   Right.
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:09:01.440]   But part of Facebook's new rules dealing with bad governments is that it's okay to pray
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:05.280]   raise, you know, a violent organization.
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:08.040]   If it's a revolutionary organization against a bad government.
[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.600]   Well, that's true.
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:15.960]   Like the freedom fighters in 1776.
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:16.960]   Right.
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:17.960]   Mm.
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:18.960]   Mm.
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:20.960]   Ben Franklin on Twitter, that would have worked well.
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:22.720]   Poor Richard were were perfectly perfect.
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:23.720]   Perfect.
[02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:24.720]   Perfect.
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:25.720]   All right.
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:26.720]   One more because I don't want this is endless.
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:30.720]   A tweet is from a representative in the national legislature of another country, not
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:34.280]   just hateful speech about a group of people in your country.
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:36.640]   I hate those Texans.
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:38.440]   They talk funny.
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:42.200]   The tweet comes not from their official account, but from a personal account.
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:44.920]   But it is the fifth violation of the Twitter rules.
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:49.640]   You don't talk bad about people in Texas permanently suspended the account immediately.
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:54.480]   It is a hateful speech about a group of people in my country.
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:55.480]   In our country.
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:56.480]   Yes.
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:57.480]   How dare you.
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:09:58.480]   Oh, okay.
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:05.280]   I would want to know that my legislator was a racist.
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:06.280]   I would say.
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:08.480]   Oh, this is our don't say in.
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:09.480]   Don't delete.
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:15.080]   There's value in the shortcomings of some of these people that are leaders.
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:16.640]   Yeah, I would block.
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:22.960]   I would not delete it, but I won't let people like it or retweet it or comment it.
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:26.800]   I mean, unless they're calling for violent action, I'm sorry.
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:32.040]   I don't think and I don't want them to be able to pull the like if they tweeted aunt
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:33.840]   and they say something bad about black people.
[02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:37.000]   I don't want ants mentions to go all crazy, right?
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.400]   So I don't want that to affect.
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:44.880]   But I think the constituents have a right to know that their representative is a D.
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:45.880]   Ha.
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:48.800]   So, yeah, that's interesting.
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:49.800]   That's it.
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:51.880]   That's kind of why I didn't delete the first one either.
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:56.880]   Because like that's public that's.
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:10:57.880]   It's their fifth violation.
[02:10:57.880 --> 02:10:58.880]   Fifth violation.
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:00.480]   I don't like these options.
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:03.120]   I wish we could combine the second.
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:04.280]   That's an option.
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:05.640]   But really, that's not the point of this.
[02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:07.360]   And it's very obvious what the point is.
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:08.360]   See, it's hard.
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:09.360]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:10.680]   And that's what's that's what's great about this.
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:11.840]   It shows you the new one.
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:13.000]   See, it's hard.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.560]   You keep saying we should do stuff, but it's not easy.
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:16.560]   What do you do?
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:17.800]   That's the point of it.
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:21.600]   I think I don't think I actually set that on this show a couple days.
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:22.600]   That's hard.
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:23.760]   It's very hard.
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:26.240]   Just for curiosity Leo, hit the next one just to see what the question is.
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:27.240]   I already closed it.
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:28.240]   Oh, geez.
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:32.880]   Here, I'll tell you, I'm what a mine is this tweet is from a candidate for the National
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:35.760]   Head of Defense that others in another country.
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:36.760]   Okay.
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:40.160]   The tweet contains hateful speech about a group of people in another country.
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:41.160]   Okay.
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:45.840]   It's their personal account and it's their again fifth violation of the Twitter rules.
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:47.360]   This probably happens a lot.
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:50.000]   Well, yeah, the National Head of Defense.
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.440]   I mean, those are the people who want to go with war.
[02:11:52.440 --> 02:12:02.400]   The Saudi Defense Minister is saying the Israelis have got to stop mistreating Palestinians
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:05.920]   or have to end their occupation of the West Bank.
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:08.320]   So you might not have to take anything.
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:11.160]   Yeah, I think that's on them.
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:12.160]   All right.
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:13.160]   I've got the perfect one.
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:14.160]   All right.
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:18.200]   A representative in the National Legislature in your country has false claims that election
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:23.440]   was stolen in your country from an official government account.
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:24.600]   It's the fifth violation.
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:25.960]   Who would that be?
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:29.120]   It's only their fifth.
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:32.040]   Do you love five hundredth?
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:33.040]   Do you love Sydney?
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:34.280]   Was it Sydney Blumenthal?
[02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:42.800]   Do you love her defense of she's being a Sidney Powell rather?
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:43.800]   Yes, sorry.
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:44.800]   Thank you.
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:45.800]   Yeah, I don't know who Blumens was.
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:51.280]   The defense of her contention, the election was stolen and there was massive fraud.
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:54.200]   She's being sued, of course, by Dominion.
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:13:01.280]   Her defense is, well, nobody would believe what I said except for 80% of Republican voters.
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:05.400]   Nobody would believe that.
[02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:06.400]   Silly country.
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:07.400]   Silly.
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:13.440]   No reasonable person would accept my statement as fact.
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:16.880]   It's a merely expression of an opinion.
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:18.880]   Wow.
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:19.880]   Yeah.
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:20.880]   Okay.
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:28.160]   So, and he Blumenthal was like an editorial writer, I think, from way back when?
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:29.880]   I feel like that's a real person.
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:31.520]   And if it is, I apologize for it.
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:32.520]   The Senator's cousin.
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:35.920]   Yeah, I don't know.
[02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:40.520]   American journalist and political operative, former aide to Bill Clinton, longtime confidant
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:42.960]   of Hillary Clinton.
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:46.840]   So, yeah, there is a signal with all, but that's not who said it.
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:48.840]   All right.
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:56.440]   Do we have any line numbers to reiterate or it can sell to her anything?
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:13:58.120]   So now he's back to line.
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:13:59.720]   I have a change log.
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:00.720]   Oh, thank you.
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:01.720]   You're right.
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:02.720]   I left out the change log.
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:05.720]   It's time for, we'll do this quick, folks, because there's nothing in it.
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:07.960]   The Google change log.
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:10.160]   The Google change log.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:13.600]   How fast can you do?
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:15.760]   Has Gmail been crashing on your phone?
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:17.760]   Google's fixing it.
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:18.760]   Done.
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:20.160]   Line two.
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:25.760]   Chromebooks are getting Android 11 in beta with dark mode support and better app scaling.
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:27.160]   Line three.
[02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:29.000]   Stadia open sources.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.720]   Some of its dev tools.
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:33.080]   Line four.
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:39.080]   Google updates chat UI for workspace users to match personal accounts.
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:40.080]   Whatever that means.
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:42.880]   That might be useful for you.
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:45.400]   Is that help you, Jeff?
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:49.440]   Your chat UI in your workspace because you're using G Suite or workspace.
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:51.720]   I don't use their chats, so it doesn't matter.
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:54.880]   But it would match now your personal account.
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:55.880]   Well, good.
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:14:59.160]   So that's a beginning of a unification.
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:00.720]   Sure.
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:03.240]   And that's the Google change log.
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:04.640]   Record time.
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:10.040]   Hey, Taco Bell did buy a social media ordering company.
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:13.960]   And it's also bought an AI insets company, insights company.
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:14.960]   What is going on?
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:21.080]   By the way, the name of the social media ordering platform is TikTok.
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:24.120]   Okay.
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:27.400]   As the owner of Lip Lock, I am upset.
[02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:33.240]   TikTok T I C T U K allows customers to order food while on social media.
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:40.000]   How lazy do you have to be to order your Taco Bell in a Twitter?
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000]   Sweet.
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:46.600]   That is so freaking lazy.
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:50.720]   Although if you're Taco Bell, you know, you like that because other people might see your
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:55.000]   order and say, that's a good idea.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.280]   Earlier they bought quantum.
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:03.320]   Quantum use that's literally how it spelled K V A N T U M uses artificial intelligence
[02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:08.320]   for consumer insights and marketing performance analytics.
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:14.160]   By the way, TikTok's parent company is called Yum.
[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:17.400]   You can talk of Bell's parent company or the new TikTok's right.
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:18.400]   TikTok.
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:19.400]   Yum brands.
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:20.400]   Tik though, it's confusing.
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:22.560]   T B's owner is Yum brands.
[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:24.560]   Yums and Louisville, I believe.
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:25.560]   Are they?
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:28.240]   They also own don't they own KFC?
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:29.240]   Yep.
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:30.240]   KFC.
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:31.240]   Yeah.
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:32.240]   Yeah.
[02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:33.240]   Yeah.
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:34.920]   And pizza hut and habit burger grill, which is quite good.
[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:35.920]   Yes it is.
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:36.920]   Actually.
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:37.920]   Yeah, I like the habit.
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:40.720]   I haven't been there in a year.
[02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:42.920]   I'm debating whether I can go.
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:43.920]   I know.
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:44.920]   I know.
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:49.560]   I know Stacey's the one near my home is right now.
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:50.560]   I can feel it.
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:52.160]   I'm not just approving a few.
[02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:53.160]   No.
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:56.800]   Prince Harry's got a job now that Megan's pregnant.
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:16:57.800]   More than one.
[02:16:57.800 --> 02:16:59.320]   I should get a job.
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:02.560]   His new job title, chief impact officer.
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:09.360]   A better up, which is an employee coaching and mental health startup.
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:10.920]   Chief impact officer.
[02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:16.520]   See, Harry's an example of a kid who wasn't brought up thinking, you gotta do a gig work
[02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:18.720]   thing, you gotta build your brand.
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:21.040]   Look, he's trying to learn how to do it.
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:24.520]   He thought he'd be working for the family business.
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:25.520]   The company?
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:26.520]   Didn't work out.
[02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:27.520]   Firm.
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:28.520]   The firm didn't work out.
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:30.000]   They call it the firm, don't they?
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:31.000]   Yeah.
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.680]   The royal family in England.
[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:35.640]   The firm, he calls it the firm, I guess.
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:36.640]   That's what he said.
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:44.760]   I saw a great video, TikTok, guide doing the diversity training in the castle.
[02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:46.840]   Oh, geez.
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:48.240]   This is a joke, obviously.
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:49.240]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:50.240]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:52.240]   Oh, how's it going to hire?
[02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:53.240]   Diversity czar.
[02:17:53.240 --> 02:17:54.240]   Yeah, I'll look for that one.
[02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:55.240]   I'll look for that.
[02:17:55.240 --> 02:17:56.240]   Yeah.
[02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:57.240]   All right.
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:00.000]   Let's take a break.
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:05.080]   And when we come back, we're going to do the picks of the week.
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:08.760]   And then we will get an update if that boat is still blocking.
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:10.000]   Oh, God.
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.120]   The Suez Canal.
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:21.800]   I think we can go to a live nav map and find out the ever given, the ever stuck.
[02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:27.360]   They expect transit to resume sometime Wednesday or Thursday.
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:29.960]   Yeah, it's still stuck.
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:32.640]   It's still stuck.
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:33.640]   Wow.
[02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:35.200]   It's OK.
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:37.400]   It has a digital twin.
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:45.880]   Oh, oh, we're talking about forward networks.
[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:47.960]   Good job, man.
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:49.360]   Good job.
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:52.360]   You are now you used to run networks.
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:53.360]   What?
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:57.240]   You know, you've been an assistant man networks, especially nowadays.
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:18:59.480]   They are kind of black boxes.
[02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:03.440]   You know, you know what you've got on prem and then it goes up to the cloud and maybe
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:07.440]   you've got multi homes and then it goes on the cloud to the edge.
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:12.560]   Then it's on the endpoints and then your users and it's very it's a great mystery.
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:18.360]   Wouldn't it be nice if you if you had a mathematical model and software of your entire network
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:21.160]   that was kept up to date that was completely accurate?
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:23.760]   That's what forward networks does.
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:29.720]   Created by four Stanford PhD students seven years ago, they said, you know, we feel bad
[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:32.720]   for these guys who are trying to figure out what's going on in their network, the great
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:34.800]   mysteries of their network.
[02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:40.760]   So they sought to apply principles of modern software development to network.
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:47.120]   They created a digital twin and accurate completely 100% up to date in real time mathematical
[02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:50.880]   model, a single source of truth for how your network works.
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:52.480]   Now, what can you do with it?
[02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:54.680]   Well, you could look at it.
[02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:59.120]   Actually, they have tools to do this and verify that the networks configured correctly is
[02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:04.600]   can in compliant with your policies is behaving as you intend.
[02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:07.320]   If they have this thing called behavior diffs, I love this so much.
[02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:11.520]   You've you know what a diff is when you have two text files, you compare them with a diff.
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:18.440]   They have behavior diffs that will allow the same thing side by side comparisons to see
[02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:22.040]   what's going to happen when you change a config file, for instance, between any points
[02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:23.440]   in time.
[02:20:23.440 --> 02:20:24.760]   This is our existing network.
[02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:27.000]   This is the this is the change network.
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:32.360]   What are the diffs and how is this going to impact network performance?
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:37.720]   Imagine knowing ahead of time before you change those BGP routing tables and bring all of
[02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:40.720]   the network traffic to a small town in Maine.
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:42.440]   Imagine knowing that ahead of time.
[02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:48.200]   You can accurately predict the impact of a proposed change across every possible traffic
[02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:49.600]   path.
[02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:51.960]   That means you roll out changes with confidence.
[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:54.160]   You keep your network healthy and agile.
[02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:56.400]   You can search network behavior.
[02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:59.720]   You can search configuration and state network wide.
[02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:05.600]   It's got a very nice intuitive powerful search tool perform end to end path analyses across
[02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:10.600]   your network, both including by the way, on-prem and cloud infrastructure.
[02:21:10.600 --> 02:21:16.880]   You could proactively identify potential connectivity and security policy violations.
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:18.440]   This is amazing.
[02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:23.280]   50% faster resolution of network trouble tickets on average.
[02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:26.600]   90% faster fixes related to audit processes.
[02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:32.160]   33% reduction in aborted network updates due to identified errors.
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:39.560]   A 100% reduction in embarrassment when you apply a configuration change that brings your
[02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:41.480]   company offline.
[02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:42.720]   You don't want that to happen.
[02:21:42.720 --> 02:21:44.120]   Forward networks will prevent it.
[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:47.680]   Let me tell you some of the people who have been using forward networks.
[02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:50.960]   I love the story about Goldman Sachs.
[02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:53.480]   They have a massive network, as you might imagine.
[02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:55.200]   They brought in forward networks.
[02:21:55.200 --> 02:21:56.520]   They were so impressed by the tool.
[02:21:56.520 --> 02:21:59.840]   They led their series C funding round.
[02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:01.720]   Mark Andreessen loves forward networks.
[02:22:01.720 --> 02:22:08.040]   That's why Andreessen Horowitz also was in that round and threshold committing $65 million.
[02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:09.880]   PayPal was having an issue with their network.
[02:22:09.880 --> 02:22:14.760]   They thought, "Maybe we can build a tool that will somehow diagnose these problems."
[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:18.040]   Fortunately, before they did, they found forward networks.
[02:22:18.040 --> 02:22:19.480]   It did everything they needed.
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:22.360]   Found the trouble spots, saved them time and money.
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:25.120]   So many big networks used forward networks.
[02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:26.680]   Telstra in Australia.
[02:22:26.680 --> 02:22:29.640]   Verizon in the US Bank of America.
[02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:34.440]   Several large unnamed governmental agencies.
[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:37.600]   Look at this is the best way to know what's going on in your network.
[02:22:37.600 --> 02:22:42.360]   Network automation and verification for your intent-based network with forward networks.
[02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:44.720]   Your business depends on it.
[02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:46.520]   There's a great demo waiting for you.
[02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:49.200]   Forward networks.com/twit.
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:51.240]   Forward networks.com/twit.
[02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:55.760]   If you're interested, they've got a podcast called Seeking Truth in Networking.
[02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:57.280]   I love that name.
[02:22:57.280 --> 02:23:00.200]   You'll find it wherever you can get your podcast downloaded and listen.
[02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:01.480]   I think you'll enjoy it.
[02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:06.080]   But honestly, I want you to get the demo because this could save your life.
[02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:07.640]   Certainly could save your network.
[02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:12.240]   Forward networks.com/twit.
[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:15.600]   This is the kind of software I love.
[02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:17.560]   This is what software should do.
[02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:19.960]   Can save you a lot of trouble.
[02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:21.600]   Forward networks.com/twit.
[02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:34.320]   Thank you forward networks for supporting this week in Google.
[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:37.320]   Mashed potato says I should reopen the change log.
[02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:39.240]   Is there anything new?
[02:23:39.240 --> 02:23:40.600]   Anything different?
[02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:42.880]   The new Barnes and Noble Nook?
[02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:43.880]   Who cares?
[02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:44.880]   Who cares?
[02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:54.120]   Here, let's see a live stream of the situation in the Suez Canal.
[02:23:54.120 --> 02:23:57.360]   It's not moving much, is it?
[02:23:57.360 --> 02:23:58.800]   You know why?
[02:23:58.800 --> 02:23:59.800]   It's not moving.
[02:23:59.800 --> 02:24:02.240]   Look at the little bulldozer.
[02:24:02.240 --> 02:24:04.760]   Look at the little tiny bulldozer.
[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:14.760]   I'm going to move to a big fat boat.
[02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:17.280]   Oh, the memes.
[02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:21.680]   I'm just trying to find...
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:24.400]   This is a single image.
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:27.000]   I want a live stream.
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:32.120]   So as can a live stream of it just sitting there.
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:33.120]   Come on.
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:36.360]   I'm going to have cameras there.
[02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:39.720]   What's the Instagram account on that Twitter thread?
[02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:40.720]   The Instagram account.
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:41.720]   I don't know if she's refreshed or not.
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:43.200]   It was on the boat behind.
[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:44.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:45.200]   Yeah.
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:46.560]   She's stuck.
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:49.480]   The hidden container ship is stuck right there.
[02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:51.960]   Actually, there's some really cool...
[02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:52.960]   I have some pictures.
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:59.360]   I'd like to share my photo album from the Suez Canal if you don't mind.
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:01.800]   They have bridges that go across it, but they can't...
[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:03.800]   Oh, Stacy, we're going to be here for three hours.
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:04.800]   Thanks, Bill.
[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:06.520]   As a webcam, sir, in the chat.
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:07.520]   Get the slide here.
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:11.160]   We are going into the two-aged canal.
[02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:15.960]   Did you know the toll through the Suez Canal is like $750,000?
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:16.960]   Oh, yeah.
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:18.720]   Any cheap to go through the canal.
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:19.720]   Yeah.
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:22.960]   What if there's any refunds on current trips?
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:23.960]   Yeah.
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:24.960]   Sorry.
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:25.960]   No, no.
[02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:26.960]   It's...
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:29.320]   This whole thing is expensive.
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:30.320]   That's a blurry one.
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:31.320]   There's my boat.
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:32.760]   Look how wide that is.
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:38.360]   That gives you some idea of how big this ever-given is if it's crossing the entire width of that canal.
[02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:39.360]   Wow.
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:42.360]   That is a massive big boat.
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:44.320]   Okay, wait a minute.
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:48.400]   I think we have a live feed.
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:50.360]   It's not much.
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:52.000]   A live feed.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.440]   How to watch is the 30s shift stuck ship?
[02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:59.000]   No, that's not the live feed.
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.680]   Boy, there are a lot of ads on this.
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:03.680]   This is just a video.
[02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:05.880]   That's why we need flock.
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:06.880]   Yeah.
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:07.880]   And amp.
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:08.880]   And flock.
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:12.960]   It's the express.
[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:17.120]   Stacy, would you kick things off with your pick of the week?
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:19.640]   I will, and it's so relevant for y'all.
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:22.040]   How not to get stuck in a canal.
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:24.200]   Well, it's relevant.
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:27.840]   I actually haven't thought about telling you about this because it didn't seem relevant,
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:31.800]   but since there's a boat stuck in the Suez Canal, it's totally relevant.
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:34.000]   I live right up.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:37.720]   I can see the sound from my house.
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:40.000]   So I get to watch the container ships come in.
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:43.320]   And it's really mean we get to see the other day I saw an air traffic.
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:44.400]   No, what are those called?
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:45.720]   The big boats for the air.
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:46.720]   Aircraft carrier?
[02:26:46.720 --> 02:26:47.720]   Thank you.
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:48.720]   Wow.
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:53.600]   So we saw, yeah, it was the Nimitz coming into Vermerton.
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:54.760]   And there was a plane on it.
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:55.760]   It was so cool.
[02:26:55.760 --> 02:26:57.640]   Oh, I'm jealous.
[02:26:57.640 --> 02:27:03.000]   One of the first apps we downloaded, we got our little telescope up so we can watch everything.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.760]   But the first app we downloaded is something called Marine Traffic.
[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:12.400]   And this is an app that if you sail, you probably already know about it, we paid for
[02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:14.200]   the $10 a year subscription.
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:21.440]   But what it is, is we just go and you can see, you can check the ever given on this thing.
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:23.720]   Everyone else is using vessel watch, which is totally fine.
[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:27.040]   It's just, I happen to have personal experience with Marine Tracker.
[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:29.400]   Sorry, Marine Traffic.
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:35.320]   So yeah, and the cool thing is on your phone, you can actually, once again, lift your phone,
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:40.360]   show it the boat and the data will come up and about that particular boat.
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:41.360]   Oh, that's neat.
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:42.360]   Yeah.
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:46.960]   So if you're on the water or this happens all the time, I see a, you know, when we, when
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:50.800]   we go on our cruises or go to the harbor, you see boats and you want to know who owns
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:52.120]   that or where's it going?
[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:53.120]   Where is it from?
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:54.680]   That sounds like fun.
[02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:58.180]   So yeah, the free, there's a free version and then there's a $10.
[02:27:58.180 --> 02:28:03.560]   So $9.99 in a year plan that gets you, it's the, the annual starter pack and that gets
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:09.920]   you a little bit more, like all the vessel details, the port it's going to, you can track
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:12.240]   certain, tracking the Nimitz.
[02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:15.760]   So we could be like, we wanted to make sure we were there when it was coming in.
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:17.440]   Oh, that's so cool.
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:20.600]   So yeah, it's, it's a fun app.
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:23.880]   Marine Traffic.com, iOS or Android.
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:24.880]   Yeah.
[02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:25.880]   So there you go.
[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:26.880]   Cool.
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:29.080]   Really nice.
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:32.680]   And here's the Marine Tracker plot of the Suez Canal, by the way.
[02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:35.280]   You can see what's going on right now.
[02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:36.280]   Yeah.
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:39.480]   You can, you can filter out all the ships that are not cargo ships.
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:40.480]   Oh my gosh.
[02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:41.480]   Look out.
[02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:42.480]   Look out.
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:48.760]   How many folks are just stuck right at port side where they're about to enter.
[02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:49.760]   Wow.
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:51.400]   That's really amazing.
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:52.880]   Good pick.
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:53.880]   Great.
[02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:54.880]   Timely.
[02:28:54.880 --> 02:28:56.840]   Jeff Jarvis, a number.
[02:28:56.840 --> 02:29:04.000]   So last week I told you about whale net, how once people started hunting whales, the
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:09.880]   whales learned and obviously somehow communicated with each other in a big, like worldwide network
[02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:12.480]   and then, and, and the killings went down like 58%.
[02:29:12.480 --> 02:29:13.480]   Right.
[02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:14.480]   So we were amazed.
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:19.520]   This is in the time of, what's his name?
[02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:20.960]   Who was a real Melville, right?
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:22.120]   It was the time of Melville.
[02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:23.120]   Yes.
[02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:28.760]   And, and when whalers and all that, well, this week we find out that humpback whales are
[02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:32.160]   organizing in huge numbers and no one knows why.
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:34.080]   Do they want to join a union?
[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:37.240]   I think, I think there are new masters and I for one welcome.
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:38.240]   I love it.
[02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:40.160]   Humpback whales are organizing.
[02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:43.320]   They normally staying groups of 10 to 20 would be large.
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:47.800]   They're congregating in groups of 20 to 200 off the coast of South Africa, where they
[02:29:47.800 --> 02:29:48.800]   normally are either.
[02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:49.800]   That is a little.
[02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:53.520]   That is a little, a little bit scary.
[02:29:53.520 --> 02:29:58.160]   Maybe they're consulting like what the heck's going on with the climate or hey, is it hard
[02:29:58.160 --> 02:30:01.600]   to breathe where you are because of ocean, like, yeah, yeah.
[02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:02.600]   Yeah.
[02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:04.560]   What's it called when carbon dioxide gets in there?
[02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:05.560]   Yeah.
[02:30:05.560 --> 02:30:08.840]   The equivalent of us with a bug in your mouth, you know, you're going to plastic bagging
[02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:09.840]   your mouth.
[02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:11.640]   Aren't you hate that?
[02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:12.640]   Yeah.
[02:30:12.640 --> 02:30:14.200]   So good one.
[02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:15.360]   Whale net.
[02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:16.640]   Whale net.
[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:18.240]   The whales are organizing.
[02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:23.560]   And I also put in one just for, and you love, you love flying things generally, right?
[02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:24.560]   I do.
[02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:27.720]   I saw this and I appreciate that you put it in there.
[02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:30.200]   I've seen it before and you have.
[02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:31.200]   Okay.
[02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:32.400]   How to maintain an airport in Antarctica.
[02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:34.000]   That was just, I found that fascinating.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:35.000]   Oh, wow.
[02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:39.640]   From flight radar, which is that by the way, like marine traffic for flights, it's a great
[02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:40.640]   app.
[02:30:40.640 --> 02:30:41.640]   I use it all.
[02:30:41.640 --> 02:30:42.640]   Yeah.
[02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:44.280]   Flight radar 24 troll research station.
[02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:47.560]   How to operate an airport in Antarctica.
[02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:48.560]   Wow.
[02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:49.560]   Wow.
[02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:50.560]   Wow.
[02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:51.560]   Wow.
[02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:55.800]   Trying to keep things warm, but yet cold enough so you can fly off of the runway.
[02:30:55.800 --> 02:30:56.800]   Yeah.
[02:30:56.800 --> 02:30:58.880]   You don't want to turn it to slush either.
[02:30:58.880 --> 02:30:59.880]   Yeah.
[02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:00.880]   Yeah.
[02:31:00.880 --> 02:31:04.680]   That is a pretty awesome video on that link there.
[02:31:04.680 --> 02:31:05.680]   Yeah.
[02:31:05.680 --> 02:31:07.160]   Because they're bringing in freighters.
[02:31:07.160 --> 02:31:11.240]   So these are like big, big, big, yeah, they got to get all the food and everything in
[02:31:11.240 --> 02:31:12.240]   there for people.
[02:31:12.240 --> 02:31:14.160]   Is that like a Zamboni for the runway?
[02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:15.160]   Yes.
[02:31:15.160 --> 02:31:16.160]   Pretty much.
[02:31:16.160 --> 02:31:20.320]   The runway was snow when they don't use it so it doesn't melt or anything and then they
[02:31:20.320 --> 02:31:22.040]   have to take the snow off.
[02:31:22.040 --> 02:31:24.000]   Yeah, didn't have to scrape it.
[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:25.000]   Yeah.
[02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:26.000]   Oh, wow.
[02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.000]   Wow.
[02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:28.000]   Wow.
[02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:29.200]   It is exactly a Zamboni.
[02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:30.200]   Yeah.
[02:31:30.200 --> 02:31:31.600]   That's hysterical.
[02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:36.720]   A mixture of cold water, ice chips and snow is poured on, allowed to harden and smoothed
[02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:39.320]   over just like making a nice drink.
[02:31:39.320 --> 02:31:40.800]   Wow.
[02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:41.800]   Mr.
[02:31:41.800 --> 02:31:42.800]   Ant Pruitt.
[02:31:42.800 --> 02:31:45.240]   What's your thing this week?
[02:31:45.240 --> 02:31:47.400]   I got a couple of things.
[02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:51.720]   The first one was, I know some folks have been trying to find that dream job during
[02:31:51.720 --> 02:31:52.720]   this pandemic.
[02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:59.840]   Well, there is a winery here in Sonoma County that's offering an opportunity to apply for
[02:31:59.840 --> 02:32:02.440]   your dream job in wine.
[02:32:02.440 --> 02:32:05.600]   That's why I really have done this before.
[02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:10.320]   They've done this before because they have someone that's still there on their staff that
[02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:12.120]   did the same thing with this process.
[02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:14.240]   Are they looking for a social media person?
[02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:15.240]   Whatever they look like.
[02:32:15.240 --> 02:32:18.640]   No, it's whatever you'd like for it to be within wine.
[02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:21.520]   I'd like to drink it, please.
[02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:23.520]   Not just that.
[02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:32.120]   You know, but if you're curious about a profession in wine making a send them a video of what
[02:32:32.120 --> 02:32:35.440]   you want to be and why you would be the best person for that job.
[02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:38.520]   And apparently they've done this before and it's worked.
[02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:42.240]   It was a, I believe there's a video on that link that I shared.
[02:32:42.240 --> 02:32:43.240]   Yes, there is.
[02:32:43.240 --> 02:32:44.240]   But it's pretty good.
[02:32:44.240 --> 02:32:45.920]   It's pretty good wine.
[02:32:45.920 --> 02:32:47.760]   I like barfie good.
[02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:48.760]   Let's see.
[02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:49.760]   Boy, they have the worst.
[02:32:49.760 --> 02:32:50.760]   Great.
[02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:51.760]   Read free year.
[02:32:51.760 --> 02:32:54.000]   Upload video of your application.
[02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.160]   So you have to do a video to get this.
[02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:57.160]   Yeah.
[02:32:57.160 --> 02:32:58.160]   Yeah.
[02:32:58.160 --> 02:33:00.000]   Do you want to work and live in Sonoma?
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.440]   You just up the road a piece here.
[02:33:02.440 --> 02:33:06.320]   Here you are looking for a change in career to pursue your passion.
[02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:07.560]   Do you want a really good job?
[02:33:07.560 --> 02:33:09.320]   This is such good marketing.
[02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:10.320]   Yeah.
[02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:12.120]   And rent free.
[02:33:12.120 --> 02:33:13.920]   Is this what it looks like in Sonoma County?
[02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:16.040]   Because I'd like to move there too.
[02:33:16.040 --> 02:33:20.680]   Six figures salary in a year's worth of Murphy Good Wine.
[02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:23.120]   This is all just a little bankrupting.
[02:33:23.120 --> 02:33:24.120]   Yeah.
[02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:25.120]   Yeah.
[02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:27.120]   It's good stuff.
[02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:30.960]   You know, any wine goes with kochio e pepe.
[02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:32.720]   Any wine at all.
[02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:34.200]   Whatever can cut the grease.
[02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:35.200]   It's good.
[02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:36.200]   That was a great idea.
[02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:37.200]   So they did this last year.
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:42.360]   My is given up his seat to let you to his replacement.
[02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:45.600]   I think that's a good gig.
[02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:46.600]   Yeah.
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:47.600]   Well, it's only a year though.
[02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:48.600]   Well, that's good.
[02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:49.600]   That's not bad.
[02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:50.600]   Set you up for something else though.
[02:33:50.600 --> 02:33:54.560]   And then the other thing is I've been playing with this travel dock because I've been having
[02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:57.560]   some thoughts on my computer here recently.
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:33:58.960]   But this is from OWC.
[02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:00.440]   I own that travel dock.
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:01.440]   I like it.
[02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:05.120]   Because I've been trying to find something that's going to have an SD card reader because
[02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:07.840]   a lot of laptops don't have SD card reader.
[02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:08.840]   Show the bottom more.
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:10.000]   That's my favorite part.
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:11.000]   But this is the cable.
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000]   Look at that.
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.000]   It goes right in there.
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:14.000]   Yeah.
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:15.000]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:16.000]   Yeah.
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.800]   And then when you take it out, it still sits nice and neat right there and it's all in
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:21.000]   little divot right here.
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:22.640]   Mine broke right away.
[02:34:22.640 --> 02:34:23.640]   USB-C.
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:24.640]   Yeah.
[02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:25.640]   Mine stopped working.
[02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:28.640]   I don't know if I pulled the cable too hard or something.
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:30.400]   I wouldn't have surprised.
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:31.400]   Yeah.
[02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:32.400]   Yeah.
[02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:33.400]   But it lets you read.
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:34.400]   I was sad.
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:35.400]   I love it.
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:36.400]   Yeah.
[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:39.040]   It lets you read up to UHS 2 SD cards.
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:45.480]   So if you have like a V60 or V90 SD card for your super high resolution video, I'm
[02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:46.480]   moving the wrong way.
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:47.480]   There we go.
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:48.480]   Sorry.
[02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:52.520]   You're going to be able to pull that data off pretty fast and not have to worry about
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:54.160]   bot on it because of that USB-C.
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:55.160]   That's good stuff.
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:56.160]   Nice.
[02:34:56.160 --> 02:34:59.520]   And I think it was 60 bucks or so.
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:00.520]   Yeah.
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:01.520]   I can't remember.
[02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:02.520]   They're good.
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:03.520]   Other world computing is good.
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:08.480]   It works with the iPad as well as any computer with a--
[02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:11.800]   It's usually more on that Mac side of thing, but I've--
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:14.960]   But you've found it worked on a Windows machine and all that?
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:16.760]   I never tried it with a Windows.
[02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:17.760]   Good.
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:18.760]   Yeah.
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:24.800]   And then my last one-- well, should I do too quick?
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:28.160]   The last one will be-- my next one will be for Floss.
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:32.400]   Today, we had Keith Packard on Air.
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:39.360]   And this was a perfectly tying episode for him to be on because of some interesting news
[02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:46.200]   regarding Mr. Richard Stallman in the Free Software Foundation.
[02:35:46.200 --> 02:35:48.640]   So make sure you check out Floss Weekly.
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:50.200]   I think it's episode 622.
[02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:51.920]   Let me double check.
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:52.920]   Yep.
[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:53.920]   Episode 622.
[02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:54.920]   Check that out.
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:36:00.080]   Very, very interesting conversation there on Floss Weekly.
[02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:02.640]   .tv/floss.
[02:36:02.640 --> 02:36:08.320]   And lastly, if you don't mind, would you click on that link for this here, House Call?
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:11.680]   Because it's just a proud moment that I wanted to show you.
[02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:14.400]   House Call to the Pruitt House?
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:15.400]   That's right.
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:16.400]   Oh, no.
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:17.400]   He's going home.
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:18.400]   Let's see.
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:19.400]   Let's play this video.
[02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:21.560]   Can I go bigger with it?
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:23.040]   Oh, it should be a bit.
[02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:24.040]   Here it is.
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:25.040]   Here we go.
[02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:27.240]   Is this a hard head in that outfit?
[02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:28.480]   The senior hard head.
[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:30.320]   This is the senior hard head.
[02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:31.320]   Starting at about 95.
[02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:35.480]   Oh, this is a punt reception or a kick off return.
[02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:36.480]   Oh!
[02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:37.480]   What?
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:38.480]   Get a hug!
[02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:39.480]   Get a hug!
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:40.480]   Wow!
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:42.480]   Is that you, Ant?
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:44.480]   That's me, Yellen.
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:49.520]   So, Ant, this is all a note saying I'm going to be a little horse at work today.
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:51.600]   Now I know why.
[02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:52.600]   Beautiful, Ant.
[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:54.760]   Now I know why.
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:59.920]   That is the first kick off return for that school in about four years.
[02:36:59.920 --> 02:37:01.400]   All the way.
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:02.400]   He might be.
[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:03.400]   He could be.
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:05.560]   He's going all the way!
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:07.160]   That's fantastic.
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:08.160]   Was he really stoked?
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:11.360]   That's really, we all were.
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:16.880]   The game was out of reach at that point, but it was still pretty cool to see that nobody
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:17.880]   came even close.
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:19.280]   He didn't even get touched.
[02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:20.280]   Yeah, he was.
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:22.560]   He had the jets.
[02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:24.560]   I was quite proud of that.
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:26.960]   The only person near him is his teammate.
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:29.200]   That's really good.
[02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:34.000]   And also his younger brother, the other hardhead, they had their game the same day.
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:38.640]   He unfortunately went out early in the fourth quarter because he cramped up, but prior to
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:40.600]   that he was kicking butt to it.
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:41.600]   Wow.
[02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:43.600]   He had a 35 yard touchdown.
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:45.600]   I think I had to go ahead and touch down.
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:48.600]   I was a little tough on the train.
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:50.400]   Is it Friday night?
[02:37:50.400 --> 02:37:52.360]   Did you do Friday night football?
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:53.840]   Yes, sir.
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:38:00.080]   This week, the JV team will be playing the Petaluma High School on Friday, but the varsity
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:05.920]   is not playing until Tuesday to be playing that fancy Cardinal Newman school.
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:06.920]   Oh, they're good.
[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:07.920]   The Cardinal Newman.
[02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:08.920]   Yeah, they're good.
[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:09.920]   I want to see how that goes.
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:10.920]   Yeah.
[02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:12.920]   Nicholas Montana used to play for them.
[02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:13.920]   Yeah.
[02:38:13.920 --> 02:38:14.920]   Yeah.
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:16.520]   Well, that's awesome.
[02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:19.520]   I'll just throw this one in as a quick pick before we head out.
[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:26.600]   This is an AI experiment from Google experiments with Google.com, the infinite drum machine.
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:28.000]   Oh, dude.
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.600]   You can play drums with the blob opera.
[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:39.040]   Yeah, if you want some percussion, you can play drums with normal objects from the real
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:40.520]   world.
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:43.080]   That's a computer laptop, a magazine.
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:45.280]   Here's a zipper jacket.
[02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:49.160]   There's a projector slide.
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:53.000]   Mr. Howell is just crazy right now.
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.000]   Oh, my gosh.
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.520]   The track below.
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:57.000]   So you pick what you want.
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:58.000]   You pick where it goes.
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:05.640]   You want a truck land Rover Defender interior clutch release.
[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:07.400]   Or maybe, let's see.
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:11.960]   Oh, how about, boy, that's good.
[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:15.080]   Food peel golf club shuffle platter.
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:21.520]   So what is like the green cluster is like sounds or is that like people said needs
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:25.360]   sounds versus have no idea you're asking me a question.
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:27.320]   I just know this.
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:34.120]   I am all for this right now because I don't know if you all have ever heard of Timbaland.
[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:38.840]   Timbaland is a masterful producer in hip hop.
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:41.360]   He also produced Justin Timberlake's album.
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:43.360]   What's the magic thing?
[02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:46.160]   I don't know if you've heard of Timbaland.
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:48.160]   Well, he's the one I have.
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:49.160]   I have.
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:50.160]   Yeah, Timbaland.
[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:51.160]   What are you talking to?
[02:39:51.160 --> 02:39:53.600]   Well, he's known as the Emperor of Sound.
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:54.600]   Oh, yes.
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:40:00.520]   And his career, he started his career by making sounds of random and animate things like what
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:05.200]   you see in the screen and turning them into great beats and songs.
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:10.320]   And you would never know that it was a chicken bone snapping or a baby.
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:11.560]   Well, this is a baby.
[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:16.720]   But this stuff, I like this.
[02:40:16.720 --> 02:40:17.720]   Put it in the right hand.
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:22.160]   It's like say someone like Mr. Howe, somebody not me in the port.
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:24.080]   Let's see what the colors are.
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:26.400]   I don't know.
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:27.400]   Doesn't really tell you what them.
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:28.960]   I'm sure there's something.
[02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:33.800]   It's an open source code project.
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:36.240]   I like just going through the sound.
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:39.240]   I did it.
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:44.240]   I did it.
[02:40:44.240 --> 02:40:49.240]   Put this in the right hands and this is the experiments with experiments.withgoogle.com.
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:50.240]   What did that say?
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:51.240]   Jars shake something?
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:52.240]   Oh, you can't.
[02:40:52.240 --> 02:40:57.600]   I can't get back to it because there's so many different stuff.
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:40:59.600]   Can I zoom in?
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:05.800]   Yeah, I can zoom in, but that isn't.
[02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:06.800]   Casino slack.
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:08.440]   Go back to casino slack.
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:09.440]   Go back.
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:10.440]   I can't.
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:11.440]   Right there.
[02:41:11.440 --> 02:41:12.440]   Interesting.
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:13.440]   Yeah, I would.
[02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:22.440]   I would spend a bit of time on this.
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:23.440]   All right.
[02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:27.440]   There you go.
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:34.520]   Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this percussive edition of this week in Google.
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:36.200]   Thank you so much, Stacey Higgenbotham.

[02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:55.760]   sensors and Kevin and I both are like high on thread and he's good too.
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:41:56.760]   Yeah.

[02:41:57.760 --> 02:41:58.760]   Yeah.

[02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:07.800]   Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:08.800]   Okay.
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:09.800]   Cool.
[02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:10.800]   Very cool.
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:15.040]   @gigastacey on Twitter and I'm sorry you're not going to be here next week.
[02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:20.320]   I'm glad you're spending time with your lovely daughter and we will see you in a couple
[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:22.020]   of weeks.
[02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:27.200]   Thank you, Aunt Pruitt, the hardhead father of hardheads.
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:29.000]   That's his title officially.
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:30.000]   Twitter.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:34.040]   #HOP and well, you got mother of dragons, father of hardheads.
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:35.040]   It just belongs together.
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:37.760]   And the core jester of Queen Pruitt.
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:38.760]   There you go.
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:41.320]   And his court jester.
[02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:42.960]   Aunt will be on hands on photography.
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:44.880]   What day do you do that show?
[02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:48.880]   Each and every Thursday, sir, Twitter.tv/HOP.
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:51.720]   Subscribe right now and tell a friend.
[02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:52.720]   Yeah.
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:55.120]   And actually, Jason Hall, our producer has and host of all about Andrew.
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:59.960]   It has his review of the OnePlus 9 coming out tomorrow on Hands on Technology.
[02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:00.960]   So that's good.
[02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:04.880]   And Jason, do a lot of hands on technology episodes.
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:09.360]   Jeff Jarvis is the director of the Townite Center for what used to be called entrepreneurial
[02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:14.240]   journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University
[02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:15.240]   of New York.
[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:16.240]   Thank you.
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:19.640]   Jeff Buzz machine.com at Jeff Jarvis.
[02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:21.200]   Always a pleasure.
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:24.640]   Former TV guy critics Sinatra once called him a bum.
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:27.640]   I love that.
[02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:28.640]   I do too.
[02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:30.360]   He's a bum.
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:32.160]   I tell you, he's a bum.
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:36.240]   Alan Thick said, when will you stop making me your personal whipping boy?
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:41.160]   Oh, if only he had his fantasies.
[02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:48.240]   We do this show every Wednesday, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2030 UTC.
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:50.040]   That's roughly the time the show begins.
[02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:55.080]   If you tune in at that time by going to Twitter.tv/live, there's audio and video streams there
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:56.080]   live.
[02:43:56.080 --> 02:43:58.440]   But I might catch some pre-show banter.
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:00.640]   There's quite a bit of it.
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:01.640]   Maybe.
[02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:04.760]   This is one of those times where Stacy said, you're wasting all the good stuff.
[02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:06.360]   You're wasting all the good stuff.
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:08.920]   So that would be something to tune in early to.
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:13.240]   Oh, that's the Floss Weekly Show, by the way, that you should not miss from free desktop.
[02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:15.960]   That was a really, really good chat this morning.
[02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:16.960]   Good.
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:17.960]   We'll catch that.
[02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:22.800]   We are also on the website, twitter.tv/twig, in this case.

[02:44:56.200 --> 02:44:58.680]   We'll see you next week on this week in Google.
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:44:59.680]   Bye bye.
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:03.120]   Hey, I hope you enjoyed that episode.
