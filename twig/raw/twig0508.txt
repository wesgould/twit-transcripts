[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   It's time for twig this week in Google Jeff and Stacey are both in studio. We're gonna talk actually Stacey's gonna debunk the notion that
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:15.640]   Nest died Google IO. What really happened? We'll talk about a Google assistant coming to Sonos a real issue
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.360]   with Google's Bluetooth
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:25.520]   Security key and a 14 year old spewing hate on YouTube. It's all coming up next on twig
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.520]   Netcast you love from people you trust
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.000]   This is twig
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:50.920]   This is twig this week in Google episode 508 recorded Wednesday May 15th 2019. I'm by Cola myself
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.520]   This week in Google is brought to you by WordPress turn your dreams into reality and launch your website at wordpress.com
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.360]   Get 15% off any new plan at WordPress.com/twig
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:13.120]   It's time for twig this week in Google to show we cover the latest news from Google Facebook Twitter and the world around us
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.840]   joining us now from his
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.480]   ivory tower deep within Manhattan
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.040]   It's the Leonard Ta professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark graduate school of journalism at the City University of New York
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:34.440]   Just off Times Square mr. Jeff Jarvis in the center of the F in universe in the center of the F in universe
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.840]   Right here. This right there is the center
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.680]   We all revolve around Jeff's microphone hi Jeff
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.020]   Hello, it was so nice having you here last week so great to see you. Let's enjoy that and you made it back
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.100]   We got to go out for a dinner lunch, which I think is called a bunch. Yeah
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.220]   and done
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.320]   That we found one restaurant open at 4 30 in the afternoon unfortunately was Denny's, but that's okay
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.980]   Yeah, we're really at Denny's no
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.200]   Like that would be so funny. Well, you would get the early bird special
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.540]   Say I'm late you made it to a six a oh
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.100]   horrible also Stacey Higginbotham is here so good to welcome you back. Hi, Stace
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.420]   You are at a conference. It looks like I am I'm in the beautiful Santa Clara Convention Center and the pressroom
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.300]   Is that the McHenry? I think it's the McHenry Convention Center named after the former mayor down there
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.820]   That's where Apple has its events. What event are you at? I am at I O T world. Yes, that looks like there's three of you
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.820]   I'm sorry
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:51.460]   Event
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:59.380]   Conference you see Stacey I was playing as jokes. Yeah, I speak Leo. I am I am used myself and myself alone apparently
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.220]   Yeah, this is this is not the floor, but it's I mean, it's just a trade show. Yeah
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.620]   So let us move briskly
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.300]   through these stories because they're actually
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.780]   quite a few
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.660]   Starting with the story that if you had a pixel phone with a bad microphone
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.540]   Which I think Jeff you did have right many people had no, I was actually okay. It was very common
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.140]   It was a bad microphone not a bad screen
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.580]   well I
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.980]   There was a class action lawsuit brought by owners of the original
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.140]   Okay, oh yeah, that's the more modern pixel at a bad screen. This is the OG pixel the one you had car
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.740]   The battery conked out after Google has
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.540]   settled
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.340]   The judge will decide what the fine could be it could be up to $500 per pixel owner
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.780]   But the judge again has to decide that
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.500]   Pixel and pixel XL devices manufactured before January 4th 2017 are covered
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.620]   Google admitted there was an issue by March
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.900]   It said 1% of pixel phones had a hairline crack in the solder connection on the audio codec
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.540]   Which caused issues with calling and hardware if the world were just software everything would be okay is hard
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.820]   It would run yeah, Adam's suck. Yeah
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.660]   So the court has yet to give its final approval
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.860]   There will be a link to a claim form
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.780]   But it's not yet live you can go to the law firm
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.860]   Which is apparently called chemicals Schwartz critter and Donaldson Smith?
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.100]   Which is not the best name rolls off the tongue
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.260]   Chemicals has a site where you can say hey, I had one of those
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.620]   At chemicals calm CH I am I see LES or maybe it's Jimmy, please might be Jimmy, please
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.540]   calm
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.260]   Anyway, that's actually surprising and I it's not gonna be a huge loss for Google
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.500]   In fact you get some sense of how many phones they sold it at most at seven and quarter million dollars. They'll have to pay
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.140]   Wow, that is not a lot of not a lot of phones do the math
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.860]   I'm surprised. I don't have to just exchange that
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.140]   Supposedly even if you didn't have this problem, you can still get 20 bucks out of this if you had a pixel
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.140]   Wow, is it worth the trouble?
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.860]   No
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.220]   Yeah, but that's that's very class is to ask that a lot of people I know that sure
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.620]   I know that no what I'm saying actually is how much trouble will they put you to?
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.740]   Yeah, because I mean I just putting be putting a stamp on a postcard it might be right
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:49.100]   That's what I'm saying is that you know by the time you calculate you do still have your receipt a proof of purchase
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.300]   From 2017 right yeah, exactly. She's who doesn't say
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.500]   I say this you need to pay me to give them my you get my files here and find it
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:08.140]   I feel that rebates on like dog food, so I'm a little weird. Oh my wife has everything
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.820]   Yeah, she's it does to everything she uses honey
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.980]   Dot-com and a bunch of other things for like she won't buy anything without looking for a coupon
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.660]   Right well you shouldn't I know it's I mean they're on it's online dude. You just google it
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.740]   There's Chrome extensions that do it. I know I know she uses them
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:37.060]   I don't I just not me. I don't know why it's just not me, but you're right. It's it's what is it
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:45.180]   Privileges it's something ist it's I've never had to I'm all the worry about money as an old white man
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.180]   I am all of the above
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.180]   Nest now I really want Stacy's take on this because she covers IOT
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.580]   We're on a model wrote an article that might be I think considered by some a little bit
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.660]   The troll yeah
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.100]   He went a bit overboard
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:09.140]   Maybe he went a little bit overboard so in fact Florence I said I'm doing some she says I'm doing some research on this because I don't know
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:17.820]   If I buy it he writes nest the company died at Google I owe 2019 the nest ecosystem is dead nest accounts are dead nest
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.940]   Privacy firewall is dead you remember when Google acquired nest Tony Fiddell famously said don't worry Google's not going to get your information
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.020]   But there's also of course a works with nest program
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.580]   and
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.620]   The works with nest program is going to be deprecated
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.940]   In fact, here's that here's the post on the works of nest site. It's winding down
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.460]   So here's what's gonna happen
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.780]   Google basically at Google I owe said it took nest
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.720]   from a series of devices that have
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:58.500]   Historically had their own intelligence and agency so it there was a direct API that let you control them
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.740]   It's like nest devices talk to your stuff and vice versa
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.900]   by killing the works with nest program and
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.500]   Switching it all through the Google assistant in Google Home
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.940]   What it's done is it stuck the Google home in as a middleman
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:19.380]   so now think of the nest devices as zombies they are now controlled via the Google home and
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:25.140]   This is bad news for a lot of companies. It was sudden news for many companies
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:31.380]   So every company out there that has worked with has done a worked with nests works with nests
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:37.660]   Integration now has to go back and basically build a routine through Google and that includes if this then that
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:47.820]   includes if it includes hue it includes lutron it includes big includes Amazon anybody who's been controlling their Amazon or their nest thermostat through their
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.860]   Amazon Echo
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.240]   Amazon has to work with Google now through this and Amazon will get their own
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.460]   It's not a skill. It's a routine or some sort of integration
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.340]   so
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.700]   This isn't this isn't great. I mean if you don't have a Google home
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:11.580]   You're gonna be like crap now. I need some sort of home device from Google in my house to control my nest
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.180]   You can't use your Android device your Android phone
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.900]   Well, you can but you can't do it when you're away because there's not a device
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.660]   You need a hub at home. Okay. Got it. Yeah, that is my understanding now
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:27.540]   I don't have my nest stuff because I moved out and so I've decommissioned all that I can't play with this
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:34.180]   I would so if you're a person with nest gear and you're like, huh, what does this mean? Well, I lose all functionality
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:41.580]   You may lose some functionality in June. You're gonna be asked to switch over from a nest account to a Google account
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:47.100]   Your you shouldn't do that yet though because you have until the end of August August 31st 2019
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:54.220]   And I would wait for the integrations that matter to you for those companies to actually announce that they've completed them and tested them
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:59.280]   Because otherwise you're gonna kill functionality without being able to recreate it just yet
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.500]   That's not Stacey. Will you presumably never be going through this be if we'll work again
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.020]   These things will work again. They just get once they go through the effort
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:13.180]   Yes, everybody has to go through this effort and the reason why Google did this is because now it has greater control over what devices
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.180]   Access your nest gear beforehand
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:23.620]   I was accessing my nest gear through like if and Amazon and all these other things and I would sometimes
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.580]   Stop those connections and then other things would still try to it was kind of a security
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:38.380]   Challenge and it's a privacy challenge. So in relation to this Google actually announced a privacy program for their smart home sensor products and
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:47.300]   I have a lot of thoughts on this so we'll get into that next but ask me any more questions about works with in general
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.060]   Is this a good and necessary thing or a greedy and horrible thing? It's both
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.100]   Like life there's two I mean yes
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:04.340]   It's going to allow Google to you'll have one place to go for privacy information and to understand what devices have access to what data
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:09.580]   Because beforehand Google couldn't tell you who had access to your nest thermostat you went through nest and
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:15.740]   Something's still works. Something's didn't it was all if he and Google couldn't engine Google couldn't control the ecosystem
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:23.820]   The flip side is Google couldn't control the ecosystem and a lot of people like that because they want to feel like they're in control of the ecosystem
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.740]   Got it. What about privacy though?
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.980]   Are some people concerned that now the firewall between Google and nest is breached I?
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:39.820]   Mean the fact that they had the firewall from the deal in 2013 when it was announced or 20 it was a 2013 or 2014 that it closed
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.380]   whatever so the fact that it's lived for this long is actually really impressive and
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:50.340]   What Google's done is they're not using this okay, and here's where we get and I wrote about this
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:55.780]   So feel free to link to my story on Google's privacy thing Google put out a privacy policy
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.860]   Dedicated to sensor devices and in it. It did some really great things. It said hey
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:07.980]   Here's all of our devices. Here's all the sensors in it. Here's what those here's the data those sensors collect which is something I
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.620]   Think everything should do
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:15.300]   And then it said we're not going to use the data collected by those things
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.420]   for advertising
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:25.980]   And it was very clear on this some of that data all of the sensor home data is not going to be used for advertising now
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:32.180]   That's good. That's what a lot of people are worried about it is not the end all be all because
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:39.380]   Advertising is for the web and this is the smart home the data they're collecting is going to be valuable not necessarily for advertising
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:43.820]   Although it could be used like if they want to directly might be used for advertising
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.380]   Advertising advertising is not the big thing we need to worry about here
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:55.500]   What we need to worry about is having algorithmically generated decisions made for us for prices we pay for goods
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:03.980]   Yeah, things like insurance access to health care or access to services and that Google isn't talking about it all in their privacy policy
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.180]   They're just like here. We're gonna keep this data. We're not gonna show it to other people
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.380]   So we're not gonna share it. We're not gonna show you advertising based on it
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.220]   So everyone's like oh good digestible it
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:19.300]   But really they're not saying that we're not gonna use this to build services and products and those services and products could end up
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.380]   Couldn't put a consumer in kind of a bad spot
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.020]   We'll give us just one
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.020]   Sure potential scenario
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:33.420]   Let's say Google has all this information now about the devices in my home. They could come in and say
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.820]   Hey, would you like electricity service from us?
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.180]   We can use this data to provide a more competitive rate, which sounds really good
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.940]   But then once they have that competitive rate, how are they gonna behave?
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:50.140]   Does anyone else have that access to data? Can they offer a similar product? We know in your home
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.660]   We know when you're not home, right? And of course, we're gonna save you money by turning down your AC
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.820]   So you know your cold-blooded. Yeah, right
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:05.560]   It creates the same sort of monopoly effect or do opally possibly affect that like the cable in
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.940]   ISPs providers have by virtue of owning the pipe by owning access to our smart home data
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:19.140]   If it's a single company who has that they can build all kinds of competitive services on top of that that no one else can touch
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.340]   And though that's one example another example might be
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.900]   Google could start like a health care
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:30.620]   Brokerage health or health insurance brokerage, you know and start yeah
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:36.500]   We have to stop thinking that the hazard is that these companies are going to share our private information with third parties
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:43.300]   Because that's one of the hazards, but it's not the only hazard and we have to stop thinking about the only hazard is being advertising
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:50.100]   The web was built on advertising. We're building something that isn't the web. We're building the Internet of Things and that is going to be a
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.700]   Data you're gonna have database service data based services
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.260]   So how are you supposed to be clear is in the eye of the beholder?
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.260]   You may love your low price luxury service
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.380]   It's just a question of whether you are informed enough to make a good choice
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:09.540]   Yeah, you may love it until there is no other choice and then they didn't jack up the price
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:15.100]   I know there's that too. There's the problem with monopoly is not that it doesn't provide great service
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:20.660]   But that by virtue of having a monopoly you eliminate the elasticity of supply and pricing
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.300]   Step before the monopoly
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:29.300]   And you may never get to monopoly what I think I hear Stacy saying is that is that it's not a question of a monopoly
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.700]   It's a question of you live in an ecosystem where you have limited information
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.580]   There may be ten other competitors. You don't know about them
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:43.140]   Well, you have both limited information and then they have built a wall of data basically around you that
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.460]   It becomes impossible to leave
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:50.340]   It's kind of like what people are talking about when they're talking about regulating Facebook and like they're talking about like crap
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:55.620]   People's doing this too every every company seems to be moving into this idea of siloing you
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.700]   And creating a walled garden that is you know that works well
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:04.020]   Yes, it'll be it'll be wonderful to be highly customized for you
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:08.420]   There's there's benefits and drawbacks to that depending on how you feel about the world, but
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.780]   at the end of the day
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.740]   It's a very dystopian vision and I don't
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.420]   I don't think we want that I would like to
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.420]   keep the
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.420]   keep the competitive
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:29.460]   The barrier to that yeah, it's the same argument people give against the smart city that google's building in toronto
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:35.140]   It's not that a smart city won't have better commute better bus service better electrical service
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:39.140]   It's that it will all be owned by one company. You're suddenly in the company town
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.380]   Well there it's also
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:47.300]   What is google going to do with that data and how are they going to charge for access to that data for both cities and
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:54.180]   People and privacy and blah blah. Yeah, I for one and building an arc to take me to google island
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:59.620]   For well, you might buy 80 cubers. You might be there by by the fall you may not have
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.220]   That's false. There's also a short-term pain point
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:08.980]   Which is that anybody who has configured an elaborate smart home. You're lucky Stacy. You just took yours apart
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:13.540]   So you're gonna have to reconfigure it. You're gonna have to start all over again all your scripts all your
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.340]   Automated routines and everything
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:23.140]   But the good news is they're pulling off the band-aid this you probably once you move into the nice warm brace
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.620]   Of the google bath. You won't have to ever leave it
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.420]   Follow the light show
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:35.380]   It's the same exact same premise apple offers and amazon offers and google offers. Yeah, yeah
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.940]   And I would say
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:43.220]   There's gonna be a lot of people who this news is gonna surprise they don't they know they have nesker
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:49.300]   They may have done smart home integrations or maybe like their kids did it or they're right a friend of theirs came over and did it
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.940]   They're gonna get an email sometime in June. That's gonna be like
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:56.020]   What do I do now? Your nest account is now your google account. They're gonna be like what why what's happening?
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.020]   So I think there's actually gonna be a lot of confusion and it's not the kind of confusion where us
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.580]   Gee nerdy people are like
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.660]   I need a more open ecosystem. They're gonna be like what the hell is happening right?
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.540]   Yeah, if you hired somebody to come in and and wire your house and set it all up
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.180]   You're gonna have to hire them again
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.180]   very plenty like
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.140]   Lenar uses. Oh, no, Lenar uses honey. Well
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.340]   There are companies that have put in like smart
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:28.180]   As the amazon home. They're the amazon home. They are the amazon home. There is a google home
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.180]   But I can't remember kaby home is using google
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:37.700]   That and by the way the reason Lenar a big developer and uh kaby home a big developer does this is because it's
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:44.500]   A desirable thing consumers go hey cool. I got a smart home. It's all configured pre-configured ready to go out of the box
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.060]   That's that's a selling point
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:52.340]   Ironically when I talked to Lenar about theirs probably about a year and a half to two years ago
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.180]   I was like so hey, how are you gonna handle it when people move and they were like
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.060]   They're never gonna move
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:05.940]   Intimately of familiar with this issue now. I need to follow up with them and be like hey
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.380]   So it's been about two years. Does anyone moved out yet? And what did they do?
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:19.060]   If you know they're prisoners, they're not allowed go to states. You know iot.com because she's written a guide to moving from your smart home
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:23.700]   And there's stuff you want to disconnect there's stuff. I mean there's it's not it's not immediately obvious
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.180]   Uh those days you haven't made to ask you
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.340]   Have you had to do any customer service calls on your house buyers?
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.900]   No, no, no, she has her own uh avi guy
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.620]   Oh
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.180]   As part of it. I was like hey i'll come over for an hour, you know just to help you set anything up
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.300]   But just give me a call. That's the new thing you have to have an avi guy
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:51.060]   When you buy in a house. Well leo you have a few yeah, i'm me i'm the avi guy
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.780]   And by the way, i'm not a very good avi guy
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.940]   So each tv has its own particular set of rules
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:03.060]   Uh-huh boy does your lovely wife feel at you? Oh, yeah
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.620]   She says i just want to watch tv play see you haven't set up like a
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:13.380]   Logitech box or something where you can just say yeah, I try those things those things are you know, some ways worse
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:19.300]   Because if they worked perfectly then they wouldn't be but they don't work perfectly and so when they don't work then they really in a
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.740]   Bind she says she just says you can't die
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.900]   Well, let's ah
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:32.580]   There's your wall guard away. Yeah way to stay alive. Yeah, I have to live forever
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.620]   All right, we had a
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.700]   listener to the radio show call
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:42.100]   Uh this week he said because you were talking about how you wrote a manual
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.220]   for uh
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:52.180]   People who came to your house so they could know how to watch tv and it was it was a fairly elaborate guide to using our television set
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.940]   and uh
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:58.500]   And he said you inspired me and I wrote an app for the iphone first I did it
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:05.540]   Myself take pictures make this guide built it in mic and apple's keynote and uh and printed it out as like a
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.700]   Instruction with and I realized oh, you know, this would be a good app. So he actually has made an app for ios
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:14.580]   I think it's called pick instructions. I can't remember where you take pictures of your stuff
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.940]   The app then you can organize it you can put in the instructions
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:25.540]   And then you can share a QR code with your the new tenants or the house sitters and say here's how you operate
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:34.340]   Is that a good idea it is we I I had done an amazon echo blueprint for uh guide to turning on the tv
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:43.700]   That isn't the ask ask matt on the a to turn it on. Yeah, so and I do have the uh fire tv cube which in theory you can instruct
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.580]   But
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:52.660]   I don't know it doesn't seem to be as reliable as just well first you turn on the satellite box
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:58.660]   Then you turn on the av receiver. No, that's why you need that. So that's where the logitech harmony
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.700]   I have a harmony hub. I know
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:06.980]   How can you set it up yet? It doesn't I have and it's a pain in the ass. It doesn't work
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.180]   mine
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:14.900]   I just say ask matt on a or ask google to turn on with google you have to say ask harmony to turn on television
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:20.660]   No, actually you don't because you can create a routine that says turn on television. No, we just say turn on television. It turns on
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.860]   Then we use a roku controller to control the
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:30.420]   See that's the problem is it doesn't get you all the way there. You can't just say I want to watch game of thrones
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:36.660]   Oh, you can you just need to have so for that you need to have a chromecast in google assistant or you need to have
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:43.780]   A fire tv stick and amazon echo see see this is why living in one ecosystem
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.940]   Is a lovely and enticing thing for mortals? Yeah
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.700]   I'll let you guys right you have to get your television on so you'd have to say hey google or hey a
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.420]   Turn on television and then you'd say hey a or hey google
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:03.860]   Watch game of thrones give this guy a plug in your on your newsletter. It's called
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.140]   Pickstruction's it's only iOS right now archer smith llc
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.860]   And it's really just one guy he wrote the whole thing and I think it's a really clever idea
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.020]   That's cute. Yeah, isn't that a great idea how to clean the breville team maker
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.420]   who
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.380]   Who's right
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:30.020]   Yeah, this is why I really don't really automate that much because I feel like it's just
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:34.100]   It's hard. I have I have an ech a
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:39.380]   Logitech harmony hub. I guess I could try setting it up the problem is I'd have
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.100]   We have many tv tv
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:49.060]   Stations in the house sets we call them sets. No, no, it's not just a set. It's a whole thing
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:53.700]   Including furniture. I think of them more as
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:24:01.860]   Kind of a station like that you you would go to your the tv station not a channel, but like uh, you know
[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:06.100]   A kiosk it's a tv their tv kiosks throughout the home
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.820]   There are two of you and how many tv's
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:14.180]   Well, we just put one in the bedroom. There's one in lisa's office. There's one in the gym
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.220]   There's one in the living room. There's one in my den. There's one in the game room
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.140]   How many is that?
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:24.260]   It's a lot of rooms six. I don't know. Yeah, we got Lisa money here. We have one television
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:29.700]   Yeah, you really I it's almost embarrassed is almost it is embarrassing to admit honestly
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:37.460]   Uh, yeah, I remember a cable guy saying you got how many yeah, it's kind of but you're a former tv critic. You have an excuse
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.660]   I did i'm a former geek
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:45.860]   So so yeah, the other day I get home from my trip
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:51.460]   And uh, i'm washing tv one of the rooms and it won't work. I can't go on and i'm thinking i have to go buy tv tonight
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.460]   Of course two new batteries
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.420]   Or you could just buy a new tv
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:02.180]   Um, yeah, we don't normally we were against adverse to the notion of a television in the bedroom
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.820]   We solve that problem. You can't watch it from the bed
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:10.580]   Well, that's so where do you watch it? Do you have like chairs at your bedroom? What?
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.580]   Yeah, there's a little
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:17.140]   Why why would you watch tv in the bedroom? And then the bed is in a different part of the bedroom
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:22.100]   That's like torturing yourself. You have too many tv's and maybe too much house
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.900]   You know, I think you live in the good place
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:30.260]   Oh, it's kind of like the good place. It's term. It is. It's a big house. Uh, there are three of us
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.420]   There's a teenager as well, but um, okay, well, they they need at least five rooms
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:41.060]   It's a kind of a mikmanchin. I'll be honest with you and uh, and uh, I think it's almost 5,000 square feet
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:45.300]   So there's you can't you need we have a little golf cart to get around it's nice
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.020]   but anyway
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:48.980]   Uh
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.820]   James will you carry me upstairs?
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.940]   No, it's flat. That's the beauty of it. One of the things one of the goals was no stairs
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.660]   So you have a golf cart that you ride around
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.180]   What's always joking?
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.940]   And you ever used a scooter inside that it's a segue actually
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.940]   It's a little segue
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:12.420]   Dear
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:16.260]   Uh, no, actually I just sit on the room, but we have the room is set up to go
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:24.660]   Um back and forth like a little shuttle. It's a it's a room of shuttle and so I'll just sit on the room, but it'll take me segues electric by
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.300]   We do have a lot of electric vehicles
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.580]   We have a significant number of electric vehicles as well
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.220]   but none of them are in house
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.740]   Wow, okay
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.740]   Uh
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.140]   In fact, I watched the game of thrones
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:46.420]   The uh, the episode three the dark one. No spoilers. No
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:51.140]   Once there's a thing. I ruined it on sunday. I actually did spoil it by accident. We cut that out
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:57.620]   Uh, it was in that it was a slip of the but I did watch it on a number of different televisions to get an idea
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:03.220]   Of if it was too dark or if it was the tv and I did find a perfect tv for watching it
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:09.700]   So that's what our stern was screaming about that. It was very dark just just had a fit
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:14.900]   Well, and then last got out the name of the director and and and and docked them and went crazy
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:19.380]   It was just the stream the stream was bad. The stream was bad. Yeah, I was gonna say it's not your tv
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.300]   It's your codec and how they were compressed
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.380]   It was the tv too because the tv was doing some scaling up scaling on it
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.780]   So the 4k tv actually did a very bad job of upscaling the tennedy p
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.820]   um
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:39.780]   Anyway, I have been enjoying game of thrones apparently the the new thing if you're cool and with it is to disc game of thrones
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:46.820]   Paris martin. Oh did this on twitter a few expect I stopped watching when they uh departed from the canon of the books
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:53.140]   And because I feel that they haven't lived up to george rr martin's original vision
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.580]   He's not done with this original vision. You can't live up to it
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.020]   Well, that's why they stopped and so that's one of the things fact
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.460]   There's a great meme on reddit. Maybe you can find this. I can't find it a karsten
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:08.260]   Where they have the uh seasons of game of thrones and it starts with a beautifully drawn
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:14.820]   Horse's tail and then by the end of my season eight. It's like a four-year-old
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.340]   in the fox head and in the years on it
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:26.980]   Um everybody everybody's a critic with game of thrones, but I am enjoying it. I am enjoying it. Um, that's all i'm gonna say i'm enjoying it
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.980]   It's fun
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.140]   Okay, uh, we did the iot thing
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:35.780]   Uh
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:41.700]   How about that easy the coolest thing I saw at google i.o
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.580]   Andrew giv heart writes
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.500]   Is a tiny chip that could eliminate smart home leg?
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.700]   Okay, we have to level set here because I don't know Andrew giv heart
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:58.980]   This is not a story about a chip. This is a story about a software development kit that's sitting on a module
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:04.420]   So Andrew Andrew Andrew, please an sdk is not a chip
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:10.340]   So I think he may be confused because google at google i.o. Did something very cool. They announced a
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.100]   What are they called?
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.620]   Home sdk
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:18.420]   There's two things so I think what's confusing him and we'll talk about the sdk in a second
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:24.660]   But they announced basically a module that has the ability it's got all the radios. It's pre certified
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.500]   Ties you back into google. It's hard way. It's a module. We'll wait though
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:33.940]   On it is the local sdk, but this the hardware they announced
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.220]   Is very similar to amazon's
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.860]   Uh, oh gosh, ac
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.020]   uh, elixir connect kit
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:48.580]   So they did that in september and that's basically like so you could just throw this pre certified module into anything and build
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:53.620]   Something that works with the batamet. So azure has something microsubs or something like that as well, right?
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.180]   But it's more security focused
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:03.540]   They have so they have a module that's pre certified to work with their uh project azure sphere, but that is security focused
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.860]   Um, it doesn't have voice focus
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:11.860]   Voice it seems like a good idea because there are a lot of small chinese iot manufacturers
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.060]   Who don't have the wherewithal to do it right for one thing
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:19.940]   Uh, okay. Yes on the security thing are we moving to security or you want to help?
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.660]   Well, but it's related isn't it? Uh, maybe not. I maybe this is
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.700]   No, I mean, that's a pretty common thing to do is to say hey
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:30.020]   I'm gonna put all the functionality. I mean, it's kind of like what a reference design has been historically
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.140]   It's also what your smartphone is is this could call a system on a chip
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.700]   Everything is in this so see
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.580]   Uh, okay, so a little bit different
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:44.340]   Um, not everything you need for a smartphone is on it's more like if they gave you
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:49.060]   the soc for your computing, which is what's on your smartphone
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:56.660]   And they also did the radios and all the things to make of make it a it does for some but not everything
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:01.140]   And it doesn't obviously you're gonna customize it. You're gonna do more to it, but
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.780]   Qualcomm's socs are
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.980]   A pretty complete package. Is this like that?
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.620]   No for iot no
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.260]   No a system on a chip. It has
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.580]   It can have the radios, but it doesn't always have the radios. It just means you have this
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:22.980]   You have like your memory and your processing power and your networking and everything is already on there and in
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.700]   packaged
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:32.660]   On a single chip when we talk about a module that is a couple of chips packaged together. So what we're talking about here are modules, which is
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:38.580]   The compute power. It's probably got a accelerator for like language processing. Maybe I don't know
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.060]   um, it's got and then it's
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:47.460]   In the amazon case and I assume in the google case the radios are all pre certified with the fcc
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.940]   and any agencies where you
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:55.700]   Offer the service so you can literally just throw this in a device. There's no come
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.100]   There's nothing you need to do on the outside
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:04.260]   Um, and it would have like the microphones. It would have things like that also on it, but soc doesn't have a little
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:10.580]   No, no, so this is much more complete than an soc. Yes, but what would I add? It's like a board. Okay
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.980]   You might add if you wanted like an extra microphone you could add that or if you wanted
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:19.460]   I mean some people don't add anything some people are like i'm building a clock and I want it to be an
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:23.060]   Clock and they just pop that in is it for end users or is it?
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:26.340]   No, it's for developers. It's for people who want to build products
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:31.620]   Okay that work with this and it think about like with iot if you want to build if you're a lampmaker
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:35.140]   And you're really good at building lamps. You just put this in here and now you've got a lamp
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.500]   So it turns any conventional device into an internet of things device
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:43.300]   Yeah, I mean you have to have a microphone and speaker stuff that's also attached to it
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.020]   Well, no, I think it includes all that
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.500]   Yes, the chip does but you still have to have
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:54.660]   I mean you have to design for the image to put a speaker on a microphone on as well. Yes, sorry
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.260]   I'm like there's that there's a lot here. Anyway, um
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:05.460]   But what he's talking about in this story and it is really cool is an SDK a software development kit that is part of this module
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:10.020]   I think I don't again you still need the module. This is just the software control
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:14.100]   This is the software in anyone you don't have to have the module to have the SDK
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:19.300]   I could actually build a connected device not using the module run the local home SDK
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:26.100]   And basically what google's home device will do is it looks for that and will send all of your commands
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:32.820]   Locally if possible and that just means it's going to be faster in your home you faster resolution between command and action
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.060]   And then afterwards it's going to report the state back up to the cloud
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:41.300]   And it defaults to local but goes to the cloud if the local isn't available
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.860]   It's it's it's it's software. It's like writing a library basically
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:52.980]   And it's a way of these companies amazon google whoever else does such a thing to kind of get you to use their stuff
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:56.580]   And and make it work with google just make it super easy
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:02.980]   Which is really important in iot because they're not tech people necessarily building this stuff, right?
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:11.540]   So the google assistant sdk let's you add hot word detection voice control natural language understanding and google smarts
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:15.540]   I e I guess ai to your project
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.580]   Whatever it is so your project
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:23.380]   Which will include the hardware module or not but it will have a microphone for instance
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:29.140]   It'll capture an audio request like what's on my calendar and sends it to the sdk
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:34.340]   Which then interfaces with the google assistant google assistant sends back a spoken audio response
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:38.020]   Which you then render on your built-in speaker that you included
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:46.660]   And kevin says he's they're seeing 300 milliseconds latency with local home. Holy cow. That's super fast. Yeah, that's amazing
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:56.020]   Uh, there is a it's a raspberry pie if you want you could use a raspberry pie or any linux arm or linux x86 architecture o bun to desktop
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:00.420]   Uh, that's pretty cool. It uses python as the interface language
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:05.940]   It does support hands-free activation in other words. It understands okay
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:12.820]   Uh, that was that was sufficient to activate mine. So I guess i'm sorry. I apologize
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:16.580]   Now I know I could say okay, i'm gonna activate my phone
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.900]   um
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:23.220]   Audio capture and playback built in and if you have again that hardware module would do that
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.020]   conversational state management
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.860]   Timers and alarms playback of podcasts and news
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.900]   We could build a little twit device
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:37.380]   Yes, you could you could build oh you could build a connected bobble head leo
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:43.620]   Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no stacey stacey. You know what we must build
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:51.140]   Uh, queso a crock pot that punchy. So, uh, the time we say okay punch leo
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:54.180]   Oh nice
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:59.620]   But we'll see that our challenge there is the servo to actually do the punch. It's not the voice command
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.580]   No, we know how we know how to make it work and uh, oh, okay
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:07.540]   I've just paid I've paid a burk twice what you offered him to keep him from building it
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:14.020]   I have a standing offer for all our engineers whenever anybody asks you to build such a thing
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.260]   I will pay you twice what they offer
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:23.940]   It has visual output via html5 of assistant responses when you oh no, that's the service not the library
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.660]   This is pretty uh pretty nifty
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.620]   So if you have a raspberry pie, you can play with it right now
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:34.580]   Yeah, see there's that you don't need a chip don't need this chip
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.500]   But and again end users can or cannot buy the google
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:46.580]   What are they what do they call the google the module? Um, oh, let me get the right words. Um, they gave it away at
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.420]   Oh man
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:53.540]   But they're gonna it's gonna be available later and it's called google assistant connect
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.620]   So gak
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.700]   Good you went to that secret session you got it
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:03.220]   I guess so I don't know I didn't go to the I didn't go to IO because I was doing something else last week
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.700]   Which makes me so sad
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:12.900]   Um, Kevin just sent me the link to the local technologies for the smart home google IO 19 video on youtube
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:20.340]   So I I'm not on the uh chat so I can't put it in the chat. Sorry. All it's not loading for some reason. That's okay
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:26.020]   Um, that's cool. I want but so do you think they'll ever oh jeez louise
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.060]   It is working
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.060]   Is that my friend manual punch
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:34.660]   I love it
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.660]   Apparently burky is working on it
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:41.140]   I told you I'd pay you twice what stacy's paying like nothing you can pay
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:45.700]   Here's nothing state nothing leo can offer him that stacy can't top
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.420]   I was gonna say my my cheery
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.860]   On call fella stay on call you will be called upon
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.340]   My new ways
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:57.220]   I want to buy this thing though. I want a gak
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.260]   Um, I think you have to wait till october
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:04.660]   And then the local home sdk will be in developer preview soon
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:09.620]   As per kevin so it's not available yet, but then you can download it onto a pie or something like that
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:10.500]   Yeah
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:15.140]   And does it google actually has their they have their any a n y
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:20.020]   Um, and they have a google assistant any but I don't know how that fits in with any of this
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:26.500]   Um, and those were they had a computer vision one and a voice activated one and they were like how you could play with some of google's
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.220]   NLP technology and then
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:36.660]   You know, I mean I bought the amazon racer the little car that amazon is offering. It's not it'll come in a couple of months
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:41.780]   It's a lower level thing. Yeah, I understand but i'm just saying this is a good thing to encourage
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:48.020]   Hobbyists and people you know to experiment with it especially kids high school kids and
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.740]   The like to experiment with it. They should they should make these sort of available
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:57.540]   Sell them on the aid of fruit or something. They just announced it. I mean, right?
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:02.020]   Maybe they will maybe they will or they'll kill it after a few months and we'll never know
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.540]   It's google. Who knows
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.780]   a great, but you know, that's a great way
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.900]   So a bunch of michaels
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:18.820]   Teenage friends they're all sophomores in high school have come to me and said we want to learn programming help us learn how to code
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:25.300]   And so I've agreed somehow to figure out a way to do this like every friday will meet and we'll we'll do something
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.060]   and
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:31.460]   Honestly, the best way to do something like that is to have some piece of hardware
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:37.540]   That they can attempt to write something actually that we talked about last week. That's what kevin elkins
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.180]   Thing is for younger kids
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:45.860]   Do they want to code or do they want to play with like an Arduino because those I mean they want to code I could get an argue
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:49.060]   We know they want to code, but I just think that's it's a lot easier
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:53.700]   It's less abstract you can teach some of your code. It's less abstract if you're coding and something does something
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.740]   But but you're right we could absolutely
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:01.380]   In fact what I'm thinking of doing is sitting down and we're gonna watch harvard's
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:07.060]   CS50 their introductory computing science class, which is online for free at edx.org
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:11.540]   And uh watch the video every friday night and then we'll do the assignments through the week
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:15.460]   And then i'm thinking of just doing that that would take some of the onus off me
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:19.780]   And I think they're smart kids. They're at least as smart as a harvard freshman, right karsten
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:26.740]   When you're a freshman you're really not that bright. No, you're not that's you're not that bright when you graduate
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:29.700]   Well, I don't know about that
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:30.820]   um
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:36.980]   After a long wait sonos is readying the google assistant update for next week. So if you've got uh one of the more new
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:40.900]   Like a sonos one or the sonos beam
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:45.380]   Oh, it's today you could uh may 14th
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:51.780]   This moment this this moment in time. So uh, I have a sonos one at home
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.100]   I bought uh the sonos
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:58.900]   Not the beam, but the other one that when that's because it's under the tv. I wonder if that's beam like
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:04.180]   Isn't that the beam or is that the soundbar? That's the sound beam is a little soundbar
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.820]   the little soundbar, but then they also have the
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:11.380]   The one that's like you put the but I think it's probably just a beam in a box
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.540]   So that's cool. So buying sonos
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.900]   You know somebody asked me should I buy sonos and I feel like
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.140]   Sonos is over
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:26.340]   Honestly, we just sold our sonos amps for a pretty chunk of money not as much money as we paid for them
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:31.860]   But I was I was surprised but I would you recommend somebody's buying new sonos? Obviously not you got rid of yours
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:36.420]   Well, I got rid of mine because I I moved out of my house with the in
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:42.420]   ceiling speakers. Oh, I didn't need to drive them anymore. Um, but probably I
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:50.420]   The sonos ones are nice kevin actually reviewed the sonos one google implementation. He discovered that
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.620]   Um, you can't you can only pick one
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:58.020]   It's like the highlander. You can only have one you can't have both echo and google
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.580]   No, you have to choose one when you set it up
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:05.780]   That's a bummer now you can go back in afterwards and set it up. They could change your mind
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.500]   It's a software defined preference
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.820]   interesting
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:15.300]   I thought it was um, so there's maybe a little maybe a limitation of the
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:22.980]   To be your computational power available for listening for the wake word, but it but they designed it for that
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:26.500]   So I don't think that would be it actually see I think I just bought a play base
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.980]   for for our new tv kiosk
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:33.940]   And uh, I don't think it's I think it's more like the old one not the new one
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:39.060]   That's gonna be a bummer. I do have a sonos one though in my closet
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:44.580]   Along with the echo spot. So I can I can have a conversation with both
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:48.980]   I'm a very busy closet
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:55.220]   I'm an idiot. I'm just saying uh out loud
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.460]   uh
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:04.340]   Oh, we should mention this just in real briefly that if you bought the titan
[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:06.340]   security key
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:08.340]   to secure your google stuff
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:14.740]   You might want to replacement google's now announced that the titan security key can be exploited
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.940]   And they are offering a replacement version
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:22.740]   There's a misconfiguration on the titan security key pairing protocol
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:27.380]   This affects the battery powered fob not the physical usb key
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:32.900]   Of course you get them both in a bundle if an attacker is physically close to you within 30 feet
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:36.900]   Uh, they can communicate with your security key
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.580]   Well, that's not seems kind of obvious
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.540]   That's well. I mean
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:47.700]   That's that could be anything from a radio exploit to i mean bluetooth is not
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:52.180]   Not notoriously secure. It is not it relies. I mean it's
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:58.980]   Threw up until iot though the risk model was that a you weren't using it quite as much and b
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:02.500]   It was you had to be physically close, but now it's everywhere
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:06.420]   Oh, and it also has to be at the moment of pairing although
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:10.740]   It used to be that most devices paired kind of more automatically than they do today
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:17.700]   Uh the the scenario is the attacker uh in close enough to you within 30 feet could use their device to masquerade as your
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:22.580]   Security key connects to your device the moment you're asked to press the button on your key
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:24.580]   So it's kind of an intercept
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:29.940]   After that they could attempt to change their device to appear as a bluetooth keyboard or mouse and then take actions on your device
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.900]   So this would be something like in a coffee shop. You'd have to be careful
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:38.660]   Uh also the other the hackers convention or it don't take it don't take it to the hackers convention
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.820]   Don't you take your ub key to death gun
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:45.140]   Or not ub key your type of security safe. Yeah, it's the bluetooth the belle key
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:50.740]   Um when you're trying to sign into an account on your device, you're normally asked to press the button on the security key to activate it
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:57.300]   Uh again a nearby attacker can potentially connect their own device to your affected security key before your own connects
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:01.540]   And in this case the device the i attacker could sign into your account using their device
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:07.700]   If the attacker somehow already obtained your username and password and could time these events exactly in other words
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:13.620]   It's a tough it's not an easy hack still google is offering uh replacements
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:19.060]   So if you're using the bluetooth titan security key mighty big at google get the replacement
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:25.300]   Um, yeah, what was I gonna was gonna point to something
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:29.380]   Do you I actually want your opinion on this one
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:35.780]   Uh buzzfeed had a uh shocked i'm shocked article about sof
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:40.980]   YouTube's newest far right foul mouth red pilling star is a 14 year old girl
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.940]   Uh, it said oh whatever you do don't go watch her videos
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.660]   uh
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:53.300]   But actually they said don't imagine it watch it. It's already here
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:57.460]   Uh, she says she's a comedian. I watched them. She's very funny
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.660]   But if you didn't know that it was tongue in cheek
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:04.820]   It'd be a little scary. I know it's a it's kind of profanity laden
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.980]   I'm not sure
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.820]   Well, we can blue. Oh
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.460]   Well, look at that this video has been removed for violating youtube's policy and hate news
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:19.700]   So I thought she was kind of funny. She's it's the kind of humor a high school sophomore
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:24.660]   Which she is a very very smart high school sophomore might
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:28.340]   Do to mock, you know the current
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.820]   zeitgeist
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:37.700]   Um, and she says some hateful things, you know, but uh hateful in satire. I think yes
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:45.220]   So, um, does she read any presidential tweets? No, she does not sorry
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:49.060]   Um
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:52.900]   So you haven't seen it so and now you can't so never mind I can't
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.500]   um
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:59.540]   What buzzfeed is saying and I think this is not wrong. Joseph brin steins reporting
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:05.220]   Is that this is the kind of video that exists and gets promoted on youtube
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.940]   and
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:15.940]   And she by the way has 800 000 subscribers. So she's clearly benefited from you know, uh automatic promotion of her videos
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:22.340]   Uh, he says it's because youtube deliberately ignores toxic content as a growth strategy
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:28.500]   Soaf scripts which she says she writes with a collaborator are familiar a mix of hatred towards muslims
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:34.980]   anti-black racism bizantine fear mongering about pedophilia tissue thin in cell evolutionary psychology
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:40.580]   And reflexive misanthropy that could have been copied and pasted from 1000 different forchan posts
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:46.500]   Of course, it's all presented in the terminally ironic style popularized by boundary pushing comedy groups
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:52.340]   Like the influential million dollar extreme and adoptive late by white supremacist mass shooters in christ church in san diego
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:56.180]   What it seems to me is the de what it points up is the difficulty
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:48:03.620]   For anybody especially youtube of figuring out is this satire parody or real
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:09.860]   So so watch out here comes a jeff spiel. What's up? I knew that's why i brought this up. I wanted to jeff spiel
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:12.420]   Here comes it so I spent
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:16.260]   Uh last week after I left you in la for my get ready
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:21.140]   Transatlantic high-level working group on content moderation and freedom of expression
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:24.340]   Oh, that sounds
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:29.460]   Well, it's actually fascinating. It's actually very take it a badge and then and then yeah, no idea. No, I need a sash
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:36.340]   On the transatlantic working group out of the way. I want you to add it to lower third and member of
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:43.140]   Yes, so then then yesterday was yesterday what this but this is exactly this stuff. I presume you deal with
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:48.100]   Yeah, it is so then then two more things about this. So I was in I was in the senate
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:51.140]   on on tuesday
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:58.020]   uh meeting with a senator and various members of congress on on similar issues and I was and then today I interviewed
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:02.820]   The vice president of safety for facebook at a facebook safety
[00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:06.660]   Conference so I've been on this stuff a lot lately
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:13.060]   And there's a new concept is entered by head. It's very hard to get it in there. It takes some it takes a major mallet to get it in there
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:16.740]   But in the discussion of the high-level working group
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.260]   um
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:20.900]   Not just a working group a high level working group
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.540]   um
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:25.540]   I've come to be convinced that
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:30.660]   One should note should not regulate content but should instead regulate behavior
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:40.100]   Now that I didn't that made it. I like that. No, I like that because that solves this free speech problem
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:46.420]   Well, it doesn't solve it doesn't wait, you know, it's still the fire shouting fight a fire in a crowded theater
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:53.460]   Uh, it's still the troubling one, right? But um, right but but pass that I mean if you're if you're trying to regulate his beach
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:59.700]   It gives you kind of a bright mind. It does. So so so one of the one of the constructs in this group was
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:05.220]   abc actors behavior content and where do you where do you tackle it could be actors?
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:08.980]   You could say, you know extremists. We want to get rid of them, but that's hard
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:13.300]   It could be content, but just in this case, you know trying to judge the content itself
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:18.900]   Whereas if you go after behavior and say that there is uh evidence of an effort to
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:27.860]   Uh falsify manipulate the form of the formation of public opinion by these nasty means and mechanisms that you go after their behavior
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:32.100]   and um so so so the problem with um
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:36.180]   The german law about hate speech is you've got to define the content
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:40.020]   And the problem is the company has to do it. The government doesn't the court stone do it
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:45.860]   The problem with where the uk government is going with its online harm's report is to say that the content is harmful
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.540]   Well, all right. Let me give you an example and see how your abc model works
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:56.420]   So among other things and this may have been the one that got her pulled down
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:59.860]   So
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:02.100]   Again, this is a 14 year old
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.180]   Uh middle schooler
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:06.820]   making these videos
[00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:12.100]   Uh when you're gonna mess with her in the lunchroom when youtube deactivated comments on her videos
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:18.420]   Uploaded a 12 minute video in which she said susan referring to youtube ceo susan wojiske
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:23.380]   Susan i've known your address since last summer. I've got a lugar and a mitocondrial disease
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.900]   I don't care if I live. Why should I care if you live or your children?
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:31.460]   I just called an uber you've got about seven minutes to draft up a will i'm coming for you
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:35.220]   It ain't gonna be pretty now that sounds like a death threat
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:40.740]   Yeah, i'm sure because youtube gets those and someone actually came into their heads
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.460]   orders that
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:47.940]   But I think it's probably intended as comedy. I know it is she didn't do it
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:53.060]   Where how do you how do you address that and and what's the difference between?
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:52:00.740]   Behavior and content when the behavior is posting inciting violence. Well, yeah, there's posting content
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.740]   Right, that's the behavior. That's the behavior. Not actually shooting anybody
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.540]   No kerson, uh, harvard boy
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.300]   be
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:14.900]   Hey, sorry p p p for the off air last week harson got it like three zingers on me
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:18.660]   So I don't try to get a cigarette really did it was it was amazing. He was he was whoa
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:21.860]   He was just one too. He went to that uh, dunch that we had
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:24.260]   Yeah, um
[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:28.020]   so uh, no the behavior isn't isn't as as
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.940]   um
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:34.420]   literal as that the behavior is trying to swing an election by lying to people
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:40.820]   That's a behavior, um, and it's content based but it is posted on youtube is not a behavior
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.540]   Well, what about what this what I just read to you, which seems pretty
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:47.380]   So I think I think that goes to it so so then there's two there's two layers here, right?
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:50.260]   One is terms of service and the other one is legality
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.980]   on um
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:57.860]   Terms of service. I would just say that if if you run a civilized decent service you would say
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.100]   uh
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:01.940]   Killing people is not funny
[00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:05.460]   Don't threaten it and we don't want that on our service. Yeah, so you
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:07.460]   did
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.660]   After after
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:14.500]   Being contacted by buzzfeed youtube did pull that particular video and issue her a strike
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:20.500]   But they didn't pull any of the other videos they have since obviously because I just went to see it and it's not there anymore
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:26.340]   I uh, so on may 14 and I think this is her account, uh at sewer nugget
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:33.140]   Uh, I just got another strike get on bitchoot before i'm gone
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.540]   I'll make more updates there and on patreon
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:38.660]   it's it's you know
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:42.740]   Just does it does a comedian have an obligation
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:47.060]   To stay away from anything like that
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:49.860]   Comedians go too far. Yes, they can
[00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:54.740]   Uh, now it all depends on whom you ask, right? If you watched the white house dinner last year, some people thought
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:57.220]   Uh, align was crossed. I didn't
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:03.220]   But the server here's the hard part for these services. They are they have no choice now
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:05.220]   but to make decisions like human beings
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:08.740]   And they hate doing that they don't want to do that
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:14.740]   Um, I understand why they don't want to do that, but they've got it aside this either fits that are we are the ones with the cops
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:16.740]   We're the only ones with the power to turn things on and off
[00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:19.700]   So we're gonna take this down now. Now meanwhile you have
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:28.100]   Um, I'm gonna go to a working group. No, a it was this a workshop next week on facebook's new
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:31.460]   Uh effort to create kind of an appeals court
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:34.020]   They're holding these things trying to learn how to do it
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:38.020]   Right now. Is that a cop out? Is that facebook saying somebody else should do it?
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:40.740]   It's a cop up by government. I already think his government's not doing it
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:44.260]   But there'll be some appeal structure to go to
[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:46.020]   By the way, so so
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:52.100]   Account is still there. She now has 900 000 subscribers. Yeah, so the stress and effect takes right in
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:57.140]   Um, that video is gone. So is the one that buzzfeed writes about
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:55:01.540]   Um, but you know, it's clear to me. It was clear to me
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:04.100]   to me that she is
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:07.460]   This is comedy
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:10.420]   She's 14. So maybe not fully understanding the
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:13.220]   her responsibility
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.780]   um, but
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:18.580]   It's intense as a commentary
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:24.500]   An absolute right to say we don't want jokes about killing people. It's too close to home. Sorry. You're off
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:28.820]   Service has the right to do that. Oh, there's no well. There's no question the service has the right to do whatever it wants
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:31.380]   Yeah, right. I mean clearly it can ban her
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:32.900]   So
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:39.140]   It's not just the issue of banning. I think what this buzzfeed article talks about and what's something that we're we have been talking about
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:44.180]   And should be talking about that google absol or youtube absol is the thing to think about is
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:51.220]   They've been algorithmically pushing people towards this content that helps indoctrinate other people
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:55.620]   And that's he's holding this up as an example of a way to get into that
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:56:00.980]   So it's not just regulating like what people can say and who can say what and all of that. It's that
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:02.740]   It
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:06.340]   Once you click on something like this, you get further and further down the rabbit hole
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:08.340]   It's kind of how it takes some of the issues
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:14.340]   But the intent is not I don't think soaf's intent is to indoctrinate. I think it's too uh paradise
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:20.820]   Well, which does indoctrinate right? Yeah, you start with that and then you go further
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:26.340]   It may be it be fine. I mean she may have been radicalized in order to get more and more subscribers
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:29.140]   I mean she's got hundreds of thousands of views on all our videos
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.940]   um, so she
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:35.620]   There's certainly some incentive some perverse incentive
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:40.980]   Just by her viewers to maybe go more and more radical radical
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:44.420]   I'm long on patreon is sofis grating in generation of dissidents
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:47.940]   I can you know, I was 14 once
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.740]   Many years ago and I understand
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:55.140]   There's a certain kind especially among precocious and very smart
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:58.660]   Kids and you know at that age there is a
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:00.820]   like a
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:05.300]   Screw the world kind of anarchy kind of sense of humor. I kind of get it
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:13.780]   I overdosed on merelax and now i'm terrorizing youtube from hell says repeat i think she's hysterical to be honest with you
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.660]   One of her event gen z from becoming like millennials
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:21.540]   Keep me off the streets and away from crack and be mildly entertained while the world as you know it
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:25.860]   Comically crumbles away. Please consider surrendering a couple of your presser shekels to the channel
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:30.020]   So there's a sense of humor to it. Obviously she's precocious and very bright
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:35.460]   I mean, maybe maybe you know, do we let now are we gonna
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:40.740]   Want to live in maybe we have to live in a world where there's just certain things you can't
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:46.900]   Certain boundaries you can't go out of even if your intent is pure and the comedy is there you just can't go there
[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:48.900]   You just
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.420]   You're tasteless
[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:55.700]   As my mom would say that that's not funny. That's just tasteless stacy. Yeah, but who enforces the taste
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:58.820]   Who decides who's the tastemaker? The point is
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:05.620]   You know if if you decide something's tasteless with youtube or with yeah with youtube
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:08.260]   just
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:12.260]   They don't they could decide that they could be like yeah, we don't want to be the home for that
[00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:17.140]   They're not deciding they have decided that they should decide that I think that's the point of that article
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:18.740]   Of
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:24.260]   Tastefulness decided that today with the yes, they did when they took her down. They're like oh everybody's upset about this
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:26.820]   And that's I think the issue
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:32.740]   And that's why I don't like talking about this issue because that's like asking these content providers to be an arbiter of taste in some ways
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:35.460]   If we don't have a clearly defined thing
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:42.100]   I think it's legit to talk about clearly defined rules like you are jeff with your abc or ac whatever
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:48.820]   Um, but I do think the more interesting issue and the thing that the platform should focus on is how not to
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:52.420]   To use hate as a growth generation
[00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:58.340]   Yeah, absolutely great Stacy. Yes. It's it's it's whether the platform exploits it further
[00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:03.940]   Uh or digs you in further. I agree and that's and that that is most definitely a decision by the platform itself
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:06.180]   That's the platforms activity agreed
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:09.620]   So so today I was at this this facebook thing and I asked
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:12.340]   Um the executive I was talking to
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:16.020]   Uh, you know two weeks ago or so you took down a lot of stones and ferricon
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:18.900]   Everybody asked but what what took so long what took you so long?
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:21.620]   and their argument is
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:27.060]   That this was streamed live. This is nothing secret. Their argument is that they
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:30.580]   um that they have levels of punishment
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:35.780]   And that the highest level is to is to forbid a person from coming onto the platform
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:39.380]   And that they judge off platform behavior
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:43.780]   Which kind of struck me as a little bit odd in a way
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:47.380]   that then facebook is not just a judge of
[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:52.660]   Activity on its platform, which is its full right and this is right to do whatever it wants to in any case
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:55.860]   But now it becomes a judge of your life outside
[00:59:55.860 --> 01:00:01.700]   Well, they're what they're trying to do, which is the most difficult thing of all is to judge intent
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:05.380]   And so they're using whatever data points they can find
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:09.300]   Uh, I would imagine sof is pretty much anonymous
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:13.620]   Uh, this buzzfeed reporter did apparently track her down in her father
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.860]   But uh, she her intent is clearly to be a not mostly anonymous
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:22.420]   Um, it is a challenge and I think the high level working group
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:29.300]   Has its job cut out for it. Absolutely. I like the abc. I like that. I think you know actions
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:32.020]   And there was a matrix
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:36.900]   It was actor behavior content across the top and on the left was legal and illegal
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:44.180]   And different things get picked in on each of those right the legal you've heard me do the show before a few weeks ago
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:49.380]   Uh, there's been a proposal for what is now being called an e-court, which I wrote about it length on medium
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:56.580]   Uh an internet court and that when things are in dispute legally that should be done with due process in public
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:59.380]   And that's a matter of legality when it is legal
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:03.940]   Uh, the uk harm's report once again said they wanted their platforms to get rid of
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:09.780]   Legal but harmful content, which is to say that once they tell the platform you get rid of it or else your ass is
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:11.860]   illegal
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:16.020]   That's a backdoor a backdoor illegality and that is absurd. Yeah
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:18.740]   So this challenging. I mean should patreon
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:25.700]   YouTube is not closed sof's channel, but they have taken down selectively taking down some videos her patreon pages up and
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.260]   you know, it's full of all sorts of
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:34.420]   Creepiness, it's creepy. I'll grant you that there's definitely it's what she's doing is this creepy
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:37.700]   so I was talking to people staffers at congress
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.020]   And they were arguing they were praising reddit
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.020]   To the hilt really and their argument was
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:49.460]   Uh, well, yeah, it has some weird stuff on there, but you got to look for it
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:53.620]   They're they're using reddit as an exemplar of how it should be done
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:58.420]   Yes, because they say that the the moderation comes down to each of the of the subreddits
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:04.260]   But also read it will pull stuff that's really reprehensible reddit will you really really repress? Yeah
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.980]   really
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.780]   Interesting so I don't know the reddit is a great model
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:18.100]   The other issue to think about all this is that no, I don't know if you saw this. Oh, this is this is actually so france announced a new regulatory regime
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.980]   um three days ago
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:23.300]   And the guy who created it
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:29.140]   Was is in the high-level working group and was kind of influenced by our our talk and so I was with him in congress as well
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:31.380]   Ben wallu trail
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.380]   brilliant wonderful guy
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:35.620]   and um
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:40.500]   So the way that france is is constructing this regulator is that they're not going to go after
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:44.420]   They're not going to try to change content on a platform. They think that's wrong
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:48.660]   They think they think the platform is media. I can argue with them about that and they don't want to but they don't want to
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:49.940]   um
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:52.100]   manipulate or manage or edit media
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:55.140]   Instead what they want to do is get accountability
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:57.860]   and transparency and so
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:04.100]   Their view of regulation is they go for the platforms and tell them they have to have as we've discussed in the show before a
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:09.860]   Standard that they set with the public each each one can be different. Yeah, uh, that makes sense
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:12.100]   And then you must provide
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.980]   They have to adhere to it. They have to provide data to the
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.260]   um
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:23.140]   regulator and the regulator has a stick and if they are if they fail at their obligation or if they fail at the transparency
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:28.820]   Stick over him. It's the analog of a privacy policy except it's an acceptable speech policy
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:34.180]   But it's enforced the same way kind of two things about this one is that
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:40.500]   Uh, the regulator did a six month or about a four month role-playing exercise
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:44.340]   with facebook so they were kind of embedded in facebook
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:47.380]   uh where they
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.380]   um
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.380]   Had a small team on both
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:54.980]   Uh, their facebook exact today said that they had called it a pizza team
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:04:00.660]   You know, the standard thing and no no more people than could eat one pizza. I said it should be called a quiche team
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:06.660]   Uh, and and and so they role played without the regulation behind it
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.220]   But what what were the relationship be like? What were the process be like?
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:13.300]   What were they going after and that yielded this fairly sensible regulation
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:18.740]   And listen to me saying that listen to me. I don't say that very often. Well, I would it's good
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:21.620]   Let's find means to create sensible regulations
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.260]   Um, that actually does sound pretty good if
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.820]   How could youtube be more like reddit in that?
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.460]   Regulators they would have
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:32.900]   Uh in in in their view and I don't agree with this but in in the
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:35.220]   Correctional staff for his view they would have
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:41.780]   Subcommunities that have moderators some power moderators and power over that so it's not just one model
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:47.780]   No, I have to say what Stacy was saying a minute ago. Do you want one singular model if to make singular decisions for all?
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:53.620]   That's where we are with youtube and facebook you could the big difference to me between youtube and reddit
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:57.780]   Is the recommendation engine? I mean reddit has horrible stuff
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:02.500]   As he as you pointed out he said well, but you don't see it it's hidden away in the corners
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:06.900]   And if it gets too horrible, well, bana, but there's lots of stuff that's you know, just borderline
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:10.180]   YouTube could do the same thing the the problem we have
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:13.540]   We keep breaking up bringing up is the recommendation engine
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:17.700]   Well, it's it's people versus letting a computer do it
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:22.980]   No, but if they didn't recommend extremist stuff, it would just kind of die away, wouldn't it?
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:28.260]   Well, if you if you had people or moderators who actually recommended content
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:31.860]   You would probably get more appropriate content. So if I go look up
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:35.300]   Something about vaccines like i'm a kid doing a report
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:39.460]   I probably if a person's picking my next video
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:44.660]   It's probably you know, maybe it's the life history of louis pester or something like that versus like
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:48.500]   I don't vaccines cause autism twitter is now
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:52.260]   fighting a vaccine misinformation by redirecting
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.740]   people who search for
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:57.540]   vaccine tweets to
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:04.820]   Opposed from the united states department of health and human services and vaccines dot gov
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:10.900]   Know the facts they say before you be sure make sure you get the best information on vaccinations
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.900]   From the u.s. Department of health and human services. That's kind of an interesting way to
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:17.620]   To handle that, right?
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:22.900]   Yeah, I mean, but there's always going to be people, you know, there's that whole contingent of people who are like
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:27.780]   Well, the government of course doesn't want to tell us that they're responsible for chemtrails. We know that
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:30.820]   so um
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.180]   I honestly
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:35.140]   What what would be what if you two got rid of recommendations?
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:37.620]   Would that really harm their business?
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:42.900]   Well, but here's the problem leo that my complaint with youtube is a user is that I can't find anything on it
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:47.140]   So I actually their recommendations just aren't very good
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.140]   Some shit
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.020]   That's interesting
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:53.060]   Facebook's recommendations are much better and by the way again
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:54.660]   I say I say this again and again and again
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:59.700]   I go down my facebook and I don't find a single Nazi or a bad thing on it. I find good stuff
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:02.580]   I'm on there a lot. I follow a lot of people. It's all
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:07.380]   Good. What if though is if I mean it's up to creators
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:10.180]   to find a way to market themselves
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:17.140]   Do they I mean, I don't know what if they what if it feels like youtube sticks its thumb on the scale
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:20.020]   and and in doing so
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:22.180]   brings a lot of burden on itself
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:28.980]   Or it's just worse or it's just it's just it's it's so simplistic that it says oh you like fire
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:32.100]   Uh, i'll give you night 11. Yeah
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:35.460]   Well, and they also tend I mean as part of their engagement things
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:39.380]   I know that people were looking and they send you to longer and longer content, right?
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:44.020]   And I will say, you know, well done service journalism or well done informative content
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:49.380]   Some of that is designed to be consumed quickly because people probably don't want the nitty nitty gritty
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:54.580]   They just want to understand something right? Well, algorithmic recommendations are always going to do the wrong thing
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:57.460]   I think in the long run because they're going to optimize for profit
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:00.740]   Well, no, no because they're going to optimize for engagement and profit
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:06.900]   You they don't have to though. That's the beauty of an algorithm. You couldn't you could optimize for
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.460]   Having someone walk away
[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:14.340]   Better informed like i'm able to take a test on this topic and get a higher score
[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:17.860]   You could actually build a system that optimize for that
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:22.020]   But we don't because why not we're going to make money. Oh, okay
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:25.060]   So the problem is capitalism
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:27.140]   Well
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:31.220]   The problem is and you could even you could also optimize in a secondary
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:37.380]   You know, maybe you optimize for engagement, but you dump things that don't lead to a better informed consumer
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:42.660]   We just we haven't gotten that sophisticated yet like for I know we feel like we're smart at AI
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:46.980]   But it's a really blunt instrument right now to be like this is how we make money
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:52.180]   Thus this is a particular thing. You think the platforms are working hard to make make it work
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:55.780]   Right now. I think they're having those discussions. I mean, it's hard to know
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:01.940]   How to do something in a way that's realistic because they they also have to do this in a way that's cheap
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:08.100]   I think to implement I think mark zuckerberg is probably at this point if he's telling his team anything is
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.420]   Let's figure out how to optimize
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:16.500]   Not for profit or maximizing engagement, but for some other value
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:22.260]   What whatever it is whether it's your value to be become way better informed or
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:29.540]   If you shift to privacy or is basically about building services a layer for services to happen on the platform
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:34.340]   Then what you're looking at is his optimization strategy will change
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:37.940]   actually my favorite
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:40.580]   Suggestion
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:42.580]   for facebook that i've seen
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:43.780]   Yet
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:50.420]   And we we talked about christu's saying it's time to break them up and of course many democratic candidates are starting to think about this
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.700]   uh comes from john conch josh constein at
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:57.220]   Tech crunch he says it's it's simple
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:04.500]   Just require facebook to let you export your social graph your friends list
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:08.500]   Fount portability is the must have to well
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:15.220]   The thing is the thing that keeps people from trying to write a facebook competitor is oh it's because you don't have that I say right?
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:21.380]   I can't export my friend graph to that new thing. Okay, so so I like that's that's the word press model
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:24.660]   The there is there is an open source something
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:29.220]   Upon which others can build and facebook because the advantage of being the first to build but I can build it too
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:33.780]   Yeah, go ahead. It sounds like kick remember when kick was like export your friend graph
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:39.700]   I mean like what if I don't want to be on your new social network you can't you can't make me no no no no stacy
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.860]   but but all I want to do is
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:44.660]   Give me my friends
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:49.860]   Right, but as a friend of someone maybe I don't want to be well you don't and then I would send you an invite saying
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:54.100]   I'd like to invite you to my new i'm leaving facebook but I found something better
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:11:01.540]   So I get those all the time and I think that's I don't know that that's really the answer. I guess is what i'm saying. I mean
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:05.860]   There's I mean how many times do you get invited to like the next
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:12.420]   Linked in or the next whatever for through people's contacts. I mean that's kind of what this is
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:20.500]   And if I'm I'm not trying to be up to so i'm i'm genuinely like I just don't understand why they think here's why I like it
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:24.100]   First of all, it's something that can be easily done with governmental regulation
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:30.420]   To the technology that exists without as far as I could tell any hazard. It's merely giving
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:34.020]   It's giving every user of facebook
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:38.900]   Some of the information that is in their account, which right now they can easily extract
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:41.140]   um
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:47.540]   He says the ftc must require facebook to offer truly interoperable data portability for the social graph
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:54.020]   Government should pass regulations forcing facebook to let you export your friendless to other social networks and a privacy safe
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:59.940]   Way the social graph on facebook is not your contact list. They say you're it's more than that
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:05.380]   My contact right or maybe not. Maybe your contact list is that social graph
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:09.540]   Well, it's it's their posts and that sort of thing as well. I assume
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:14.660]   Um, I don't think it includes well it could include content, but I don't think it has to
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:21.060]   I think the his thinking and my thinking would be to include well it would need to include enough so that
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.460]   I could go to another platform
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:33.540]   So what is what is makes what it makes facebook an insurmountable wall what gives them an insurmountable advantage
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:38.340]   Uh, all my friends are on it. That's what you say, but
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:45.860]   Well, it's sorry. Stay. Stay. Sorry. But your friends are actually on it. So if you really want to make something competitive what you do is you create some sort of like
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:51.140]   Uh jabber protocol for your social network updates and then anyone could actually
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:55.940]   Create a social network update on whatever format or not format. Sorry platform
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:00.580]   They choose and post it and then if I want to be your friend on my own
[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:02.340]   personal
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:06.340]   Email client or social network client that I could pull in all the relevant data
[01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:10.500]   And we don't have to be on the same platform. That would make it truly interoperable
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:14.020]   But that's not what they're talking about. But if I don't participate
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:18.580]   Then I don't understand how having your social graph if I'm in your social graph
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:22.580]   But you can't see me or my information and I don't want to be on your platform. It doesn't matter
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:25.860]   Well, then you don't want to be my friend and so then that's fine
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:29.140]   No, I mean seriously
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:32.260]   No, it just means I don't want to be your friend on a social net on that social
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:34.260]   To be our friend
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:38.420]   I don't want to be anyone Facebook definitely sees this as a threat because they have such a thing
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:44.180]   It's called find friends, but that is they've blocked competitors from using it twitter vine voxer message me
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:47.060]   Uh, they block
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:50.660]   Well, do you think it's two professors have written about this
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:54.740]   Uh from the University of Chicago, Luigi's in gala san gerry rolnick
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:14:01.380]   And uh, this is that they're op ed from two years ago a way to own your social media
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:03.860]   data
[01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:07.300]   And that's where uh josh refers people to this idea
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:12.020]   I mean, yeah, I mean that's one problem is you can't just export
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:14.820]   I just can't just bring all my friends to some new social network
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:18.500]   Unless maybe it's an interoperable social network so that I could be on it
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.860]   I don't it could be a one-way street. I could I mean in a way
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:25.220]   Isn't that what people do when they take their twitter feed and they post it to their facebook feed?
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:31.300]   It's like well look at the other way leo is that all of these social networks will allow you to import your contacts not export
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:38.100]   Right. So it's it's pretty pretty basic. Yeah, um, basically you just did an s o p p for social networks
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:40.740]   Yeah, yeah
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.740]   I mean that's what i'm like google plus content
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:46.180]   yay
[01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:49.380]   All right, well, I thought it was a good idea, but you know
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:54.820]   I it it may be I mean again you guys I've only had like three hours of sleep last night
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:59.460]   So I could just be stupid about this. I just don't I just found a minute you're out you raise an interesting point
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:02.260]   um, and maybe it isn't sufficient
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:04.340]   to
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:10.500]   Create new competitors to facebook, but it doesn't seem to be too much to ask this is after all my social graph
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:15.300]   Yeah, I mean and if you want to take that he says you could your social data though
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:19.460]   I don't think so like who your friends are
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:24.500]   Well, you're you don't want to your friends would object at some level
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:30.180]   Yeah, i'm like why would I want my friends if they're not actually going to communicate with me on this then it's like a your book
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:32.580]   I just I don't want to be known
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:35.300]   Stacey. I don't want to know that i'm your friend
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:38.820]   Uh-uh so stacey don't you take that elsewhere?
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:44.820]   Your preference would be then to fix facebook rather than to try to make it easy to have competition for facebook
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:49.940]   Well, if you want I guess my my point is if you want competition for facebook
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:53.860]   You need an xmpp for social networks. Well that could be designed
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:16:00.180]   Yeah, but and then you would have to force them to use it. Ah well, that's that's kind of what we're talking about in a way
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:02.260]   It's provide access. Well, we're talking
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.580]   Well provide access somehow
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:10.900]   To your social graph you're you're saying they'd also have to accept input data as well as x-port have to be a two-way street. Yeah
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:19.220]   Okay, i'm willing to accept that addition to the josh concetine theorem that it becomes a chat client basically
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:22.900]   Right, it can be whatever you want to be
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:28.740]   Yeah, that's true. You could you could add extra features to build on tat like kind of like apple or
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:34.980]   One of the many google messengers has done with you know sms you could actually build some neat things
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:36.900]   and
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:41.940]   Then you're then you're competing on the services that you've built around the social graph as opposed to
[01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:45.300]   The lock it just the lock in the wall
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:49.460]   Oh my god, you guys i'm gonna go get a cup of coffee. Y'all keep talking amongst yourselves
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:52.500]   Let's talk about the christ church called action facebook
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.220]   Uh, has signed this
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:17:02.020]   Is a joint statement in support of the christ church called action to eliminate terrorist and violence extremists violent extremist content online
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:03.220]   We come together
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:09.380]   Resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that leads to terrorist
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:14.420]   Violence, this is the one that president trump would not sign would not sign right
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:18.180]   Facebook though, so i think that's maybe more important
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:24.580]   But but so the trump argument is that this could violate the first amendment right?
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:29.700]   I don't see how because it's not government. I guess unless government signs it it would
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:35.220]   Oh, I see well, no, but it does it all it's it's not it's not a law right it is
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:40.020]   Um just fight hatred and extremism. That's all we ask it's guidance
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:45.860]   I can understand why any government might be reluctant to sign on to that but certainly private enterprise
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:47.940]   should
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:49.940]   Uh, however, it is governments
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:53.780]   Well government's gonna pass lots of regulation
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:57.300]   Uh telling the platforms do lots of things
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:01.780]   Um, I don't know. I got it. I want to talk some lawyers about this. Yeah
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:07.380]   Technology companies also committed to a nine point plan that sets out concrete steps they will take
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:13.860]   To address the abusive technologies. Chris facebook is ground zero for this because the christ church
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:17.940]   Uh slaughter was broadcast on facebook live
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:23.700]   Meanwhile facebook made some other changes to live. I think today that I don't fully understand yet
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:27.140]   But they think will help prevent that they think will help well
[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:28.580]   Yeah, it would have
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:34.500]   If you've had any complaints against you on facebook you can't you're you're blocked out alive and that would have prevented the christ church guy because there
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:38.020]   Was some unstated complaints against him in the past. Well
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:44.980]   It doesn't stop somebody from creating a new account. I mean, I don't true that if there's if they're killing a million a day or whatever
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:47.060]   It's very hard
[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:53.380]   Do you think you should have buffering on something like that? Um just because of a 40 minute delay or something an hour delay
[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:56.020]   But not a 40 minute delay like a five minute delay
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:19:01.060]   But but it took longer than an hour for somebody to complain and longer than that. Yeah, here's the problem stacey
[01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:06.020]   It's not going to be I thought about that, but it's not going to be reported until someone can see it
[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:13.140]   Right. Well that oh your algo your algo might try to look at but the algo looking at videos is is really right
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:15.780]   Yeah, you're right. Okay
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:17.860]   No good point. Yeah upon the public
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:22.260]   Oh, oh, oh karstin put that in the rundown stacey said I had a good point
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.300]   I
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:27.300]   Want to know that I haven't had a lot of sleep
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:30.260]   We gotta run we gotta run because we only have half an hour left
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:32.260]   I want to get the change login in your picks of the week

[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:12.020]   Ready start counting no i'm not
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:15.380]   I'm i'm not going to read it
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:20.180]   Uh, but there is a lot of stuff here. This is google's own blog
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:23.300]   They're the keyword blog the developers section
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:26.980]   Uh new smartphones are number one under hardware
[01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:33.060]   Um, I don't know if you can count that as two items when you say we've got a new phone and they come in three colors
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:35.060]   That's number two. I don't know
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:41.300]   Uh, but some of these are features of purpleish purpleish house. That's a not added that deserves its own
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:46.420]   Yeah, there's a green light in front of the hub max it indicates when the camera's on. Okay, that's nice
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:49.860]   Here's a bunch of new stuff and assistant a lot faster
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:56.180]   I can't wait it's coming to pixel phones later this year. They say up to zero almost zero latency. So
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:23:02.740]   That will really make assistant a very different beast if it responds to immediately. Wow
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:07.460]   uh, some ai and machine language stuff including the
[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:13.220]   20 google ai impact challenge grantees or using ai to address societal change
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:20.740]   They uh, they had the flaming lips on stage. Did you see that? I love the flaming lips. Did you go see that?
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:21.860]   I'm too old
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:26.740]   They worked with google engineers to create music with magenta their ai tool for artistic creativity
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:31.060]   That is exactly what I'd expect of waincoin in the flaming lips. That does not surprise me
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:34.100]   google news and search
[01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:37.460]   The technology that powers full coverage in google news is coming to search
[01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:41.220]   I think that's good. I like that
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:45.860]   Podcast I really like this. I read it. Can I say I really like this
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:53.220]   They're gonna start including podcasts and google search results so you can listen podcast directly from the search results page and oh by the way
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:54.660]   they'll also be
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:58.340]   uh doing voice speech recognition so that you'll be able to search for
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:05.140]   audio inside the podcast text inside the podcast and jump right to that point that's gonna be fantastic
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:09.700]   Uh lens, which was very we talked about a little bit last week very impressive
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:18.420]   I just used that today. Did it work? It did like a sham nice. I used it in I was standing on a balcony in
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:22.100]   Santa Monica and someone thought that there was a um
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:25.140]   bogan vielea instead it was uh
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:31.940]   You'll identify the plant and I took a picture of the plant and it got the right plan. Oh, that's pretty impressive
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:34.340]   It's very impressive google knows all
[01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:40.100]   Uh, the your soon your android phone will be a security key. I think that was very interesting
[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:42.980]   Um, it is something you have
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:47.220]   Uh, I guess using bluetooth le
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:55.300]   Family link is a part of every device that has digital well-being starting with android q lot of new things in android q
[01:24:55.940 --> 01:24:57.220]   chrome

[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:15.860]   so good
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:17.860]   uh ads

[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:30.180]   Accessibility we talked about project uphonia to help google assistant understand diverse speech patterns including impaired speech
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:37.700]   And a lot of developer announcements there you go the 100 wait impaired like your trunk
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:44.180]   Uh, maybe or a speech impediment. Yeah. Oh, you remember to meet read you saw a demetree
[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:51.140]   He was both russian and so he had a strong accent and he had a speech impediment when it was okay
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:57.460]   It was difficult for him to speak google assistant understood imperfectly after he trained it with a mere 15,000 samples
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:04.740]   Well, he was training for a larger. He was a researcher. I'm just not everybody. I know okay. Sorry. I just really know
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:10.980]   I'm being silly and the 100th new feature announced at google.io
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:19.540]   A new change is coming to chrome canary to help image heavy websites load more quickly and that's your google
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:21.540]   No, I gotta have other things in the google change
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:25.380]   That's just the beginning google is
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:28.100]   Kind of merging a bunch of different travel
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:30.820]   features into one site
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:38.340]   Google trips google.com/trips it'll combine the mobile google trips app with google flights and google host health search
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:41.460]   google.com/travel
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:46.900]   We'll give you everything. I I thought I was downloading it. I already had it on I opened it up today
[01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:51.220]   It had trips of mine from 2014. Yes, nothing to do. Yes me too. Look at this
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:55.940]   My trip from Naples to Brussels in 2017. I don't even remember that
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:27:02.740]   I think I don't think I ever did that a trip to Mexico and city in marita. I've never been there
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:06.900]   Or maybe I have a line ticket google google knows better
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:10.100]   Yeah, I think I bought airline tickets for my daughter when she went to marita
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:12.820]   Uh, but isn't that amazing look at all the places
[01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:17.700]   All the a trip to paris and stock home. That was true. I did that
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:20.980]   All the places you'll go the places you've been
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:26.340]   Uh, but that's just the beginning of course you can use it. It's kind of like a little bit like trip it which I love
[01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:29.780]   Uh, we'll we'll do a lot more than that
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:31.220]   Um
[01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:33.220]   Now speaking of ads
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:39.620]   Google is going to start showing ads on the home page of the mobile site and mobile apps
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:43.060]   I don't know how people feel about that
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:47.460]   Remember how people got really upset when the wall street journal did ads on their front page
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:52.100]   Yeah, and now we're all like used to it. Yeah, that's how I think we're gonna feel about that. Okay
[01:27:52.100 --> 01:28:01.540]   Google was for years google said with a google.com front page is always going to be clean and simple and stacy's very calm when she's tired
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:03.860]   Yes, she is. She's much for calmer
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:08.020]   Even with that extra cup of coffee. Oh my god. I'm gonna need like eight more
[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:11.620]   We're almost done. We're almost done. I'm gonna let you go
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:18.340]   Uh, google is also going to be doing ads where in discover which does bother me a little bit
[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:23.460]   That's the bar where you know, you see things related to your search. There'll be ads in there
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:26.740]   Uh, that's a little like native content
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:30.100]   That is the thing you you you
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:34.740]   Um, it's where we're going to scroll. That's why we scroll at the top of the search result
[01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:45.300]   Um, google podcast can auto download new episodes from your favorite shows that feature every other podcast application did for years
[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:51.700]   But that was one of the complaints about google podcasts is it was kind of primitive. I guess it's getting more like a real podcast app
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:55.620]   You're gonna be able to buy stuff through youtube videos soon
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:58.740]   Google I guess now that the european
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:02.020]   Stuff is over is is bringing shopping back
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:07.220]   They're revamping their shopping hub and they will let you buy stuff through youtube videos
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:11.380]   This was announced at the google marketing live summits
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:16.260]   So get ready for more ads
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:20.180]   I don't mind go ahead google
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:25.540]   Fire when fire away. It's just ads. I like ads. Yes. You know i'm an ad guy
[01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:28.180]   Um
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:30.180]   Let's see here
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:35.060]   Read oh, this is good for kids learning to read. I really like this
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:39.220]   Reading practice with rivet
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:46.260]   So this is a new reading app from google's experimental projects lab area 120
[01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:51.300]   That they say addresses the most common barriers to effective reading practice
[01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:54.500]   It's a free easy to use reading experience optimized for kids
[01:29:54.500 --> 01:30:01.060]   Evidence shows that one of the major differences between poor readers and strong readers is the amount of time
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:06.100]   spent reading so rivet will give kids free access to more books
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:10.260]   and a knowledgeable reading buddy
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:13.940]   Should we watch a little rivet in action?
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:17.620]   It will read aloud the pages. I actually know this that uh
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:25.060]   It does help kids read if they can watch the text as it's being read aloud
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:29.060]   So I think this is really uh really cool
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:34.260]   And motivation and encouragement from a little cat named abcd
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:42.820]   Yeah, you did it you read three days in rivet gamify
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:50.900]   Learning this rivet rivt. R i vt is now available on androids smart phones tablets ipads iphones and chrome books in 11 countries
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:55.700]   Worldwide visit the play store and search for rivet reading better
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:31:00.020]   Practice it's aimed. I think like kind of fourth graders
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:05.380]   Although there are eight reading levels when I was a kid in school. We had something called sra
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:08.180]   Which was considered very fancy and modern?
[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:12.340]   It was a way of increasing reading ability kind of automatically
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:17.460]   We had phonics. Yeah, that's you got robbed. You got ripped off. How's your spelling?
[01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:20.580]   That atrocious. Yeah
[01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:22.580]   You can thank phonics for that
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:29.140]   I'm okay. I'm really I'm a good reader. Yeah, that's true. You've read really fast
[01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:34.100]   Say goodbye to project campfire
[01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:42.340]   This was the project dumbest ideas ever. You would want to ruin a chrome book with windows dual booting windows
[01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:44.580]   the idea
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:48.020]   First pointed out by about chrome books. Hello kevin toful
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:54.820]   comments and code removals effect. Let's forget this article at nine to five google. Let's go to about chrome books
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:32:01.380]   So long dual booting windows and a chrome book project campfire is deprecated not announced but
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:03.300]   uh
[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:08.500]   Kevin deduced this actually a you a redditor named crossfog deduced it by looking at the code
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:11.220]   the word the big word deprecated
[01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:18.340]   Was was kind of the giveaway. I don't ever want to be deprecated. Don't ever be deprecated
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:23.860]   I think it's what happens to you in the good place. Do you think anybody really wanted the dual boot windows on their chrome book?
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:29.780]   I don't know kevin if you're listening, let us know if you want to dual boot windows on a chrome book
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:32.500]   It was for schools
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:36.740]   Yeah, my son my son would kill to be able to do this. Yeah his school issued chrome boat
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:40.500]   Yeah, because they could play something more interesting
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:44.180]   Like the google 404 game
[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:47.220]   Yeah, not that
[01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:55.540]   Uh, think something involving guns a new game on google earth available wednesday and ios android in the chrome web browser
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:59.140]   Let's see if we can find it. I'm launching google earth
[01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:01.940]   It's shot with a seems to not send a
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:04.660]   Metographer that shot that last episode of uh game of thrones
[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:10.100]   Tutankah i'm gonna have to play the video because I can't get it to come up tutank commons mask
[01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:14.020]   caper calling all gumshoes. This is a little Carmen san diego
[01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:16.180]   adventure
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:18.180]   Get ready for your next case
[01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:26.420]   Where in the world is common san diego? There's a peramid. There's the eiffel tower help carmen stop the cheese
[01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:32.660]   The goat cheese le chevra. I was gonna say isn't that goat goat cheese? Oh, yeah
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:34.820]   chevra
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:37.380]   Uh, maybe he's the goat not the cheese
[01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:41.300]   Um
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:46.580]   Carmen san diego and nm made a chose coming to nefflix earlier this year or came to nefflix earlier this year
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:48.260]   and a
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:51.460]   Carmen san diego movie a live action movie starring jina rudriguez
[01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:54.340]   is coming
[01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:55.780]   um
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:34:00.260]   honoring sersie lannister the best best female tv villain in history
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:04.340]   What is that?
[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:06.900]   That's the google change like i'm sorry i got distracted
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:10.980]   Yeah, i think carsten you were smart to cut that off
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:21.060]   Cut off those mccarsons like we're on a clock here kevin by the way says that having dual boot windows could have boosted chrome book sales because people typically need windows for just a few apps
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:24.820]   Yeah, just put a little windows box in there
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:29.540]   Uh, they were promised coating jobs in apple atcha
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:32.420]   Now they find out it was a fraud
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:39.620]   That's mean that's just mean mind minds
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:41.460]   sounds like
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:46.340]   A well-off rich person coming down to try to do something and not really having the expertise
[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:52.740]   But thinking they did because they succeeded in the silicon valley world consulting and boom at least it was a non-profit
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:55.780]   What they didn't make money on it. I am so sick of
[01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:59.460]   former tech people who see the burning bush. Yeah
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:04.740]   Yeah, stay in silicon valley where you're appreciated darn it
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:07.460]   video game loot boxes
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:09.460]   Will be outlawed
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:11.700]   If josh holly of mazuri has his way
[01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:16.820]   He's going to introduce a federal bill that would prohibit loot boxes
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:19.780]   Uh, especially for kids
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:25.860]   Can we also out low those stupid toys that come and opaque plastic bags and you don't know what's inside and your kid buys like
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:28.260]   All of them just hoping to get one we did a
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:34.020]   Yeah, we did a review we did it was so it wasn't on this show it was on twit because we got twit pulled down
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:36.500]   Because we showed video
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:42.100]   We showed video of those things that are basically unboxing video in a box
[01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:44.900]   Yeah, yeah, it's like the min figs game
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:50.740]   What's the min figs scam? It's not really a scam. It's just the unknown you buy a package and you're like
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:53.300]   It's not that good. There's nothing that
[01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:55.380]   I did not get the banana lego and i'm
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:57.940]   Peaved about it still
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:59.940]   23 years later. Wow
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:03.620]   Adobe says
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:05.620]   We're getting sued
[01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:10.260]   And it turns out we didn't really if you have an old version of the creative cloud apps
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:17.220]   You could get sued too not by us by by somebody unnamed which a little deduction by william gallinger at apple insider
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:21.620]   Tells us is probably doleby doleby seems to be suing
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:26.420]   Uh adobe for not paying the right
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:29.860]   promised license fees
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:34.100]   For dobe technology included in these older dobe program adobe programs
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:40.020]   So dobe sent a letter out to all the people who were creative cloud customers not to use the old versions
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:45.380]   Not because we're gonna sue you but yeah, I don't think dobe's gonna come into your house and sue you but who knows
[01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:49.860]   And here's some good news if you use grinder
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:56.580]   It was purchased. I don't know if people know this grinder, which is a gay dating app was purchased by a chinese company
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:59.700]   I didn't know that beijing kunlung tech company
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:06.340]   And what I also didn't know is there is a a group called the committee on foreign investments in the us
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:12.260]   Which vets overseas acquisitions of american businesses for risks to national security
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:16.500]   cepheus ordered the chinese company to sell
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:21.860]   Grinder and in the meanwhile not to send any data to china
[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:24.420]   About people who use grinder
[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:30.420]   You didn't know about cepheus or cepheus they they kibosh so many mergers in the late or I guess
[01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:32.820]   late aughts
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:38.980]   I think I remember that yeah, but I forgot because all these chinese companies wanted to buy like three cum and blah blah
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:41.860]   It's a good thing we
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:43.860]   I don't know what it means
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:46.980]   But since we have a former tv critic on the show, maybe he can explain
[01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:49.540]   former tv god tv critic, please
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:53.140]   Hulu I it's so uh
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:54.420]   uh
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:56.420]   disney owns hulu now
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:59.140]   Comcast which owns nbc
[01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:02.100]   Has said okay
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:04.100]   Uh, we're gonna break away from hulu
[01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:10.180]   So that means that the nbc universal shows that are currently on hulu will stay on hulu for now, but in a year
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:17.380]   May move to an nbc and not an unannounced an unnamed but announced nbc streaming video service
[01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:21.940]   Which is supposed to be operating next year cbs has one abc has one
[01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:24.340]   Disney has one and then there's the lu
[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:30.660]   And atnt is also pulled out of hulu. That's they sold their stake hulu was supposed to solve all of that
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:35.780]   Yeah, nobody wanted to be in hulu now that disney controls hulu comcast is leaving
[01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:40.500]   Um
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:47.300]   Uh, it's just what it's gonna was gonna come down to is a million silos and if you want to watch a shi
[01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:48.980]   You know, it's gonna hurt though
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:54.340]   Is let's say right now if you like the good fight you have to figure out where you can watch it by a subscription
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:57.540]   If you don't have over the air tv you have to buy a subscription blah blah
[01:38:57.540 --> 01:39:02.660]   Well, you can't get to the fight on over the air you can only get on the screen. That's right. Okay, or to start trick
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:04.900]   You know discovery or whatever
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:11.140]   So but what it's gonna come down to is if you want to watch a particular show you're gonna have to figure out what services on and subscribe to it
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:13.140]   Or
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:15.140]   You're just gonna stop watching those shows
[01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:18.020]   And it'll be okay to see what happens. Yeah
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:22.820]   I mean, that's what everyone when we talked about doing an ala cart cable, which is what this is
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:24.900]   that's what we're getting to is
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:28.420]   They were like, yeah, you'll lose out on the smaller channels
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:33.140]   So you'll see consolidation and the content generation business and then you'll pay individually per channel
[01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:35.780]   Here we are
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:37.780]   American express has acquired resi
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:44.740]   Uh, which is not the biggest open table is the biggest but resi is one that a lot of high-end restaurants about 4 000
[01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:52.420]   In the new data to resi does resi is very aggressive about data. Oh, that's interesting. Really? So never use resi
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:55.940]   Uh, I have to because if you a few of our restaurants
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:40:00.900]   Only use resi open a lot of people don't a lot of restaurants even though it's got 51 000
[01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:03.300]   Restaurants don't like open table
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:07.780]   Because you have to use the open table software. I mean, it's it costs a lot of money
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:12.020]   It's kind of it's kind of reversed that right so open table started as just a reservation service
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:17.620]   But restaurants were so far behind they they had no way to get the data about what spots were open
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:20.020]   So open table had to provide
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:23.620]   The software to do that and then that became the business right
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:27.940]   So resi comes along and now American express owns resi
[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:31.540]   And uh, yeah, that's interesting
[01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:33.460]   um
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:35.700]   You know, it's become is up and coming as yelp
[01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:41.860]   You can make reservations and yelp, but I don't think it costs the restaurant or anything or not much anyway
[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:44.340]   yelp
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:50.420]   I don't like it, but some restaurants I have to use yelp to make a reservation on I hate that they force me to download an app to see anything
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:57.060]   I on principle will not use yelp screw them and yelp yelp is the biggest liner about google
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:41:01.780]   Uh-huh like you've disadvantaged us. Well, no people don't want to use you because you're paying
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:05.140]   Yeah, you're making me as linkedin does the same thing. I hate it
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:11.620]   Local babysitter.com has done a little math and says that ad-free
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:16.340]   She programs on netflix saves our kids from up to 400 hours of commercialcy here
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:23.220]   That was actually one of the things the surprising benefits we didn't really notice or think about until
[01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:25.460]   Blonde later is my daughter
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:29.460]   Because she we didn't have cable for her entire life
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:34.740]   Um very early on she didn't have any ads. She didn't want the toys
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:42.100]   Right in like even even grocery shopping with her wasn't a pain because she didn't want any sugary
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:47.300]   Cereals that we didn't already buy on our own because you know, we've got this thing for cinnamon toast crunch in our house
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:50.900]   But like she was fine with so many things that
[01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:54.180]   It was it was kind of nice. That's all
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:42:00.340]   Did you know I just read an article that the inventor of apple jacks is a professor of physics at mit
[01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:03.220]   Well, I did not know that
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:05.460]   It's a terrible cereal
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:10.580]   It is it hurts your mouth. It's like cap and crunch, but it's not as good as captain crunch. It hurts your mouth
[01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:17.140]   It gets so you super fast. It's what is no no benefits. He was an intern at kelogs
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:20.180]   and uh
[01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:22.180]   Dr. William tilly he
[01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:23.540]   he uh
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:27.380]   He invented apple jacks. I probably didn't get a penny because he was an intern
[01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:31.540]   Now he uh, he's a professor at at mit
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:40.180]   I don't know how I got there, but I oh, I know cinnamon toast crunch. Yes cereal. It's a sugary cereal
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:46.820]   Okay, I feel like we're winding down is we are last story? Okay last story and it's just a recommendation to read
[01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:52.740]   Uh, see what's more coffee. Paul Ford who is a great essay. He's also the founder of post-light
[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:56.100]   And wrote an article. It's a cover story on wired
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:43:01.380]   Why I parenthesis still and parenthesis love tech in defense of a difficult?
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:05.460]   Industry and it just reminded me because he's he must be roughly my age
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:08.500]   He's a little younger, but just reminded me of the early days of
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:14.500]   Technology and all our hopes and how exciting it was and creating your first web page
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:17.940]   He created tilde.com, which was so awesome
[01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:24.740]   Many not so many years ago and but any event, uh, it's a good read so cover story in this month's
[01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:28.500]   Wired why I still love tech in defense of a
[01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:35.220]   Difficult industry and it's why we still do this show even though sometimes it makes us tear our hair out and now
[01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:38.420]   ladies and gentlemen
[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:45.540]   I give you stasis pick of the week. Oh crap. Um, I don't have a pick at the week. She's got coffee
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:50.260]   I'm like I am terrible. I've been trev- that's what she's traveling
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:53.780]   I can tell you that I'm really right now very thrilled with
[01:43:53.780 --> 01:44:00.020]   I'm looking at my apps that i've downloaded. I've got nothing. Oh, don't make up anything. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay
[01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:06.500]   I'm Jeff is gonna Jeff is gonna redeem us. I have one of my favorites ever. I don't know how I came across this
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:12.180]   But uh, I have the 2018 drive-through study
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:18.820]   There was no I found the magazine. I'm gonna subscribe to qsr. I don't know what the qs is therefore was the fast food
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:23.620]   In this free magazine. I know that magazine. Yes. Oh
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:32.100]   So arby's is the uh, see here the slowest mcdonald's is now like the slowest at 273 seconds for the drive- what?
[01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:34.260]   That's like five minutes almost
[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:39.700]   So that's what I sell this story the story above that the rundown is that but all is gonna redesign
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:44.420]   Uh things to improve on this the man you got too complicated
[01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:49.140]   Um and other issues. So the fastest here. Let's see
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:54.740]   Every time in seconds is Burger King. You know why because they're just microwaving the damn stuff
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:08.900]   That you know, I'm a mcdonald's loyalist. I am and mcdonald's was started so that you wouldn't have to wait
[01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:11.220]   Are you coke or pepsi?
[01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:15.460]   Oh, well, I like pepsi but mcdonald's only sold coke. Well, I mean just in general
[01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:20.260]   I'm bicolon myself, but oh you're bicolon. Well, yeah, I'll drink whatever's there
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:27.140]   So go below that no cola. Yeah. Why don't I haven't had a cola in years. Oh, I have I haven't had this this my aepb started
[01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:28.660]   Yeah, um
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:34.340]   Service attributes service attributes service attributes. Okay, so they measured here
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:40.820]   I contact whether please was said pleasant demeanor whether a smile was said and
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:44.180]   Whether thank you was said at all the major chains
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:48.100]   Once again chick fillet hard to beat when it comes to service
[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:54.740]   Pleasant demeanor 94.6. They'll never going to a chick fillet. I'm sorry. I've never been and I never will
[01:45:55.380 --> 01:46:00.420]   A texas legislator today every airport in the country deserves a chick fillet. He says
[01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:05.700]   So then which airport band chick fillet was there the airport said no, you
[01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:08.900]   San Antonio san Antonio was it can't have a chip really so
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:12.420]   And finally there's order accuracy
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:14.660]   Oh
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:17.860]   That's important because when you drive away, you don't want to have to go back
[01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:24.340]   So I which I hate and I have a fit lowest surprise surprise kfc 69.9
[01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:30.500]   Order accuracy. There's always something extra in that bucket chick fillet wins again
[01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:37.540]   At 97.3 percent maybe on the accuracy and here's a smile too. Uh
[01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:43.780]   Chick fillet actually is really good at so I live in the south. There's chick fillets everywhere
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:45.300]   Um
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:50.580]   They treat their workers actually fairly decently they pay for college for that. Why is there not gay. It's okay
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:53.540]   Yes, I'm not so okay if you're not gay
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:57.060]   But you know if if they
[01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:59.140]   if we could just
[01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:03.220]   Take the family values and make them more inclusive of all families
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:07.540]   They'd have a pretty decent they go in there like they got most of it, right
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:10.900]   Oh, they guess they're starting with you know
[01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:14.180]   Actually, they're starting from a terrible place, but um
[01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:16.820]   The end result
[01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:21.380]   Anybody in our chat remember work at chick fillet. Is it a good place to work? Is it a hard place to work?
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:27.460]   Yeah, you know, I think all fast food has got a hard I work well by no, you know what I came up on a rosa
[01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:28.820]   We've talked about this you worked upon a rosa
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:34.660]   I came up at mcdonald's and I did that every summer for the through high school and even the first of your college
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:37.220]   And uh, I think I learned how to work there. I don't think it was
[01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:43.540]   Slave labor if you like steak give your up to that breakage steak at the pond rosa steak house
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:49.940]   Grab a bucket and mop from the floor to the top tell me what does it mean at mcdonald's we're clean
[01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:57.700]   That is one of the best advertising jingles of all time because it's singing the praises of mopping the floor
[01:47:57.700 --> 01:48:02.660]   Yeah, forget about the food just for a moment and consider how clean our floors are
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:11.380]   Um, my daughter says web 635 355 is very happy at chick fillet
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:14.500]   Oh, there you go. See so
[01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:19.940]   I'm glad that there are still uh jobs for teenagers at fast food
[01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:22.900]   It's a good place to start
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:29.300]   But I think now I should say to all the company you deserve a break today
