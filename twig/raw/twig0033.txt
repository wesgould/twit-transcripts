[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.600]   Three bones.

[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.680]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, our special South
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.800]   by Southwest edition.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.640]   And we're here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.960]   That's the great folks at the Texas co-working facility
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.560]   in downtown Austin, 206th Street and Paul.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.120]   Thank you for your hospitality.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.880]   We also thank the folks at New Tech, who have set up
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.080]   a Tri-Caster HD and a bunch of high-def cameras.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.680]   And this is a nice setup.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.880]   This is a really nice setup.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.200]   So we even have a few people alive in the audience
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.160]   who are forced to compel to stand, which I think
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.160]   is only fair.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.840]   You should have to stand if you want to watch this show.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.600]   I am sitting with Gina Trapani in the flesh.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.120]   It's so nice.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.840]   I've never met you.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.040]   First time we've ever met.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.800]   That seems so weird.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.000]   I kept a hug Leo.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.080]   I said he ain't a unit.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.800]   I think this happens in South by Southwest,
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.880]   is that you actually meet people that you've known for years
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.680]   but never met.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.280]   Absolutely.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.800]   You're no longer just a floating head.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.160]   It's so exciting.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.000]   I'd have still had.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.160]   Also, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.920]   Nice to meet you.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.920]   We've never met either.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.840]   You've never met either.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.440]   It's so great.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.880]   And Jake Jarvis, your son is here with you.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.560]   That's so cute, father and son.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.520]   It's a company, him.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.200]   Aw, isn't that great?
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.400]   So this is my first.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400]   You guys, Jeff and Jake, you've been here three times.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.880]   Really?
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.080]   Gina's been six times.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.480]   I think this is my sixth, yeah.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.920]   What was it like in the old days?
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.040]   I can't even really speak.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.200]   The old days were truly like 2000.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.840]   The people who were here 10 years ago.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.240]   And there's a Flickr set somewhere
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.880]   that Matt Howie's in.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.440]   He's an audience here that's like 2000,
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.960]   the really early South by.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.640]   And everyone's looking very young and spry.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.520]   We'll get Matt on it.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.040]   We should get Matt on.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.560]   He's going to talk about the old days.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.560]   I would just be a closer talking about the olden days
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.280]   of South by Southwest.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.960]   Well, six is a long time ago.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.960]   Six is a while.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.360]   It's a lot bigger.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.080]   I was bragging like--
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.400]   It's a Twitter for God's sake.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.400]   I know, pre-Twitter for God's sake.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.360]   The Twitter change.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.120]   South by-- I mean, Twitter debuted at South by in 2007.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.960]   And that really was the big debut.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.880]   Twitter amplifies the fact that there are 50 things going on
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.760]   during the time the thing that you're at.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.520]   And it makes you feel like, should I be here?
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.280]   Should I be there?
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.600]   Twitter make it easier to people to coalesce for Gary Vaynerchuk
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.880]   to say, I got wine.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.080]   Definitely.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.800]   Absolutely.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.480]   Absolutely.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.480]   Although the year that Twitter got big here, what was that?
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.080]   2007.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.000]   2007.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.720]   I was sort of the still the late adopter.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.440]   I was the one standing in the hallway kind of staring
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.800]   at the screen being like, what is this thing?
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.360]   And that's actually when I signed up.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.120]   So--
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.280]   And then four squared became big last year.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.920]   This year, that doesn't seem to be an application.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.840]   Everybody's kind of using goalas here,
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.880]   four squares here, Twitter.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.680]   What was the one Scoble was talking about a minute ago?
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.440]   Plancast.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.560]   I love Plancast.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.880]   But another one that shows you all the sign-ins on goalas.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.840]   By curious.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.960]   By curious.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.640]   By curious.ly.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.800]   But it's goalas based, or is it a bunch of other ones?
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.440]   Jake Jarvis.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.120]   He said it just-- it shows you, like,
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.000]   bliffs of people showing up at different places.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.640]   Those who show you who they are, shows, like,
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.520]   if you see a blob of people, you know to go there.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.960]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.800]   Have you guys seen Stit by us?
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.840]   No, what's that?
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.600]   It's sitby.us.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.320]   It's-- you're in South-- you're out of panel at South
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.280]   by Southwest, and you check in and say where you're sitting.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.920]   I love that.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.080]   And then people can figure out where you are in the room.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.560]   This has really become a test tube for all of these social--
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.040]   it's a social media event now.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.800]   I mean, it really is.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.840]   I'm sure it was web design early on and things like that.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.400]   Yeah, it was.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.920]   I tweeted today this morning just started game going.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.480]   And I said that Southwest is not a conference.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.440]   It's a tribal gathering.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.200]   And then I started some other names going.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.480]   People came back with what it was.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.120]   And I had a whole bunch of what it really is.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.680]   But to me, it is a tribal gathering.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.920]   It's you see these people you haven't seen.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.120]   If you ask me, that's the future of conferences.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.760]   Nobody really wants needs or wants to see booths anymore.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.360]   So trade shows that rely on booths are kind of dwindling,
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.360]   except for CES maybe.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.600]   That's the one exception.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.520]   You see that in Germany.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.000]   And I think even panels, you know, there's too many panels here.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.200]   You can't see-- you can only-- at best,
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.040]   you could see one-tenth of the panels that are available.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.560]   And it's a classic case of the hallway being the real event.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.720]   The lobby con.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.000]   You want to turn it inside out.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.040]   It's a paradox of choice.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.480]   You're like, I can't even deal with dashing across the convention
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.600]   center and making it to the other thing or choosing.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   So you just have to talk to it.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.360]   I've been to one panel.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.760]   And it was truncated by a fire alarm.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   And you were glad to be here.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.240]   I was actually glad it was Mark Cuban and Avner Ronan.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.000]   And Avner is the guy at Boxy.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.040]   And I thought he would be a very interesting person
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.480]   to listen to.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.760]   But Mark Cuban is so annoyingly opinionated.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.120]   I had-- I just was like, I couldn't--
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.520]   I was so glad the alarm went off.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.520]   It sounds like it--
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.280]   Did you leave?
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.040]   No.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.740]   A case of the big media personality
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.480]   sort of slamming the quiet, thoughtful--
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.800]   Yeah, he said, are you making money?
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.300]   No.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.680]   No, it's a case of Mark Cuban being a--
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.520]   you said it before Leo.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.840]   A dick, a prick.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.960]   Hey, look at this.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.600]   On the more positive note, there is a hardcover edition
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.480]   of Gina's book.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.080]   Hold it up, Gina.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.580]   Hold it up.
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.160]   The complete guide to Google Wave.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.760]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.560]   Wow.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.400]   Wow.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.120]   Your co-author Adam is here also.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.120]   We'll have to say hi to him.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.240]   Yes, he is.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.560]   This is the debut.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.640]   No one's ever-- first copies that anyone's ever seen,
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.560]   besides all of us.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.360]   Yeah, first edition.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.360]   It's up available for order on the website.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.240]   Completewaveguide.com.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.520]   Yeah, this is my third book.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.240]   This is my third book.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.560]   So it's not new to you to see a first edition.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.960]   But--
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.480]   It is not.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.360]   But there's a lot of things that are new about this book
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.000]   for me.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.760]   So I decided not to sort of publish it.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.160]   The traditional way, through traditional publishing
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.360]   house.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.480]   This is really a DIY kind of experiment.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.440]   Got together with a small company in San Diego.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.600]   And we said, we're going to do this book together.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.480]   We're going to design it.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.080]   We're going to copy it.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.000]   We're going to make the index.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.240]   We're going to do the screenshots.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.400]   We're going to do it collaboratively in this wiki.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.720]   And we're going to print it ourselves.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.080]   Because speed was in the essence, right?
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.760]   Because Wave just continuously changes.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.520]   We wanted to get this book out the door.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.160]   And I wanted to have more control.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.480]   And this is the result.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.080]   And we got to do some really cool stuff with this book.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.920]   This is the first edition.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.040]   The preview PDF was out several months ago.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.640]   But this book, Adam and I just blew it out.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.560]   There's two new chapters, tons of screenshots,
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.760]   tons of use cases.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.360]   I mean, the focus of the book is just
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.960]   to answer the question, illustrate the answers to the question.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.360]   What is the point of Wave?
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.160]   So we tried to do that.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.080]   Did you print a bunch?
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.200]   Or is it more per on demand?
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.480]   And you can update it as you go.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.200]   Well, so what we did-- well, the ultimate goal
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.560]   is to make it more print on demand
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.440]   so that people can get the current content of the wiki
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.640]   in their hard copy.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.480]   Are you going to use Lulu?
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.160]   How are you going to do that?
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.080]   Well, so what we did for this first print run,
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.120]   we were thinking, oh, we'll just go with Lulu.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.960]   But we got to do this really neat thing.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.280]   We hooked up with this-- or three ones, my publisher--
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.640]   hooked up with this charity in San Diego, which
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.880]   provides the job placement for developmentally
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.600]   disabled adults.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.720]   These are people who want and need jobs,
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.800]   but having a hard time finding them.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.520]   Anyway, they had enough faith in us
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.160]   to do a first print run of a couple of few thousand copies.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.560]   And they're going to be doing all the book
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.560]   fulfillment and the orders processing and returns.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.760]   So when you buy a copy of the print book, which is $25,
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.960]   half of that money goes toward this charity.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.200]   So nothing against Lulu.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.280]   They're a great service.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.840]   And they print beautiful books.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.520]   But this is a really good opportunity
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.120]   to sort of send your money to the right places.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.880]   So I'm really excited about that part.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.640]   If you don't want to kill trees, there's still the PDF version,
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.520]   $9, straight through the website.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.800]   If you subscribe, do you get updates automatically
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.280]   on the PDF?
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.760]   If you bought the pre-v PDF, you will get the first edition
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.520]   free as a thank you for supporting us early on.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.000]   We didn't know if we were going to be able to do that,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.360]   but we decided to do that, because it only made sense.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.520]   And the whole book is available to read for free on the website.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   And so the idea is to turn around new additions as wave evolves
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.400]   and changes as quickly as possible.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.600]   So we're trying to figure out a way
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.080]   to kind of meld this web publishing and book publishing.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.560]   But we put a lot of work in this thing.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.000]   I mean, we had a copy editor just
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.360]   slaved over the index in this book.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.600]   Because we're dealing with a print book.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.280]   You need an index.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.320]   There's no control left.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.400]   You can't do a fine for a word.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.160]   How antiquated is that?
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:32.660]   I know.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.480]   It's crazy.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.760]   A human indexing the book.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.560]   It was amazing.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.360]   I didn't really think about that part of the process.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.320]   Those people are gross.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.120]   My copy editor, Marianne, and 3-1.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.560]   She was amazing.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.480]   I want to click the pages.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.920]   I don't know.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.400]   Yeah, it was really hard, you know,
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.480]   putting-- I use Google's URL shortener for the particularly
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.160]   long and complicated URLs in the text of the book,
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.680]   because you don't want to print long URL's.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.200]   So I'm totally excited.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:56.960]   It's available now.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.640]   Literally just went live today.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.200]   Brand new.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.160]   So I hope everyone will check it out.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.320]   And if you decide to still choose--
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:02.840]   And you can buy it.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.600]   Wear, Gina.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.960]   [LAUGHS]
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.360]   Completewaveguide.com.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:07.640]   Yes.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.120]   So good.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.560]   And thank you to all the listeners who bought the early
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.440]   copies and have just been--
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.120]   you know, visited the site and checked it out.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.920]   I really appreciate it.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.400]   I'm really excited about Wave.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.080]   I know there's been a lot of backlash, a lot of people
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.800]   saying that, you know, it's dumb.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.120]   There's no obvious use.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.040]   But to me, Wave represents this kind of future in real time.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.480]   Have you seen a new, good application on top of it lately?
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.360]   Or anything--
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.840]   I think that Google is gearing up to launch some really
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.440]   cool plugins to Wave for Google I/O in May.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.760]   So I think they're rolling out a new API for robots
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.320]   for building Wave extensions.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.120]   They've been launching a few new things here and there.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.360]   Like email notifications just got built in last week.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.880]   So you can get email notifications.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.880]   There's a link now, extensions, where you can browse and
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.080]   install extensions inside Wave pretty easily.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.400]   And I think they're going to have some goodies come May.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.320]   So Wave is still preview.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   It's not even beta yet.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.760]   So I think we're going to see some really cool stuff come
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.320]   down the pipe.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.920]   You can get the book now, the complete guide
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.320]   to Google Wave, the Google Wave, complete wave guide.com.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.840]   Never will get that right.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.520]   Thank goodness it's printed on the back.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.920]   You need to give Leo his own short URL for you.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.920]   I know.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.440]   I know.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.920]   Don't get it.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.360]   So Google's testing internet TV--
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.080]   TV internet search.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.240]   That is just the weirdest thing ever.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.160]   They're doing this with dish.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.720]   I don't even know how widespread this is.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.960]   It's just executives right now.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.000]   Just to start.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.160]   So what is Google's plan with this?
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.040]   What do they want to do?
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.680]   Make it possible for you to search your TV?
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.160]   Yeah, organize everything.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.600]   What don't they want to organize?
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.360]   Right.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:35.880]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.840]   We have stories about Google display ads, Google radio,
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.440]   Google now TV search.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.560]   I mean, Google really is into everything these days.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.000]   So this is according to information week,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   but actually they're quoting in a Wall Street Journal report.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.200]   So we'll give credit to Wall Street Journal for this.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.440]   They're testing a search service that would enable users
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.080]   to find video content on conventional TV on the internet
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.320]   and on the internet.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.840]   Actually, this would be good for us,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.160]   because as a video show, it's hard to search us precisely.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.360]   So how are they going to do it?
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.480]   Are they going to transcribe it?
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.480]   What are they going to do?
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.960]   I'm not sure exactly, but I think it is a bit of the holy grail here.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.920]   My theory is that right before the Oscars,
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.240]   WBCTV in New York was at war with--
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:19.600]   Oh, it wasn't there.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.600]   --table or something.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.160]   And 15 minutes into the red carpet.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.680]   Somebody playing.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.920]   They turned it back on.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.680]   But what's going to happen here, in my view,
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.400]   is that more and more stations are going to ask for money,
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.880]   get money from the cable operators.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.120]   It's going to go through to the consumer.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.440]   The prices are going to go up.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.920]   And the FCC is finally going to demand all a cart.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.120]   And if that happens, it's going to kill tons of cable networks.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.520]   And that's the beginning of internet TV.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.480]   That's what it all starts to look like, just me and me.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.320]   I got excited, then.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.800]   That's good news.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.720]   That's not bad news at all.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.320]   I think, in fact, we should be pushing for it more and more.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.280]   I forget where it was.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.160]   I saw a list today, a very good list,
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.080]   of the per-channel cost for what we pay for cable.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.320]   I be not being a real man and not watching sports.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.200]   Don't give a damn about any sports station,
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.000]   except my daughter, Jake's sister, likes tennis.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.960]   Jake does too once in a while, so do I.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.000]   That's the only one we watch.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.520]   I think that's like $0.04.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.000]   ESPN is $4.60 a month.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.720]   And I don't watch it.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.520]   Fox Sports is $2.63 a month.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.280]   I don't watch it, and it's bundled.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.520]   40% of what I paid a cable or the fees that go to channels
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.720]   are sports.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.120]   Plus Spanish stuff, I should speak it, I'm sorry, but I don't.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.360]   Plus all this other stuff that I don't pay for.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.960]   And I think we're going to finally hit the point
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.640]   where we are subsidizing a whole bunch of channels.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.920]   So that's going to kill, if this ever happens,
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.880]   if the FCC finally does protect us.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.040]   That's unfortunate, because it's going to support
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.000]   sports channels.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.320]   They're not going away.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.640]   But maybe the niche channel, Discovery Science
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.240]   or Discovery History, that's going to go away.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.080]   It'll go away.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.960]   But then again, somewhere out there,
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.640]   there is the legal report of science geeks.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.480]   There is.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.560]   His name is Miles O'Brien, and he is a great stuff.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.400]   Right.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.760]   And so maybe you think it's an opportunity
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.600]   for somebody like that.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.680]   I think we don't have, we don't have, I should say,
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   the budgets to do those kinds of productions.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.800]   Not that kind of production, but--
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   Maybe we will.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.840]   Maybe we will, if everybody migrates to that.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.720]   That A, and B, you can still reduce the cost
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.360]   to make a good respectable production.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.360]   Right.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.160]   More expensive than this sitting around the table,
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.880]   but still cheaper than the way big old TV does it now.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.920]   Right.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.400]   Right.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.080]   Well, you can mine and moan all you want.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.160]   There's nothing you can do to change it.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.960]   So once you're there, once all of it becomes TV,
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.240]   then searching that and finding that stuff--
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:35.960]   Makes sense.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.800]   --is the holy grail.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.160]   They're using Android as the operating system
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.400]   for set-top boxes, buddy boxes, and TVs.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.760]   And I take it back, it is not dish executives.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.000]   It is Google employees that are getting the access to this.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.240]   Isn't they learn anything from buzz?
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.040]   I was going to say.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.600]   Try it there.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.480]   Yeah, we know Google employees are not going to--
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.040]   A stranger crew you couldn't imagine for testing.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.480]   So well, we don't know anything more about that.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.960]   That's basically what we know.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.600]   Interesting insight into what Google is all about.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.240]   Speaking of the FCC, I've just got a brag for one second.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.000]   We could go like, I got to testify before the FCC
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.560]   about the public interest for TV stations.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.800]   And so I said as I began my testimony,
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.560]   I said, I want you to indulge me.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.800]   Years ago, I have had fights with the FCC ever
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.080]   freedom of speech through Foyas.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.720]   And I want to begin my testimony today with one word.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.640]   Baba Buoy.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.800]   Oh, man.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.360]   Howard Stern must have loved you.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.160]   I said, oh, he did.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:37.960]   It was all New York.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.720]   Oh, man, he must have loved you.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.440]   And you think anybody got it?
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.240]   A few of the FCC guys laughed.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.080]   Yeah, they got it.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.000]   I was so proud.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.960]   I got Baba Buoy, I mentioned it three times at the FCC.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.160]   And you tweeted a picture, a capture
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.200]   from the screen of the closed caption person.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.880]   And you said, whoever's doing the closed captioning clearly
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.760]   isn't a Stern fan.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.200]   It says, to begin with one word, Bob Bubbly, Bob.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.400]   Google Voice, YouTube Captions.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.320]   Yeah, Bob Bubbly, Bob.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.320]   That's pretty funny.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:11.840]   That's very funny.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.720]   Take that FCC.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.640]   It does look like Google Voice might have done that.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.000]   Somebody sent me--
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.120]   I guess YouTube has now opened up the automatic transcription
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.000]   to YouTube videos.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.560]   So some of our videos that are on YouTube,
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.120]   people are turning it on and getting
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.480]   some less than ideal results.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.120]   I get an email.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.160]   It doesn't do a very good job.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.760]   Someone said that it's on by default.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.200]   Is it?
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.720]   Yeah, one of the producers with the Guild,
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.120]   which is this really good web show,
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.040]   is uploading the latest season of YouTube.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.160]   And he wrote me to say that a lot of people
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.480]   are saying that it's on by default.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.560]   And viewers are upset that it's not perfect.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.560]   Well, it's not very good.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.520]   It's not very good, right?
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.280]   I haven't watched one of our shows with it on, is it?
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:50.960]   I don't know.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.960]   I'm going to have to watch it now.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.640]   I've only heard from people who have.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.720]   So that's a little scary.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.400]   They've also added variable speeds to YouTube video.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.000]   So this is part of their HTML5 experiment, which I love.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.080]   And I just-- you know, I turn it on all my browsers.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.120]   There's a whole panel here at South by Southwest about fun
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.920]   with HTML5 video.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.320]   I think I'm Monday.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.920]   Well, this must be part of it, because if you're using--
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.800]   so you need to go to youtube.com/html5.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   And then it'll say, oh, would you like to join the beta?
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.840]   There's a link kind of buried in the text there.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.520]   And you click that.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.400]   And from now on, I guess, when you go to YouTube,
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.640]   you've got a cookie set.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.720]   And it will default to HTML5 instead of Flash video.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.960]   If you've got it going, then next to the Play Pause button
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.080]   is a little arrow.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.640]   It's very hard to see a little red arrow.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.120]   And if you click that arrow, a panel with a tortoise
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.600]   and a hair opens up and a slider.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.640]   And you can make the videos--
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.120]   I don't know why you'd want to do this.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:42.960]   Well, because it's very hard to ask.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.960]   I usually talk to people about it.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.800]   Do you have that, actually?
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.400]   Slow it down.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.680]   People do it for podcasts all the time.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.000]   And they're listening to the audio, right?
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.440]   And this actually does what people do, which is it pitch shifts.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.520]   So the audio doesn't sound weird.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.800]   It sounds normal, but it's speeded up.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.480]   So you can get to--
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.480]   Watch the wagon half the time.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.920]   And it's well known that the human brain actually
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.480]   has better comprehension when stuff is faster.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.960]   So we actually understand it better.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.440]   So I've never reminded that people
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.320]   listen to our podcasts faster.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.000]   And I guess you could now do video podcasts faster.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.760]   That's kind of cool.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.560]   If captions are annoying you, though, and YouTube,
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.680]   if you go to your account, playbooks setup,
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.560]   play back setup, and captions, you can--
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.320]   Oh, you could turn it on.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.720]   --on check, always show captions, yes.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.520]   Oh, OK.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.600]   Oh, you mean it turns them on always?
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.520]   How annoying is that?
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.200]   This is word on the street.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.320]   I haven't verified, but yeah.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.560]   How annoying is that?
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.080]   If captions are annoying you, though, you can--
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.760]   I'm going to check my account.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:42.280]   YouTube has started to cover live sports.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.800]   Streaming, well, it's the Indian Premier League cricket
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.440]   tournament, but it is live.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.560]   Is this new to YouTube?
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.360]   I don't remember them doing much live.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.720]   That's the first effort they announced it a little bit ago.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.160]   I think it's just starting.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.920]   They have all 60 of the cricket matches.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.440]   I've never watched cricket.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.160]   That would be one where you'd have a little slider
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:02.920]   would be very handy.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.680]   Yeah, my captions are on right now on my YouTube account.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.200]   This is beer.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:09.200]   I certainly--
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   This is beer.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:10.760]   It is beer.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:16.480]   Is somebody trying to get us drunk?
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.960]   Clearly, we need to do this live and in person more often.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.560]   I have no idea.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.280]   Do you know if I decided we're already
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.480]   moving to Petaluma?
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.240]   Would you please?
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.600]   We would love to have you up there.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.960]   It's so nice there.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.600]   We're trying.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.360]   This is-- I don't know how well--
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.000]   remember Google says they're going to do gigabit internet,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.440]   or gigabit internet, rather, in five communities nationwide.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.360]   You have to be between 50 and 500,000.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.080]   My town, the little town of Petaluma, the city fathers,
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.360]   or whoever they are, the mothers, got the idea
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.160]   that we should be participating in this.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.000]   And they've asked me to kind of launch a grassroots effort
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.880]   because it would be great for Twit to have gigabit internet.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.280]   We pay a lot of money for 10th of that or 100-pico's
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.160]   pushing every town.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.200]   My mayor didn't respond to my email.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.120]   He's lost my vote forever.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.600]   Twit's--
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.040]   --Twitchburg?
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.800]   Sorry.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.440]   Mayor Bloomberg?
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.880]   No, no, I have my little town in New Jersey.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.440]   Oh, OK.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.960]   I thought you lived in Manhattan for some reason.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.240]   No, no, no.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.920]   You seem so urbane.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.480]   I have kids who like oxygen and schools and things.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.840]   Oh, how the heck would that?
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.000]   It's overrated.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.880]   Yeah, no, I think any--
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:17.840]   --tier to tier ticks.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.280]   Any time between 50 and 50,000 should be lobbying for this.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.840]   But I'm going to make a web page.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.800]   And I guess--
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.040]   I don't know what Google's going to look at,
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.840]   but I would imagine if there's a grassroots movement
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.560]   within the town to get that gigabit internet.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.240]   That'd be awesome.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.000]   There was Topeka that changed their name, right?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.480]   Was it Topeka?
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.240]   Somebody changed their name.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.600]   Somebody changed their name.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.560]   Google, Kansas.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.520]   It was Topeka, yeah.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.800]   Well, I haven't said it up yet.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.040]   So we should chat room and everybody.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.320]   We should brainstorm and create incredibly impressive things
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.880]   that Petaluma do.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.720]   What could Petaluma do?
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.600]   Well, we've got Twit.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.600]   I think that should be enough.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.600]   What more does Google want?
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.360]   Are you listening to Google?
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.840]   Home of the president of the internet.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.120]   Shouldn't the president have the best access?
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.960]   Of the internet.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.120]   Of the internet, anyway.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.040]   So we're going to take a break.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.800]   Come back with more.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.360]   This is this week in Google Live from Austin in that South
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.080]   by Southwest.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:06.840]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.200]   Jake Jarvis is here.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.760]   I should talk to you in just a second.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.320]   Find out what you think.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.800]   Representing the future and all that.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.720]   Gina Tripani from San Diego.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.440]   She's visiting.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.480]   It's so nice to see you in person for the first time.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.880]   Jeff Jarvis also.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.000]   And Gina's book is out.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.280]   If you go to completewaveguide.com,
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.400]   you can get your copy of it.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.480]   Don't forget, of course, what would Google do, which
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.320]   is still out?
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:28.600]   Thank you.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.400]   Thank you, Brian.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.960]   It's still there and still selling very well on Amazon.com.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.880]   More with Twig in just a moment.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.680]   But first, I want to mention our friends at GoToMeeting.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:43.360]   If you are currently wondering, why am I traveling?
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.240]   Why am I spending all this time on the road driving across town
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.520]   for meetings or worse flying across country
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.160]   in the middle seat for meetings?
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.680]   And you haven't really taken a look at GoToMeeting.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.600]   I want you to do so.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.800]   This is a way that you can travel less and yet get more done.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.840]   We're all doing it now.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.320]   I mean, nobody wants to spend the money and the time
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.600]   and the stress traveling.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.600]   So we do conference calls, but they're so unvisual.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.160]   I mean, you really need to be able to show them
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.200]   the PowerPoint or the keynote presentation.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.440]   Maybe share spreadsheet data, collaborate on documents.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.880]   That's what GoToMeeting lets you do.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.000]   From the folks at Citrix, they know remote access.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.600]   They've got it wired.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.680]   They really have the best technology.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.280]   It's secure, 128-bit encrypted, end-to-end.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.480]   It's fast.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.840]   That's very important, very reliable.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.840]   And you can try it free.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.520]   How about that?
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.040]   By going to gotomeeting.com/twig,
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:37.000]   g-o-t-o, meeting.com/twig, 30 days free unlimited meetings.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.520]   But you know, anything, it's only $49 a month
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.120]   when you decide to buy.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.280]   And you never have to watch the length of the meeting
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.000]   or the number of meetings.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.160]   It's unlimited.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.600]   Use it 24/7 if you want.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.840]   Free for the first month.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.320]   GoToMeeting.com/twig.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:56.480]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.400]   Netflix-- I don't know if this isn't really a Google story,
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.120]   but it's kind of relevant to the cloud.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.920]   Netflix had a contest remember last year
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.160]   to improve their recommendations.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.320]   And a million dollar prize, a pair of researchers
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.400]   from the University of Texas were
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.080]   able to win that million dollar-- is that right?
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.960]   A million dollar prize.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.200]   Unfortunately, the anonymized data,
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:23.480]   which was used for the contest, apparently,
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.440]   including movie recommendations and choices made
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.960]   by hundreds of thousands of customers,
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.680]   could be used to identify them.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.120]   That's what the researchers figured out.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:30.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.040]   That wasn't the team that won.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.320]   They took the data and said, hm, you know, we can show--
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.480]   this is the name of their paper-- robust de-anonymization
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.040]   of large data sets.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.720]   How to break anonymity of Netflix prize data set.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.200]   Party poopers.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.800]   They're from here in Austin.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.300]   Yes.
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.720]   We should go get them.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.360]   Hook them horns.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.320]   You got to do this, right?
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.900]   I always think of that as Aussie Osborn.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:03.160]   So the Federal Trade Commission said, wait.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.040]   Hold on there.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.600]   And a lawsuit has been filed.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.020]   And that means Netflix is going to shelve its plans
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.800]   for the sequel.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.440]   It's really too bad because that kind of data,
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.340]   that aggregate data, if we can find the way
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.560]   to anonymize it, really has value for research.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.880]   I've written about this when it comes to medicine
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.680]   that if we knew what happened in my latest medical condition,
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.080]   if we knew what people were doing 24 hours before they got it,
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.360]   maybe there's something in there that's valuable.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.000]   And if we just lock everything in the earth down to privacy,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.240]   we're losing something as a society.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.240]   We're losing an opportunity.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:38.840]   I agree.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.720]   I've applied just recently for the Personal Genome Project.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.520]   This is something that Harvard geneticists is doing.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.980]   And what they ask you to do is submit your genome
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.660]   and then submit all of your medical records.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.700]   Everything.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.380]   Your height, your weight, your hair color, everything.
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.020]   They call it your phenotype.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:03.140]   And by doing that, they can match the two together.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.940]   But one of the things they say is,
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.780]   we can't guarantee the anonymity.
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.780]   So we're going to warn you right up front.
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.700]   We're going to print your name.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.060]   We're going to tell everybody.
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.300]   In fact, they are even offering--
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.460]   they've got 11 people who have done it so far,
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:23.820]   including Esther Dyson, who is the most famous.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:28.140]   You can get a strain of Esther Dyson's cells
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.420]   because she participated in it if you want,
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.940]   because the researchers need that.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.780]   And so this wouldn't be any good if they basically said,
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.220]   recognizing the kinds of things that these guys at UT
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.100]   have realized, you can't anonymize these data sets.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.300]   So we're not going to promise it.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.980]   We're going to, in fact, make it public.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.420]   And what you could do with it.
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:50.020]   Jake, what was the letter Neemoye Christmas napkin?
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:50.940]   The Big Bang Theory.
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.220]   The Big Bang Theory, that's it.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.660]   That's a TV show.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.300]   Who got his--
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.700]   Penny gave Sheldon--
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.500]   she works in a restaurant, and Leonard Neemoye
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.300]   came in to a restaurant.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.060]   So she saved the napkin for Sheldon.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:03.900]   And it has his--
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.500]   And it's happy that he could create his own letter Neemoye.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.300]   Well, how far are we from that, really?
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.140]   I think you could sell Leo kits.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.700]   Well, I applied.
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.900]   You have to get accepted to this.
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.780]   But if I get accepted, they draw blood.
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.660]   You actually have to fly to Cambridge.
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.340]   And they draw blood.
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.260]   They do the genotype.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.620]   Then they do a long questionnaire.
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:23.820]   If you get accepted, and you have to--
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.740]   What's the basis of acceptance?
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.260]   You have to--
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.140]   besides applying, you have to fill out questionnaires.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.380]   And they really--
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.900]   one of the things you really have to do
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.380]   is say, I understand the risks of what I'm doing.
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.460]   And it's not just risks to you.
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.380]   It's risks to your family.
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.980]   What is your wife and family?
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.060]   They have to approve it too.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.060]   They have to say yes to you.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.060]   Absolutely.
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.060]   But what about your unborn children?
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.060]   They don't get accepted.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.060]   They don't get accepted.
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.500]   They are none of those.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.940]   So that's one of the reasons I feel comfortable.
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.900]   Are you sure I'm positive?
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.100]   There's no way that could happen.
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.180]   But my kids will have to say yes, because half of their genotype
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.380]   will be known.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.460]   And if I have a predisposition towards alcoholism
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.380]   or something, it could hurt them in the marketplace.
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.660]   But it's exactly as you say, Jeff.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.220]   You lose something in society by this.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.740]   I think we have to deal with this.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.100]   Today, Dana Boyd, who's brilliant,
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.140]   gave a keynote here at South by Southwest
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.020]   about privacy and publicity and raising
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.420]   a lot of good concerns.
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.220]   And when companies don't realize how they think that something's
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.620]   a little bit public, they make it very public what that does.
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:31.500]   And that's all true.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.460]   But I think we never talk about the benefits of publicness
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.780]   that we have today.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.020]   And what's a good point.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:41.140]   I mean, you, like me, are very public and open.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.940]   You were open about your surgery, about your condition.
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.940]   And do you think there's a value to it?
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.740]   And you told me the role that I was incontinent and nibbident.
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.340]   Yes, after you did.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.060]   But did you see the value in that?
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:51.580]   Absolutely.
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:52.540]   And you're willing to take that chance.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.220]   Absolutely.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.860]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.740]   So these are the-- I'm just showing you the public profiles.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.980]   They have people's names.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.700]   They have everything about them.
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.780]   Like I said, you can get a cell strain from them.
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.020]   It's out there.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.780]   And if I get accepted, it'll be out there for me.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.380]   But I feel like I can, since I already do live in public,
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.180]   I can accept that lack of privacy.
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.740]   And it is for the public wheel.
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.980]   So it's worth doing that.
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.340]   For those of us who are willing to do that,
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.340]   it's worth doing that.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:17.860]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.180]   But you also can't ask anybody who's--
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.540]   just because I'm a member of Netflix--
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.860]   No, that's true.
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.020]   My data shouldn't be public necessarily, right?
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:26.460]   It's a challenge.
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.940]   It's got to be informed consent.
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.940]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.700]   But I think it's important, as you say,
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:36.460]   to recognize the value in this living in public, too.
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.940]   There is some value to it.
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.020]   It's not merely exhibitionism on our chart.
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.140]   I'm not a Netflix customer.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.700]   Are there dirty movies at Netflix?
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:43.540]   Or just a-- there are--
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.860]   There are-- well, they're not X-rated movies.
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.020]   But there are certainly sufficiently dirty that, well,
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.740]   you know, I'm on this thing called Blippi, which--
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.460]   What are you nodding?
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.700]   You're going, yeah.
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.700]   So Blippi.com is a Twitter.
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.580]   But what it tweets automatically is what you buy.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.780]   So your Netflix is on there.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.500]   Your iTunes is on there.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.900]   And as well as your credit cards, if you put them on there.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.060]   And I'm fairly public.
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.260]   But every once in a while, a movie crosses the stream
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:13.060]   that I'm going, oh, I don't know if I should really mention that.
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.580]   I didn't know if they--
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.500]   maybe my audience wouldn't like the gay,
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.140]   girl-girl-in-prisoned movies that I don't like.
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.940]   So you opt to have your Netflix data public then.
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:24.460]   You choose that.
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.020]   And do you do it on a per-case basis?
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:26.460]   Like--
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.660]   You could, but who's going to do that?
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.140]   But who's going to take the time to do that, right?
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.060]   So you just decided to--
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.300]   Blippi gives you that granularity.
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.260]   I think it's great.
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.700]   And again, speaking to your point,
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.700]   I've got so much out of seeing what other people buy.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.420]   I've bought stuff that they-- oh, that's great.
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.140]   Or that movie is greater.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.300]   So there's real value to our sharing this information.
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.260]   I guess it's just a question of an informed consent
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.340]   and knowing what you're doing.
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:48.460]   Absolutely.
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.060]   But it works for me.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.300]   Google Buzz is going to--
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.940]   are you disappointed with the lack of speed--
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.100]   I was talking to somebody yesterday,
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.940]   the speed in improvements in Buzz.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.740]   Do you feel like they made a commitment?
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:01.420]   How about you, Jake?
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.420]   Do you use Buzz?
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.140]   No, I don't.
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:03.860]   You use Twitter.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:04.540]   Yep.
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.020]   Why don't you use Buzz?
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.500]   It's just-- I don't like the fact that this is in Gmail.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:08.940]   It's just--
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:09.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.940]   If it was separate, I might consider using it.
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:11.860]   Well, that's problem one.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.420]   In fact, that's one of the things they're addressing,
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.220]   more inbox management features.
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:15.740]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.980]   And that was Data Boyd's main point today.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.660]   Jake was there with me that the big mistake
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.420]   was that they mixed the public and private.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.940]   Well, people thought their email was becoming public.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.260]   Because Buzz is not clear, is it?
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:27.260]   Right.
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.260]   No.
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.700]   And it shows up when you click all mail.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.700]   It's just all there.
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.660]   It's too much to handle.
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.740]   It's also not clear which buzzes are public
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:35.940]   and which buzzes are private.
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:36.460]   Mm-hmm.
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.980]   Right.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.420]   And again, for people like you and me, Jeff, we don't care.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.780]   But I can easily see why other people would--
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.620]   I'll show you my tattoos.
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:43.940]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.980]   I can easily see why other people would care.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.380]   Right.
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.780]   So I guess Google's--
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.700]   according to a Clint Bolton writing in Google Watch,
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.140]   the Buzz team is listening to your pleas.
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.500]   They sent out a brief buzz that it's
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.780]   working on two features to cut down the noise.
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:05.020]   One, settings to control what gets sent to your inbox, yay.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.820]   Although we've all figured out how to filter it.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.340]   Yep.
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.140]   But this way, you don't have to do that.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.660]   You'll be able to choose whether these buzz items get
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.500]   sent to your inbox.
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.740]   Comments on your posts, comments on posts after you comment on them,
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.700]   comments on posts after you're at replied on them.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.620]   See, I just turned it all off.
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.140]   It seems like a lot of configuration.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:22.660]   Yeah.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.980]   This is the almost too many choices thing
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.980]   that Android suffers from a little bit.
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:27.980]   I mean, it's great choices.
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:28.420]   Geeks love that.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.420]   Geeks love it.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:29.940]   And I love it.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.940]   But it's like so many choices.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.580]   I am filtering buzz, so it doesn't show up in my inbox.
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:35.780]   But we have no granularity.
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.460]   I just filter everything label buzz.
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:37.960]   Right.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.620]   It's out.
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.180]   And I'm also-- it bothers me to see that big unread number.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.820]   So I'm using a grease monkey user script
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.500]   to actually hide the number so that I can just dip in when I
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.620]   want, but I don't have inbox guilt.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:49.900]   I have their unread items.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.380]   Twitter, you can go to whenever you want.
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.140]   But Buzz, it makes you feel obligated to click that.
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:53.660]   It does.
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:54.140]   It does.
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:54.860]   It's a really good line.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.300]   It's a good email metaphor.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.300]   Exactly.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.140]   Yes, that's the problem.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.220]   You're mixing metaphors.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.860]   That's really the problem here.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.500]   So I don't have any problem with having huge numbers
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.300]   of unread messages in any of my inboxes.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:06.780]   I just gave up on that.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:07.460]   I know.
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.060]   You've read some of mine.
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.980]   I gave up on that a long time ago.
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:11.940]   You just-- you can't.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:12.940]   I mean, come on.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.060]   You're inbox zero.
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.620]   See, Merlin still impacted you, Gina.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.380]   I am.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.740]   I am because I'm a special kind of uptight.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:21.580]   Really?
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.540]   You know, well, it's just--
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.700]   I worry that something important is just
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.620]   going to fall down the stream.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.620]   I'm not going to fall down the stream.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.980]   I know it's going to fall down the stream.
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.500]   And if it comes back up again, that's
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.580]   actually the rule you gave me.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.540]   But if it comes back again, then OK.
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.540]   It's important.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.380]   It is like it to do this.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.940]   But as a freelance, there's something important
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.220]   could mean my next play check.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.220]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.740]   So it just becomes like--
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.420]   you know what I mean?
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.380]   So at Life Hacker, we got tons and tons of email.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.660]   In our tips box, I could dip into checkout.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.940]   And if I missed something, it was like, it'll bubble up fine.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.860]   But if our freelancer is talking to clients,
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:50.020]   I'm looking for work.
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.260]   That's the key.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:52.900]   That's why email is so different.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.900]   That's why they mixing metaphors didn't work.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.740]   Because there is a difference between your buzzes
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.580]   and your tweets and your email.
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:02.380]   Your email should be somehow separated and saturated.
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.540]   Has anyone done any studies yet on how much of one's Twitter
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.820]   feed is read on average?
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.860]   And there's a assumption that the rate
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.620]   base-- the circulation of Twitter is that everybody reads it.
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.180]   But not, obviously not.
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:14.660]   Obviously not.
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.860]   Although I've talked to people who go back, scroll back,
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.860]   what they missed.
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.580]   That's crazy.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.700]   That's crazy, Tom.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:20.900]   I agree.
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:21.500]   That's crazy, Tom.
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.620]   But that's not an inbox.
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.460]   That's a stream.
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.700]   There's a stream passes by, and an inbox sits there and waits
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.860]   for you and pons you with an unread number.
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.420]   You weren't saying that you do that, Jake.
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.420]   No, no.
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.580]   You just dip it in whenever you see it.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.540]   I thought I was going to use the lists to create those people
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.460]   I really don't want to miss.
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:38.740]   There are some people I don't want to miss.
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:39.780]   But I haven't used it that way.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.340]   Because it's another damn stream.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:41.340]   Yeah.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.340]   Who has time?
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.340]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:43.860]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:44.900]   Jake, it's so nice to see you.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.140]   Anything you'd like to say about South by Southwest,
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.060]   are you excited about this?
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:48.660]   It's good to be here.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.260]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:49.660]   It's cool.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.980]   Jake will be a freshman in college next year.
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.180]   You don't know where yet, do you?
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.180]   Not yet, no.
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.180]   How's your going?
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.180]   No, still waiting.
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:57.180]   Any minute now, though, right?
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.180]   Right.
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.180]   Soon.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.180]   He's got a couple of weeks.
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.180]   Oh, you did?
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.180]   Rochester.
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.180]   Congratulations.
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.180]   Thank you.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.180]   That's a great school.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.180]   You want to go to a tech school.
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:07.180]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.180]   Yeah, that's a great school.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.180]   So you got that in your back pocket.
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.180]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:10.180]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.180]   Now we get to let the other guys decide.
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.180]   They're worthy of you.
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.180]   Next few weeks.
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.180]   That's great.
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.180]   Why don't we bring Matt?
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.180]   Is Matt here?
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.180]   Matt, how we come back?
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.180]   Come on over, Matt.
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.180]   We'd love to have you.
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.180]   Come on over.
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.180]   What is a legend on the internet?
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.180]   This guy's my hero.
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.180]   Yeah.
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:30.180]   Meta-filter.
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.180]   And what else are you doing these days, Matt?
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.180]   What is "fuelie"?
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.180]   It's a...
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.180]   Get real close to the mic, yeah.
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:41.180]   Completely public, open miles per gallon tracker.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.180]   So like fuel, LY.com.
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:48.180]   It's pretty cool because you can like, you know, feel like for a new car, you can see real world
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.180]   mileage from like 25,000 people.
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:55.180]   So you have something to think, you have a thought about then this notion that there's some value to being public in your data.
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.180]   Yeah, and we were totally upfront about that.
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.180]   And we still get like an email a week.
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.180]   People going, "I don't want people to know I fueled up."
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:10.180]   Or that I got terrible gas mileage or people can just go to the browsing vehicles to see like a random vehicle.
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:11.180]   This is fantastic.
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.180]   Yeah.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.180]   So how does that happen automatically?
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:19.180]   No, you can ask a messa, or you can use a web app, just pop in your miles.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:21.180]   So this is like Blippi and a lot of other services.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:24.180]   You could connect with Blippi, is there other data?
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:27.180]   There's an RSS out for the data.
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:31.180]   Yeah, Blippi right now is like, they do the deals with the companies and the credit cards.
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:35.180]   I don't think they have a way of adding stuff to it, which is too bad.
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.180]   They really ought to.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.180]   That would be really interesting if you could have a whole...
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.180]   This is Phillip Kaplan's one of the cool guys involved in the startup.
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:42.180]   Well, it's so nice to see you Matt.
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:45.180]   So what was it like in the old days at South by Southwest?
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.180]   It was tiny.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:47.180]   Really?
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:50.180]   Yeah, so I've been here, this is my seventh year.
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.180]   I've been here 10 years.
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:54.180]   10 years ago we did like the first weblogs panel ever.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:56.180]   Like 40 people showed up.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.180]   I am a blogger.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:09.180]   And then the tech books, you know, boom and then bus happened and then Southwest Southwest went from like 500 people down to maybe 150 people into 2001 to first interact.
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:12.180]   There's people in the bar down stairs.
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:16.180]   It was just one row of four, you know, rooms, that was it.
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.180]   And there would be two or three things happening at one time.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.180]   Then it would be like four panels at once.
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.180]   Now it's 23 in every slot.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.180]   Every time it drives me crazy.
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.180]   And three different buildings.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.180]   There's over 10,000 people here for it.
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.180]   It's crazy.
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.180]   Why do you think that is?
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.180]   What's happened?
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.180]   It used to just be like blogger summer camp.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:42.180]   I mean like you knew the 150 people, they're all sort of active bloggers and it was like, you know, seeing friends again.
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:48.180]   It's hard to get, you know, more than five people, be recognized together in the same place now.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:51.180]   Finding them among like a thousand people at a party.
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.180]   It's not easy.
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:53.180]   That age is so much over.
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:57.180]   I was talking to Dave Weiner through links about the original blogger cons that he held.
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.180]   Right.
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:02.180]   And there was kind of a magical moment in the blog world where you really had that.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:06.180]   Gee, I get to meet you moment and you knew everybody, but it was that over.
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.180]   It's still kind of when you've, I mean, just for me to see you guys.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.180]   Oh yeah.
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.180]   You should get that experience, right?
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.180]   So Matt, you're feeling well?
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.180]   Because you had an amazing blog, talk about living in public.
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.180]   You had an amazing blog post.
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:20.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.180]   What's that?
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.180]   Two, three months ago.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.180]   Which we talked about on the show at length.
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.180]   We did.
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.180]   Oh yeah.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.180]   Sorry, I missed that show.
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.180]   I mean I wrote a post for friends and I thought, you know, there weren't that many stories out there on the web.
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.180]   I might as well share it and see what other people.
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:41.180]   I mean, I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:46.180]   I mean, I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:51.180]   I mean, I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:56.180]   I mean, I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:59.180]   I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:02.180]   I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:07.180]   I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:12.180]   I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:17.180]   I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:22.180]   I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:25.180]   I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:28.180]   I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:33.180]   I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:38.180]   I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:43.180]   I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:48.180]   I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:53.180]   I was like, I'm not sure if I was going to be able to get a picture of it.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:58.180]   What I had was when two bloggers in LA, famous ones Matt Welch and Ken Lane,
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:02.180]   saw my first posts thanks to Nick Denton and said something about them and linked to them.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:06.180]   I responded and I realized it's a conversation.
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.180]   Distributed but a conversation.
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:12.180]   That was a pathetic commentary of my life that was a life changing moment.
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.180]   But it was.
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:16.180]   By revealing, you saw that value that comes back.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.180]   Haven't you learned that from the beginning of blogging?
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:25.180]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:31.180]   Your thoughts and just like, you know, love was coming in in 2099 and it's still to this day.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.180]   Great connections from.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:38.180]   I do remember the first time I started a blog and I thought, this is, I felt egotistical.
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:41.180]   It felt like it was very self-centered.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.180]   I was already on TV and I was already doing pretty egotistical things.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:47.180]   And even then it felt like, this is like creepy.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.180]   What is wrong with me that I'm doing this?
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.180]   But I guess you quickly get reinforced that this is something.
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:58.180]   Yeah, and I think some aspects is like a reaction to elections and the way the politics has done this country really dig up.
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:04.180]   Some tiny aspect of someone's life from 12 years ago or 22 years ago where they said something.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.180]   And I was like, you know what, I work with databases.
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:12.180]   And I was like, you know, if we were all completely public, like, you know, 20 years from now,
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.180]   it was like Facebook generation.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:17.180]   Everyone's drunk in pictures on there and people getting fired for it.
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.180]   But like 20 years from now, it's going to be ridiculous.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.180]   You could railroad anybody.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:26.180]   So I was thinking when everyone's skeletons are out of their closets, there will be no skeletons in college.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.180]   You've fully assured humiliation.
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.180]   Right.
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:30.180]   That's how you know, I love it.
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:34.180]   Maybe the discourse will raise up, you know, because we're all.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.180]   Tell her with a little raise.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.180]   But how many of you have had a stalker?
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.180]   That's true.
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.180]   I mean, you have.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.180]   You have.
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.180]   I have.
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.180]   I have.
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:43.180]   I have.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.180]   I have as well.
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.180]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.180]   And does the testosterone keep you from being like, uh...
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.180]   No, no.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.180]   It happened to me long ago when I was on the radio and TV.
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.180]   I mean, I kind of dealt with that from being a public figure.
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:58.180]   I think you get, I think it's actually better the more human you are.
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:01.180]   I think a lot of that comes from being somewhat distant.
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.180]   Yeah, I got a moment.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.180]   I was a columnist in San Francisco, then I got it now.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.180]   And it was spookier, I think.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.180]   So it's creepy.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:12.540]   With like 100,000 people over, like, a long, you know, whatever micro fame media career
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:17.660]   online, you know, one in 100,000 is going to be off their meds and off their rocker.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:21.100]   It sucks when it happens in like the first month or the first year of it.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.580]   But after like five years of it, you know, like, yeah, how much is that a threat?
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.620]   We have a nut job who's calling our home, who I think has no idea who we are.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.180]   And so it also can happen randomly.
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:34.860]   Yeah, but the thing is, is like, do I want that one weird person who I totally expect
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.580]   to know exactly where I am in the moment?
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.580]   Like what I'm buying?
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:38.580]   I can understand that.
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.580]   I don't know.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:44.580]   I'm probably my home address and home phone off the web, maybe around 2000 years ago.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:50.860]   We also live in a little bit of a bubble because we still are talking to a small subculture
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:55.020]   that is more higher educated, more normal, more higher functioning.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:58.820]   You know, you're not really, I mean, that's the difference in mainstream media and what
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:02.180]   we do when you're on, you know, entertainment tonight.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.180]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.780]   You're talking to everybody and you're much more likely.
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:10.940]   And Leo, it's even more than that and chat room blush here because you have an incredibly
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:11.940]   nice audience.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.940]   Well, but I'm serious.
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:13.940]   I'm serious.
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:14.940]   They've been, they've been me.
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:18.540]   But, well, no, no, but, but, you know, you take somebody like me and I'm a gray beard
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.980]   in here and you invite me into this world and I'm not part of this world.
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:25.420]   And there is an incredible welcoming nature to your audience.
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.460]   They're very nice people stop me here and say, oh, that's great.
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:29.460]   It's a reflection.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.020]   It really is true of the people who've gathered around you.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.020]   Well, that's good.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.020]   And it's a reflection.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.180]   We are living in a bubble, right?
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.580]   It's the Leo bubble.
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.980]   Well, and that's done a similar thing, a meta filter.
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.940]   And I think what it is, it's a meritocracy, right?
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:49.540]   What we do is we celebrate merit regardless of other externalities, whether you're a man
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:54.260]   or a woman or black or white, none of that matters age or anything.
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:58.180]   And so when you celebrate merit, I think you attract a certain kind of person and you kind
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:59.180]   of foster that.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.020]   Well, I'd love to foster that more globally.
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.700]   I mean, that's a really great way to be.
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.420]   It's not the way the world really works yet.
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.980]   But maybe we're utopianists.
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.460]   Maybe a lot of what we're talking about is wishful thinking.
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.460]   But maybe you can have it.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.460]   All you ever do is shut down to the worst common denominator.
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.460]   Yes, you can find a reason to do nothing.
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.460]   Right.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.460]   That's true.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:22.780]   But you got to try and but try with caution and with wisdom.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:23.780]   And I think you're right, Gina.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:27.340]   It's important for us to let people know what the risks are and what the prices are and
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.100]   then make sure it is their decision.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.700]   I have to say, though, that the chat room can be harsh.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.900]   We've had people come in studios, mostly women.
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:38.300]   And the chat room can make very personal comments that are upsetting to people.
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.700]   This is why I don't look at the chat room.
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:40.700]   Sorry, chat room.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.700]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.700]   I can understand that.
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.780]   And I think you're wise to know what you're...
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:49.020]   And I often tell people who come into our studio, okay, we have chat over there.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.020]   But don't look at it.
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:53.540]   In fact, I sometimes will close it and not have people look at it because it is...
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:54.780]   It can be very difficult.
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.980]   And the truth is most of us, we see one bad thing.
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:58.980]   Even amongst 100 great things.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:02.220]   The one bad thing always seems like the thing that you see.
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.220]   So sorry, chat room.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:04.220]   Most of the chat room is great.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.220]   I think we're not the chat rooms.
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.060]   I'm the chat rooms best friend today.
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.380]   I said nothing but nice things about the chat room.
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.900]   These guys are throwing you under the bus.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.860]   Who loves your chat room?
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:17.380]   See, the chat room is saying really nice things right now.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.300]   They're chat room long to see.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.300]   The truth is they do love you.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.300]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.300]   And you know what?
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:27.300]   I almost want to say first post because every time I come on camera, they go, boy, you
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.540]   look tired today.
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.100]   And I almost was like, oh, that's the first tired of the day.
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.100]   And it happened today.
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.100]   I came in.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.660]   The first thing I say is, gee, Leo looks tired.
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.300]   And you get used to certain things.
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.380]   And you let it run off of you.
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:40.380]   Right?
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.380]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:44.300]   Well, a thick skin is certainly required apparel for a living.
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.300]   But there's a...
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:46.900]   And the key is there's a benefit to it.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:52.020]   So it's worth having a thick skin because of the benefit of the great benefit of being
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:53.860]   more public and so forth.
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:54.860]   True.
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:59.740]   And part of it is that we in media try to clean up the whole world for you and put a
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.460]   box to the bow on it.
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:02.460]   Absolutely.
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:03.940]   But the truth is there are bozos in life.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:04.940]   There are bozos in your head.
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.460]   And we all know who the bozos are.
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:07.700]   We know who the trolls are.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.700]   You bet.
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.700]   Yeah.
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:10.700]   You bet.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.700]   Twits.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.740]   They're just all sorry.
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:19.500]   Search Engine Land writing about US regulators gearing up for a Google AdMob challenge.
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.340]   Of course, Google acquired AdMob.
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:22.660]   Or is trying to.
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.740]   $750 million for this, what was it?
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.220]   Two-year-old company?
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:30.420]   Amazing story.
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:31.420]   Why would it be a...
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.460]   And by the way, Apple was also bidding for them.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.180]   Why would it be a problem for Google to acquire AdMob?
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.340]   Isn't it just more of the same?
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.540]   That's the problem, right?
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:43.260]   It's just more hegemony in advertising.
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.260]   And...
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:50.620]   The FTC is taking a closer look at the deal.
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:55.540]   And of course, the competition doesn't like it too much because it is...
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:58.660]   Surprise, surprise, surprise.
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:44:59.660]   Should it be blocked?
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:00.660]   The Google AdMob acquisition?
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:04.660]   Does that concentrate too much power in Google's hands?
[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.980]   Google has Android already.
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:07.980]   Google has mobile.
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.980]   They're mobile.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.540]   And it needs to be able to help support that.
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:16.340]   And those of us who want to create content for it and support local news on it, AdMob
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:18.020]   could be helpful to us.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.260]   So blocking it is a non-market inanity.
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.260]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.260]   Yeah.
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.820]   I'm with you on that one, man.
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.060]   Jordan, anybody order an iPad?
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.060]   Yeah, Matt saying yes.
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:32.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.060]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.060]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:35.060]   Ordered one for Matt.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.060]   Sucker.
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.060]   Every employee.
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:38.060]   You ordered a bunch?
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.060]   Yeah.
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:40.060]   I don't want for Matt.
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.060]   Yeah.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.060]   Well, I was talking with my CFO about whether we should get one for every employee.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.500]   And we thought, well, we'll get a couple, we'll try them out and then maybe we'll see
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:45.500]   if we want to get there.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.500]   How many of you ordered so far?
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:47.500]   Four.
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.500]   Can I work for you or you?
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:53.020]   I'm going to go with the like, let it come out.
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:54.020]   See the people.
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.820]   That would be the wise thing to do.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:56.820]   Wow.
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:57.820]   Yeah.
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.660]   I know it's not going to be a good creation device.
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:00.660]   Right.
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.660]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:02.660]   Well, you know, there's some interesting questions.
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.500]   I had a question on the radio show, a guy who goes around to schools.
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.100]   He's a marine biologist, does presentations.
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:13.500]   Wanted to know there's a connector that goes from the iPad to a VGA.
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.500]   So you can put it, you know, put it out on a projector.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.900]   And it's got this mobile keynote for $10 that they're making.
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.780]   He was wondering, is it going to be able to, can I do the keynote presentations with it?
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.500]   I said, we don't know, but that would be annoying if Apple didn't, you know, sort of
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:27.500]   --
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.500]   --Kino presentations demos.
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.500]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:31.500]   It looked pretty cool.
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.500]   Yeah.
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.940]   And if you could do, you know, take this little thing with you, have little presentations,
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.420]   plug it in, put it on the screen.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.220]   I think there might be a, that's just yet another way it could be used.
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.220]   I'm pretty explosion-ish.
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:45.500]   I can't wait for just being a tall guy in coach class, not having a keyboard.
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.620]   Like, I'll just have just the screen to watch movies.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:49.780]   That's all I want.
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.900]   You know, we're running out of time, Adam.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.700]   Do you mind if I don't bring Adam on?
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:54.700]   I mean, he's here.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:55.900]   Is it okay with you?
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:57.460]   Come on over and just say hi.
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:58.460]   Just say hi.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.020]   It's great to see you, Matt.
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.020]   Thank you so much.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.660]   We just love Matt Howie.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:08.900]   Just one of the pioneers of the internet and a great blogger and just a really great guy,
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:09.900]   obviously beloved.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.900]   Adam, nice to see you.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:12.900]   Good to see you.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.540]   So congratulations.
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.540]   That's good.
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:16.540]   Yeah.
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:17.540]   It's a great book.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:18.540]   Completewaveguy.com.
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:19.540]   One more plug.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.900]   And when you were on you said you're also working on a Buzz Guy.
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:22.900]   Yeah, is that right?
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:23.900]   No, that wasn't Adam.
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:24.900]   That was a- Kevin.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:25.900]   Kevin.
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.620]   Yeah, he's working on the Android guy.
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:29.620]   Android.
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.260]   Nobody's doing a Buzz Guy?
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.260]   Come on, maybe you would like, yeah.
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:36.500]   I don't know, if they keep adding options, perhaps a guide will be required.
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:37.500]   That's the theory.
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:38.500]   The title?
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:39.500]   Buzz.
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.860]   What gives?
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:43.420]   So Adam, you're your editor.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:45.060]   What is your title again?
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.060]   Editor.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:47.060]   Editor.
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.060]   Editor.
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.060]   I think in chief now they added it to the best test for-
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.060]   Oh, you're in chief?
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.060]   Did you make it more money for that?
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:52.060]   I'm on the next one.
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.060]   Oh, all right.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:54.260]   I'll take it to the table.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.260]   That's very good.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:00.580]   How's the South by Southwest treat name, John?
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:01.580]   Good so far, yeah.
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:02.580]   It's really- Yeah.
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:04.740]   I mean, it's been the typical thing.
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.980]   I've been to an area panel.
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:07.980]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:08.980]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.820]   It's about- But I've seen a lot of great people and had a lot of great conversations.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:13.900]   That's the new slogan I decided.
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:15.700]   South by Southwest, it's made of people.
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:16.700]   It's made of people.
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.700]   How about that?
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:18.700]   It's like soiling.
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:19.700]   What do you think?
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.060]   I just invented that just now.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:25.020]   So let's get to our tip tool and number of the week.
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.260]   Now Gina, I know you were scrambling to get one, but that's why I brought Adam over
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.780]   in case you wanted to get him to do a tip for us.
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:32.780]   Oh yeah.
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:33.780]   Oh yeah, she says.
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.780]   Adam, you got any tips for us?
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.340]   There are a few of them.
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.020]   I was going to do- Oh yeah, talk about it.
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:42.220]   So there's a new Gmail Labs feature.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.900]   This is good for people who get their pop email and Gmail.
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:46.900]   It was annoying.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.580]   Before, you know, you'd enter your credentials for a pop account and it would fetch your
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.260]   email at sort of random times.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:54.660]   If you got a lot of email with Dude Moroffin, if you didn't, it wouldn't do very often.
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:59.140]   So if you go to Gmail Labs now, there's a new Labs feature called- I believe it's just
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.540]   called Refresh Pop.
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:02.540]   Let's see.
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:04.700]   You can kind of manually force it.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:05.700]   Refresh Pop accounts.
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:07.940]   Yeah, so it adds a link at the top of your inbox.
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.540]   So you click the link, say Refresh, and it will repop your messages from your external
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:12.540]   account.
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:15.020]   So it makes it easier to kind of consolidate our accounts in Gmail.
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:16.540]   That's great.
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.220]   So turn that on.
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:23.620]   We also bookmarked the one about adding this continued Quick Search box.
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:29.020]   So Quick Search box was an application that the guy who made Quick Silver, I think was
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.420]   behind when he went- Yeah, Nicholas Jitkoff.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.420]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:36.020]   He went to Google and he made it for Max.
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:43.020]   And then they released it for Windows as part of the Google toolbar, I believe was the only
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.540]   way you can install it.
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:47.340]   Which is insane because no one wants to install the Google toolbar.
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:48.460]   No, it wants the toolbar.
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:53.580]   So it's like if you want this application, it's just like an application launcher.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:56.660]   Install this toolbar, which is actually like the most backwards.
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:01.580]   I mean, you always unclick installing the like Yahoo!
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:04.580]   Ask.com toolbar or whatever when you're installing applications.
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:08.940]   So anyway, yeah, I guess they've discontinued it from that, but you can still install it.
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:14.340]   Yeah, the trick is to install Google toolbar, move the folder for Quick Search, then uninstall
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:15.340]   Google toolbar.
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.540]   It won't find the folder, but you still have the application.
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:20.820]   I think it's been abandoned though, right?
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:24.940]   So no one wants to forget about it.
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:25.940]   Forget about it.
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:31.980]   If I may intrude on tip land- Please do.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:37.260]   There's a new fast window in Gmail that I haven't been able to use yet, but I find it true that
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.220]   I think I'm in tab think.
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.180]   As in Gmail, you're in screen think.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.260]   It drives me nuts.
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:46.820]   So they created a means to create a new window using Gmail.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.220]   And it's great because it's one of those things when it used to be if you popped up
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:55.140]   a new window, it would do the whole loading thing and it sucked.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:56.140]   And now it's super fast.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:57.140]   It's great.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.660]   I mean, if you do that ever, which a lot of people don't.
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.420]   Yeah, a lot of new window person, but...
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:05.460]   I do when I'm trying, when I want to look at an email while I'm composing another one.
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:07.460]   She has great tabs to you.
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:08.940]   I'm mad at tabs.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:09.940]   Too many.
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:10.940]   You're worse than I am.
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:11.940]   Oh, no, that's a geek thing.
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:12.940]   How many tabs?
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:13.940]   Yeah.
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:15.940]   And you can't read any of the text on the tab, doesn't you know?
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:16.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:19.620]   But it's just the fav icon.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.860]   Actually Google is here at South by Southwest, according to the official Google blog.
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:26.340]   Representatives from Google and YouTube are on more than 20 panels.
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.380]   That was a number of...
[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:29.380]   Was it really?
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:30.380]   No, it's right.
[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.380]   Was it really?
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.140]   I thought you said another number.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:34.140]   All right.
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:36.260]   At the Google booth, there's a Google booth.
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:37.460]   I didn't even know there were booths here.
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.060]   There's booths hidden somewhere.
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:40.060]   Any swag from Google?
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:41.060]   Anybody been there?
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:43.060]   We have a Google map.
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:44.060]   We're going to talk about it.
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.060]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.060]   That's one of my tools.
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:48.060]   Like his bike routes just launched?
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:49.060]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.060]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:54.020]   On Sunday, the all day hackathon will give you a chance to get your hands dirty and build
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:57.100]   applications using a variety of Google technologies.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:01.340]   There'll be prizes, including Android phones, Gina, for the best apps.
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.900]   They're giving away those phones, man.
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:07.820]   Yeah, we're back, Bill.
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:09.660]   All right.
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:14.060]   So let's get to our number of the week if you are ready, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.820]   Well, do you have installed it by now?
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.900]   I didn't mention it.
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:22.900]   99.9, just to get a news update in here, which is the financial time says that that is now
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:25.980]   the odds that Google will, in fact, pull out of China.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:26.980]   99.9%.
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:27.980]   Wow.
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:28.980]   How would they know?
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:29.980]   Is this the betting on this?
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:30.980]   Sources.
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:32.660]   But that's the word we'll see.
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.260]   They still have said a date.
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.260]   Are they even negotiating?
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.860]   Evidently, they have been and it has gone nowhere.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:40.100]   That's what the word is.
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:41.460]   Going badly.
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:43.940]   I forgot what my tool was, but I have a couple of good tools.
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:47.620]   We mentioned already that Google Maps has biking directions, which is just fantastic.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:50.220]   I think that's a wonderful thing for them to add.
[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:52.860]   And Gina has donated a tool.
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:56.900]   This is in the Google Shopping for mobile application.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.060]   It's not even really an application.
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.620]   It's just the mobile version of Google Shopping.
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:03.540]   They now have an in-stock feature.
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:08.340]   So if you do a search within your mobile version of Google Shopping, I presume if it
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:13.060]   does it, the mobile version will not do it in the full-size version.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:18.660]   There's now, if you do a search for a product, you will see whether it's in-stock.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:22.460]   And if you click the in-stock nearby button, it'll show you the stores that have it.
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:26.940]   Very handy if you're searching for something that will be out of stock like an iPad or
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:28.860]   a Wii or something like that.
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:30.860]   It's pretty small.
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:31.860]   It's limited.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:32.860]   It's a business-sized series.
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:36.180]   There's a service that does this already that has like 25 or something.
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.180]   But obviously, you have an API.
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.380]   It's pretty easy to see how you just add it in.
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:42.580]   I was visiting Best Buy this week, which is really fascinating.
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:45.420]   Best Buy sees itself as becoming a media company.
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:46.420]   And they are.
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:47.740]   They sell advertising in circulars.
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:51.900]   They sell advertising in the stores, end caps, displays, and all this.
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:53.660]   And work with Google on this kind of stuff.
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:59.140]   At a very local level, you take the disadvantage of retail as brick and mortar becomes an advantage
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:00.140]   again.
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:01.140]   And it becomes an advantage.
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:04.460]   And this isn't a great tool, but I think somebody like you in New York would love this.
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:07.660]   This is an 8-bit Google Maps mashup.
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:08.660]   8-bit NYC.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:09.660]   Have you seen this, Jeff?
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:10.660]   It's amazing.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:11.660]   It's amazing.
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:12.660]   It's amazing.
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.660]   It's amazing.
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:15.860]   It looks like a cross-stitch that I want to have on a umbrella.
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:17.340]   Zoom in on that.
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:18.340]   And let's zoom in on Brooklyn.
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:19.340]   Alright.
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:20.340]   Where's Brooklyn here?
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:22.340]   Right in the south.
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:23.340]   Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn there.
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:24.340]   Alright.
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:25.340]   Now we're going to zoom in.
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:27.780]   The plus sign is up on the left-hand corner there.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:29.020]   Oh, I see.
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:30.020]   Okay.
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.020]   Left-hand corner plus.
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:35.460]   So as you zoom in, the little block trees and the little...
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:36.460]   Oh, it's so cool.
[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:37.460]   But it's pretty complete.
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:38.460]   I guess this is a actual...
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:39.460]   I want to get little tiny people.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:40.460]   8-bit people.
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:41.460]   Yeah, seriously.
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:45.140]   And if you're in Austin, by the way, they've just launched an 8-bit Austin as well.
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:48.540]   So we can zoom in on Austin as if it's an 8-bit game.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:51.540]   It's the number 8-B-I-T-A-U-S-T-I-N.com.
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:57.700]   Or if you want to go to 8-bit New York, it's 8, the number 8-B-I-T-N-Y-C.com.
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:59.300]   And it's just cool.
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:02.980]   If you're an old Nintendo player, it's just a Commodore 64 player.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:04.420]   It's just a cool thing to have.
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:07.220]   So if you pan too far over to New Jersey, it just kind of stops.
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.220]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.300]   You got a problem with that?
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:12.220]   It goes 16-bit all of a sudden.
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:13.220]   Hey.
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:14.220]   It just stops.
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:15.220]   It's great to stop.
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:17.220]   And credit to Brett Camper, who came up with this.
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.740]   Because the world pretty much ends tomorrow.
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:20.820]   Watch it, lady.
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.420]   I love it.
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:23.260]   I love it.
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:26.340]   Hey, it's so fun to have everybody real and live and in person here.
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:28.300]   Oh, I was going to mention that there's going to be an event.
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:32.300]   If you're in Austin this afternoon, Sunday afternoon
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.460]   at the co-working facility where we are the Texas co-working
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:38.020]   facility, there's going to be an open Linux event from 1
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:39.060]   to 4 in the afternoon.
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:43.460]   So come if you'd like to come to that, it's open to-- is it open to badge holders only,
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.020]   or anybody?
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:45.900]   Anybody into the open source thing?
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:48.540]   And our guests, so they don't care about your badge.
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:51.380]   We do really want to thank the folks at the Texas co-working facility
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:52.180]   for letting us be here.
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:52.680]   You really--
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.180]   Brace Base.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.580]   --really great host Paul and the gang.
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:57.260]   Let us use it.
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:01.540]   And thanks especially to New Tech, who brought their tricaster HD
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:03.540]   and cameras and the setup.
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:07.740]   Really nice of you to let us use this for our broadcast today.
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:08.900]   Thanks to Gina Trapani.
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:10.580]   We're so glad to have you here.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:11.420]   So nice to see you.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:12.260]   Congratulations on the book.
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:12.460]   So good to see you.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:13.700]   Give me a big hug.
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:14.940]   I got such a nice hug.
[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:16.020]   The book is out.
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:18.540]   Completewaveguide.com.
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:20.500]   It's a three bones thing.
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.820]   And that's what it says in the back.
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:24.300]   I'm just reading the back.
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.180]   Three ones, three ones.
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:28.300]   It's not a B. That's a one.
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:28.820]   It's a three.
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:29.340]   Well, three ones.
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.140]   B-O-N-A.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:31.380]   It looks like a B. Are you sure?
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:32.660]   Three is.
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:33.900]   I thought it was a Jones thing.
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.620]   It's a Jones thing.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.740]   We were reading way too much of that logo.
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:38.740]   As to that logo.
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:39.420]   Yeah.
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:40.620]   My publisher, three ones.
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:41.420]   Three ones.
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:42.220]   Three ones that comes.
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.260]   Not three bones.
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:44.300]   Not three bones.
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.020]   But if you see something that looks like three bones,
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:48.260]   that's probably it.
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:50.740]   Gina and her co-author Adam Pash.
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:51.980]   Nice to have you here, Adam.
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:52.300]   Yeah, it's just a yes.
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:53.260]   So we really appreciate it.
[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:56.420]   Gina Tripani, of course, is at smartawear.org.
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.100]   That's her blog.
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:59.100]   And a great place to read regularly.
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:01.980]   Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com,
[00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:03.820]   associate professor of journalism
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.620]   at the City University of New York.
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.940]   And great to finally meet you.
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:07.460]   Thanks.
[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:08.820]   So nice to meet you too.
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:11.060]   Jeff, by the way, is the walking wounded.
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:13.300]   He had surgery yesterday and still came.
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:14.140]   I can't believe it.
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:15.420]   I have a little Frankenstein.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:15.780]   You do?
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.340]   You have stitches there.
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:19.100]   I've been staring at that.
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:20.460]   Do they take the nodes out?
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:20.820]   What is it?
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:23.100]   They took out arteries.
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:23.540]   Oh, wow.
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:24.620]   To test the arteries.
[00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:26.740]   I have inflamed arteries.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:29.780]   And they chose that very public place to take them?
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:30.460]   Yep.
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:31.420]   That's where they do it.
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:32.100]   But I'm on drugs.
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:32.900]   I'm feeling better.
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:34.260]   The last two shows I was sick,
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:35.300]   and you didn't even know it.
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:35.780]   Really?
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.060]   Oh, well, I'm glad you're feeling better.
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:37.500]   That's great.
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.540]   And Jeff is very tall.
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:40.820]   I'm probably a good converter.
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.300]   As they say here in Texas, he's a tall drink of water.
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:44.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:45.420]   We thank you for joining us.
[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.620]   We hope we'll see you next week back in studio.
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.220]   This week in Google, I'm Leo Laport.
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:50.380]   Have a great week.
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.980]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:57.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:02.600]   (guitar note)
