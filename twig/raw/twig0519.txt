[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Jeff Jarvis's in studio with us Stacey Higginbotham
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.360]   on the Skype.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.320]   We will talk about YouTubers unionizing the big quarterly results from the big tech companies
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.080]   and an interesting new strategy for marketing the Pixel phone.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.320]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.320]   I'm Twig.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.760]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:36.320]   People you trust.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.160]   This is Twig.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.320]   This week in Google Episode 519.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.000]   Recorded Wednesday July 31st 2019.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.080]   The Jimmy Hoffa Unboxing.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.040]   This week in Google is brought to you by Capeterra.

[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.120]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show where you cover any damn thing we want.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.000]   So I don't want to hear from you.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.680]   We will talk about Google, but we will also talk about Facebook, Twitter and media.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.880]   And guess who's in studio with us to talk about everything and nothing.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.080]   It's Jeff Jarvis of Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.400]   We'll bring you out here.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.600]   The Dean and I visited five years ago.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.040]   She's just a real job unlike me.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.640]   So five years ago, six years ago, we came out and we invented a new degree while we were
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.640]   out here.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.360]   And she came up and she rethought television as a result.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.800]   And then this time we're doing a reprise.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.120]   We're visiting Google, Facebook, Twitter, media.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.600]   You built a beautiful studio at CUNY.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.600]   We did?
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.400]   The journalism is J School there.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.400]   What's your name?
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.400]   Sarah Bartlett.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.400]   Sarah Bartlett.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.400]   Yes.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.920]   But then I always think, oh no, that's West Wing.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.920]   It's not.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.920]   It's not.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.680]   Jeff's sister, Sarah.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.880]   Also with a Stacey Higginbotham from the Wall Street Stacey to North.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.880]   Yes.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.880]   I'm okay with that applause.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.880]   Up in Seattle.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.960]   It's great to see you.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.800]   Wonderful to have you as always.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.080]   It is good to be here.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.240]   Before we start.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.240]   Before we start.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.720]   I have some footage to show.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.480]   Carson Bonny, our producer.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.480]   Uh oh.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.240]   Jeff's drive up here.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.240]   Oh.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.240]   Oh no.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.640]   Oh, should we explain that Jeff does not like bridges?
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.280]   I hate not like bridges.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.600]   I don't like bridges.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   So we have some rather dramatic--
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.520]   By the way, that's PTSD from 9/11.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.520]   Oh.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.000]   We have some rather dramatic footage of him running away from a bridge.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Uh oh.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.200]   We'll bring out the balance of maybe living and just killing him.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   That's you.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   Jeff Jarvis, oh Jeff.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   Jeff used to be the critic for tuning down.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.880]   Oh my god.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.880]   What happened?
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.440]   Now I'm very confused.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.040]   Was that Howard Stern talking?
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.040]   Yes.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.040]   And then--
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.040]   Shh.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.040]   Thank you.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.040]   Wonderful.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.440]   So somebody is listening to Howard Stern talking about-- this is very meta.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.440]   Talking about Jeff.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.440]   Oh, you're in the--
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.440]   And they get into rec.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.440]   You edited that, right?
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.440]   They get rear ended.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.240]   Uh no, that was-- we just found that.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.440]   No, you're kidding me.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.440]   We found that.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.440]   Found.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.440]   Jeff.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440]   Our Jeff.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.440]   Our Jeff.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.440]   All right, rerun.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.440]   Let's do it again.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.440]   All right, all right.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.440]   For the audio.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.440]   For the audio audience.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.440]   I'm a car camera.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.440]   Yes.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.440]   And he's listening to Howard Stern that's the audio.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.040]   And a car comes up from behind in rear ends.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.440]   Jeff Jarvis, oh Jeff.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.440]   Jeff used to be the critic for--
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.240]   Oh, boom.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.040]   I think they added the car--
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   Nope.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.040]   Wheel squeaked.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.040]   No?
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.040]   Nope.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.040]   Wow.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.040]   Flipped him on his side.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.040]   Wow.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.040]   I hope nobody was hurt in that--
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.040]   I hope so terrific.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.040]   I actually--
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.040]   Jesus, what one causes.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.040]   I bet someone was.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.040]   Yeah, it doesn't look good.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.040]   It's all Jeff's fault.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.760]   The video is from June 16th.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760]   Of this year?
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.280]   Was it a bottle three?
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.920]   Because I've been seeing all these model three videos getting run out of time.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.920]   Well, you know why?
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.960]   Because the model three's have cameras now that are always recording.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.800]   So it might have been a model three.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.840]   Although it didn't look like a model three.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.840]   It's not like a model three.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.880]   Yeah, that looks like a pickup truck is what it looks like.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.880]   It looks like a bed.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.880]   So it records out the back?
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.240]   Yeah, so sometimes people have cameras recording, like for backup.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.800]   Yeah, I'd tell most certainly a pickup.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   Because that's the problem with pickups.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.320]   They don't have any weight in the back.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.240]   And so if you get tapped even, you get tipped.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.920]   Yeah, let's be able to Golden Gate.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.920]   Yep.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.760]   No hazards on the bridge.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.720]   Tesla, Tesla, what did it take me over the--
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.720]   I mean, I've got Tesla to say.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.720]   You have Tesla.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.720]   Google.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.600]   Ways, what did it take me over the Bay Bridge?
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.160]   And I yelled at the ways lady.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.960]   I said, no, never.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.960]   It fell down in an earthquake.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   No.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.480]   But they built it back since then.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.480]   It's all new.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.480]   Wow.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.040]   And they use bad bolts.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.400]   I read those stories.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.840]   Then there's that other bridge we have, the Richmond Bridge, which pieces of chunks of
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.840]   it were falling off.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.640]   Yeah, just earlier this year.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.640]   So maybe you're right.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.840]   Maybe we should stay away from bridges.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.800]   Jesus, can I get a helicopter back to the city, please?
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.760]   So are YouTubers unionizing?
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.480]   This is a wild story from Vice.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.120]   The YouTubers union is not messing around.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.480]   It's joined forces with Europe's largest trade union to fight for a fairer platform,
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.360]   fighting for the rights of content creators, but also of users.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.600]   They've joined with IG Mattal, Germany's largest union, Europe's largest union.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.560]   Which would be like YouTubers being Teamsters.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.320]   That's kind of strange.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.520]   Which is a funny image, but--
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.520]   It is.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.720]   I'm like, yeah, OK.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.600]   When they joined, they would totally tell where Jimmy Hoffa was buried.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.640]   They tell, but they do a 15 minutes of video before telling.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.640]   Saying they were gonna tell.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.360]   We're gonna do the Jimmy Hoffa unboxing.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.200]   In recent years, this is from the Vice article in recent Jimmy Hoffa unboxing.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   Thank you for that saying that like that.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   That was a great setup.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   That was awesome.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.720]   I think it's not usual that we'll have the title of the show in the first three minutes,
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.280]   but I think we actually do.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.680]   In recent years, YouTube creators have consistently spoken out about changes to the massive platform.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.000]   They say they're rarely consulted on that affect their ability to make money.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.280]   YouTube's changed how it handles copyright takedowns.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.520]   That's actually costing us money.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.240]   We're not strictly speaking YouTube creators, but we put our shows on YouTube, and we do
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.280]   make money on that because we count the downloads on YouTube.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:39.240]   And so we've had to make goods in the past for advertisers because it was a month, right?
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.720]   That one of our shows was taken down for a month.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.440]   We got it back up because it was an unfair takedown.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.440]   Right.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.480]   But more than a month, it was 45 days.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.480]   45 days.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.960]   It was over 45 days actually.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.960]   So that's a good...
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.960]   More than a month.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.960]   It was 45 days.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.960]   It was over 45 days actually.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.960]   So that's a good...
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.960]   More than a month.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.960]   It was over 45 days actually.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.960]   So that's a good...
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.960]   More than a month.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.960]   It was more than a month.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.960]   It was 45 days.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.960]   It was over 45 days actually.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.440]   Users, it says, are problematic.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.400]   It's also issued content warnings to some innocuous channels.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.960]   One of the creators leading the unionization charge, Jorg Sprav, has had his popular slingshot
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.640]   videos removed by YouTube.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.640]   Why would that be?
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.640]   Do you imagine?
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.640]   I don't know.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.360]   It depends what's at the other end of the slingshot, I guess.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.520]   Sprav traced the origins of the problems leading to this recent move back to changes in YouTube's
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:35.440]   relationship to advertisers following the 2017 ad-pocalypse major advertisers organized
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:41.960]   a boycott of YouTube because they didn't want their ads running next to "extremist content"
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:48.960]   and claimed, demanded that Google implement brand safety controls, which they did.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.520]   But that costs a lot of content creators significant ad revenue.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:01.080]   Two years ago, Hank Green created the Internet Creators Guild, which was an effort to do something
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.080]   like that.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.080]   I'm all for unions.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.280]   I'm a member of SAG-AFTRA.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.640]   I've always been a union member.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.080]   We're not a union shop, but I have nothing against unions.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.440]   But it seems kind of a slap in the face.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.200]   YouTube provides free bandwidth, free publicity.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.240]   It's a great free platform for content creators.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:26.080]   I was ready to mock it, but you do think that more and more and more, we had a conversation
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.880]   about this this week in San Francisco.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.680]   It's not about jobs, it's about work.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:36.000]   In a freelance gig economy and a world of Lyft and Uber, and last night I used Caviar
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.080]   to get while I was watching the debate to get food brought to me, there is no representation
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.080]   for independent people.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.960]   And the gig economy hurts a lot of people.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.920]   I mean, it's a very hard thing to do.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.360]   I worry for our kids.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.880]   They see if you've been a union.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.880]   Have I?
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.880]   Oh, no.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.880]   I am from Texas and be...
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.520]   We don't have no unions and taxes.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.880]   I was like, oh, we're not.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.040]   But even when I'm trying to think, no, even at my publications, I've never been in a
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.040]   union pub.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.720]   Actually, that is one thing that's happening in web publications.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.720]   Yes.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.720]   They are unionistic.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.600]   Yeah, because Fortune had half of them were union and people like me were not.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.040]   Print people were union and the digital people were not.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.800]   I mean, there's very much in the sentiment in this country, anti-union sentiment.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.280]   Oh, my gosh, yes.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.960]   In the European union, unions aren't a bad, aren't a dirty word.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.160]   So names because of it.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:42.120]   I think the point Jeff's making about these platforms, and maybe we don't go to the platforms,
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:48.320]   but we've historically relied on employers in our country for a social safety net, right?
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.200]   And that has shifted.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.600]   And now we don't have a social safety net and we don't have employers.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.280]   And so we're like, okay, so a lot of the big debates around things like Medicare for
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:08.200]   all or universal payer or things like that are because we need something.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.200]   We don't have anything.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.760]   And if you look at the gig economy, we're gradually dismantling even the ability of
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.720]   an employer to be your safety net.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.720]   Or it's a perfect idea.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.520]   So this is one thing that's always puzzled me in the debate that was going on last night
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:28.880]   in the election and the Democratic candidates is that if I were, and I'm not, if I were
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.480]   a Republican company owner, you would think that I would want to get rid of the burden
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.080]   of having to provide health insurance to my employees, but somebody else do it.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.440]   Why should that come out of my pocket?
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.800]   Why should I deal with all that?
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.800]   I would think that apart from not liking big government, fine, but you think that they
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.400]   want to offload that.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.040]   I don't understand it just logically.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.320]   I, well, I don't know because I'm pro health insurance.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:02.920]   I think, as am I, I think even business owners, even business owners understand that our health
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.400]   system is broken.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.600]   So stockholders, so the problem is businesses, big companies who provide health insurance
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.760]   are beholden to stockholders.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:19.600]   And stockholders typically want providing health insurance is, it hurts the bottom line.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.080]   So I think that's where that's coming from.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.040]   The loyalty isn't to your employers as a business owner, it's to your shareholders.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.440]   That's a good point.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.400]   But even then, Stacey, you're spending money who want the government to do it, right?
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.400]   You don't want to spend it?
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.880]   Well, and there's a lot of talk about, so if you look at something like, they talk about
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:45.720]   with companies like Walmart, especially low paying companies or the Paylow wages, what's
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:52.040]   happening is taxpayers are ultimately subsidizing the high insurance rates of the uninsured that
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.400]   these people have.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:58.080]   So what's happening is they're getting kind of a two for one in the sense that they're
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.720]   not insuring people, right?
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.560]   And they're not paying taxes.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.800]   So basically the costs are coming down on municipalities and people who pay taxes into
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.200]   those, which companies do a little bit, but not as much.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.400]   Maybe that's why business owners aren't lobbying for national health care.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.720]   They just say, well, we're not going to pay.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.120]   And so it's up to you.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.000]   We pay, we have fairly good health insurance for our employees.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.120]   It's a fairly significant cost.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.320]   But I think Lisa, who I can say was a Republican, I don't know if she still is, not anymore,
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:35.920]   she's independent now, but still supports single-payer health, government support health.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.160]   Because I think for even for business owners, it's pretty clear that the health system isn't
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.160]   working.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.160]   It's inefficient.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.080]   Billions of dollars are going into the pockets of insurance companies, not into medical care.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.080]   And here we are in what should be the country that has the best medical care in the world.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.880]   And it is, we are not even in the top 20.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:13:00.720]   I mean, as a business owner, I was in a fairly large company that had one or two employees
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.240]   who had very sick children, and the rates went, boom.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.800]   So that you're not protected.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.640]   That's part of it also, isn't it?
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:13.440]   In fact, that's one of the burdens that we see all the time is the very steep increases
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.040]   year after year after year in the health plans we provide our employees.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:24.320]   We've had a couple of years where it went up double digits and it was significant increases.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.480]   And that's without anybody getting sick.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.400]   I mean, if somebody gets seriously sick in the group, then that's even more of a problem.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.920]   So back to the YouTube Union.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:37.360]   I love the idea of a YouTube picket line where everybody's shooting everybody else on the
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.360]   picket line.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.120]   But that's why you, that's one reason people want to unionize because that is one of the
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.880]   union benefits that's most cherished by people is union health care.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.880]   Right.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.080]   The problem is a union works when you've organized the entire shop.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.080]   You have to.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.200]   On YouTube, the majority will be with spoilers.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:59.280]   You couldn't even demand a union because even if you had a vote, first of all, who has standing?
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.280]   Right.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:06.080]   Everybody who ever made a YouTube video who has standing, this just doesn't make sense.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.320]   But I don't see any reason why creators couldn't join together.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.280]   Like the Greens have tried to do and make some sort of guild where they should be.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.760]   But there's always going to be people who don't join and they'll be, I mean, they'll
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.760]   be, what is it?
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.760]   Scabs?
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.680]   Is that what they are when you, when your union is harsh?
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.680]   But yes.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.680]   Okay.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:30.480]   I have a giant inflatable rat that's just waiting to be set up outside of Twitch headquarters.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.080]   I imagine what I, what I now fantasize about is the TikTok Union.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.080]   What's that?
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.240]   Well, just, just, oh, good Lord.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.800]   A bunch of, a bunch of preteens.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.040]   So the idea of unionizing YouTube doesn't completely make sense to me.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.560]   And yet I do think YouTube creators have a decent case to present to YouTube.
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.600]   And the only way, the whole point of a union is collective bargaining, right?
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:59.040]   That if every employee gets together and say, says we want some concessions from an employer,
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.200]   it's very difficult for the employer to ignore that.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   You know, you, you have the threat of a strike.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.040]   And even if you hire the Pinkertons to, to beat up the strikers and bring in scabs, it's
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.280]   not a good look.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.280]   No.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   It's not a good look.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.280]   I love that too.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.280]   Right.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.280]   So the YouTubers are out on strikes.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.480]   There, there are, there are come scab YouTubers who make inferior YouTube videos.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.560]   But that is, but that's the legitimate threat that these guys have to YouTube because,
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:27.640]   and we've always said this, when you're a YouTuber, you are working for free to benefit
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.560]   this giant company.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.360]   And we don't know the one thing that I would, if, if I are a YouTuber, I would want to know
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.040]   is how, what percentage of the ad revenue am I getting?
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.120]   Google does not even say that.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.120]   Are they taking 50% of the ad revenue, a segment eat?
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.680]   Appellately says we take 30%, but Google doesn't even say what the ad revenue is for
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.840]   YouTube and how much you do to get because they negotiate it.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.840]   And that's the best thing we're.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.600]   Well, that doesn't mean they couldn't put up a sheet for every YouTube channel and say,
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.840]   this is what we charge and this is what you're getting.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.840]   Not a great thing.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.840]   They don't want to do that.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.840]   No, no, I understand why they don't.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.960]   And that's why people form unions to get that kind of information to band together.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.040]   And I think the most powerful, what it's going to take is the top 50 or 100 YouTubers to
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.600]   get together and say, yeah, okay, I will imagine that PewDiePie in the organizing meeting.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.720]   Could they do something from an agency?
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.320]   Like so could there.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.680]   Well, that is one thing that's happening, isn't it?
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.280]   You could come through your content creation agencies.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.280]   Yes.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.200]   So that at least that gets them the data they need to argue for better rates and that
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.400]   sort of thing.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.600]   And then, but I mean, it does create a middleman instead of a union who's going to negotiate
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.600]   on your behalf.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.880]   So it's collective bargaining only in the sense that if you're with a powerful enough
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.600]   group who can be like, oh, yeah, well, if you don't take this person, I'm not going to
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.600]   give you this person.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.440]   I'm going to come down on the side of the free market here and say, if you want to be
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.720]   on YouTube, you know what the rules are going in.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.680]   You're getting some real benefit from being on YouTube.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:16:59.680]   We're happy to be on YouTube.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   We get free distribution.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.560]   It's, I mean, I think I do the creators.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.520]   It's a good idea where they're, they're becoming somebody.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.600]   What happened with the newspaper industry?
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.760]   And that's why I've been down talking to all the companies this week.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.520]   Google did an excellent job of involving newspaper publishers and product people in
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:22.360]   its new product for subscriptions, for example, change the relationship that they had.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.200]   And it gave them a body to talk with.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.640]   And that wasn't just to fight with or even to negotiate with.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.160]   It was to create a mechanism to be able to do things together.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:38.800]   That would make sense to have a creators guild to go and talk about ethical standards for
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.720]   creators, ethical standards for Google.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   That would be interesting.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:50.480]   And then I think we should have a guild of tweeters.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.080]   The guild of Facebook users.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:58.960]   I mean, all of these modern platforms, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, all the content.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.680]   All the, well, I'm just pointing out all the content, all the way they make money.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.760]   They make money by selling ads against content created for free by the users.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.760]   That is inherently.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.720]   But as you said, they get free service by Stacey.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.720]   Okay.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:18.240]   So maybe you create a guild of influencers or a guild of people.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:25.760]   I mean, because there's, there's something to the idea that to, to create rules around
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:30.680]   ethics and what the type of content you're going to produce, the type of messaging that
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.240]   you're going, you know, however you're going to behave online and how you're going to
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.480]   treat other people and whatnot.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:42.480]   And maybe that influencers is bad because, you know, influencers encompass everything
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.840]   from Instagram people all the way to people who are like creating really cool and popular
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.840]   videos.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.400]   But something like that does kind of make sense.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.480]   And creating a professionalizing this category is probably smart.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.320]   It's already happened in the sense that people have money.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:05.480]   And I believe like you could actually do a lot of good for everyone who's involved in
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.480]   this.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.520]   So think about all those stories about influencers who are like bombarding hotels with requests
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.760]   to like stay there for free.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.040]   You know, because I'm an influencer with X number.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.040]   So it's such a disgusting.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.040]   It is.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.040]   It is.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:24.680]   And by the other was a great article in petapixel by a photographer who's talking about the
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:31.080]   lavender fields of France where the farmers have put up a sign saying, please respect our
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.080]   work.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.640]   Don't trample the lavender.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:39.040]   And in front of the sign he posted the author of the article posted a picture of dozens
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.200]   of Instagram influencers posing in the lavender.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.320]   Say he says some people come with 12 wardrobe changes so that they can do a fashion shoot
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.920]   in the lavender picking bunches of lavender for their Instagram shot.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.040]   He said, it's a business charge them for it.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.040]   Wow.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.600]   They're getting their climate over the fence.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.000]   And this is I think more and more of a blight all over the world.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.440]   I know our photography guy on the radio show Chris Mark Warren has said something about
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.440]   it.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.800]   Trey Rackliffe, great photographers actually written a book under the influence about the
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:19.400]   but the he and here's a guy who really created a career on Facebook, Instagram and Google
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.800]   Plus saying this is the this is horrific.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.800]   What's going on now on Instagram buying followers.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.600]   All of these would be influencers who are swamping the world.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.520]   There are places where they have signs.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.520]   No Instagram hashtag.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.520]   Please.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.920]   It's it's it's gotten out of control.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.920]   Nah.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.920]   Nah.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.920]   Okay.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.920]   Relax.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.920]   I do sound like an old guy.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.200]   Get off of my lavender you kids.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:53.240]   I don't know if this will I'm very curious how short lived this is or if this is like
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.440]   a new profession in the sense.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:01.200]   I mean, marketing has always been around but like in this kind of fashion because I look
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.720]   at like my daughter and her friends.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.720]   Some of them are very into it, but most of them are very skeptical of putting their themselves
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:15.000]   online and their friends who work hard at this, they're not shy about saying how much
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.960]   how hard they work at it.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.840]   So it's obviously a very small group of people.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.760]   So I'd be curious to hear how other, you know, 10 year olds and 15 year olds are viewing
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.320]   this as a career.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.520]   I mean, because it is.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.920]   Everybody remember I mean, for a while everybody said, well, I'm going to become an NBA star.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.520]   I don't need to study now.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.520]   Oh, man.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:41.120]   And in the 90s or late 80s, I wanted to be a supermodel for a second.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.960]   Who wouldn't it as well?
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.920]   You should have been.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:49.640]   So Paul Rayfer, the photographer wrote this in petapixel photographers Instagrammer stop
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.440]   being so damn selfish and disrespectful.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.160]   And here's the here's the picture of the fields in the south of France, the lavender
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.080]   fields in Provence respect our work, please.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:06.120]   And all the photographers trampling into the lavender fields.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.720]   And of course, if you do, if you look for a hat, you know, the hashtag, what do you say
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:20.200]   the hashtag was hashtag lavender, I guess you will see all of these pictures, you know,
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.400]   and all of these people, they damaged the land.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.720]   They'd stolen the owners products.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.160]   They'd ruined the fields.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.160]   Here it is.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.840]   Hashtag lavender 4.9 million hashtag lavender posts.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   And look at these.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.920]   No fashion shoots in the lavender.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.920]   Let's be clear here.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.640]   The problem here is bozos, not technology.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.640]   Absolutely.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.800]   But these bozos were not as prevalent until technology empowered them.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.000]   This is what I thought was for bozoishness.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.480]   This is what I come up with though.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.120]   Every single time you're right.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.880]   That, you know, I mean, for instance, public records are stored at the county courthouse.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.000]   They always have been.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.240]   And somebody wants to, they can go to the county courthouse and find out where you live.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.720]   But as soon as you added technology databases and the internet to this, anybody can go to
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.480]   a website like Spokeo and find out where anybody in the world lives.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.480]   And that's the problem.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.880]   Technology is such a powerful tool that can amplify bozos.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   As well as good things.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.880]   Yes.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:25.520]   Well, I will say that this kind of platform has, like the launch of Instagram and Snapchat
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:34.680]   has created an audience and an incentive to, that incentivizes this behavior.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.920]   An audience for it and an incentive that wasn't there prior.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.600]   So, and I don't think there are people who wake up and are born with this desire to trample
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.840]   people's fields and disrespect their property.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.840]   But I do think there are people who are maybe a little more selfish and not thinking about
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:54.240]   others or don't realize the impact of their actions.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:00.080]   And what happens is they draw, these platforms draw attention to a single place and then
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.800]   you get a bunch of people who behave that same way and have that same sense of entitlement
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.800]   and then voila.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   We're negotiating norms right now.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.560]   We got enough people have to scold the people on those photos and say, why don't you
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.040]   stop it and knock it off?
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   I have to say this comes across a little bit as a curmudgeonly photographer who wishes
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.040]   he had to himself.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.480]   There's a picture from Winaka, like Winaka in New Zealand that he took six years ago of
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.760]   a little tree that's out there in the lake.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:31.800]   And he says, nowadays, this is what it looks like with thousands of photographers, wedding
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.560]   photographers coming out and swamping the lake.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.600]   And here's even one guy who decided he wanted to climb up into the tree and sit there so
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.960]   nobody could get that shot.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:48.600]   So, you know, yeah, he kind of wishes that we're back to this, you know, lone tree and
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.840]   him.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.600]   But that's also a point of view of privilege.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.600]   So it's a privilege, yeah.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.600]   Right.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.000]   So let me try this out on you since you both like to criticize the valley and I've been
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.200]   there this week.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.200]   You've been in the valley.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.160]   I've been in the valley.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:06.320]   I heard from a lot of people who, well, let me start here.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.640]   Well, I lived in San Francisco.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.720]   Well, I have to hear my day.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   I left.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.040]   I hate to admit this in 1981.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.840]   So long before Silicon Valley was Silicon Valley.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.320]   It was a place people, San Francisco was a place people adored.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.320]   They were passionate about it.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.320]   They loved it.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.320]   They cared about it.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.320]   It was a special place.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:31.080]   What I've heard all this week from people in technology and elsewhere is nobody likes
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.080]   San Francisco.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.920]   Everybody's fed up with San Francisco.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.680]   That's very sad because it was one of the great cities.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   It was.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.840]   And it's not just San Francisco, of course, it's the whole thing.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.440]   Now, when I lived there, you looked down on the peninsula, what is now Silicon Valley,
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.440]   and no one would die being there.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.040]   That's the new Farish down there.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.680]   Well, no, no, it wasn't the new Farish.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.360]   It was the American tacky.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:57.080]   I did a column for the examiner once where I surveyed, I did a census of every single
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:02.480]   fast food and junk food brand on the entirety of El Camino Real.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.040]   All the way up and down.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.040]   All of them.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.040]   All of them.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.280]   My favorite one was eat my quiche.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.560]   But that was what I thought some people envisioned the peninsula was that it was the strip mall
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.760]   that was taking over America.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.000]   And now that strip mall is in charge of the world.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.840]   And so it's really fascinating to me.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.560]   And I also talked to a lot of people about philanthropy because we're a school and we're
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.640]   out here and we're going to beg for money.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.480]   And people say, no, no, nobody here gives any money.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.480]   No, I'm not going to happen.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.480]   No.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.640]   I mean, yeah, you got Benny off and yeah, you got Zuckerberg, but no, nobody gives any
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.640]   money.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:39.320]   And somebody said to me that that they thought that the technology rich folk think that invest
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.960]   angel investing in a company is like charity.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.460]   That's our charity.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.460]   And that's our charity.
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.460]   They're starting, right.
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.460]   We're funding innovation.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.460]   Bingo.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.460]   So you have this, this, it's worse than all we.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:55.740]   It's a, it's a bit of self hatred springing up from the entire Bay Area, which is just
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.700]   so strange to me.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:03.440]   You know, when I lived here, you had these society, uh, mockers, uh, Pat Montandons,
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.440]   Sirie and Magnum.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.440]   Right.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.780]   And they would say, darling, don't we need a symphony in San Francisco?
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.780]   Yeah.
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:11.780]   Let's raise money for the symphony.
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.080]   And then you have a huge symphony hall gets built, right?
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.080]   People usually get money here.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   The patronage system.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.320]   They really did.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.020]   And now that doesn't exist in San Francisco and now people are worried about the arts.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.980]   Uh, uh, it's still a convaling not patrons of the arts.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.020]   There's a San Jose symphony, isn't there?
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.020]   Partly.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.020]   Nothing.
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.020]   Nothing.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.020]   So, so it is interesting.
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:34.460]   What is the culture of not just the valley itself, but the valley in San Francisco and
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:35.460]   all that.
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:39.100]   This isn't permanent, but this is just a, a, a blip.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:45.340]   The, the go-go, you know, boom nature of the boom.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.520]   Never watched deadwood about the gold rush in South Dakota.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.760]   Well, those people were, were really, that's your kind of Gutenberg moment here.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.800]   Uh, there were no laws.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:01.040]   They were, you know, it was crazy, but that was the nature of the boom.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.080]   I'm sure deadwood South Dakota is not lawless anymore.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.640]   It's boring.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.640]   It's probably fairly important.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.640]   Sure.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   Don't have a symphony.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.880]   But they don't have a symphony then either.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.760]   So Stacy, what about since you, she went from Austin?
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.320]   Did Austin have a touch of that?
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:21.140]   Um, Austin was a little different because it doesn't have a lot of super rich people.
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:24.020]   So I grew up in Houston where we had huge patronage of the arts, right?
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.780]   That was the oil, the oil folks, right?
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.900]   The oil folks, they just give money all the time, right?
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.340]   Because they're guilty.
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:33.180]   They're guilty and I think it's an older tradition.
[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.580]   I think it's a George Bush kind of patrician tradition of patronage.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:41.540]   Well, and I was going to say new money trying to impress old money.
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.300]   I mean, Houston is, Houston was very much a, we are just, we're just, we're just, we're
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.040]   just as good as New York or God help us Dallas.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.040]   We're better than Dallas.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.840]   We need our own TV show.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.440]   That's my motto.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.440]   Houston.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.440]   In and.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:02.260]   Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta,
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:08.580]   So in Austin, it was, for the longest time it was real estate money and there was donations,
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:12.120]   but they weren't as big because they just didn't have quite as much money.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:18.180]   And then when the tech guys came, Michael Dell didn't donate any money for a really
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.180]   long time.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.200]   No, only now has Dell started donating money.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.120]   He was very stinchie.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.800]   And then other than that, there weren't a lot of startup, there were a lot of startup
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.160]   companies, but very few ever made it big, made it public, that sort of thing.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.000]   John Thornton is a awesome venture.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Oh my God.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.200]   That man is such a freaking jerk, but he is philanthropic.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.200]   Oh, oh.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.200]   He is a small minded.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.200]   Oh my.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:50.280]   So now that you're in Seattle, is it different?
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.080]   Seattle has a lot of public works.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.960]   Paul Allen built that beautiful museum.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:02.360]   I think, you know, he bought the Seahawks when the gates.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.320]   Yeah, I mean, is having an Andrew Carnegie moment.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.840]   Gates was the, the rapacious billionaire.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.160]   The, what did they call them?
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:17.040]   The Rockefeller's and the, the Carnegie's, they called them the robber barons.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.720]   Gates was a robber baron until after basically after he retired.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.920]   Well actually was when he married his wife, Melinda Gates, he started giving to charity.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.840]   And then he had kind of a moment like Andrew Carnegie, the steel baron, who was terry.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.720]   He talked about bringing in the Pinkertons to bust the union.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.400]   He was famous for this.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.040]   But in his later in life, I think he thought, I want to go to heaven.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.920]   So he built live, beautiful free public libraries all over the country.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.360]   We have one in Petaluma.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.320]   And I feel like Bill Gates is, is our Andrew Carnegie.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.840]   He's making up for his sins.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.800]   And I think for the, for any executive, maybe, or maybe it's just in the tech world, I don't
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.400]   know, but you get to a certain level at first you're scrapping by and you still feel scrappy.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.000]   You don't know that you're successful yet.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Right.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.280]   And then at that point in time.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.600]   Suddenly you become evil, right?
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.320]   I think I think what happens is you're still fighting and scrapping and you don't know
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.760]   if you're going to make it still even though everyone else is like, okay, buddy, you've
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.400]   made it.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.640]   Look at Steve Jobs, who was famously stingy with charity.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.720]   Now Apple never did any of that.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.040]   He passed away before he had a chance to have his Andrew Carnegie moment.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.520]   And his wife, his widow, was doing amazing.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.320]   The Marine is giving away tons of money.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.120]   Bought Atlantic magazine is not just giving away money is also supporting for-profit efforts
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.040]   in the society like Atlantic.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.760]   That's where everything collective that's doing all that investing.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.080]   Yeah, good for, good for Lorraine Jobs.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.600]   She's really a remarkable person.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.480]   But she doesn't see that's the difference.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:58.920]   Maybe that's maybe wives are important for this equation because men are jerks.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.160]   That's the beauty selfish jerks.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.160]   That's us.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:08.160]   But neither Lorraine Jobs nor Melinda Gates had to scrap their way up to the top and create
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.560]   the company that made all that money.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:17.560]   And so maybe they don't have that same Travis Kalinek kind of mentality of, I'm the underdog,
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.160]   I got to fight every step of the way.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.760]   I don't have time for charity.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:26.280]   Bill Gates famously said, I'm not going to give away any money until I could do it right.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.560]   Till I have the time to use my money wisely.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.760]   And actually that was a pretty good maxim.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:36.920]   Mark Zuckerberg, how much did he give Newark that was just thrown away basically because
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.400]   it was inappropriate giving.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.600]   It was a waste of money.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.280]   I think you also have Mackenzie Bezos is already starting to be philanthropic.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.600]   Considering she has a large amount of money.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.880]   Does Jeff Bezos have a big philanthropy arm?
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.480]   Is there a Bezos family foundation?
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.720]   I think he's starting to invest in things.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:58.200]   Jeff's charity, this is very similar actually, is going to Mars.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   Blue, blue or is going to Mars.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.520]   We screwed up this planet.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.800]   So I'll tell you what I'm going to do is my charity.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.280]   I'm going to, I'm going to colonize Mars.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.040]   So we have somewhere a plan B.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.600]   He also saved the Washington Post.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.160]   He also saved the Washington Post.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.160]   Okay.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.920]   That's, there's some credit there.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.920]   He lost a $2 billion fund for homeless families.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.920]   All right.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.920]   Okay.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.920]   So Bezos is doing good with this stuff.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.920]   But that's, that's pretty recent.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.160]   And I think part of that is, is part of this like, Oh,
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.160]   now I need to give.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.680]   It's at a certain point in time you have to give.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:39.960]   Well, I think this is a timely moment to mention how much money these guys are making.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.440]   Because it is the quarterly report time of year.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:52.040]   Facebook, it's a second 1.5 billion daily active users in June 2019.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.760]   That's an 8% increase.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.120]   So all you people quit in Facebook.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.160]   You didn't make a dent monthly active users.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:04.000]   2.41 billion also an 8% increase.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.400]   But here's the number that I think is important.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:13.680]   Mobile advertising revenue, 94% of Facebook's advertising revenue came from mobile.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.640]   That's up from 91%.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.920]   When did they make the, Oh, we got to go mobile pitch?
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.480]   It did take them long, a couple of years, three years.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:28.880]   I remember when Facebook went public, the real question on everybody's mind was,
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.960]   can Facebook survive?
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.160]   Well, we were we dumb.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.480]   Can Facebook survive in a mobile world?
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.880]   All their revenue is desktop.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:45.240]   28% increase year over year in advertising, 36% in other fees and payments.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.680]   So they had a 28% bump in revenue.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.320]   Costs went up though.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   66%.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.000]   That's a pretty big jump in costs.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.040]   They must be doing a lot of R&D and a lot of investment.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:02.520]   Income from operations was down as a result, 21%.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.680]   Their operating margin was down from 44%.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:10.760]   That's a nice margin to 27%, which is actually lower than Apple.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.480]   And their effective tax rate, they don't mention what it was.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.480]   Probably because it was zero.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:21.160]   Their effective tax rate for this quarter was 46%.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:25.960]   That probably includes the $5 billion fine from the FDC.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.640]   Can you count that as a tax?
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.440]   I don't know.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.000]   Let's see, I see an asterisk.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   A fine?
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.480]   That's an expensive event.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.480]   It's an expensive.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:43.440]   It includes an additional $2 billion in legal expenses related to the FDC's settlement.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:50.240]   And a $1.1 billion income tax expense due to developments in Altera Corp versus Commission.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.240]   Yes, I think so.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.600]   It costs $2 billion in lawyers to pay $5 billion.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.160]   They spent $2 billion in legal fees.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:02.200]   Oh, that's a great return then.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:08.000]   If you include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, their family of services,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.120]   2.1 billion daily active users.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:19.400]   So I was down in both Menlo Park and Mountain View this last week.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:24.200]   And the last time I was at Facebook, their building 20 was done.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:28.720]   The old campus, then across the street, is building 20, which is the one that has the
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.960]   famous walk on top and all that.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.280]   Now building 21 is done and it doubles it.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:37.640]   And now they're quadrupling that down the road.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.760]   I think from end to end, it looks like it's going to be at least a mile, a kind of one
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.640]   continuous, but they're all walking to the cafeteria all the time.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.280]   Well, that's good for you.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.280]   That's good for you.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:53.960]   And then down in Menlo Park, I mean, in Mountain View, have you seen the construction of the
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.520]   new Google buildings down there?
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.520]   The tents?
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.040]   Do we have any pictures of that?
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.040]   Yeah, we do.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.240]   Oh, it's unbelievable.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:07.920]   It's just these gigantic tent-like structures under which will appear buildings.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:13.120]   The growth of Facebook, they want to make these kind of almost indoor outdoor spaces.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.760]   They're just amazing that the symbol of that.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.840]   But yet, there's no branding on them anywhere.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.840]   Google now has more cash than Apple.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.840]   Wow.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.840]   Wow.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.840]   Apple had half the cash in the world.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.480]   Go, go, pour it.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.440]   Well, partly that's because Apple repatriated and rebut stock with it.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.440]   So Apple's-- Google's going to do a--
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.440]   S-TAC is down to $102 billion.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.960]   Is it going to wish on-- It was all the way up to 163.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.080]   Is that before the stock buyback?
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.240]   I don't know.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.120]   Alphabet's financial reserves are now $117-- financial reserves.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.840]   In other words, money in their pocket.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.720]   $117 billion.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:59.040]   That's a $20 billion increase over the last couple of years.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.360]   Is that short term?
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.360]   Is that cash?
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.360]   It's a corporate liquidity.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.360]   Cash in liquidity.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.360]   They are the top of the corporate liquidity rankings.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   Dang it.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.360]   That's a lot.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:14.640]   And that's even after the $8.2 billion, $8.2 billion euro fine.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.640]   That's how much they've paid in the last couple of years to the EU.
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:22.520]   So Alphabet bought back $3.6 billion of stock in the second quarter.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.520]   Oh.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.520]   So it was even after that?
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.520]   Wow.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:32.200]   Companies new $25 billion buyback authorization.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:39.880]   Look at this sort of thing in the context of, OK, let's look at their contractors versus
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.520]   their employees.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:49.000]   Look at a company like Verizon or actually AT&T, which is more unionized than Verizon.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.880]   And think about how that kind of-- how that math ends up working.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:59.520]   So if you look at margins and profits on AT&T, and not that they're a wonderful company that's
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:04.760]   just not screwing anyone over anywhere, but they do have financial obligations they can't
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.680]   warm their way out of.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:14.560]   And this is shareholders that are getting this money, the stock buybacks, et cetera.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.560]   Right.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.560]   So--
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.560]   Right.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.560]   So it's interesting.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:25.240]   Alphabet-- well, Apple spent $122 billion over the last 18 months buying back stock, including
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.240]   dividends.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:31.120]   Google $1.7 billion a quarter, much less.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:35.560]   According to the Financial Times, in that time, Google has handed out more new shares
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.120]   in the form of employee stock benefits than it's bought back.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.960]   Now shareholders don't like that because that actually does not help shareholders.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.960]   It dilutes them.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.960]   But--
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.200]   But they're not using this cash to invest in--
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.800]   They must see this as a necessary thing to keep their-- they don't know what to do with
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   the cash.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:59.120]   This is unfair, but I'll be unfair because, hey, it's only a podcast.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.600]   It shows a lack of imagination.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.600]   Right.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.600]   If you've got this cash--
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.320]   I think they just have so much-- I mean, that is a lot of cash.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.840]   And it's kind of this-- I mean, think about it like the Bill Gates problem.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:15.200]   They actually have a fiduciary responsibility to do something good or useful for their bottom
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.640]   line with it, right?
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.640]   So they--
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.800]   Yeah, that's exactly what they think they're doing.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:23.760]   Ruth Porat, the CFO, said the increase in stock repurchase.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:28.360]   Which is now $25 more billion to a stock buyback program.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.840]   Did not reflect any change in Alphabet's financial priorities.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.520]   Alphabet's two top goals to your point, Stacey, were unchanged to invest in the long-term
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:41.040]   growth of its existing businesses and to support acquisitions.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.080]   That's one thing Google does more than Apple.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:45.440]   Apple doesn't like acquisitions.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:49.480]   Acquisition-- and I don't blame them because acquisitions are challenging for a company.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:55.520]   But didn't someone do a story about how Apple has been making way more acquisitions?
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.520]   Maybe lately.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.520]   Maybe lately.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.000]   They did just buy Intel's chip business for the--
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.720]   That's a big one, a billion dollars.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.440]   And $2,000 Intel employees are coming over.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.560]   But that's historically difficult for a company.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:11.600]   I mean, if you look at the history of acquisitions in the tech sector, it's almost an unbroken
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:19.200]   chain of failures and misery because it's hard to when the HP bought-- who was it?
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.320]   HP bought, I forgot now.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.760]   That was that big--
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.960]   It was a big product.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:24.960]   Compact.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.960]   Compact.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.960]   HP bought compact.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:31.360]   Integrating that those two teams was a nightmare and never really went very well.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.800]   When Time Warner-- So, OK.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:38.360]   Those are big-- those are the-- Those are big-access mergers, big acquisitions.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.520]   Ty two bricks together and they're still gonna sink kind of deals.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.520]   But look at Apple.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.280]   Apple's doing it smart, I agree with you.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.160]   They-- like, their acquirers as much as anything else.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:53.120]   Yeah, their Wikipedia page shows that they have started acquiring much-- many more companies
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.480]   in the last five years.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.360]   Most of those companies are small.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.400]   The acquisitions-- Well, not actually--
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:05.200]   They're really hiring-- they're hiring great engineering teams.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.320]   They're buying-- perhaps buying intellectual property, but they're not trying to buy companies.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:15.080]   Yeah, they're-- Well, they actually in this last year-- so there's Intel smartphone
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:19.320]   mode of business.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.320]   That's a big one.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.160]   But Beats was their last big acquisition.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.160]   100 million dollars.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.360]   It was a 400 billion dollar deal.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.360]   That's not insignificant.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.520]   Yeah, but how many employees did they acquire?
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.520]   I don't know how many employees they have.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.760]   I think they probably got the technology more than anything else.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.680]   And they've done a lot of semiconductor deals, believe it or not.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:42.040]   That makes sense because they're trying to build a semiconductor business.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.640]   That's why the Intel acquisition makes sense.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.680]   They want to build their own silicon.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.000]   That makes no sense.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.640]   That's just like a-- I don't-- that's a weird thing.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:55.680]   But I was going to say most of their chip deals have actually been relatively small tuck-ins
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.840]   with really-- with cool technology.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.320]   And what they've done is they've hired people--
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.600]   the engineering leads for--
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.720]   they hired the former papermaster.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.120]   I can't think of his first name.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:12.000]   It was their head of silicon when they wanted to design their own chip.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.680]   So what they've actually done is find really small chip companies that offer some--
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.360]   maybe it's a weird networking fabric.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.680]   Maybe it's an optimization scheme.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.560]   And then they've actually hired someone well-known in the chip industry
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:29.160]   to pull that together with, you know, arm silicon or whatever.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:35.200]   That's why this Intel deal is so weird and dumb.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.600]   It's because Intel has not done a great job with their modem business one.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:44.560]   So Apple has a buy technology that's bad.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.760]   It buys technology that's just not known yet.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.200]   So yeah.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.640]   That's on that topic.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:58.880]   It'll be interesting to watch that because there were some stories that Intel felt like
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.160]   that was a fire sale, that a billion was not nearly enough for the thousands of patents
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.160]   in the 2000s.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.040]   Well, it's going to buy it.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:05.960]   But that's the problem.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.680]   There was no one else out there who had--
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.160]   I mean--
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.960]   anywhere near that kind of money.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:14.600]   And only Apple-- this is all about Apple getting out from under Qualcomm.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:19.160]   And remember, Apple has paid a billion dollars to Qualcomm for licenses over the last couple
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.160]   of years.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.960]   So a billion dollars to get out from under Qualcomm maybe is a bargain if they can get
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.720]   out from under them.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:31.160]   That's the-- I think that's-- is that why you're saying it's not a great acquisition?
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.240]   Because how good was Intel's 5G modem anyway?
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.240]   Exactly.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.680]   It's not-- like Intel was struggling to make it--
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.000]   It was not a good product.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.240]   So now, what I would expect to see then is now that once Apple assesses all of this
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:51.280]   and takes a look, what I imagine will happen is it will either find something to fill in
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.080]   the gaps in Intel's technology.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.080]   And I don't know enough about it.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:59.040]   Which includes, by the way, licenses from Qualcomm, of all things.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:06.200]   And then-- or it will hire some sort of Qualcomm-- I mean, they have Qualcomm people there.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.400]   But hire someone in charge of like building 5G chips that's really well known in the industry
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.400]   and bring them in.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.240]   This-- it fits in-- and maybe it is a bad acquisition.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:21.040]   But it fits in with Apple's general desire to vertically integrate the entire process,
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   hardware, and software.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.400]   They'd like to make everything.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.800]   Because if they make everything, they've been-- one of the problems Apple's had over
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:32.880]   the last few years is that Intel has not been able to deliver with CPUs or modem chips
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.080]   or anything else, and it's held Apple's product line back.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:41.760]   So Stacey, where's most of the fabbing done for the Intel stuff that Apple bought?
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.800]   US or foreign?
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.440]   I'm going to guess it's either TSMC or--
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.440]   Let's see.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.440]   Time one.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.440]   Intel-- yeah.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.400]   I can give you a list of Intel's fab locations.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.400]   I just wonder about--
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.400]   Intel doesn't make-- Chandler, Arizona.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.400]   Terra, so all that.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:58.400]   No.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   Rancho Rio.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.400]   The original.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.400]   Those are the modem chips.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.480]   Those are the CPUs.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.280]   So I think the modem chips are fabulous.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.520]   But I don't know that for sure.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.520]   If you just need to--
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.520]   That's interesting.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.520]   That would make sense.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.920]   That's where you'd have TSMC and others.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.920]   Right.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.760]   And I can't think of the other one that I'm thinking of.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.760]   TSMC and--
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.760]   Micron?
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.760]   No.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.600]   That's memory.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.600]   Global Foundries?
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.720]   Global Foundries is the old AMD one.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.960]   They do memory mostly, I think.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:33.960]   SMSM.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:34.960]   UMC?
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.240]   Oh, UMC is the other one, and then there's an SM one.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.960]   Anyway, OK, just ignore me.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.960]   Ignore me.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:41.960]   STM?
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:42.960]   Well, this is--
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.960]   SMIC.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:44.960]   This is Infinean's old.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:45.960]   This is Infinean stuff.
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:46.960]   So I'm trying to remember where Infinean--
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:53.280]   I'm giving you these names from a spreadsheet of 73 rows of Intel chip foundries.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.000]   And by the way, they are all over the world.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.680]   I know Hillsborough, Oregon is a big place for the CPU.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:06.640]   They use-- they make some in Israel, the microprocessors.
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:11.520]   Make a lot of RAM in Singapore, the US, Japan.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.520]   They have a Foundry in--
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.600]   Broken Foundries in Germany.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.760]   So they're all over the world.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.760]   It's really interesting.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:19.760]   Those global Foundries are in--
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.760]   It's really interesting.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.760]   --of the one in the region.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.200]   Yeah, I would look at the TSMCs in that place, but--
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.840]   Yeah, that's Taiwan.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:33.520]   And then there's a UMC, which is in China.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.520]   Wow.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.520]   France.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:42.880]   SMIC is Beijing and Shanghai, Tianjin and Shenzhen.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.080]   How did we get into this?
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.080]   I don't know.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.080]   We were talking about Alpha--
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.080]   We were talking about Alpha--
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.080]   --of Foundry and Hole.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.320]   Did we do Google's financials yet?
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.320]   I can't even remember.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.320]   No.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.320]   Alphabet--
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.320]   Oh, we started by their cash pile.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.320]   Cash pile.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.560]   What is their revenues?
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.440]   And where have I put that?
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.320]   Where have I stuck that?
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:08.240]   I don't think that made it onto the rundown.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:14.040]   I believe they announced their Q2 earnings.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.680]   Google's-- here's a story from Quartz Google's Future
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.600]   Beyond Advertising is starting to become clear.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.600]   Alphabet's cash cow has always been Google
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.960]   and Google's largest revenue driver has always been by far
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.320]   advertising.
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:32.360]   July 25th, Alphabet reported its second quarter earnings.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.800]   32.6 billion in revenue from Google's ad business.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.000]   That's a 16% increase.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.640]   But traffic acquisition costs went up also 12%.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.960]   In fact, traffic acquisition costs are 22% of Google's ad
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.320]   revenue.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.000]   So that's a cause perhaps for concern.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.520]   I'm not a Wall Street analyst, so I don't really--
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.960]   I don't know really know what this means.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:01.320]   The revenue from ads to Worfs, everything else,
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.320]   if you look at this graph--
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.840]   What else are they going to do?
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.080]   Other revenues is blue.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.520]   Purple is ad revenue.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.560]   Other revenues is tight C. And you can't even
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:18.080]   see other bets, which is a tiny little sliver below that.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.400]   But ad revenue is doing very, very well.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.200]   It's still a good business for Google, right?
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.240]   It's still a good business.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.720]   But it's not growing.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.320]   So you look at that and you say, oh, is it kind of plateauing?
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.160]   And then I would also--
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.920]   the other thing to look at their margins.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.000]   How are the margins doing?
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:34.640]   Are they shrinking?
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:35.040]   Are they--
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:35.960]   Wall Street liked it.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.200]   Their stock went up.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.960]   Was bumped quite a bit, as I remember.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:42.600]   I think that just as advertising is challenged in media,
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.520]   it's also challenged in the platforms.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.720]   And the form of advertising is not forever.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.000]   So I think--
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.040]   Well, that's where other bets is really important, right?
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:56.480]   Google and Facebook are vulnerable.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.080]   The ad industry itself is suffering.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.720]   Being an agency right now is no fun.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.520]   Other bets, which includes Waymo, the health sciences,
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.600]   fairly, their internet.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.960]   These are all money losers.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.960]   Other bets lost almost a billion dollars.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.360]   That's an increase of 35%.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:17.600]   Generating a mere $162 million in revenue.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.120]   Over the last eight quarters, over the last two years,
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:24.000]   other bets has lost $6.6 billion.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.080]   So I don't know what this court's headline really means.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:31.200]   Doesn't sound like anything but ads are making money for--
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:31.800]   Pretty much true.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.360]   --Google.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:39.320]   Maybe-- OK, so Nest's cameras, Pixel phones--
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.120]   Yeah, their hardware is--
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:40.880]   Play Store revenue is--
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.480]   Not gigantic, but it is really coming up.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.600]   Company posted $4.25 billion for that business line
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.200]   compared to $6.2 billion.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:53.040]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.720]   Last year was $4.25 billion.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.840]   This year, it was 40% higher.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:01.600]   So yes, it is coming up-- $6.2 billion in its hardware
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.000]   division.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.880]   And when they come up with a new Chromebook,
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.400]   Pixel, I'm sure it'll go up another billion dollars.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.800]   When are you going to do that, guys?
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.300]   Huh?
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:08.800]   Google has--
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.520]   Was it last week?
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.000]   Neither of you were here last week,
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.600]   and we had a whole thing on Chromebooks.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.600]   Of course, you did.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.600]   Dr. Chromebook.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:18.600]   The Kevin is--
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:19.600]   Kevin Tofol's there.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.240]   And Jason Howell loves this Chromebook, too.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.040]   I don't remember.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.000]   I ignore it when it comes to Chromebooks.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:25.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:28.840]   I was like, oh, I do enough to be like, oh, Jeff,
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:29.560]   would be so excited.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.680]   They were talking about LTE on Chromebooks,
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:32.720]   which I know is your thing.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.480]   Here's an interesting change in strategy from Google.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.960]   They're kind of following the 1+ marketing model.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.840]   They're starting to just talk about their phones,
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:43.120]   even though the Pixel 4 won't be out till this--
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.360]   later this fall.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:49.200]   They're already releasing information about the Pixel 4.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.160]   This is a Google blog post.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.240]   As we shared last month, Pixel 4 is in the works.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:56.920]   Today, we're giving you an early look at the technology
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.400]   behind two new features.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.360]   I like this.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:51:59.880]   I do, too.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.920]   Instead of doing the Apple, oh, you can't know.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.560]   It's all going to be surprised.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.160]   Google's saying, well, let's talk about it.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.680]   Maybe you'll be more interested in what we've got.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.240]   And it gets an excitement build up.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.000]   Motion sense.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.560]   For the past five years, the advanced technology
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:15.160]   and projects teams, ATAP has been working on solely
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.040]   the ISO Li.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:19.400]   That's a motion sensor radar.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.240]   We've got a miniature version at the top of the Pixel 4.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.400]   It's not in the notch, by the way.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.600]   The Pixel 4 will not have a notch.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.840]   It's just going to have a big bezel up at the top.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.560]   How old are you?
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:33.120]   It senses small motions around the phone,
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.000]   combining unique software algorithms
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.040]   with advanced hardware sensor to recognize gestures.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.120]   So let's figure out where this is going to go next.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.960]   Because I figure that basically what's going to happen
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:45.120]   is people are going to look stupid in a whole new way.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.040]   They're going to be waving at their phone to skip songs.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:48.720]   Just stop.
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.120]   We talked about this today.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.560]   Silence for calls.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:53.040]   No.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.280]   This is not for that.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.960]   This is for everything else.
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.960]   It's said before your phone.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:03.720]   This is for imagine yourself in front of your Google Nest
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:07.840]   hub, whatever the heck it is, the smart display.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.120]   Moving through your recipe that you're working on.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.120]   You're moving through your song.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.120]   That's a good idea.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.520]   You have to say, hey, Google, do this.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.320]   Sorry, everyone.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.640]   I'm so sorry.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.000]   And then-- so that's one.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.640]   Two, think about it in your car.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.000]   And so where we're going to see this,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.800]   they're putting this on phones as a test.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.760]   They're also doing it.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.520]   I had said it was for economies of scale,
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.760]   but no one actually buys pixels.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.560]   So they're just doing it to give developers access to it
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.040]   in a format.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.840]   It will be available in Android.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:37.880]   So it is-- as the Pixel really should
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:41.080]   be, a reference design for whatever phone manufacturers
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.240]   might be doing.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.680]   I, when Soli first came out, I was excited about it.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.680]   And I still am.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.680]   This is interesting for robotic vision.
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:52.680]   So for robots, being able to understand--
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:56.280]   so the ultrasonic sensor, the radar sensor that's in there,
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.360]   gives it fine-grained understanding of movement, which
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:05.320]   means it can understand where a person is in space much better
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.240]   than using cameras.
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:06.960]   And it's not--
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.240]   I love it.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:10.440]   Look, we're looking for new user interfaces.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.880]   Voice is one.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.380]   Right.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:15.440]   Gestures makes a lot of sense.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.200]   Should I introduce the conspiracy theory at this point?
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:18.720]   Sure.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.840]   The other thing that will be very useful for Google
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:24.280]   is it's another kind of camera.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:24.720]   And so--
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:25.800]   It's not a camera.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.840]   No, it's another kind of camera.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.120]   It's radar.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:29.600]   So what--
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.600]   It's pulling in data about where a person is in space.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:35.440]   But it's actually much less granular and fine-grained
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:35.640]   than--
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:39.600]   But think about it can be used for identification as well.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:42.320]   Gate-- one of the things Google has already pioneered
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:44.720]   is gate recognition.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.160]   I think that Google has interests--
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:49.600]   cameras doesn't just have to be a visual picture
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:50.960]   of what's around you.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.720]   I think a radar of what's around you
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.040]   might be of equal interest to Google.
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.560]   And the more sensors they have on that phone,
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:58.920]   the better they can gather information.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.960]   They also say they're going to add face unlock, which, of course,
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.440]   Apple pioneered here.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:10.440]   They say the Pixel 4 will proactively unlock faces,
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.600]   even if you don't lift your phone.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.680]   If the face unlock sensors and algorithms recognize you,
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.960]   the phone will open the minute you pick it up.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.280]   It's already recognized you.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:25.160]   It just hasn't unlocked until you tell the phone I want to use
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.000]   you.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.120]   Face unlock works in almost any orientation,
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.200]   even if it's upside down.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.720]   And you can use it for secure payments
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:32.840]   and app authentication, too.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.240]   This is a little bit of let's do what Apple's--
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:39.160]   So Benedict Evans, who's a brilliant analyst at Andreessen
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.080]   Horowitz, wrote a piece--
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:45.080]   I just put it in the rundown this month--
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.400]   arguing that--
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.560]   talking about computers that can see--
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.240]   how a huge number of cameras that are being produced
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:54.280]   are not produced to make anything for us human beings--
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.280]   I agree.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:55.800]   Right?
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:56.280]   Yes.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:00.520]   And that's where the notion of vision goes.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.200]   It's a lot of Stacy's world, right, Stacy?
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:03.560]   Yes.
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:06.800]   And I've-- in the last two or three years,
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:09.680]   I think I've written his article several times.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.160]   But yes.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:13.840]   And this type of technology--
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.480]   I know just a couple--
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.120]   probably a few months ago, I wrote about radar and project
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:22.400]   solely and other sensor efforts that use radar.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:26.200]   This is going to be super popular for aging in place.
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.400]   People are already using it to measure falls.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:30.400]   There's a good use.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.400]   So yes, there's--
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.320]   There's the conspiracy theory.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:33.920]   Yes.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:37.560]   But this is, for most people, way less intrusive.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:40.440]   Because-- and this has always been the case.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:42.960]   People worry about images of themselves
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.240]   that are viewable by other people online and searchable.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.640]   We worry about cameras for that reason.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:51.680]   People don't think about metadata that can equally
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.560]   understand that when a computer knows that I am doing
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.960]   something embarrassing, it doesn't bother me,
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:59.120]   because it's a computer.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.640]   As long as the computer-- and people don't think about the
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:05.200]   fact that the computer can say, oh, these engage--
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:09.800]   this set of metadata means Stacy's picking her nose right now.
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.720]   As long as that's not visually out there on the internet,
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:12.400]   I don't care.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.800]   Well, it happens that it tells Stacy--
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:14.800]   It says it.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:18.880]   But I would submit that that's a typical human-centric point
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.600]   of view, but not a very informed point of view.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:22.600]   Which is what Stacy said.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.760]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.760]   I'm saying that people think that's great.
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.880]   But what's really happening is that
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:31.080]   I made a metadata about my falls or me picking my nose
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:35.280]   or whatever, that is going to be turned into Stacy picks her
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.280]   nose.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.480]   Let's mark it her some--
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.280]   I don't know what products nose pickers have.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:41.360]   But--
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.360]   Well--
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:43.920]   It's also a face recognition.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.720]   Radar makes-- in fact, Apple has basically that kind of
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:50.680]   3D sensing built into its iPhone face ID.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:54.520]   Face recognition with a 2D still images and as good as 3D
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.160]   images.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.480]   They don't use radar.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:58.480]   They don't use the--
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:57:59.520]   It's depth sensing.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:00.040]   They use--
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.920]   Yeah, is it a time of flight depth sensor?
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.040]   Time of flight.
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:04.880]   Time of flight.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:05.880]   Time of flight.
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:06.880]   Time of flight.
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:07.880]   No, like LiDAR?
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:08.880]   What type of--
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:09.880]   It's not LiDAR.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.880]   It's the same thing as--
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.520]   It's not LiDAR because they're thinking of--
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.360]   They bought--
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:14.360]   --and doing LiDAR into--
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.800]   Apple is really a company called PrimeSense that developed
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:20.160]   this initially for Microsoft's Connect.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.880]   The Connect--
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:22.240]   Right.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:24.280]   --and it's the same technology in the Apple iPhone,
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.280]   I should point out.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.480]   Can tell your heart rate.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:31.680]   So with the Connect, for instance, when you're exercising,
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:34.560]   they've taken-- Microsoft's stopped selling them for a reason.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.080]   I don't--
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.080]   But there are three different technologies--
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:38.280]   They can tell if you're exercising hard enough
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:41.800]   because your heart rate at distance is not fast enough.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:45.160]   This kind of technology is very useful.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.120]   Yes, but my quibble with you is there
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.000]   are three different types of technologies
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.280]   that allow for depth perception.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:51.280]   It's not radar.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.080]   And radar is one of them, but I don't think
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.440]   that's the one that Apple's using.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:54.960]   Sorry.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:55.960]   No, but--
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.160]   Mine is-- I'm arguing with you on a purely tech basis.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:01.040]   So Apple-- and in fact, Apple even demonstrated this
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.880]   when they introduced Face ID.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.120]   It sends out an infrared light, which
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.840]   they bounce off your face, which detects the contours
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:08.880]   of your face.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.040]   So it's not technically time of flight,
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.920]   but it's very similar to that kind of--
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:16.680]   Well, so it's time of flight uses math.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.600]   Google's face recognition is supposed to be different.
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:19.440]   The story's about--
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.280]   Right, because they didn't have the patent.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.280]   But it's supposed to be better than PrimeSense.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.280]   How does it look like that?
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.080]   They just have to do something different.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.920]   Because they say you don't even have to pick it up to your face.
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.760]   They can do it from different angles and upside down.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:33.120]   Yeah, and Apple had struggled a little bit when it first
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:35.800]   came out with Face ID at doing it at different--
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.960]   and if it's the cameras rotated.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.000]   I'm dreadiness.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.120]   They've mastered that.
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:40.960]   It does it now.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.320]   I'm dreadiness.
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.680]   Well, I want to point out that there's
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:49.000]   some value to it for unlocking or sensing or adjusters.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.880]   But I wouldn't be-- and you got to remember
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:52.920]   how Google thinks about this.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:55.000]   They don't go-- they're not rubbing their hands gleefully
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.640]   saying, and while we're doing that,
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.280]   we can also sense your heart rate and all these other things.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.440]   They think of this all as a general benefit.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.120]   We will know more about you, and we
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.240]   can deliver more services as a result.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.960]   But I should point out, as you have Stacy,
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:12.160]   that it is much more information than a 2D picture can give you
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.400]   and can be used in a variety of ways.
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:17.920]   And we don't yet know what kinds of ways.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.040]   Google did point out that just like Apple,
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.240]   they're going to store all that face recognition in a secure
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.520]   enclave chip within the Pixel 4.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.360]   So it won't be--
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:26.720]   Right.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.880]   It will be local, which is exciting.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.080]   So that's good news.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:34.760]   What is important also to point out-- and we always
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.280]   point this out with Apple-- is they
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.560]   may store the raw data of your fingerprint
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:44.600]   or your face ID on the phone and never send it to Apple.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.560]   But they absolutely send out the processed information
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:53.040]   later that they know.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.640]   And they even admit to this.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:55.960]   Yeah, we don't have your fingerprint,
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.680]   but we know the information that that generates.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.000]   And I think that Google would do the same thing
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.560]   for a variety of reasons.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.080]   Oh, here.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:07.040]   I found a paper for the super nerds.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.080]   I'm going to put it in the chat.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:13.560]   Here is the SIGGRAPH paper from 2017 on how solely works.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:14.520]   There you go.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:15.760]   Thank you.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.840]   And I am reading it right now to figure this out.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.360]   Well, you--
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:21.040]   It's all right.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.800]   You don't have to do it right now.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.120]   I have to know.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.000]   It's OK.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.400]   I'm like, this is how I know this stuff.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.880]   I read lots of papers.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.120]   Yeah, I bet you do.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.320]   Oh, it's--
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.400]   Yeah, let me ask you about that for a second.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.280]   How many do you have to subscribe to a lot
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.240]   of academic journal databases?
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.160]   I subscribe to no academic journals.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.400]   What I do is I pay attention for hot chips or SIGGRAPH,
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.400]   which just happened.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.720]   And a lot of companies, if I talk to them,
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.480]   they'll just send me the papers, their white papers.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.640]   Because I mean, it's really rare that they're
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:02.560]   interviewing a journalist, and the journalist gets so excited
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.520]   about what they're doing that they're like, can I see a white paper?
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.440]   Can I see a research?
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.520]   And then I go and archive, which is my favorite place ever.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.440]   But that's for AI research more than chip research.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.440]   Got it.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.440]   OK.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.640]   Let's see.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.920]   Google is stopping people on the street and giving them $5.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:22.920]   Just relax.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.920]   Just relax.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.680]   OK.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.120]   They are--
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:25.880]   They're disclosing--
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:29.800]   They're disclosing their Pixel 4 Face ID feature.
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:33.160]   Because, of course, you need the data before you can make Face
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.200]   ID work reliably.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:39.600]   Google has said that it was initially reported
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:45.600]   by Chris Matizik in ZDNet.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:49.120]   He said-- I think he was in Washington Square Park in the city.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.720]   Hi, I work for Google, somebody said.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.000]   And we're collecting data to improve the next generation
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.440]   of facial recognition, phone unlocking.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.200]   You need to hold the phone in selfie mode in front of your face,
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.680]   moving it around to analyze every feature of your appearance.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:06.000]   And then we'll give you a $5 AmazonX Starbucks gift card.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.200]   So they're disclosing.
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.000]   It's fine.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.080]   I'm saying, what's what?
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.480]   And companies need to do this.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.200]   They could do it surreptitiously.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.800]   They could just put a camera out and do it.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.280]   Well, that wouldn't get them the measurements they need.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.960]   Well, five or six cameras.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.440]   Well, here's what they could do.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:26.840]   They could put out an app saying, hey, if you scan your face for us,
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.520]   we'll send you.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.080]   We'll tell you what you look like when you'll be doing that.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.520]   Who would ever do that?
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.840]   Google says, although--
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.160]   Google says with their art thing.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:35.920]   Yeah, remember that?
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:36.760]   Yeah.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.880]   Microsoft's done it too.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.040]   But Microsoft did the aging thing.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.280]   When it comes to the data, the company's already gathered
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.640]   from the compensated volunteers.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.400]   Google is allowing them to decide what ultimately happens to it.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:51.080]   Although face samples inherently can't be anonymous, says Google,
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.880]   each participant is assigned an abstract identity number.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.640]   We separately keep each participant's email address
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.600]   in order to remove data upon requests.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.720]   That's probably a GDPR requirement.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.480]   Participants previously agreed to allow Google to keep--
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.480]   they should call themselves doodle--
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.160]   Google to keep their face data for five years.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:15.320]   Now they're cutting it down after the publicity to 18 months.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.160]   What's the analyze?
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:16.720]   They don't need it?
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.440]   Yeah, they don't need it.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.480]   The Pixel 4 will not send your data to Google
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:22.920]   for its face recognition to work.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.840]   Should reiterate that.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.760]   You're calm today.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.680]   This is good.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.160]   I'm always calm.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.800]   I think-- is it weird?
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.200]   Baby Jeff has a calming influence on you?
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.680]   I'm always--
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.520]   Oh, wow.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.480]   I'm not any different than I always am.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.720]   Or do you have a calming influence on Jeff?
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.120]   Exactly the same.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.880]   Even Jeff seems calm.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.400]   You just wait.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.960]   Let's talk about section 203.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:48.960]   No.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.200]   That's not-- that's not really up.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:50.760]   That's not really up.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.960]   Actually, let's talk about--
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.960]   230.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.960]   Let's talk about--
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.960]   Go in.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.680]   Let's talk about the quality.
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.680]   Oh, medium is down.
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:02.120]   Well, I'll have to talk to the author about what's
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.280]   wrong with tech journalism.
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:08.200]   So there was-- is it down?
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.880]   There was a very good paper that I saw presented
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.920]   at an academic conference in medium.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.720]   Yeah, it's-- oh, no, no.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.520]   Oh, it came back up.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.680]   OK.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.840]   By Axel Bruns, who's an academic at the University of Queensland.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:25.880]   And he pokes holes, rather considerable gigantic wormhole
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.920]   holes in the notions and metaphors of the--
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.200]   it's on Buzz machine.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:31.960]   OK.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.840]   Your blog is never down.
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.840]   Don't jinx me in the idea of the filter bubble
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.680]   and the echo chamber.
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.720]   And does a very good literature read going through all
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.120]   the literature that says, folks, it doesn't really exist.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.760]   But these metaphors are being used.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.240]   And the metaphors are not at all defined.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.120]   So we don't have any mechanism to argue about it,
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.840]   or measure it, or understand what this impact is.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:57.360]   So define, before we go too much farther,
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.120]   what is commonly believed to be the echo chamber
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.120]   in the filter bubble?
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.400]   They become almost synonymous.
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.000]   Eli Parriser used the filter bubble.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.640]   Eli Parriser argued that the filter bubble
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.880]   is that if you went into search and you and I would get--
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:13.560]   Because search is-- and the way Google does it anyway
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:17.560]   is modified based on your previous searches,
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.480]   you're going to tend to get eventually over time
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.400]   the same results.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.920]   That was the argument, though.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:25.040]   The Axel Bruns points to research that says that
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.600]   wasn't the case, except for within a nation,
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:30.040]   you had some more search results.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.080]   But you went on.
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.600]   Maybe even within a zip code.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.600]   No, no, no.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.000]   Has to be as big as a nation.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.640]   Yeah, there are different languages
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.120]   and so on, so you have different search.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.400]   But in Google Search and Google News,
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.960]   this research showed because it's actual research.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.960]   So this sent me on to an argument.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.240]   And I'm a fake academic.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.080]   I'm no academic.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.680]   I'm just a journalism teacher.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:53.040]   But among the real academics, we're
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.880]   doing the kind of papers that Stacy reads that really matter,
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:00.440]   there is a standard and discipline of evidence.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.200]   And we don't have that in journalism.
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.560]   So I end up ranting about the quality of technology journalism.
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.520]   It went from full utopian to full dystopian.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.000]   And things like echo chamber and filter bubble,
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.560]   a bubble up to become just presumed this exists without any
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.520]   effort to even do a literature search
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.080]   and see what exists in the evidence.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.160]   And then regulation and legislation
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.720]   is going to pop out of that.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.840]   And we're just irresponsible in my field,
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:26.840]   so I complained about that.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.240]   I thought I'd get a lot of crap from people like you.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.640]   But so far, I haven't.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:35.240]   And I think we have a problem in the tech journalism world
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.280]   that we haven't really, really dealt with.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.560]   But it's not just tech journalism.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:39.960]   It's all of journalism, right?
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.760]   It's humans.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.760]   It's human.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:43.960]   We should be better.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:44.540]   Humans--
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.760]   Yeah, need better journalism, of course.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.440]   No, no.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.440]   OK.
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.560]   We have to-- more data is always good,
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.760]   but the challenge with journalism-- and you can call it
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.360]   a filter bubble, you can call it whatever you want--
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.160]   is we are writing stories for people.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.840]   And people are story and narrative oriented.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.320]   And Jeff, you have some book, some academic book
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.360]   that talks about this.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.360]   Yes.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.680]   How history gets things wrong, the neuroscience
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.200]   of our addiction to stories.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.320]   Yes, that is--
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:17.080]   Stacy, that doesn't mean the story has to be factless.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:19.640]   But journalists do look for facts.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:23.800]   We just look for facts in the context in which we have today,
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.040]   which is driven by a narrative.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.960]   I mean, how do you find your stories?
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.320]   I tell you how-- I mean, I find my stories because people
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.240]   talk to me about things they've noticed.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:33.960]   But I know--
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:33.960]   I hate--
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:34.640]   --stacy.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.600]   I know that you--
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.120]   You don't do that.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.560]   --because you're a good journalist and responsible
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:41.640]   journalist attempt to escape the confines of your preconceived
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.840]   notions when you're doing research for your story.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.840]   And you have context--
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.340]   I do.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:45.840]   And that's--
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:46.840]   You do it in the show, Stacy.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:47.840]   You bring in context.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.840]   I do, too.
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:49.840]   You just did, Leo, three minutes ago.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:50.340]   Yeah.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:50.840]   So no, no, no, no.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:51.960]   I don't know that wrong because you
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.680]   have the experience of the context.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:54.440]   But OK.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.600]   But here, and you're right.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.360]   I've done this.
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:00.240]   This is why I talk to engineers more than I talk to people.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:00.840]   Or-- OK.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:01.400]   That was wrong.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.400]   They're going to log here into that construct.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:03.920]   Sorry.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:08.760]   PR people is really-- like normal people, people who don't look
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:09.120]   at data.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.360]   And that's why--
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.760]   Keep digging, Stacy.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.720]   Keep digging.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.360]   I am more like that than an actual person, I guess.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.480]   Anyway, the point is engineers are my people
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.160]   because we think alike.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.680]   We think in data.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.360]   But I will tell you, as a journalist, fewer people
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.760]   read my stories because I don't have the narrative.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.680]   And I'm not very good at it.
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.920]   And that is the challenge.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.360]   And I always call it the dead baby lead
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:41.480]   because you lead with the dead baby to get your story out
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:41.760]   there.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.480]   And Sarah Kiff is actually really good at this.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.880]   She does health care data, for example.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.360]   But she will always-- all of her stories
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.760]   are super immersed in data.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.200]   But they always-- they don't always
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.280]   have an actual dead baby.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:56.160]   But they have some sort of--
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.120]   usually it's a dying patient of some sort.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.440]   But that type of journalism is really rare.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.280]   It's really hard.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.960]   It's really expensive.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.120]   And people don't--
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.720]   I mean-- and honestly, I don't think it actually
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.400]   drives page views, which is the advertising--
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.160]   Well, let me argue with this, Stacy, because I think--
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.560]   I think Leo's point is, right, you're
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.320]   not giving yourself sufficient credit for the good job
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:20.600]   that you do in journalism.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.800]   What I'm talking about here is that you come along--
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:26.560]   look at the red wine will kill you, red wine will save you
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.920]   stories.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.120]   That's an example about how we just simply just understand
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.440]   and report on science the way it should be reported on,
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.880]   that there are strings of bits of research that test out
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:41.920]   various hypotheses and that add up to something.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.520]   But the story doesn't add up to it.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.680]   Or when we say, when there's this presumption,
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.000]   that there's a filter bubble, and it's never tested,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.600]   that you do stories about, oh my god,
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.000]   we're all in a filter bubble.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.600]   This is the roots of all of our problems in society right now.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.360]   And then you have academic research at easy reach
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:00.800]   to just do a simple search to say, oh, actually, no.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.800]   The filter bubble's been debunked,
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.360]   but it's been debunked in a different world of the academe.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.320]   So I would say--
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.840]   That's the problem.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.560]   One, when people start talking about the filter bubble,
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.880]   we've been talking about the filter bubble
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.080]   before there was academic research about it.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.400]   So people start estimating that this is out there.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.720]   If you're actually at the cutting edge,
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.320]   people are estimating that these things happen,
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.280]   especially in the social sciences.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.760]   And then the research comes out,
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.080]   either backs it up or doesn't back it up.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:30.760]   So I think there's social science research is hard.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.840]   And it's usually after the fact, after we've
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.960]   started writing articles about it,
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.840]   empirical science that you can measure.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.560]   Even that is called into question.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.120]   So those red wine studies are difficult
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:45.920]   because you'll have an article or you'll have a study come out
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:49.640]   one year that says this, and then another one that says that.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:53.120]   And I think another thing that's hard for journalists
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.320]   reporting on science is they don't understand science.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:02.840]   They don't understand how studies should be written.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.360]   And I think--
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.800]   And they don't understand the difference
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.360]   between a control group or maybe an overview study.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.120]   Which is why I was involved in journalism school
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.320]   that we don't teach them.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.160]   Yeah, we've got to do that.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.920]   We give you a few facts from Brungs.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:16.520]   Our study.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.840]   I give you a few studies, let's say.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.200]   So two studies looked at already divisive topics
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.240]   like abortion, vaccination, Obamacare, gun control,
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.160]   and found, of course, their divisive online.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.200]   Then they looked at other topics that people
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.720]   argue about, like Game of Thrones and Foodborne,
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.520]   and found that they didn't need to polarization online.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.440]   So is the problem that online creates the divisiveness,
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.960]   or we just bring the divisiveness online?
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:39.600]   Another one.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.160]   Social media users, quoting here, generally
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.560]   encounter a greater diversity of news sources
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.120]   than non-users do.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.400]   So that's the echo chamber argument.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.040]   Oh no, we're just in our filter bubble.
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.080]   We don't know crap.
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:50.960]   Another one.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.200]   Those users frequenting the most extremely partisan
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.840]   conservative sites in the United States
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:01.520]   have been found also to be more likely than ordinary users
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.480]   to visit the New York Times.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.080]   Another one.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.560]   Exposure to highly partisan political information,
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.280]   I'm getting quoting, does not come
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.400]   with the expensive contact with other viewpoints.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.440]   These are things that are not hard to find.
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:17.880]   And I will confess here that I'm very ashamed of myself
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.480]   that I never learned, no one ever taught me in journalism
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.960]   school, no one ever taught me in a newsroom ever
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:25.520]   to go and do a search of academic research
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.120]   to find out what facts were.
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.480]   And yeah, we didn't have Google Scholar before,
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.880]   and we didn't have Jay Stewart, we didn't have other things.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:36.000]   But I'm saying now that the next time I see a journalist do
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.640]   the lazy filter bubble story, I'm on their rear end.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.720]   I have to say that there's two things that work here.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:46.920]   First of all, the reason people believe in the filter bubble
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.160]   is because it makes sense to them.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:52.200]   So it's one of-- and I think this we do this all the time.
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:55.120]   We don't look for studies or facts.
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.320]   It just-- oh, that makes sense.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.920]   Same with the vaccinations story.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:58.320]   It makes sense.
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.280]   For some people, it makes sense.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.320]   Kind of makes sense.
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.800]   And then this is-- and it's hard for a journalist
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:08.920]   because if you're constantly saying, well, wait a minute,
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:12.600]   but let's look at the facts, what makes sense to you is wrong.
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:16.600]   You end up sounding like you're harping.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.920]   I don't think you'll be a popular journalist for very long.
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.400]   And so this has to be done.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:27.440]   As Bernie Sanders would say, well, nobody likes Bernie either.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.080]   I mean, that's a problem.
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:33.240]   And it's a problem journalists are, yes, of course.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.840]   It's a higher calling and all that.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.360]   But ultimately, it's a business.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.360]   That doesn't mean that.
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:38.760]   That doesn't mean you then say you need--
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.120]   You need to build an audience.
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:44.280]   And if the audience gets angry because every time you come on,
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.600]   you say something that bursts their bubble--
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.080]   So we should go with the falsity screw it?
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.800]   Well, no, but you have to do it carefully.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.200]   Here's an easier representation.
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.720]   And you can't do it every time.
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:54.680]   OK.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.080]   As a journalist, as both a newsroom journalist who
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.960]   had only one story due every day,
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.880]   God, you remember being a daily journalist.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.440]   And people are like, that's so hard because you
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.480]   have to write a story every day.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:05.880]   Yeah, you could read the newspaper in the morning.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:07.040]   It was amazing.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.240]   Oh, crazy.
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:11.800]   But now, in being a blogger who's had a story and even,
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:16.320]   occasionally, only have to do one story a week, which is crazy,
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.760]   academic papers suck.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.520]   They're hard to read.
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.200]   They're hard to understand.
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.720]   They're expensive to find and access, even with things
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:25.640]   like Google Scholar.
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:29.000]   And you can even find studies that completely contradict
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:29.640]   one another.
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:30.560]   Oh, that's really fun.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.240]   Of course.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.160]   Yes.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.960]   And in the world of academia, it's
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.120]   hard to know who's legit and who isn't.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:42.280]   So I have to quote academic sources every now and then
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:43.840]   for some of my articles.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.360]   And if you get the wrong academic,
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.080]   everyone else in the academic circles
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:49.840]   are laughing at you.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.160]   And they're like, and they'll come out of the woodworks.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.040]   Not just laughing at you.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.360]   They're usually telling you what an idiot you are.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.840]   And you also have to deal with people
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:04.280]   who think that their minor disagreements really
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:08.200]   matter when to the bigger picture in world at large.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.880]   You're like, eh, it doesn't.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.960]   Through that.
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:16.720]   So that's asking a lot of someone who's not paid very much
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:21.080]   and who is also trying to juggle a lot of other things.
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:22.120]   That's--
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.600]   But as a journalism teacher, I think that--
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.480]   Well, you should always hold the highest standard.
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:28.520]   Yeah, you should tell them--
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:29.000]   I realize--
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.200]   I'm realizing that I'm not--
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.000]   yes, they had a research that our school teaches this.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.680]   But I have them in teaching this, and I need to.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.160]   No, I think you're right.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:36.520]   I think you're right.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:40.520]   But I think you also have to address the real politic
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.880]   of it all, which is you can't be the guy who's always
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:44.360]   burst in people's bubbles.
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.920]   But you don't back up the bubble when the bubble is--
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.160]   Don't back up the bubble.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.160]   Don't back up the bubble.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:49.840]   Don't back up the bubble.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:54.200]   That would be a show title, but we are beat.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:54.760]   Let's see.
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:55.480]   Let's take a break.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.920]   Come back with our change law.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.160]   We've got picks of the week still to come as well.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.840]   And we do want to wrap this up in the next 15 minutes.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:03.800]   Don't have fun.
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.160]   You can get to the debate.
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.920]   Well, we've got a half an hour.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:07.440]   OK.
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:11.480]   I know you're trying to get rid of me, but it stuck with me.
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.400]   I'll show they brought to you by CAPTARIF.
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.040]   You're in business.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.000]   It's so common.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.440]   It's almost universal.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.800]   In fact, I just read a study--
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.880]   we were talking about on Windows Weekly this morning.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:24.440]   One third of all businesses are still running at least one
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.800]   Windows XP machine.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:27.800]   Of course they are.
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:30.240]   And I can almost promise you the reason they run that Windows
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:32.800]   XP machine is because that critical,
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:35.800]   super important line of business program that they got written
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:40.200]   back in 1992 will only run on Windows XP.
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.920]   And they're stuck with it.
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.920]   That's why people still use Internet Explorer 8.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:47.800]   Still use Flash active desktop.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:53.960]   But really, honestly, there is great software, modern software,
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.400]   better software out there.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.240]   If you could only find it--
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:59.600]   and that's why our sponsor really is helpful--
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.880]   CAPTARIF.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.600]   CAPTARIF is the leading free online resource
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:10.560]   to help you find the best modern software for your business.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.160]   And by the way, I think if you've done this,
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:16.920]   you know that, well, the first thought maybe is Google it.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:18.360]   Because that's just a bunch of results
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.960]   that are going to be all over the place.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.840]   Ask a friend, but he's not going to know every--
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.000]   CAPTARIF is amazing.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.040]   CAPTARIF is a search engine, in effect,
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.680]   with 700 categories of business software and everything.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:32.960]   I mean, from project management to email marketing,
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:38.760]   customer relation management, mailing list management.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:42.640]   But also, line of business software.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.240]   Jail management software.
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.720]   You've found a good one.
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.960]   You've got to manage a jail tracker.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.960]   Actually, it doesn't have to be jail tracker.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.320]   Could be e-logger.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:55.720]   Could be-- turns out, there are half a dozen, maybe more,
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:19:01.320]   offender management system, jail management programs out there.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.280]   Well, that's amazing.
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.120]   First, in custody.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.080]   First of all, now we know there's some.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:09.280]   But what-- what's great is you can then narrow it down
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:12.520]   by the number of stars it's got,
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.760]   by how it delivers itself.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:15.560]   Is it local?
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.600]   You put it on your hard drive.
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.400]   Or is it a web-based solution?
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.000]   How many seats it supports?
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.840]   Whether it can make appointments,
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.520]   all the different features you might want.
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.600]   Narrow it down.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.400]   You can compare side by side up to four.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.080]   But then the best part.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.200]   I'm kind of amazed that there's this many jail management
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.200]   programs out there.
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:39.000]   Then the best part is you can read the reviews.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.320]   Almost a million verified, real reviews
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.000]   by realusers on capterra.com.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.480]   This is incredible.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.880]   There's 1,000 new reviews every single day.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.120]   That means in the next, I don't know, three weeks.
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.520]   They're going to get over a million.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.200]   And that's fantastic.
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.400]   That means you're not only going to find the right software.
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.560]   You're going to see what people who are using it right now
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.840]   say about it.

[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.960]   of this week in Google.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:08.600]   Are you excited?
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:12.360]   Are you interested in this T-Mobile sprint merger?
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:13.760]   It looks like it might be going forward.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.160]   There's still a few hurdles.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.440]   But why not?
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:17.920]   I think what's really interesting--
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.640]   and I mentioned this on Twitter-- is Charlie Ergin.
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.200]   Mm-hmm.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.000]   He is quite a character.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   That was a good spirit.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.080]   He's the founder of Dish.
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:30.720]   Dish is the big beneficiary on this, because Dish--
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.200]   so Charlie is a very interesting fella.
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.600]   Great profile about him in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.280]   I've met Charlie.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:40.640]   I've done his show, Charlie Chat, on Dish.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:44.320]   He was a professional poker player for many years.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:47.160]   Then an analyst at Frito-Lay, he decided to quit his job
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.920]   at Frito-Lay, joined with another poker player friend.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:54.200]   They ponied up $60,000 to start a business selling
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:58.960]   big satellite dishes, the 10-meter dishes in Denver.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.560]   Eventually, he founded the Dish network,
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:04.440]   selling those hubcap-sized dishes,
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:09.000]   going right up against the cable TV business and winning.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.560]   That $60,000 investment is now worth $9 billion.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.840]   That's his stake in the Dish network.
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.240]   One thing Charlie's been doing--
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:18.680]   he's a really interesting fella.
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:20.280]   He's kind of a character.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:23.720]   But one thing he's been doing is buying up spectrum
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:24.920]   and not using it.
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:28.560]   Much to the dismay of T-Mobile's Sprint AT&T, Verizon,
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:33.080]   and the FCC, he's been collecting spectrum.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.480]   He has been the biggest spectrum speculator out there
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:39.360]   for the longest time, and one of the more litigious.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.920]   So he's buying it, holding onto it,
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.920]   and it's since there is a dead asset.
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:48.280]   Yes, although he would argue that he is using it,
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.560]   or he has always had plans to use it,
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:53.400]   and various things keep getting in the way.
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.960]   So he--
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.040]   Everybody knew that Dish was going to do this
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.240]   at some point, right?
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.240]   Yes.
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:03.920]   And he is in a really interesting space,
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:09.280]   because right now with 5G, so having access to both dishes
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:13.960]   on people's homes and millimeter wave spectrum, which he has,
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.720]   he can actually build a viable network, which is--
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:20.320]   I mean, this is exactly how AT&T and Verizon,
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:23.240]   or how Verizon specifically is doing their 5G
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:23.960]   to the home network.
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.000]   But even better--
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.320]   And he even says this in this Wall Street Journal piece.
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:29.360]   He said, why would I build LTE?
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:32.480]   Just have to rip it out when 5G comes along.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.840]   He's been thinking all along.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.360]   I'll start with 5G.
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.360]   I think he's actually been--
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.000]   he's had the spectrum, and he's made
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.200]   some interesting spectrum trades over the years, too.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:44.920]   I think he's positioning to be in a space
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.280]   where he can actually offer a compelling service
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:50.840]   to compete with these guys, where he doesn't have
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:52.960]   to compete against their spectrum holdings, which
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:55.040]   have been superior historically.
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.240]   He's also doing an MBIOT network.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.640]   What's that?
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:02.720]   MBIOT, it's a standard.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:07.200]   It's a cellular standard that sends very tiny bits of data out.
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.720]   And you can--
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.520]   yeah, it's just tiny bits of data.
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:14.600]   Microchip Bluetooth internet of things.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:17.840]   So a couple of things I think you're interested in.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:20.200]   Yes, he may have just been--
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.240]   he may come out as one of--
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:24.880]   he was accidentally smart.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:26.440]   It may be-- he didn't have this strategy.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.760]   No, no, I think he was very smart.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:29.880]   I think he knew what he was doing, but you can't be sure.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:30.400]   Yeah, I think he was very smart.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:34.080]   I think he reminds me a little of Elon Musk, maybe Jeff Bezos,
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.960]   as one of those guys who was willing to take the long shot.
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:39.880]   I think this-- I think he's a poker player.
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.880]   He's pushed his chips.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.520]   All these people, guys, are poker players.
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:43.520]   They're poker players.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.800]   And I think he knew he was taking a big risk.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.160]   So he's putting you as playing, yes.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:50.200]   They say he says it's going to cost him $10 billion
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:51.280]   to build this network.
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:51.800]   This is not--
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:56.520]   Did you explain how this comes out of the Verizon deal?
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.040]   What he gets out of the sprint T-Mobile?
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:59.440]   Yes, it's right.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.040]   So this is what's fascinating.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.920]   And this is from the Wall Street Journal piece.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:07.360]   He's sitting there, sitting on all these assets, just sitting.
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.400]   And all of a sudden, John Ledger, T-Mobile,
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.960]   is told by the Department of Justice,
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.320]   we're not going to let this go through unless you can somehow
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:17.520]   figure out a way to create a credible fourth carrier.
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.400]   John Ledger goes, how am I going to do that?
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.400]   He says Charlie--
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.400]   Who am I?
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:24.920]   He says he calls up Charlie within-- they made this deal
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.560]   in three weeks.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:27.560]   Wow.
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:34.520]   And Charlie's going to get the sprint PCS MVNO business, which
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:35.440]   is MetroPCS.
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:40.080]   He's going to get T-Mobile's boost another MVNO style,
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.800]   although it's owned by those companies.
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.840]   So part of the reason he needs that
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:46.920]   is because he has a deal that he has to be up and running
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.920]   as a wireless carrier by next year.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:49.840]   So he is.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.000]   They just give him these businesses.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.080]   It may not be a very good business.
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:55.480]   It may not be a very big business,
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.120]   but he's satisfied the requirement.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.920]   And so that gives him a little breathing room
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.680]   so that he can then start building this $10 billion 5G
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:05.600]   network.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:06.080]   You know what?
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.520]   He could fail miserably.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:08.960]   He knows he could fail miserably.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.720]   This could be a huge gamble.
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:14.240]   And he pushes in all his chips and he has to walk away.
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.480]   So what else did he get from T-Mobile?
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:19.160]   He got a lot of spectrum, but I don't know
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.160]   if it's valuable spectrum.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:24.320]   Maybe Stacy knows that better than I do.
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:27.200]   I'm looking at the current spectrum holdings
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.080]   before the acquisition.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.080]   I can go look, I haven't seen there.
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:32.880]   Essentially, this was mandated by the Department of Justice.
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:35.480]   They said, look, in order to improve this merger,
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:40.040]   you've got to create a credible fourth carrier.
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.080]   And this was actually a very clever way to do it.
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:47.200]   Under the merger, dish will rent capacity from T-Mobile
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:48.960]   and the new T-Mobile, which is the combined--
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:51.040]   Which, by the way, is who'd be run by whom?
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.120]   By T-Mobile.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:53.880]   No, by which CEO?
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:54.440]   Ledger.
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:54.960]   Ledger, cut.
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.480]   Yeah, sprints out of the-- now, I
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:58.560]   don't know what happens to soft banks investment in sprint.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.320]   I guess they probably still have a piece
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.040]   of the combined companies.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:05.160]   Deutsche Telekom, one's a big piece, if not all, of T-Mobile.
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.800]   So these are actually--
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.160]   don't think, even though these companies were struggling,
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.640]   especially sprint, that they are not well-funded.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.440]   They've got soft bank behind them.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.960]   They've got Deutsche Telekom.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:19.160]   After seven years of using T-Mobile's capacity,
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:23.360]   dish will now run its own network using all that spectrum
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.600]   he's been acquiring and its own equipment
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.480]   installed on fewer towers.
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:32.160]   So it's a very interesting play.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.280]   I think, Charlie, I love watching people like Elon Musk
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:38.280]   as crazy as they are because they're
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:42.440]   willing to play at a level, a Wild West level, that most
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.400]   corporate CEOs in America just aren't willing to do.
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.280]   And you know what?
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:51.840]   Elon wants to put 12,000 low-Earth orbit satellites up
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:55.520]   to create global internet at gigabit internet.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:59.120]   I also love it when the third-point-one ledger goes
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:01.080]   after his competitors and pokes them.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.760]   Well, and that's why we needed somebody,
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.480]   because Charlie's the new John Ledger.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.000]   So if it weren't for T-Mobile, I don't think
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.160]   we have the deals we have from Verizon and AT&T, by any means.
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:14.320]   Yeah, so, OK, so it's actually--
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:17.080]   dish is actually going to get part of sprint's 800 megahertz
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.160]   spectrum, which is awesome.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.160]   Juicy, juicy.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.960]   And dish already has 600 and 700 megahertz spectrum.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:29.880]   So they have really-- so who cares about 5G and their stupid
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:30.600]   millimeter wave?
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:32.560]   It's got stuff that is going to--
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:35.040]   Yeah, these low frequencies go through walls.
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.360]   And that's really what's key.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.920]   These are the old TV spectrum that remember
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:41.280]   when the digital moved to digital,
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.720]   they had to give up those 700 megahertz spectrum.
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:44.920]   That's what he has.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:48.400]   So that is-- yeah, that's going to be a better cell phone
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:49.960]   service than these other guys came up with.
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:52.080]   Is it a cell phone or is it data or what?
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.160]   I doubt they're very much--
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:53.760]   That'll be data.
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:54.520]   It'll all be data.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:55.520]   They're not going to do it.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:58.040]   Well, but OK, so he can't do massive amounts of data,
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:02.000]   because I think he's only got a 20 megahertz total
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.080]   in that band, which in your--
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.640]   so the width of your channels is what
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:09.840]   allows you-- is the limiting factor
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.760]   on how many bits perhertz you can--
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.640]   Well, and the other thing Charlie's betting on
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:16.040]   is that-- remember we were talking
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.960]   about how hard these giant corporate mergers are
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.440]   when you have two different cultures,
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.440]   you have two different technologies.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:25.680]   I think he's betting that T-Mobile is going to be struggling
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.000]   integrating Sprint's customers, Sprint's network
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.280]   into their network.
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.000]   It's the store is going to be a mess.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.840]   And I think he's saying to himself,
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:35.880]   that gives me a decade to build out something better.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:40.160]   He also says he wants to disintermediate the phone
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:41.000]   companies.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.680]   He says-- you know, he says that--
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:48.400]   Yeah, everybody wants to disintermediate the phone company.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.120]   Well, of course.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.120]   But he's in that business now.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:57.080]   He says-- he's starting from behind in the cell phone game,
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.760]   but he argues it gives him an advantage.
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.120]   Their legacy is a mishmash.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.880]   Their networks are plaid.
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.240]   We will be a solid color.
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.760]   You got to like this guy.
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:09.920]   He also says he sees some opportunity with car companies,
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:13.520]   offering 5G to self-driving cars.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:15.280]   He's going to target those businesses.
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.280]   Does it affect--
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:17.880]   Is it core dish business?
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:18.240]   Pardon me?
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:19.600]   Does it affect his core dish business?
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:20.640]   Does he-- does he deliver--
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:23.440]   Does it get integrates with this core business, right?
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:25.440]   Those dishes can be used.
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:26.120]   Can they be used?
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.560]   Are they the right frequencies?
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:30.320]   You don't need to-- so your satellite dish
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:33.960]   is given the spectrum he owns, he doesn't need to worry about that.
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:34.800]   OK.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.160]   He doesn't--
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:36.720]   So he'll be fine having--
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:39.600]   He does have to have space on towers, which--
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:40.760]   That's going to be tricky.
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:41.080]   Right.
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:43.360]   That's where the $10 billion comes in, I would imagine.
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.280]   He also says he wants to offer something
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:47.960]   called on-demand pricing, charging less
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:49.120]   in the middle of the night.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:53.680]   I think what Charlie's looking at is B2B business.
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.800]   Not so much the consumer business would be to be.
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:00.200]   And there's a whole-- yeah, so Dish and Twilio and--
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:02.520]   Oh gosh, even ARM is getting into this.
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:03.960]   There is a whole business right now
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:09.920]   to be had in saying, I'm going to give you internet access
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:10.880]   for your things.
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:11.960]   Again, it's IoT.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:12.480]   Right.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:16.000]   And it's because a company like BMW, for example,
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.840]   doesn't want to have to do deals with AT&T and Verizon
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.000]   and Deutsche Telekom and everybody.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.800]   They want one throat to choke, basically.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:27.520]   And they want to have SLAs that work for them
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:30.600]   when they're talking to their customer.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:33.520]   And it's going to be a huge business.
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:34.600]   The carriers know it.
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:35.360]   Everybody knows it.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:36.960]   Everybody's trying really hard.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.400]   And we'll see who wins.
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:39.840]   It's just a fascinating story.
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.280]   Great piece in the Wall Street Journal
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.280]   about Charlie Erigan.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.120]   And I think we're going to have a lot of fun
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:47.480]   over the next decade watching this play out.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:50.160]   Now, is this bad for consumers?
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:54.560]   Losing combining two into one.
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.320]   Yes.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.880]   Yes, because T-Mobile has gotten better.
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:01.640]   Sprint has kind of failed.
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:04.600]   I feel like we have lost Sprint anyway.
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.080]   It is kind of have.
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:07.960]   I mean, who's on Sprint today?
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:11.280]   I feel like them together will be better at fighting AT&T
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:11.680]   and Verizon.
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:13.080]   That's kind of my thought.
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:14.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:15.480]   They weren't apart.
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:17.200]   That's why I've been rooting for this merger.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:20.000]   And even if their service is very good,
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.560]   as Ledger did before, they'll poke them so hard
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:24.480]   that we'll get better deals.
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:25.320]   Right.
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:26.200]   I'm a T-Mobile fan.
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:27.680]   I'm a John Ledger fan.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:30.440]   And I also think that Charlie wants
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:34.000]   to take over the role of the industry iconic last
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.280]   and the poker.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:38.240]   And I think Charlie's a really good person to do that.
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:40.280]   He'll be the Craig McCaw in this decade.
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:41.000]   Yeah.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.760]   Craig McCaw is a great analogy.
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:46.160]   He was the guy who created the cell phone business, basically.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:50.000]   I mean, wireless, I think one of my first stories for Gigo
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.600]   was actually like, to be in wireless, you need to be--
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.400]   Ballsy.
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.240]   It's crazy.
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:55.760]   Ballsy.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:56.600]   Because it is a--
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:58.160]   Crazy business.
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:58.680]   So.
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:32:59.640]   Yep.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:00.120]   Yep.
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:00.600]   We'll watch.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:01.760]   It's not over.
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:04.680]   There are, I think, a dozen state attorneys general
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:08.040]   who are still suing saying it's anti-competitive.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:12.120]   I wonder if those lawsuits will disappear now that the DOJ has
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.640]   said, well, we think it's competitive
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.800]   if they do this, this, and this.
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:19.280]   So interesting.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:21.840]   Let's do that thing with the trumpets and the drums.
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:24.320]   It's time for the Google change log.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:29.720]   A Google change log.
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:32.240]   So Karsten has to hit like four buttons to make that happen?
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.320]   Yeah, it's very complicated.
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:35.800]   There's a steam engine involved.
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:36.280]   He's got a--
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.240]   Is there not a macro we can have for that?
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:39.160]   Wow.
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:40.520]   No, that macro is named Karsten.
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:44.920]   We probably could automate it.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:47.320]   But I like watching him spray.
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.360]   It was his scramble.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:49.360]   It's really--
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:51.680]   I enjoyed that too.
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:52.720]   It's like an octopus.
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:55.120]   It's like, I don't think he did it until he was--
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:58.640]   No, he's actually using gesture control.
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:33:59.880]   That's what we need.
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:01.720]   We need gesture control.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.080]   All right, so we need to wait a punch, Leo,
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:06.920]   and we need a way to make Karsten's life less miserable.
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:08.720]   You've got me here today.
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:09.400]   Uh-oh.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.600]   Oh.
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.280]   So that means you've got to be nice to be.
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:16.440]   Have you had any reason to want to punch me to this point?
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:18.040]   Not today.
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:20.000]   Thank goodness, sweetie.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:20.840]   Oh.
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:21.840]   Ah.
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.360]   Ah.
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.400]   Well, he punches good.
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:29.720]   Google Chrome 76 is here, and it does a number
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:33.640]   of interesting things, including block, flash.
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.440]   It also has an interesting feature
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:38.400]   that paywalls won't like.
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:41.560]   It turns out in Chrome, they have this incognito mode,
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:45.600]   but a lot of sites have figured out a way to bypass incognito.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:48.360]   Or to recognize you're in incognito
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:49.760]   and then come after you and say, ah.
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:50.720]   And say, you can't--
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.280]   Yeah, there are a number of sites that will say,
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:55.800]   no incognito visits because we don't get any information
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:58.680]   about you, so Google has reestablished
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.120]   the power of the incognito mode.
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:03.080]   We go back to flash for a second.
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:07.680]   So when I try to watch MSNBC, I've
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:09.800]   got to go through this whole nigula every time
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:14.000]   where I have to say it's OK to do flash like three times.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.560]   MSNBC uses flash.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:18.840]   OK, well, they need to fix that.
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:21.000]   That's really what this will do.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:21.640]   That's what I'm hoping for.
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:22.760]   Nobody will be able to see it.
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:25.560]   I mean, flash--
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:28.160]   Ironically, though, when I want to do Google Hangouts,
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:31.960]   if I want to take a picture of me, I have to enable flash.
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:32.440]   Really?
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:35.000]   Which is, yeah, so like, you know how--
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.960]   and maybe this won't happen for much longer,
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.720]   but there's an option for you to take a picture of what
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:40.760]   you're doing right now.
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:41.520]   Look at this.
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:43.600]   On MSNBC, no flash detected.
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.880]   Adobe flash required to watch our live video.
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:50.640]   Please visit adobe.com to activate Adobe Flash in five easy
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:53.080]   steps, which definitely can be done.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.320]   Five easy steps.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.480]   And by the way, I'm on a Chromebook, so it won't work.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.720]   It won't work, right.
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:01.520]   And so then it tries to go in here and tell me to do it there.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.560]   Then I've got to do it a lot easier.
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:03.920]   So that's just ridiculous.
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:06.320]   There's absolutely no reason in this day and age
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.720]   why any website should be streaming via flash.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:09.720]   Did you hear that?
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:10.920]   I know you're watching.
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:11.760]   Did you hear that?
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:13.480]   Why does Google use it for Hangouts?
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:16.680]   Go to Google Hangouts and click the little attach a photo thing.
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:19.400]   And if you use your web camera, boom.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:19.920]   Really?
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:21.000]   Get the same message.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.040]   Yeah.
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:23.480]   I'm looking at it right now.
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:24.040]   That's weird.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:26.960]   Just to make sure.
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:28.360]   Don't know.
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:29.360]   Go with it.
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.160]   Google better fix that, Google.
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:36.240]   Different teams, but still, I'm like, it's so baffling.
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:38.240]   Mmm.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:39.240]   Mmm.
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:40.240]   Mmm.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:41.240]   OK, sorry.
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:42.240]   We're actually doing a change line.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:44.480]   I don't know anything about that.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.680]   The reason you might want to use incognito mode
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:49.040]   is to bypass that counter that says you've already
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:50.680]   had your five free.
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:54.320]   And so if they're not saving a cookie, they wouldn't know that.
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.760]   Which, by the way, the counters lie regularly.
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:59.160]   There are sites that I have never gone to in life.
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:01.040]   If you go to it, it says, oh, you've already
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.160]   seen your three articles.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.680]   It works, though, because I've ended up
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:05.760]   paying for Bloomberg, which I really didn't want to do.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.760]   It's $35 a month.
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:09.000]   I've ended up paying for wire.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000]   I was willing to do that.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.280]   $35 bucks a month?
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.920]   Bloomberg really rakes you over the course.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:15.840]   But it's a business expense.
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.160]   It's a necessity.
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:20.080]   And so I do it, but geez, I hate--
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:23.520]   If every website charges $35 a month, I'd be broke.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:26.000]   I mean, we use so many different websites.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.600]   Anyway, Google has fixed that incognito mode.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.720]   How do you define fix, Mr. President?
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:37.200]   Now you can go to the Boston Globe or the New York Times
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.600]   and read as many articles as you want.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.120]   It doesn't tell people you're using incognito.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:47.240]   That was the problem.
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.240]   And it's been doing that for years.
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:51.600]   And so stop it, Google.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:54.240]   I will show you another useful tip,
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.600]   if you want to know a useful tip.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:59.520]   Remember I was talking last week or two weeks ago about start
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:02.560]   using startpage.com.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:06.400]   If you-- on the start page site, I'm
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.080]   going to go search for New York Times.
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.120]   Remember, these are Google search results.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:12.440]   So it's going to give me the same results I would get.
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.960]   On every link-- and I should have mentioned this--
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.840]   every search result, there's an anonymous view.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:24.120]   If I click that, it goes through a kind of a toward style
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:28.480]   anonymizer that means it's all reset.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:30.880]   So I don't use this because I pay for the New York Times.
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:33.760]   I don't use this to bypass any paywalls.
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:36.040]   But it does-- that is a very nice way,
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:38.240]   if you want to go to a site and not have them know anything
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.000]   about you.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.480]   Actually, I can demonstrate that.
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:43.480]   By the way, that's the creepiest technology story.
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:44.920]   Oh, the Epstein story.
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:48.400]   He wanted to freeze his head and his--
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:50.400]   He wanted to spread his DNA through men.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.440]   He wanted to impregnate 20 women with his sperm.
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.760]   And his spruce them at a ranch.
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:56.440]   Insane.
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:58.360]   I'm going back to the change log.
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:00.800]   So--
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:01.320]   Sorry.
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.320]   My fault.
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.360]   Anyway, I'll show you, if I go right now
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:08.080]   to a site like Who or Not Net, which
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:11.240]   tells you what your IP address is, what your browser is,
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:14.520]   who your ISP is, if I do that from the start page search,
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:17.040]   it knows a lot of stuff about me.
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:22.480]   But if I click the anonymous view from here, it's like Tor.
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:24.960]   It thinks I'm from some other spot.
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:27.320]   It thinks I'm in West Hills, United States,
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:28.920]   using Hurricane Electric.
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:29.720]   I'm on Linux.
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:30.200]   I'm not.
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:31.040]   Geez.
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:34.760]   So this is really a useful tool for completely anonymizing
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:36.360]   yourself better than incognito mode.
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.360]   If you want to go to a site and you want to go--
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:39.920]   You just bankrupted the news business.
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:40.360]   Thank you very much.
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:41.360]   You're very welcome.
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:41.680]   My pleasure.
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:45.720]   Hurricane Electric is a hot potato routing site.
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.200]   So it's not an actual ISP.
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:50.200]   But if you wanted to, you could look at that and say, oh,
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:51.480]   they're using Hurricane Electric.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:52.160]   That's not legit.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:53.280]   Don't let them in.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.520]   Yeah, I guess they could.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:57.680]   Well, when they do that, we'll do something else.
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:00.520]   If you are interested in Google's Titan security keys,
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:03.640]   I honestly think there are other solutions just as good.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:05.040]   I'm a UB key fan.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.240]   But if you want to get your security keys from Google,
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.440]   you can now, not only in the US, but in Canada,
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:11.840]   Japan, France, and the UK.
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:15.120]   And I guess because it's from Google and all of that.
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:18.280]   But you can use Google's super security system
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:20.360]   without having their particular keys.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.720]   Yeah, I actually, they had problems with the Titan security
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:27.320]   keys, so I'm not a huge.
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:28.280]   Now what are you saying?
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:30.360]   I saw the next story.
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:33.880]   Android autos, first big refresh since debuting,
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:37.880]   is starting to roll out with Jeff Jarvis's very favorite
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:39.800]   feature.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:40.520]   Dark mode.
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:41.080]   Now dark mode.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:42.480]   By default.
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:43.640]   But it's good in your car.
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:45.200]   But no, it's not.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:47.040]   It's so much better in your car.
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.800]   You know, it's not a one over the bridge and up
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:51.480]   in the panic because it's all dark.
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:53.880]   No, but it's you're actually--
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.320]   You're going off the bridge at night,
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.320]   and you can't see anything.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.680]   Well, actually I turn it off--
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:40:59.160]   I'm in your car.
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:00.400]   You want the truth?
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.160]   I turn off ways when you're going over the bridge
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:03.640]   because I don't want to see all the blue.
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:04.400]   The blue, the water around.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:09.160]   So this is a redesigned Android auto.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.000]   I do not have a car with Android auto.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.240]   I wish I-- actually I do, but I don't get to drive it.
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:15.760]   That's the Chevy Bolt.
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:18.840]   As I was saying earlier, I still drive a car from--
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:21.040]   oh my god-- 2016.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.480]   It feels so antiquated.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:27.960]   It's funny how technologies move so fast that a car's
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:32.560]   infomattics from 2015 or 2016 seems out of date.
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.080]   But I wish I had any--
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:36.200]   Well, and think about it this way,
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.040]   the car that is being sold today,
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:40.320]   their infomattics were developed and built
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.600]   in implementing in 2015.
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:43.600]   Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:44.840]   Yeah, that's why.
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:45.880]   I mean--
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:46.640]   Oh, there's no--
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:47.280]   It's pretty good.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:48.760]   You have a Tesla Stacy.
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:50.400]   They've done a good job of keeping it up to date.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.720]   That's-- you know, I gave up my Tesla, the lease ran out.
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.360]   So that's why I'm kind of suffering.
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:56.400]   I came in the parking lot here.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.960]   I thought, oh, no, Leo's not here.
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:58.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.760]   No, no, no, look for my car.
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:04.200]   So I love the story from the information.
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:09.280]   Google has many OEM partners for its smart speakers.
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:12.280]   One of them was Huawei.
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:13.960]   They were going to do a speaker that
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:17.000]   would come out this fall at the IFA trade show in Berlin.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.800]   A smart speaker that's listening to you all the time.
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:21.920]   You're actually in a way that's kind of probably a good idea
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:24.960]   not to do a Huawei Google smart speaker.
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:28.160]   When can we get the new Nest Hub Max?
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:28.880]   I want to get that.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:29.960]   September 9th.
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:31.200]   Well, that's when you can order it.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:32.600]   I don't know if it's going to ship the same day.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:33.560]   I want to get that.
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:35.520]   I like the looks of that.
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:38.080]   Aren't you going to wait for the One with Project Soli in it?
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.640]   Oh, will there be?
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:40.920]   I guess there would.
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:41.440]   Then it could--
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:43.040]   If you believe me--
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:46.480]   Then it could see everything in 3D.
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:48.400]   Then it could-- it could reach your gestures.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.720]   I had that--
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:52.720]   remember the advertiser that had this--
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.880]   what was it?
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:54.880]   Lighthouse had the 3D.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:55.880]   Lighthouse.
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:56.880]   The time of flight sensor.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:57.880]   Time of flight sensor.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:58.520]   And all that stuff.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:00.760]   So I'm not shy.
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:01.920]   I don't mind.
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:03.920]   Well, that was an actual camera.
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:06.920]   Yeah, and the time of flight sensor.
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:09.960]   So you couldn't fool the camera with weird cutouts
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:10.960]   of people moving around?
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:13.200]   Actually, it was pretty cool.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:15.080]   Didn't you fool it with a balloon, though?
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:17.240]   No, that was the one that didn't get fooled by the balloon.
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:21.400]   The nest got the S-I-Q, which is now here,
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:22.480]   got fooled by the balloon.
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:24.120]   It kept saying there's somebody in your house.
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:25.560]   It was Mylar balloons.
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:29.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:33.360]   Google is phasing out the old voice search.
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:35.200]   The old voice search.
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:38.200]   Getting phaged out in favor of the new young assistant.
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:43.160]   OK, fine.
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:44.680]   What's the difference to a consumer?
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:45.160]   Not much.
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.040]   It looks different.
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:47.000]   Oh, then never mind.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:47.760]   No, it doesn't.
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.960]   It's the same response.
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:54.320]   I have John Legend now on all my Google assistant stuff.
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:55.680]   I love it.
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:55.880]   I love it.
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:58.720]   I have cyan, I believe, as a color.
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:43:59.480]   Oh, you cyan?
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:00.560]   I like cyan a lot.
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:01.720]   Yeah, they do it by color.
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:03.400]   The voice is now.
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:05.320]   That's a good tip, by the way.
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:07.800]   We've mentioned it before, but go into your settings
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:09.200]   and choose a color.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:11.480]   There are some very dramatic differences.
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:12.840]   And that--
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:14.760]   watch this now, watch, watch, watch, Carson.
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:18.160]   And that's the Google change log.
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.320]   Oh, he was on it.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:20.280]   Oh, he cheated.
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:21.680]   He was ready.
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:23.480]   Let's do the Google change log again.
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:26.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:33.320]   Jeff Jarvis, Jeff used to be the critic for TV Guide.
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.960]   Now he's--
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:36.440]   You don't use mine on the right way.
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.040]   Lower third, that's what happens.
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:40.360]   He used to be the critic for TV Guide.
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:44.200]   So did Howard Stern pick up on that former TV Guide
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:45.200]   critic--
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:46.200]   No, no, no, no.
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:46.560]   All right.
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:49.200]   Well, that's how he knows me because I wrote about it.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:50.200]   That's how he knows you.
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:52.200]   Ah, well, that's how that all started.
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:54.160]   Yeah, yeah, I gave him a good review,
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:57.280]   and he offered to do unspeakable things to me.
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:00.480]   Jeff has been a former TV Guide critic for a long--
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:01.880]   A long, very long time.
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:04.400]   Long time.
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:10.000]   Spotify's doing well, 108 million paying customers,
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.240]   total monthly active user count, 232 million.
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:15.240]   There you go.
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:16.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:17.880]   Yeah, I was-- there was-- for a while,
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:19.520]   it looked like Apple Music was coming on strong.
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:20.680]   Might beat Spotify.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:21.840]   In fact, the Wall Street Journal said,
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:23.000]   it's just a matter of time.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000]   Nope.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:24.520]   Nope.
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:26.640]   Apple Music is not even close.
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:28.760]   I am weird because I live love you to Google.
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:30.480]   I still use Google Play Music.
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.080]   It's fine.
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:31.880]   What am I missing?
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:32.240]   Nothing.
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:36.680]   In fact, I'm mad at myself because I went through a pruning,
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:38.680]   and I thought, well, I've got Apple Music.
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:41.080]   I've got Amazon Music, and I've got Google Music.
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:41.960]   I only need one of those.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:44.040]   I'm going to keep Apple Music.
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:46.000]   I killed Google Music, and I forgot
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.360]   that that also was giving me YouTube Red--
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:49.000]   Right.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.400]   --or YouTube Premium, as they call it.
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:52.640]   Now, all of a sudden, I got all these ads in my YouTube.
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:54.200]   Oh.
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:56.400]   That is worth the price of admission alone.
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:58.080]   Yeah.
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:59.280]   So that's what you're missing.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:02.840]   So you can watch great elephant videos.
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:04.560]   I don't know what that's about.
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.960]   Cute elephants.
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:10.000]   You can still watch cute elephants with ads.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.880]   I just-- I have ads now.
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:15.960]   I think it was funny because my art teenager noticed.
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:17.960]   He said, why are my seeing all these ads on my YouTube
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:18.560]   all of a sudden?
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:21.320]   I went, oh, shoot.
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:21.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:22.920]   My daughter--
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:26.760]   My daughter-- we have Hulu because we got a special,
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.120]   I don't know, a while back for 99 cents a month.
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:30.960]   Oh, nice.
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:33.840]   It's the ad version, but I'm like 99 cents a month.
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:35.200]   That month, I'm OK with it.
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:39.240]   She's like, what are these ads?
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:40.720]   They're stupid.
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:41.800]   And I'm like, oh, yeah.
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:42.640]   Ads are really bad.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:45.720]   She has not seen commercial television, has she?
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:47.640]   She is-- I mean--
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:50.640]   Why do they keep playing the same ad, mommy?
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:52.040]   Yeah, she's like these--
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:53.440]   The Liberty Mutual ones.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.840]   Oh, god, I hate that emu.
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:57.000]   That freaking emu.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:57.400]   That's the worst.
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:58.360]   Oh, I do too.
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:58.720]   The emu.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:46:59.720]   I do too.
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:00.240]   But you know what?
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:01.080]   I actually looked up.
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:03.160]   I was worried that there was animal abuse.
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:03.680]   No.
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:05.120]   It's a serious animal trauma.
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:07.040]   It's a CGI emu.
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:11.400]   But it can't get a real emu to peck the glass over and over again.
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:12.800]   Come on, man.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:13.800]   I was worried.
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:14.760]   It's so sad.
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:15.160]   It's so sad.
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:16.000]   Companies are evil.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.120]   It feels like Liberty Mutual wants to be Geico, but can't.
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:21.640]   Like, they just don't have the--
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:22.880]   They need a better agency.
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:24.560]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:25.560]   Anyway--
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:27.120]   Well, there can only be one Geico.
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:27.880]   There can only be--
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:28.600]   What's his name?
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:29.440]   Chuck?
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:29.960]   Chuck?
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:31.320]   Not the emu with the guy.
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:31.920]   Chuck.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:32.560]   The guy.
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:35.400]   The emu and Chuck.
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:36.120]   Terrible.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:36.720]   It's awful.
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:41.000]   70s cop show party that just doesn't ring true at all.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.840]   And then there's Captain Obvious.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:45.600]   Is Hulu stopped with that?
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:48.960]   Because they were running a Captain Obvious at every break.
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:50.920]   Every break, hotels.com.
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:53.840]   It was getting so tired.
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:54.840]   They needed some more ads.
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:55.760]   That's all.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:56.280]   I'm a 5.
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:57.840]   We may be in a different--
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:58.320]   Sorry.
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.080]   Oh, go on.
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:01.600]   YouTube Premium is $11.99 a month.
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:02.760]   I am such an idiot.
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:06.280]   I canceled because I was grandfathering at the $8
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:08.040]   dollars a month for YouTube community.
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:10.440]   See, this is what you get for all this given things up.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:11.080]   I'm such an idiot.
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:11.840]   I'm going to quit.
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:14.160]   I'm finished.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:15.200]   What was I thinking?
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:16.840]   Well, you say what you do to yourself?
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:17.120]   Say it.
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:18.640]   What if I can go back?
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:19.480]   I wonder if I say--
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:21.040]   Google will forgive me.
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:24.200]   Please forgive me, Google.
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:27.520]   That would be nice if they have said, well, yeah, OK.
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:30.560]   You can get back in that you're grandfathered.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:32.080]   Yeah, that's not going to happen.
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:32.880]   No.
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:35.160]   They've been just waiting for me, right?
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.600]   Like, I'm sorry, Theo.
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:39.800]   I'm waiting for me to do that.
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:40.600]   Subscribe.
[01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:41.960]   Let me just see how much it costs.
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:43.920]   Because don't you still get YouTube Premium
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:45.680]   when you subscribe to Google Music?
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:46.320]   I think so, yeah.
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:46.840]   Yeah.
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:47.840]   Or vice versa.
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:48.760]   It's about all you look at it.
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:50.600]   I should probably just resubscribe.
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:52.760]   It's $15 a month now for the family plan.
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:57.200]   Well, I like Google Music.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:01.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think we should wrap this up.
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:02.640]   I think we've gone through--
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:04.480]   do you have a story I've missed?
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:07.400]   I was just going to ask about the five limits, which some people
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:08.920]   have brought up because they're upset.
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:11.160]   Are there limits on your five?
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.480]   But only have four Sims now, not.
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.240]   Data Sims.
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:15.640]   Data Sims.
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:18.000]   Oh, that's too bad because I was about to order another data
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:18.200]   sim.
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:19.520]   I love the--
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.160]   I have dozens of them.
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:24.320]   Because you only pay for what you use.
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:25.240]   It does affect me.
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:26.000]   That's what people are doing.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.240]   It only pays for what you use.
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:29.440]   So I was putting Sims in everything.
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:32.000]   My car, everything.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.400]   I wish I could put it in a Chromebook, yeah.
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.920]   Oh, well.
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:36.800]   One day, Jeff.
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:39.280]   One day.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:39.960]   All right.
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:42.840]   It's time for Stacy and her pick of the week.
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.360]   And I bet you I know what it's going to be.
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:49.200]   Is it going to be the wise, smart plugs?
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:50.360]   Someone asked me about that.
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:52.160]   I can make those when I pick of the week.
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:53.360]   I had something different.
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:56.560]   They've announced the pricing and pre-orders.
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:57.960]   Yeah, I have here.
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:58.720]   Let me pull up this.
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:03.720]   If team bugs appear, that is amazing.
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:06.240]   I'm going to make that my pick.
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:06.760]   All right.
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:07.720]   You do it.
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:10.360]   I can't bring myself to buy more smart plugs.
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:14.360]   I have so many.
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:18.000]   You only need as many smart plugs as you have sockets.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.600]   That is not true.
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:22.160]   But you can still buy them.
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:24.920]   What would you do with more than you have sockets?
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:25.320]   Sorry.
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:28.600]   I mean, I don't need that many because not all of my sockets
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:29.600]   are so new.
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:30.600]   I need fewer than you.
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:34.080]   Are homes being built with smart plugs in every--
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:38.240]   No, but homes are being built with USB ports.
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:39.480]   I'm seeing that right.
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:40.520]   Because that's a cheap and easy.
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:44.960]   Well, I saw somebody on Twitter today, a friend of mine, said that he could tell from the fresh
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:45.960]   paint smell.
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:49.800]   He was in a new room, and then he saw that the USB port in the wall was USB C.
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:52.960]   Ooh, that's modern.
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:56.480]   That is like this year.
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:58.480]   Live in a future.
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:00.800]   That's so 2019.
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:02.240]   Oh, my God.
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:03.360]   I want.
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:04.360]   All right.
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:05.360]   So we won't mention the wise smart plugs.
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:06.640]   What is your pick?
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:08.880]   My pick of the week-- and I've mentioned this before.
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:12.160]   I think I just shut down that window, though, so let me go get to it.
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:19.560]   Slate does a deal with future tents, and they have people write fiction stories, and they're
[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:24.320]   awesome fiction stories, and they're all about like extra-- it's like Black Mirror, but
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:26.200]   they're not all depressing.
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:30.120]   And so they're putting them all in an anthology.
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:36.000]   And yes, you can read all of them online for free on Slate.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.840]   But if you're just the type of person who just wants to have it in a book or can go
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:44.640]   format, it won't be available until October 2nd, but you can pre-order it now.
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:45.640]   I love this.
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:53.160]   My favorite story, probably, of all of them is Charlie Jane Anders had this awesome one.
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:55.640]   I even wrote a response to one of them.
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:57.320]   So that's my pick of the week.
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:58.800]   You should totally read these.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:51:59.800]   They're fun.
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:00.800]   You'll enjoy them.
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:01.800]   Nice.
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:02.800]   I love sci-fi.
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:05.600]   I did not know that you were a sci-fi fan, however.
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:08.000]   I'm a reading fan.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.160]   Reading.
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:10.320]   I read everything.
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:13.280]   I read cereal boxes.
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:14.280]   You know what?
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:15.280]   I'm on a James McWorter.
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:17.280]   I can't pick it because it's you.
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:18.280]   Well, you are now.
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:21.360]   Turns out-- so you talked about his book about the English language.
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.360]   The Bastard Language.
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.840]   I bastard tongue.
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:28.480]   But it turns out-- remember I was telling you about the great courses I was listening to?
[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:29.480]   That's him.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.480]   It's his great course.
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:36.040]   And then he has another book which I found in my searches about Black English, which
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:37.200]   is really good.
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:38.200]   Oh.
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:39.200]   Really good.
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:40.200]   It's only a few hours.
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:44.480]   It's a shorter book, but he talks about how it is a full-fledged language.
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:48.320]   A lot of people think it's a form of illiteracy or a slangy.
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:49.320]   It's not.
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:52.200]   It's a full-fledged language with its own grammar and its syntax.
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.200]   And it's really quite interesting.
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:54.200]   It's quite fascinating.
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.840]   So I highly recommend that as well.
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:56.840]   James McWorter.
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:58.840]   He is a linguist.
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:52:59.840]   Yes.
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:00.840]   He's phenomenal.
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:02.360]   But what is your number, Mr. Jarvis?
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:11.880]   So the LA Times today had a memo leaked perhaps about how their efforts to get subscriptions
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:12.880]   are not going so well.
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:15.440]   Their goal was to get 300,000 new subscriptions this year.
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.440]   They have 17,000.
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:17.440]   Oh, dear.
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:20.480]   They got more than that, but a lot of people were canceling.
[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:25.680]   You know, the Times almost knew this because they were one of the only daily papers to
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:27.840]   show up in Apple's News Plus product.
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:29.840]   They said what they had.
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:31.040]   The Wall Street Journal didn't do it.
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:32.320]   The New York Times didn't do it.
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:34.200]   The Washington Post didn't do it.
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:38.520]   And I think because all three of them have fairly robust digital subscription numbers,
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:41.320]   and I kind of read that as the Times is a little bit desperate.
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:44.000]   So Josh Benton from Neiman Lab did a great post.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:49.720]   If you go to the second chart here, Leo, the next one, he looked at 2002 print circulation
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:52.560]   versus 2019 digital subs.
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:57.640]   There are two publications where the digital subs are higher than the print was.
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:54:02.640]   New York Times in 2002 had 1.1 million print.
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:04.680]   Now it has 2.7 million digital.
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:06.400]   So digital has been good for the time.
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:13.200]   Washington Post, 764, 446,000 print in 2002, now 1.7 million.
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:15.840]   All the other papers have far fewer.
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:18.600]   But I'll tell you why.
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:23.880]   I think the Times, New York Times and the Washington Post are seen as national papers.
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:24.880]   Exactly.
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:28.040]   The only Times again wants to fool itself in the things that it's national.
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:29.040]   It feels like a national paper.
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:30.600]   But it's a great, it's a great, Metro paper.
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:35.600]   So it now, it had 965,000, almost a million print circulation in 2002.
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:39.160]   Now it has 170,000 digital subs.
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:41.840]   And they want to try to get up to a million.
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.080]   Who knows?
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:49.360]   The Chronicle, San Francisco Chronicle had 512,000 print.
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:51.760]   Now it has 57,000 digital.
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:55.000]   I think it just bodes poorly for Metro papers.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.600]   They want paywalls at that level are hard to justify.
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:00.600]   A lot of churns.
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:05.000]   So yeah, the internet's ruined something else.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.120]   Lavender Fields and Metro Dailys.
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:11.040]   All right, here's a question for the journalists in the house.
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:13.000]   Do we need Metro Dailys or is it sufficient?
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000]   We need to have nationals.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.000]   Oh my gosh.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000]   No, no.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.000]   No, no.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000]   We need local.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:21.000]   You not only need Metro, you need like super city council people.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000]   All town papers.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.400]   Yeah, we have the Argus career in Petalum.
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:25.600]   So they cover the city council, you're right.
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:33.440]   My dean, Sarah Bartlett, was core in helping to start the city in New York, which is the
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:36.480]   Texas Tribune of New York.
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:40.960]   Texas Tribune, which was founded by, I'd say the name again, John.
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:42.440]   He didn't, he didn't found it.
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:43.440]   He just funded it.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.440]   But yes.
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:46.680]   Yeah, well, anyway.
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:51.280]   So but it's set a model for nonprofit journalism in the country, but that's not going to solve
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:52.280]   every problem.
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:53.480]   There's not enough charity.
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:59.480]   There's not enough patronage, but things like the city and the Texas Tribune give their
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:01.360]   content for free to media around them.
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:04.160]   So it helps bolster the journalism in the ecosystem.
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:06.440]   So that's another model that's starting up.
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:09.600]   Here you look at something like medium.
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:13.240]   I finally, I finally think I figured out what I visited with him, but I think I figured out
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:14.240]   what he's doing.
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:16.480]   He's trying to create kind of the YouTube of text.
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:18.480]   The YouTube of text.
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:20.040]   Think about that in a way.
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:24.960]   I know it's a difference because he's charging subscriptions and he's pushing.
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:28.440]   I have to say I'm a little irritated with medium because every time I go there, it says,
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:30.480]   oh, you could read more if you would just pay for it.
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:32.320]   But it's only $5 a month as opposed to Uber.
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:34.040]   Yeah, I canceled my $5 a month.
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:39.560]   Well, and it also, it pushes content that is old.
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:40.560]   That's what tries to mean.
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:41.720]   That's part of his arguments, Stacy.
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:44.320]   And I don't know that I agree with it because I find him a little irritating sometimes too,
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:53.400]   but his argument, his argument, his argument is that the rabid currency of the web is what
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:58.600]   led to a lot of our problems so that he wants to, when medium started, he didn't put a date
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:56:59.600]   on the page.
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:01.560]   There's no date there, which was irritated people.
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:03.400]   But now he will surface stuff from the past.
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:08.320]   And I will find things I wrote a year ago will suddenly get a comment or something.
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:10.080]   It's kind of interesting to see how that happens.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:16.720]   Actually, that reminds me of a story we didn't do, which is the guy who invented retweeting.
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:19.200]   He says, we handed a loaded weapon to four year olds.
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:21.520]   I thought I was going to make it safely out of here before he was.
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:22.520]   World panic.
[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:26.240]   Well, I have to admit retweeting is one of the things that makes Twitter.
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:29.000]   No, it also brings what makes little things.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000]   It's great.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.200]   This is pandering to this is what it wants to be like.
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:37.320]   I do like the heroic pictures of him.
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:38.320]   Yeah, cheese.
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:43.400]   I mean, Chris weather all who no longer works.
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:45.040]   Staring at a burning bush.
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:47.200]   Yeah, piss me off.
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:49.040]   Okay, well, I'm glad I brought it up then.
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.680]   Yes, I can live to piss you out.
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:52.480]   I might just hope I don't crash on the bridge.
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:53.480]   No, you won't.
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:54.480]   Don't think of that.
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:57.480]   I finally figured it out.
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:03.400]   I hope my palms are sweaty and literally at the mention of it, but I just try to not
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:05.000]   know where I am.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.800]   I concentrate on the car ahead.
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:08.280]   Oh, I discovered that years ago.
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:09.280]   And then I sing a song.
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:11.440]   I have no idea where I am.
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:17.080]   Jeff, are you driving yourself or do you get a car?
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:18.600]   I can't afford a chauffeur.
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:20.240]   We would pay for a car for you.
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:21.240]   No, no, I drive it myself.
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:22.240]   I have one.
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:23.240]   Oh, okay.
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:24.240]   No, I was the way you were.
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:25.240]   I was like, you were like.
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:26.240]   I would give you a shit.
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:27.760]   Well, I have the car in the lot.
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:28.760]   So if you'll drive that.
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:30.680]   Carsten, can you drive the car to the city?
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:32.320]   Yeah, I see you could do that.
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:33.320]   Sure.
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:34.320]   That'd be fun.
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:36.120]   Next time, would you please let us.
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:38.120]   Would that be a better way for you to come?
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:39.120]   No, I'm fine.
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:40.120]   It's embarrassing.
[01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:41.120]   It's not embarrassing.
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:42.120]   I can pick you up.
[01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:45.000]   Oh, I don't know if I trust that.
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.720]   Yeah, I wouldn't take a ride from Carsten if I were you.
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:49.960]   He's driving with the hand gestures.
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:50.960]   What?
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:52.760]   Where's my horn?
[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:53.760]   Where's my horn?
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:54.760]   I need the horn.
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:55.760]   Hey, where's my horn?
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:58.120]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism.
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:00.360]   Well, he's not just a professor of journalism.
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:04.560]   He's the Leonard Taill professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:05.560]   of Journalism.
[01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:06.560]   So, breath.
[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:08.680]   At the City University of New York.
[01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:14.160]   And is a blogger prolific at Buzzmachine.com and a book author prolific.
[01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:16.560]   Now in paperback, what would Google do?
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:17.560]   Public parts.
[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:19.640]   I said that on your blog.
[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:21.000]   That's why I said it.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:27.680]   Now in paperback, Gutenberg, the geek, geek sparing gifts and lots more.
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:28.840]   Read his books.
[01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:30.840]   They're good.
[01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:32.960]   We also thank Stacey Higginbotham.
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:33.960]   Stacey on IOT.
[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:36.240]   She is her website Stacey on IOT.com.
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:37.360]   The great newsletter there.
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:38.360]   Read that.
[01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:39.360]   Subscribe to that.
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:40.360]   It's free.
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:41.360]   Why wouldn't you?
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:47.680]   And of course, the IOT podcast with Kevin Tofel, a must listen at Gigastacey on the tweet
[01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:50.640]   storm on the retweet machine.
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:53.640]   Do you hit the retweet button, Stacey?
[01:59:53.640 --> 01:59:54.840]   I'm pro retweeting.
[01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:56.440]   I hadn't even occurred.
[01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:59.280]   It hadn't occurred to me that people are using it for abuse.
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:03.160]   But once it did, I was like, I tried to become more judicious about how I used it.
[02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:04.400]   Actually, the president used it.
[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:05.400]   Just people use it as a.
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:06.400]   People use it as a for abuse.
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:07.400]   They use everything for abuse.
[02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:10.080]   Just today, the president retweeted a QAnon site.
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.320]   Brought it to Twitter's attention.
[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:15.920]   They banned the site.
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:18.080]   So be careful out there.
[02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:21.240]   You never know what a retweet will do.
[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:27.280]   We do Twig every Wednesday about 130 Pacific 430 Eastern, 2030 UTC.
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:29.000]   You could watch live if you wanted.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.640]   If you're listening live, we have live audio and video streams at twit.tv/live.
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:38.080]   If you're doing that, join us in the chatroom, irc.twit.tv.
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:41.200]   We don't get a lot in studio visitors because it's the middle of the week, I guess.
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:42.960]   But you're always welcome.
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:48.960]   If you're going to be in the Petaluma area, send us an email at tickets@twit.tv and say
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:50.520]   which shows you'd like to attend.
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:53.360]   And we'll let you know if we're doing those shows and if the studio is open, it's not
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:57.000]   always open, but it's open for this show every week.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000]   And we'd love to have you.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.160]   We'll put a chair out for you and all that.
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:04.960]   If you want to download copies of the show, we also make those available on demand because
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:06.400]   it's a podcast after all.
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:07.600]   That's the whole idea there.
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:13.640]   Just go to twit.tv/twig.
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:17.000]   What is that sound?
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.440]   Is there somebody grinding stumps in your backyard, Stacey?
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:25.480]   Oh, no, that is someone, I guess, taking a shower right next door to me.
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:31.280]   So now we know what it sounds like in my little area when someone takes a shower next door.
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:33.000]   Okay, it's good to know.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.880]   Sorry, sounds a little bit like a stump grinder.
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:39.600]   That's the most.
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:42.080]   I haven't turned up too loud, obviously.
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:43.080]   What was I saying?
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:44.080]   Oh, subscribe.
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:45.320]   That's the best thing to do because that way you'll get the show.
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:46.320]   The minute it's available.
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:50.680]   Thank you all for watching, listening, and for being here, we'll see you next time.
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:51.120]   On twig.
