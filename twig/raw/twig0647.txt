[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   It's time for Twig this week in Google coming up Microsoft's biggest acquisition ever.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.700]   What does it mean for Google?
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.160]   We'll talk about the crypto derps who bought a copy of Dune and now want to make a movie
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.100]   because we own the book, right?
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.920]   And Spotify experts are saying, what are you going to do about Joe Rogan?
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.560]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:36.940]   This is Twig.
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.440]   This week in Google, Episode 647, recorded Wednesday, January 19, 2022.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.060]   A disco floor for your wall.
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.920]   This week in Google is brought to you by ITProTV.

[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.800]   Traditional audio conferencing systems can entail lots of components.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.000]   Installation can take days and you might not get the mic coverage you need.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.680]   That's complex-pensive, but Noreva audio is easy to install and manage.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.760]   No technicians required and you get true full-room coverage.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.520]   That's easy-can-omical.

[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.240]   It's time for Twig this week at Google to show where we talk about, you know, pretty
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.000]   much anything we want to.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   It's about Google, probably not today.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.480]   Stacey Higginbach, just back.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.840]   We missed you, Stacey.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.280]   Thank you for being here.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.280]   We had it's usual.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280]   Miss Joel.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.160]   You could tell who replaced you last week because you have his lower third.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.920]   Oh, was it Matthew?
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.920]   Who was it?
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.920]   Mike Elton.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.920]   I didn't see him.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.920]   Oh, Mike Elton.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920]   Well, we'll fix that.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920]   Oh, he's nice.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920]   There you go.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.920]   Stacey Higginbach.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.920]   Stacey.ioT.com.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:23.240]   @gigastacey, don't forget the Stacey and Kevin Show, the IOT podcast and all of that.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.960]   Also with us, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, you know him better as...
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.800]   To that grumpy old band.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.920]   The Leonard Taub, professor for journalistic innovation at the...
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.620]   ...graduate school of journalism at the City University of New York, director of the Town
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.620]   Night Center, et cetera.
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.620]   Et cetera.
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.620]   Et cetera.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.620]   Et cetera.
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.620]   Hello.
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.620]   Hello.
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.620]   Did you eat that entire bag of kachoey pepi?
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.620]   No, no, I didn't.
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.100]   I definitely lost to my hat.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.900]   It was last week, but I had some kachoey pepi puffs before the show.
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.060]   I didn't want to make noise.
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.220]   I had a show Stacey, my...
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.220]   ...our find.
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.220]   I am jealous.
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.220]   Very...
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.220]   She's these salty snacks.
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.220]   They're the best.
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.220]   They're all the best.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.580]   Actually, Sunday we were talking on Twitter about using chopsticks to eat spicy hot Cheetos
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.660]   so they don't get your fingers all orange.
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.580]   That's what people do for any sort of Doritos.
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.140]   A lot of my engineering programming friends do that.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.180]   Because you want to have the snack while you're coding, but you really don't want to get
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.340]   orange on the keyboard.
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.340]   It's bad.
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.940]   Trust me, I know.
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.820]   So with us from Hands On Photography, Ant-Pruit.
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.940]   Also the community manager of our fabulous club twit, you have a bunch of events coming
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.940]   up.
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.180]   Georgia Dow will be joining us for a...
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.500]   What do you call a fireside chat?
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.940]   Andy Enoco was mind-mungingly fascinating.
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.100]   His was an AMA and that was so much fun.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.620]   Oh, so there's a difference.
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.620]   You actually have...
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.620]   Yes, sir.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.620]   There's a difference.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.900]   I set it up to be geared more towards our club twit members to participate and get their
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.220]   feedback and the fireside chat is more along.
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.860]   I'm digging in and sitting down.
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.900]   I'll take some questions from my members, but it's more me trying to drive it.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.780]   January 28th, Georgia Dow at 3PM Pacific.
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.620]   4PM Pacific, February 11th, Mike Elgin and Amira.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.420]   And I'll be hosting that one.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:35.420]   And then the poll is up for the next book in Stacey's Book Club, which was another great
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.420]   time.
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:45.020]   We sat down before our AMA, Mrs. Stacey and I, and the book wasn't horrible, as I say.
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.820]   You didn't like it that much.
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.420]   You didn't like it that much.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.420]   No, I liked it, but it's...
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.420]   Not horrible.
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.420]   That was the quote.
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.900]   Sci-Fi is just a different thing for me.
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.900]   You have to be in a Sci-Fi, yeah.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.700]   It had great issues to talk about, though.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.700]   It did.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.540]   Even Mr. Jammerby joined in on the conversation.
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.100]   He would cut our mics off and just take over the show.
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.980]   Well, as you know, Jammerby is a big Sci-Fi fan, so as am I.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.980]   And something that was worth mentioning is we included our members in that because we
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.700]   do it over Zoom and our members can join in on the Zoom and pop up on the screen and
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.900]   talk with this and all that.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.500]   So hey, sign off a club's weight.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.500]   Y'all, it's only $7 a month.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.500]   It's a good thing.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.900]   It's a positive good cause.
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.740]   I'll give you all the eats later, a little later on the show.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.740]   The big story...
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.860]   Oh, I'm trying to find the poll.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.860]   Oh.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.860]   For the book?
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.860]   Yeah, I had it a minute ago.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.860]   I don't...
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.860]   It should be pinned.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.860]   It should be pinned.
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.860]   It should be pinned to what?
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.020]   I can't find it either.
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.460]   If you don't pin it to my sweater, I'm not going to find it.
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.460]   That's all...
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.060]   A twit event and you twirl down, club twit events and you should see Stacey Hagan-Botham's
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.060]   book club.
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.060]   All right.
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.460]   And then you go to the pin section.
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.060]   I feel like it should be.
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.020]   So maybe we got to work on this.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.220]   So when I'm looking at club twit, I have events here.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.260]   That's what I clicked, but that does not include the poll.
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.260]   Nope, not that.
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.740]   And then where is to keep scrolling?
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.740]   Keep scrolling.
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.740]   Keep scrolling.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:24.740]   Keep scrolling.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.420]   There's Stacey in the best.
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.420]   Keep scrolling.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.420]   Yeah, keep scrolling.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.420]   Keep scrolling.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.420]   Keep scrolling.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.420]   Because this is a show section.
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.420]   Oh, it's under this twit events?
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.420]   No, sir.
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.420]   Okay.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.420]   Yeah, I don't even know where that came from.
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.900]   But it should be down under the general section.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.900]   You see the general section?
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.700]   I don't think well.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.860]   Let me know when you find it.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.900]   I see general on my screen.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.060]   That's discourse stuff.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.700]   I don't have a general.
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.700]   I see every day.
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.300]   You're at the twit farm.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.300]   Okay.
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.140]   This is still a working progress, clearly.
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.100]   But you know, if I go to the terminal, I could probably get this working.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.100]   Oh, God, please.
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.100]   No.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.100]   Please.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.100]   No, dear.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.020]   All right.
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.220]   The books are nor by.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.220]   I'm not sure how to pronounce that authors name.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.420]   Oh, are Corey Doctorow, an authorized bread.
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.220]   And I truly.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.500]   AI 2041.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.660]   And right now, unauthorized bread is leading the vote.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.780]   Yeah, because Corey is kind of has been on the show many times.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.540]   The author's name for newer is needy.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.580]   Oker Oker before.
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.380]   Oker for a core for I believe us.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.380]   I'm sorry.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.380]   I'm sorry.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.380]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.380]   I think she.
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.380]   All right.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.380]   Good.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.380]   Good, good, good.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.340]   Well, thank you very much for joining us.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.420]   That's it for this week in Google this week.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.420]   Yeah, that was exciting.
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.100]   We can put some around with the fun.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.100]   Futs around.
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.740]   You missed the fun part Leo told the stories before we got on old guy Leo on the porch.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.740]   Oh boy.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.820]   What I could do.
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.820]   This is what I did.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.620]   I just tagged you in the that channel.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.020]   So maybe it'll pop up as a notification for you.
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.620]   Are we still doing this?
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.620]   No, we're done.
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.460]   I'm done.
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.060]   We got to show it to do, right?
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.620]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.700]   Big story of the week.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.020]   And I don't really know if we have to talk about it on this show.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.500]   I guess it impacts Google a little bit.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.020]   We certainly talked about it on Windows weekly.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.860]   Microsoft has put in a bid to buy Activision Blizzard.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:36.180]   I have to say I love the New York Times story on this because they said for around $70 million.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.180]   It's a little bit.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.740]   Sorry, $70 billion.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.740]   Big difference.
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.740]   $70 billion.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:46.500]   The irony is that it's actually $68.3 billion.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:53.620]   So somewhere in the author's mind or the headline writer's mind, they figured $1.7 billion more
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.620]   or less.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.620]   Honey, what is that?
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.620]   A bridge?
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.620]   A roadway?
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.620]   Who knows?
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.580]   Just a little bit.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.580]   Just a little bit.
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:07.220]   Anyway, big story because it is the largest acquisition Microsoft's ever made almost at
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.540]   $68.7 billion.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.460]   So they left out $1.3 billion.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:17.620]   It also is a story because this is the same Activision Blizzard that was under so much
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:25.340]   heat for its frat boy culture, for the Bill Cosby conference room.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:31.140]   And it's CEO Bobby Kotick who had been with the company since 1991.
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.740]   Kind of the poster child for all this.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.260]   They're being sued by the federal government.
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:41.420]   A lot of employees very upset about how the company has been run, especially women.
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.140]   So Microsoft's buying into this kind of toxic workplace.
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.220]   And Microsoft has just recently had issues of their own.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:54.620]   In fact, they announced this week that they're hiring a white shoe law firm to further investigate
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:59.460]   allegations of mishandling sexual harassment, including from its former chairman and CEO,
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.140]   Bill Gates.
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.740]   So this is great.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.340]   It's the merging of two boys clubs.
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:11.980]   I didn't get to catch Windows weekly to hear Mr. Thoreyde and Ms. Mary Jo talk about it.
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.220]   But when I saw this news, the first thing popped to my head is why is Microsoft investing
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.020]   in such a mess?
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.460]   Because well, would Microsoft be liable for some of the price?
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.900]   It's a good time to invest in a mess.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.500]   Yeah, their stock price is almost half what it was a year ago.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:35.220]   So although Microsoft is offering a premium, but I think we concluded that it's a very
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.220]   good deal.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.100]   It's the right thing for Microsoft to do.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.340]   As expensive as it is, it's good for business.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.340]   Go ahead, Stacey.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.340]   You heard an and.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.620]   Oh, I was going to say it helps them set up if you think about Netflix or Google doing
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.900]   any sort of streaming games platform.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.220]   This sets them up for that.
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.380]   Plus, is it Xbox?
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.380]   Yes, Xbox.
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.380]   Yes.
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.380]   David, Xbox.
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.380]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.380]   Sorry.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.380]   I'm like, wait a second.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.380]   That's it.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.820]   I'm like, my credit's not good enough, apparently.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.620]   Sorry, dude.
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.500]   Yeah, so this gets them also.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.700]   I mean, Microsoft, I know we don't think about it for gaming, but they have a very reputable
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.700]   gaming platform.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.860]   Oh, they're huge.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.340]   They just bought Bethesda not so long ago.
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.340]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.660]   They have, let's not forget Minecraft, which has been a huge success for them.
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:29.460]   And in fact, it's shown that they can be a steward of a game studio and really let it
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.780]   do its job and make it better.
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.780]   I think everybody agrees.
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.580]   Minecraft is even better under Microsoft.
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:42.580]   Do you think Minecraft is more of a game's play for them or more of an education slash
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.100]   world building kind of play for them?
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.300]   I'll tell you what my thoughts are.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.380]   And I think I remember I've been chewing over this for the last two hours with Mary Jo and
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.380]   Paul.
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.380]   So I have, you know, you have opinions.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.780]   You've cheated.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.980]   I looked ahead on the test.
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.980]   It's actually sensible.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.260]   Remember, Microsoft's under assault from meta, right?
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.700]   They'd like to play in the metaverse.
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.380]   Microsoft is a big games player.
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.460]   Nobody denies that and they will become even bigger.
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.820]   By the way, among other things they get with Activision Blizzard, Candy Crush because
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.280]   so they get king.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.320]   So there's a lot of mobile.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.340]   So it gives them a foothold in a form of gaming.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.540]   They're not particularly big in, which is mobile.
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.780]   Call of Duty is also available on mobile.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:30.940]   It gives them, I think it positions them well for what I think might be the next big thing,
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.980]   which is e-sports.
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:38.660]   You know, football and baseball in this country are multi-billion dollar and then the NBA,
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.660]   multi-billion dollar businesses.
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.700]   I think e-sports is poised.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.580]   All we need is that game, that one game that everybody goes, oh, this is incredible.
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.180]   And it's going to explode.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.540]   So I think Microsoft's well aware of that.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:57.140]   They're also, of course, a cloud company with Azure, UPS guy?
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.460]   I think it's my family.
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.460]   Sorry.
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.460]   No, it is UPS.
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.460]   Okay, go on.
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.460]   Well, here's how you tell.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.460]   Are they wearing brown shorts?
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:07.900]   I don't know based on the dogs.
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.460]   I think it's not my family because the dog would be less upset.
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.460]   Okay, go on.
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.460]   Keep talking.
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:18.780]   But they're also a cloud company with Azure.
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.540]   But I think that this, really what this is, and you pointed this out, I mean, Google with
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:27.980]   Stadia, Amazon, Nvidia used to be Sony.
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.580]   All streaming game, I think streaming games, a lot of people think might be the next big
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.140]   thing because you don't need a lot of hardware.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.820]   It's a really good use of cloud resources.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:42.940]   So all in all, this, I think integrates beautifully with what Microsoft's business is.
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.980]   So as expensive as it is, it's half of Microsoft's cash position.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.580]   It's a month of revenue for Microsoft.
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.340]   It's a significant amount of money, but they can afford it.
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.500]   And I think it's in the long run, I think it's a good business proposition for them.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.020]   That would be my, you know, I'm not a business.
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:03.340]   So Corey Doctorow came on Twitter and, and, and, and, and, taking the whole bunch of
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.980]   us saying, don't say that they're buying it.
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.700]   They're trying to buy it.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.420]   They don't have permission to buy it.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.340]   They can get turned down by the government.
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.700]   Right.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:17.940]   So I asked that question of Paul, Mary Jo, Microsoft addressed it in the announcement.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.660]   Even with this acquisition, Microsoft is the number three games manufacturer.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.780]   They're not in a position of monopoly in this at all.
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:27.780]   Right.
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.820]   Tencent is bigger.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.460]   Sony is bigger.
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.300]   So this would not make them behemoths by any means.
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.420]   Now I think Corey's right.
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:42.740]   Under Lena Khan, the FTC is a, is, you know, I think there's this kind of regret that they
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.980]   didn't stop Facebook from buying Instagram and what's happened.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.980]   So I think they're looking at all acquisitions now with a little bit of a more evil.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.980]   You know what?
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.540]   Yesterday, are we going to talk about that?
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:56.460]   That's like the biggest story in tech this week, which is yesterday's FTC department
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.820]   of J, DOJ announcement.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.660]   I think we can talk about that because I mean, unless anybody has anything else they want
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.980]   to say about the Microsoft is where I was headed.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:12.260]   There was, was that it's so funny that they're now not the, they're not the evil empire anymore.
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260]   They're the nice tech company.
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.940]   Well, that's the other thing is it's a good one to give them a crap.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.780]   It's, no, but it is an opportunity.
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.780]   It is.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:26.020]   It's an opportunity for Microsoft because while the eye of Sauron is, is looking at Google
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:32.820]   and Apple, you know, for the app store, they're looking at Amazon, Facebook for anything.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.420]   Facebook, Congress did not ask such in Adela to come testifying.
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.460]   He was the one guy out.
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.060]   And I think maybe he's the nice guy.
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.060]   He's the nice guy.
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.740]   I think maybe, and this does totally fit with Microsoft.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.300]   The other thing, he is a brilliant CEO.
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:55.300]   He has pivoted Microsoft from being the Windows and Office company to being the cloud company.
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.060]   And gaming is a big part of that for him.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.220]   So I think this is an opportune moment.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.220]   Corey's right.
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.980]   I mean, it's got to get regular choice.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:07.300]   But I think there's a good case to be made that that this will not be stopped.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.100]   Who else would have bought it?
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.100]   Sorry.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.900]   Apparently we're talking to Google.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:19.220]   They were apparently because and Google, the price was pretty high.
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.220]   Who are the rumors that they were talking to?
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.980]   Although Bobby Kotick, the, can I say embattled?
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.980]   Is that the word?
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:31.340]   The embattled CEO and founder said that Microsoft was such a natural fit.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.860]   They started conversations a couple of months ago.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.860]   It just was obvious.
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.860]   This is where we should go.
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:36.860]   Of course, that's who got him.
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.180]   So that's what he's going to say.
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.660]   But apparently they went to other companies and nobody wanted to bite that big of a bullet.
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.300]   You know, that's a lot of money.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:51.020]   With the Google perspective on here, you were mentioning why Microsoft is so successful
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.020]   in this.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:56.860]   Is it because they have the Azure backbone because Google has just as much money and
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.460]   resources to be able to pull this stuff off from a close history.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.420]   It was dating work.
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.420]   Why didn't it work?
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.420]   Why didn't it take off?
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.780]   Google is the worst run company in big tech right now.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:14.420]   No, it's because Google makes deliciously beautiful tech and has no idea how to explain
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.460]   it to anybody who's actually going to use the tech.
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.460]   Yeah, they have some good.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.140]   I'll grant you that.
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:24.620]   It any cool stuff they may have done related to Stadia, trying to communicate that to developers
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:29.220]   and also because Google has a reputation for saying, "This isn't working for me.
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.220]   I'm pulling the plug."
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:36.980]   I mean, building a good quality video game takes time and effort and money and you're
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.140]   not going to invest all that and have Google say, "You know what?
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.140]   Never mind."
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:46.180]   Remember, Google bought a bunch of, they were going to do their independent studio.
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.740]   They brought in big people and they folded it like three months.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.220]   And then it turned around and sent them out the door.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.220]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.220]   Yeah.
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.220]   Like you would never build for that if you were a gaming company, unless you're building
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.220]   Candy Crusher, Wordle.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.500]   What are those called?
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.220]   Not parodies, copycats.
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.220]   Yeah, clones.
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.220]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.220]   Clones, thank you.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.220]   Yeah.
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.980]   It's funny because Sony, which is Microsoft's big competition in the console markets, stock
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.660]   went down $20 billion when this was announced because there's a fear that Microsoft will
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.340]   take all these games exclusive and Sony will lose some of its biggest franchises like Call
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.340]   of Duty.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.620]   Microsoft said right now they're not going to do that.
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.420]   Of course, that's really intended for the most important audience.
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.740]   To this point, the Federal Trade Commission.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:33.540]   So let's get to story number two, which Stacey says is the biggest story in tech.
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:40.220]   The FTC and the Department of Justice seek to rewrite merger guidelines.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:47.700]   They kicked off a crisis on Tuesday to rewrite these guidelines, a request for comment, particularly
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.700]   about digital markets.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.700]   So go ahead, Stacey.
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.620]   Why is this the story of the week?
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.620]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.180]   I just realized it wasn't on our list, which, okay.
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.780]   This is the story of the week because it just happened yesterday.
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.780]   It just happened yesterday.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.220]   It did just happen yesterday and they actually just.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.060]   We don't use the internet until the three or four days old.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.060]   We like to do.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.220]   We like to do that on the circle.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.620]   I like to find out what I think ahead of time.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.060]   We'll get a nice, a nice cheesy smell than we were in the story.
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.460]   We wait for the Caccio e Pepe moment and then we dive in.
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.260]   A nice rind on it.
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.260]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:29.900]   So what they did is they put out a request for information on how they enforce mergers.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:37.020]   And why this matters is because it's saying to the world, both the DOJ and the Federal
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.940]   Trade Commission are going to be looking at how they evaluate mergers.
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:41.940]   They're going to change.
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.420]   Well, they're looking at changing our policies.
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.420]   So that's a big deal.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:50.740]   And in particular, in the digital age, what used to work does not work.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.740]   And I do.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.820]   And this is bitter regret over Instagram and WhatsApp.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.820]   And they.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.340]   Yeah, there's, I think it's not just that.
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.620]   I mean, look at how Lina Khan looks at what Amazon's doing.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.660]   I mean, there's, there's tons of things.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.420]   So they put out this.
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.180]   It's a request for information.
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.180]   And you can get a lot for how they're thinking by looking at the types of questions they
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.420]   ask in this.
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.820]   So this is like just a 10 page document.
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:18.620]   They want everybody to talk about like they have some things.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:26.860]   So they're saying, hey, the way we look at M&A, do our current guidelines really work
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:27.860]   for that?
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.540]   The way we measure competition does that work, which means we could see them look at mergers
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.700]   more like Europe.
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:38.340]   You know how we used to talk a lot about how in the US we wait for harms to consumers.
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:43.300]   In this document, they're actually asking, hey, does this harm not just consumers, but
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.580]   maybe employees?
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.220]   Does it harm innovation at different levels?
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.220]   So they're actually open.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.980]   It is a big deal because they're opening up a lot of things that have been established
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.900]   and settled law for a long time.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.660]   I suspect that should say, say, say, say, say, well, okay, let me just say I suspect
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.420]   that's what Corey's talking about when he says, wait a minute, hold on, it's not a
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.420]   done deal.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:06.340]   This is not, yeah, this climate has changed.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:11.780]   But that I echo Jeff's question, which is, isn't this Congress's job?
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:12.780]   No.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:18.020]   What Congress does is they write laws and then they let the regulatory agencies figure it
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.020]   out.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.540]   Well, I would phrase it differently.
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:25.900]   They write laws that say what the mandate is for those agencies.
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:31.700]   Those agencies can only do what law, congressional law has said they can do.
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.980]   And I, so I could answer this question for the FCC because that's what I've covered for
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:36.980]   decades.
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:42.620]   I can't tell you what laws govern how the FTC or the DOJ.
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:43.620]   Right.
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.780]   My sense of it actually is that the FCC is much more constrained by what Congress says
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.220]   than the FTC or DOJ is.
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:54.420]   So probably, yeah, this is an interesting question and we'd have to get a governmental
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.420]   expert on this.
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.420]   Or just give me a week.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.420]   I'll learn.
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.420]   Will you?
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.420]   Thank you.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.220]   If you want me to, you're our expert on everything.
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.220]   That's the truth.
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.940]   No, it's about restraint of trade.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.980]   I pull it up the Sherman antitrust act, right?
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.580]   And then starts off with restraint of trade.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.440]   Well, and remember, Congress has been, Congress has been addressing whether the
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:18.700]   Sherman antitrust act is good enough in this age, but it's always my sense that Congress
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.900]   has to decide that not the FTC can't just say, well, you know, that Sherman antitrust
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.900]   act is outdated.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:24.900]   We're going to do a different level.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.340]   I don't know how much they can do that.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.340]   Well, no, I know.
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:32.220]   DOJ is different because you can investigate, right?
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.220]   They have an investigation.
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:37.900]   Like some of the, some of the things they're asking, so they're asking how should markets
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:43.040]   be defined when the potential harm, but competition stems not from price increases, but from
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.320]   long term or other non price factors.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.040]   So that's one of the things they actually bring up them.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040]   I can never say this, Jeff.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.040]   What's the word?
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.800]   Manasopi, manasopi, manasopi, manasopi, manasopi, manasopi, manopi, it's like monopoly, but it's
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.800]   a manasopi.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.480]   I'm like the coladasca.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.480]   Be there.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.320]   Manasopi, manasopi, manopi, manopi, yeah, thank you.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:09.300]   How should the guidelines analysis of manaopcini power defer from analysis of monopoly power?
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:14.500]   So the manaopcini is kind of the opposite of a monopoly.
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.500]   Monopoly is one company that dominates a business.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.100]   A manaopcini is a market in which there's only one buyer for a product.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.100]   Right.
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.460]   And then they have a whole segment.
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.460]   So it's the opposite.
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.460]   It's one customer instead of one seller, which is weird, but it's a big deal.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.460]   Yeah.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.660]   And they all also have a whole section on digital markets.
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:41.100]   So they're like, hey, how do like M&A in digital markets differ from physical markets?
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.220]   What does that mean?
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:47.080]   There's a lot of really good questions.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.080]   They're asking.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   That's the question though.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.080]   These are legitimate questions.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.560]   They should ask them then what?
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.800]   And I think ultimately it's a court that's going to decide this, not the FTC, not the
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.400]   DOJ, the court and the court's going to decide it based on established law.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.480]   And precedent, not on what the FTC thinks is.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.640]   But FTC can bring a court case, soak in the DOJ, but the courts are going to interpret
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.640]   it.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.640]   And I think they're going to look at those statutes.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.640]   Well, yeah.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.280]   But here's how this works.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:20.280]   I mean, you see the same thing play out with like the FCC when they put out like a notice
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.520]   of proposed something.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.960]   Anyway, there's a they do the same sort of process.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.400]   So the process is this.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:33.560]   These guys are clearly indicating with this, this thing that they've sent out.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.560]   What's it called again?
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.960]   The request for comment.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.320]   Yeah, request for comment.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.440]   They're saying, Hey, we're thinking about this.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.840]   You've got X number of days.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.320]   I don't remember how many days to tell us your opinions.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.360]   What they're going to do is they're going to come out from that and then they're going
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.320]   to create new merger review guidelines from there.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.120]   Everybody's going to say, Oh, cricky.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.880]   This is how they're going to evaluate this.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.840]   What'll happen is when they apply those guidelines.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.960]   The company that's affected by it and is mad about it is going to sue.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:07.040]   And then we'll see that lawsuit come forth and the judge will say, I'm sorry, you don't
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.040]   have the power to do this.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.040]   It needs to go back to Congress.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:14.760]   We actually saw this happen with net neutrality and FCC or the courts are going to say, keep
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.760]   going.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.120]   So ultimately, yes, it gets decided by the courts, but this is still a very important
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:25.000]   process because it's possible that the DOJ and the FTC make it work.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.240]   And with most companies that want to be within the legal framework or with the companies
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.800]   that are going to be doing these deals.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:44.200]   I mean, if you're a tech company, this just is one more thing that is informing you that,
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.160]   hey, they're looking at us.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.160]   They're paying attention.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.240]   And that may be the main intent of this.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.920]   No, no, the intent is actually to come up with new merger guidelines.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:58.240]   The intent is not to we're not going to leave this process with everybody agreeing that,
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:03.440]   oh, yeah, everything we've been doing is still going to happen that way because it's so
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.440]   wonderful.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.480]   We're going to walk out with new merger guidelines.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.880]   Now, I don't know if we're going to walk out with things like, hey, you're going to
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:15.080]   have to undo those deals like what the UK is trying to do with meta and Giffy or yeah,
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.080]   Giffy, but we are definitely going to have a new way of evaluating M&A, which is why
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.880]   it's such a big deal.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:30.920]   So according to the Hill, the FTC and DOJ were tasked during the Trump administration to
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.600]   look at antitrust enforcement.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:39.200]   They spent a year and a half looking at their joint guidance on vertical mergers.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:45.400]   They voted last fall to withdraw those guidelines on a party line vote.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:51.080]   So maybe it's in the face of this vacuum that they want to say, well, okay, we've withdrawn
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.000]   our existing guidelines on vertical mergers.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.560]   Now what?
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.880]   What should they be?
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.360]   Right.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.600]   And of course, this is the Biden administration effect.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:09.320]   This is the executive saying, we need to pay more attention to this.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.520]   I think Congress is split on this.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.960]   And I don't know where the courts stand.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.720]   I think so.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.280]   I think there are a lot of question marks.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.480]   It's not sufficient for the FTC and DOJ to say, no, this is the law.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   They don't.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.920]   They just say what we're investing in.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.680]   These are just their M&A guidelines that they're doing.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:34.480]   But when you're doing a deal, you do pay attention to this because let's say you want to do.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.840]   Well, you don't want to get investigated, of course.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:41.320]   Well, yeah, if you're going to buy like a tiny little aqua hire and you look at this
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.680]   and you're like, oh, well, now it's no longer worth it, which is why we're going to see
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.440]   a lot of VCs come in and talk about how, because this is going to affect their exit
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.440]   strategy as well.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.160]   You're going to see a lot of interesting players come out and be like, a little bit?
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.160]   No.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:28:00.960]   In the RFC, the joint RFC, they said they're particularly interested in hearing about aspects
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:07.960]   of competition that the current guidelines may under emphasize or neglect, such as labor
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:16.120]   market effects and non price elements of competition, like innovation, quality, and
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.120]   potential competition.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.120]   I think that's reasonable.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.120]   So instead of just saying, what's the harm to the consumer?
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.840]   How is this going to affect prices?
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.240]   All of those yield a harm to the consumer.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   That's right.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   It's not in pricing.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.240]   Right.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:33.880]   Well, that's what they're saying is our current strategy for because that's all we use right
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:40.280]   now for our M&A is price, whereas the EU looks at a broader thing.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.280]   Critics of antitrust.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.280]   This is the Hill again.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.660]   Critics of antitrust enforcement over the last few decades have raised concerns of focusing
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:50.840]   solely on the effects of mergers and acquisitions on consumer prices has allowed many anti-competitive
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.360]   mergers to be completed freely.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.400]   This is especially a point of focus for groups worried about the consolidation in the tech
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.400]   industry.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.400]   Let me ask our tech apologists, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.840]   The internet defender is my.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.400]   I'm sorry, defender of the internet, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.880]   You need a little peacemaker helmet.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.880]   That would be cool.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:19.760]   Jeff, I put in the chat a link to in the, in the doc in the chat a link to the actual
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.760]   document.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.120]   Oh, here's, is this the RFC itself?
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.120]   That's good.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.120]   That'll be good.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.120]   I was also reading the internet.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.120]   I crossed that.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.120]   But go ahead and ask a question.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:38.440]   There is on the other hand a strong case to be made that we should let these companies
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.840]   let the free market decide, let these companies battle it out.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:47.280]   The best case for innovation is for companies to compete as hard as they can and do the
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.280]   best that they can't.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:57.560]   But you think that there's a here Stacey Groening is surprisingly is the issue that they aren't
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.920]   competing as hard as they can.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.920]   They're just acquiring.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.840]   Well, I mean, a few things.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.280]   One, as a reread Sherman, it's interesting.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:11.680]   It's all about conspiracies and collusion and bad things behind the scenes, not purchases.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.680]   Right?
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.640]   So, so there's a, there's kind of a difference of what it was, what it was aimed for was
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:21.080]   these horrible bad tactics that Rockefeller and, and, and, and the rubber barons of the,
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.120]   of the Gilded Age did.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.120]   This is different.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.920]   This says, okay, we established a principle there to Stacy's point.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.520]   And now we enforce it differently.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.080]   I think what's really interesting is by the way, if you read this request for comment,
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:39.000]   they're also saying, do the guidelines properly reflect the text and purpose of the Clayton
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Act?
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.360]   They're, they aren't saying we're not going to replace Clayton or Sherman.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:49.560]   But are we act, are we actually enforcing what the intent of these laws is?
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.920]   Are we actually doing our job?
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.920]   Right.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.200]   But, but even Clayton is about unethical business practices, price fixing monopolies, as opposed
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:01.720]   to G, those, that's too big or they should be together.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.480]   Clayton says, so let me, let me, they want to prevent mergers and acquisitions whose effect
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.360]   may be substantially to lessen competition.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:14.760]   And then the FTC and DOJ say, are they sufficiently clear about the circumstances in which that
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.320]   happens?
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.160]   What, what effects should be covered by the terms?
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.640]   They're saying less in competition.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.640]   Well, what, how do we do that?
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.640]   Right.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.160]   And so the point I want to get to is, is to raise what you raised earlier.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:32.120]   Is, is that if you really could Sherman turn the way back machine to whatever year it was,
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:39.680]   and my Facebook's going to buy Instagram, Instagram, small, they overpaid for it.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.840]   It's a perfect example.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.320]   They were farther back.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.200]   They were fewer than 20 employees.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.200]   It's a perfect example.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.200]   Right.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:51.680]   And so, and to say, oh my God, they should have seen, compare that to Microsoft's announcement.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.520]   And now I'm not saying Microsoft's announcement is wrong either.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.520]   Number three in games.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.120]   One of the new players is Chinese.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.400]   You know, who knows?
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.040]   The world changes.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:05.080]   There's a Rand report that I call upon often from the 90s that said, yeah, we've got to
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.680]   let this just kind of blow out and figure it out.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.440]   They tried to think that we can control it now that we know where it's ending.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:17.880]   We know where we are is, is hubris and, and won't work very well.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.360]   And so yes, we'll make missteps and things that go wrong, but let it play itself out
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.080]   more.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:29.280]   And so I think the question then becomes we go back to our discussion of regulatory capture
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.040]   and we have Facebook out there begging for regulation because they can afford it.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.240]   What I fear for are the sprouts we can't see coming out of the ground yet.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.080]   The competition we don't know wants to start out there because it can't.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.840]   And how do you regulate to that?
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:51.600]   So that's just a silly red herring of regulating the stuff we don't know.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.600]   Just I'm going after you.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.600]   I'm with Buster.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   Thank you.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   So.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   Good for the.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:04.600]   Just say that we don't know what's going to happen.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.640]   So we shouldn't regulate is silly.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.800]   We are going to mess things up.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   Okay.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.360]   Because that's what it sounds like you're sick and I like saying is no, what I'm saying
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:20.600]   is the thing I care about that I do want to regulate to is to enable future competition.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.400]   What I'm saying is because we don't know what that is.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.800]   I don't know how to regulate to that.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:29.480]   And so what happens is a lot of the regulation that occurs to date is stuff that only the
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.080]   big companies can afford to do and new companies can't afford to do it.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:38.680]   And that's the unintended consequence of that regulation is that it stifles competition
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:43.720]   because it sets the playing field at an impossible level.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:49.680]   And so how do you regulate to avoid that is what I'm saying.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:56.360]   So big companies will always, always be able to handle regulation better because they simply
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.200]   have more money and infrastructure to do.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.840]   So we that is a good point in lawyers.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.840]   Yes.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:08.280]   But I think by setting out new guidelines, I don't think that hurts innovation because
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.640]   what will happen is you will have a clear set of guidelines.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:15.680]   And yes, the companies will that are big and established will play within those guidelines
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.280]   and manipulate them using their massive more chests and lawyers.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:25.560]   But it also makes clear where the new innovation can come in and kind of go in the cracks.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.640]   And that's how it's historically gone.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.400]   So you're going to change the field and there are companies right now like small companies
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.240]   who've been playing under the existing regime that are going to get screwed.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.240]   That always happens.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:41.480]   You know, the other way they're going to do this, Daisy, is the other thing I fear is
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.040]   that and I don't like this world where venture money controls everything, but we are still
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.080]   in that world.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.520]   And if there isn't, if exit pans get cut off.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.360]   Well, and that's what I'm talking about.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.400]   The venture capitalists are going to hate this.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.400]   Yes.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:59.800]   But there will be more investment once they figure this new thing out.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.560]   Venture capital is not, I know they like to think they're leading indicator.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.960]   No, they're not.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:09.040]   So they're going to try to keep everything the same so they can maintain their returns,
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.160]   which I don't blame them.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:15.880]   But that's also not great for innovation because we're way down this road and we're
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:22.000]   pretty basically all our cool stuff that gets invented, gets invented to be sold to one
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.600]   of the big companies sales.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:29.120]   So I have to say reading these questions, this all seems completely reasonable.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.320]   It doesn't presume an answer.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.840]   It just says, well, here's some things we really need to look at.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:37.640]   And in every case, they say, you know, consistent with what Congress and the courts have, you
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.640]   know, indicated.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.800]   Well, that's they have to say that.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   Well, that's the yes.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   They are limited by that.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.040]   But it's also better than that.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.560]   They're going to need jerk, we got to break them up to punish them.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.560]   Which is what you're in.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:53.040]   And you know, Lena Khan, I think is very thoughtful to regarding that failing firms thing.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:36:01.640]   There actually is a whole section, section 15 on failing and flailing firms in which they
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:07.000]   ask the question in what situation should a weekend competitor defense apply.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.760]   So for instance, T-Mobile, which was failing, was denied a number of mergers, but eventually
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.320]   granted it.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:22.600]   I think also of Sirius, satellite and XM, both of which were failing and allowed to merge
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.440]   even though it created a monopoly.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:29.480]   So they're asking about existing doctrine and how does it change, how does it changed
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.680]   in the digital era?
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:36.000]   And I think these are all things you want to almost constantly ask these questions.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.280]   It's appropriate at this time to say, well, markets have changed a little bit.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.360]   The monopsony thing is very interesting.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.320]   As an example, it's effect on labor markets.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.320]   If there's only one company hiring, that's a monopsony.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.720]   They're the only customer for labor.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.680]   Then labor has no recourse.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.680]   They have no defense.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.520]   They can't say, well, we're going to go across the street.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.520]   So that's a.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:03.000]   In Clayton, Clayton actually addresses what they call tying contracts.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.240]   And that labor agreements fall under Clayton, so they have a justification for something
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.960]   like that.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.320]   They also talk about innovation.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.600]   To what extent does a focus on product market overlaps fail to identify broader concerns
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.480]   about incentives to innovate, particularly given that innovation may involve the creation
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.800]   of new product or service categories.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.800]   These are all, I think, really appropriate.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.800]   Now the question is, is there an answer?
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:35.120]   I think you have to say, this is an imperfect system.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.400]   There are going to be 50 answers.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.000]   There are going to be so many answers.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.520]   This is why we hate talking about this because there's going to be 50 different answers depending
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.160]   on where you're coming from.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.760]   And the FTC and the DOJ are going to have to make some calls.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.960]   And they're going to be like, this is rule.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.280]   So I think all of this is appropriate.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:02.480]   So get back to Microsoft, I think maybe the fact that this came out the day before Microsoft
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.360]   announced the acquisition of Activision may not be a coincidence.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   Microsoft may have, because this is just a question right now.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.280]   This isn't new policy.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:16.600]   Microsoft may have thought, now's the time to jump on this and get it in under the door
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.440]   before the door slam shut.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.680]   So I think it's appropriate.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.680]   It's interesting.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:29.520]   Meanwhile, before we move on from regulation, yes, we could be in much a much better place,
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.520]   which of course would be Europe, Line 51.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.520]   Okay.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:43.720]   Well, before we go to Line 51, let me take a little tiny time out and talk about our sponsor
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.560]   because we are at the half hour mark.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:53.480]   Only if you don't include my long boring anecdotes about mattresses and Francis for Coppola.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:57.640]   Or your efforts to find a simple link on the, you're definitely cut that out.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:01.960]   I took out a whole 10 minutes in the overall timing based on me scrolling up and down.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.880]   By the way, just folks, it was fascinating.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.400]   Oh man, we edited that part out completely.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.400]   But here it is.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.400]   You do it.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.400]   You I am here.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.400]   It is right here under general.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.400]   There's a little triangle.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.720]   You can, I missed the little teeny we need triangle right there.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.720]   And there it is.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.520]   Stacey Higginbotham book club vote on the next book.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.600]   And somewhere the vote is here, you can vote on the next book.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:29.200]   That's one of them unauthorized bread, a radicalized novella.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.440]   And they talk about where you can get it and all of that stuff.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.440]   So yeah, it's good.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.280]   The votes could go to the pinned right there.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.280]   It's good.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.280]   It's good.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.080]   Nor by Nettie Ocar four.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   Cora four.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:47.600]   Cora four unauthorized bread by Corey Doctorow and Kai Fulee's AI 2041.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.160]   You can cast your vote right there.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.600]   If you have a strong opinion and then when is the next book club, it's going to be next
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:57.520]   month, I think sometime next March at the week at our March, not February.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.520]   It had to be March.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.520]   Okay.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.000]   That's the beginning after we get our vote.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Wow.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.400]   I interviewed Annalie in 2018.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.400]   Holy cow.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.160]   Yeah, a lot of this was an older book.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.400]   Mel three years old, not that old.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.840]   Well, you know, she's got a new one out.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.600]   They've got a new one out.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.600]   Yes.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.600]   Show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:25.560]   If you're a viewer of any of our Twitter shows, I know you are into technology, right?
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.200]   Maybe you've even thought this would be nice to have a career in technology, perhaps an
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.000]   information technology, IT.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.840]   Well, if you're not sure where to get started, I can give you your first step and you know
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:44.600]   the longest journey begins with a single step at itpro.tv/twit.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:51.400]   ITProTV has the knowledge, the certificates you need to break into the IT world while
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.520]   being very desirable to future employees.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.880]   This month's theme at ITProTV is perfect.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:59.800]   Getting started in IT gives you a great start to the new year.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:04.120]   If you want to dip your toes into IT, check out the following courses to get started.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.840]   CompT is ITF plus and CompT is A plus.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:11.520]   A plus is very often that first desktop support cert that people get.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.920]   I should mention that ITProTV is the official video partner of CompTia.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:22.040]   These are the official CompTia courses in Security Plus, Network Plus, ITF plus, A plus.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:28.080]   They also have courses this month, special courses on Linux Essentials, Microsoft 365
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:34.120]   Fundamentals, hands-on PC build from the bench, Cisco CCT routing and switching, and Apple
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:38.080]   Certified Support Professionally, ACSP cert.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.080]   These are great.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:44.920]   There's on-demand webinars too, lots of them that will help you decide what part of IT you're
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.440]   interested in.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:51.520]   If you're worried that learning about IT would be dull and boring, it is anything but all
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:57.080]   of their educators, they call them educators, are experts in the field absolutely sharing
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.720]   their passion.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.720]   That passion makes it fun.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.720]   They make it fun, interesting, exciting.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.400]   I love Adam's stuff, by the way.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.400]   He's great.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.400]   There's a few of these instructors.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.040]   They're just so good.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.680]   If you prefer shorter formats, you'll love it that the courses are all 20 to 30 minutes
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.120]   each.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.160]   Just the right length through your lunch break or a short attention span, but they're always
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.160]   making new stuff.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:25.480]   This is very important because the tests change, there's new versions of the software,
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:31.680]   information changes, seven studios working Monday through Friday all day to create great
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.680]   new content.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:39.720]   It gets to the library in 24 hours, 5,800 hours of up-to-date on-demand content for just about
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:43.400]   every skill, every cert, every vendor.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.760]   They make sure you're prepared for your exams with their virtual labs and practice tests
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.120]   to those are really great.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.360]   Oh, there's Don Pazette, what Linux distro is right for you.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.360]   That's a good one.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.800]   IT Pro TV also has wonderful monthly webinars on-demand.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.480]   You can catch up on to get more insight into the world of IT.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:03.680]   If you're looking to break into the world of IT, get the introduction you need with IT
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.680]   Pro TV.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:11.640]   It's an IT Pro.TV/twit for an additional 30% off all consumer subscriptions for the lifetime
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.440]   of your active subscription.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.440]   That's a great deal.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.520]   Just use the offer code TWIT30, TWIT30.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:26.200]   Again, IT Pro.TV/twit, use the code TWIT30 for an additional 30% off the lifetime of your
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.000]   active subscription.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.400]   IT Pro TV, build or expand your IT career and enjoy the journey I've talked to so many
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:37.160]   of our listeners and viewers who are IT Pro TV fans.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:41.520]   It's a natural relationship we've been with them since the very beginning.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:47.320]   IT Pro.TV/twit.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.320]   Line, what line?
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.320]   What line is it?
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.800]   Who's line is it anyway?
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.880]   This is the European regulator speaking.
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:53.880]   All right.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:44:00.160]   The European Commission.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.720]   This is from Tieribre-ton.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.880]   All right.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.880]   Here we go.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.880]   Let me turn on the sound.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.880]   Okay.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:07.880]   Yes.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   Yes.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.880]   The ecstasy of gold.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:10.880]   A new sheriff.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:13.880]   You recognize this spaghetti western.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.880]   That's Clint Eastwood.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.880]   Watch out.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.880]   This information is...
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.880]   That's the good, bad, ugly, but the soundtrack.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.880]   Water-fit products.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.880]   Ah, but new you say shoot.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.880]   Hot body in efforts.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.880]   Hoof.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.880]   Hoof.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.880]   I just hope this doesn't get pulled.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.560]   I'm covering it with my whistling.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.320]   What is illegal?
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:41.960]   There's a new sheriff in town and it goes by the name of D.S.A.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:46.480]   Boy, that makes me really shivering my boots.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.960]   What is this crap?
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:48.960]   Really Mr. J.S.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.960]   What does D.S.A.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.960]   stand for?
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.440]   Digital Services Act, I think it is.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.560]   And what is it going to do?
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.240]   Is it going to eliminate hate speech?
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.240]   Is it going to...
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.240]   Oh, yes.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.240]   And this information and everything is wrong with it.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.440]   The illegal content, it's just going to get rid of all of it.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.440]   Everything.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.440]   It's all going to be gone.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.440]   Because...
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:08.280]   Because Tieribre-ton is Clint Eastwood.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.280]   Yes.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.600]   In the D.S.A. at noon.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.520]   Oh, by the way.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.520]   Very first...
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.520]   Oh, nice.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.520]   Peacemakers here.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.520]   Very...
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:24.520]   Very first response tweet to this video.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.960]   I'm curious, did you clear the rights to this footage?
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.960]   Mm-hmm.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.960]   Mm-hmm.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.800]   Nice J.S.A.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.440]   T-A-R-E-Pretol.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.440]   You go to D.M.C.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.840]   Dead Jail.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.960]   Spotify is getting a little bit of heat.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:42.960]   Just a little.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.320]   Just a little.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.920]   Over Mr. Joe Rogan.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.480]   Was it 17,000 scientists?
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.320]   Is it really up to that?
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.040]   That's why they hired Joe Rogan.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.160]   They wanted a little bit of heat.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.960]   Now they might be getting a little too much.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:45:59.960]   It's not so...
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.960]   But people still subscribing though.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.960]   I would miss...
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:11.280]   260 scientists in an open letter urge Spotify to take action over mass information events.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.600]   I think they mean miss.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.600]   I think the rap action...
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.600]   There's a typo.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.160]   I don't get it.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.600]   Maybe there's a typo in the letter.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.400]   No, this is from the letter.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:26.840]   Baseless conspiracy theories broadcasting misinformation.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.640]   They're particularly upset about a January...
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:34.600]   Oh, the letter was day to January 10th, but they're upset over a New Year's Eve episode
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:42.080]   of the Joe Rogan experience known as J.R.E. to its fans in which guest Dr. Robert Malone
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:49.260]   promoted baseless conspiracy theories by allowing the propagation of false and societally
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:51.440]   harmful assertions.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.960]   Spotify is blah blah blah.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.520]   What is Spotify's responsibility here?
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.040]   Do they own Joe Rogan?
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.040]   No.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.280]   Yeah, they pay him a fortune.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.840]   Well they pay him for exclusivity.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.840]   I don't know.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.840]   Yeah, I don't know this thing.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.840]   They pay him a fortune.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:09.840]   But it's still their platform and I think they should be held responsible for it because
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.840]   it's their platform.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:15.520]   Unlike Twitter and Facebook, which is an open platform for all of us to say the real hell
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.280]   we want, they in essence hired him.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.920]   So they are as responsible for him.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.680]   You want a media analogy?
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.920]   That's a media relationship.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.440]   Twitter and Facebook aren't.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.440]   But that is...
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.400]   Okay, yeah.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.200]   They're responsible.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.440]   So they can make a choice to have him or not have him.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:37.520]   I was talking about this with my friend Pete Dominic on his podcast and the fear is Pete
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:44.360]   says if they get rid of him or something, oh my God, then he becomes even bigger, martyr
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.400]   for the cause of stupidity.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:53.640]   And so Spotify put themselves in a position where they're a little hotter than the collar,
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:54.640]   as Stacy said.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:59.920]   Where did 230 implications on this, if any?
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.480]   They have the right to have him run out of him.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.480]   That's the implication.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.480]   They're not responsible.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.480]   But it is different.
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.200]   It's interesting that it is a question mark.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:11.440]   I want to get one of our lawyer friends and they have a half hour discussion about this
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.080]   to drive Leo nuts.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.600]   Well, you were gone Stacy.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.600]   Asgarela.
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:20.720]   Kathy Ellis was great and we're going to have her back absolutely.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.720]   But you're not going to let me talk about it.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.680]   But whatever you do, don't ask her about it.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.680]   What is it?
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:25.680]   Incidental copyright?
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.680]   Insular copyright.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:27.680]   Incillary copyright.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:32.880]   And of course, if you get her and Jeff talking about an insular copyright, just...
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:33.880]   It's life's so correct.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.880]   I'm a happy guy.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.480]   Is it worse than me on chips?
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.280]   I'm not sure why but I'm not really.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.920]   That's talking about life's so cute.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.640]   It was adorable and I enjoyed it a lot.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:49.040]   So it was a good conversation about ancillary copyright.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:55.360]   But it's a really good question, and I'm not sure because in this case, they bought the
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.360]   content.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.400]   But wait a minute.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:04.880]   Is a radio station responsible for what Rush Limbaugh says on the radio station?
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.880]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:07.880]   Well, yes, yes.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.360]   This isn't the FCC connected radio stations?
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.360]   Right.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.360]   Yes they do.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.360]   Well, because radio is radio-suck-
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.360]   Radio is different.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:20.560]   It's not the only time that's responsible for publishing an op-ed by Rush Limbaugh that
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:21.960]   rivals someone.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.960]   Yes.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:23.960]   They can be sued.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:24.960]   Okay.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.960]   Yes.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.520]   Although I have to say my syndicator, premium radio networks which carried Rush Limbaugh and
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.000]   still carries quite a few people.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:41.480]   Or our competitor which carries Ben Shapiro, they, I mean nobody stopped these people from
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:45.480]   saying things like, but the Joe Rogan says, because they're saying awful things are not
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.480]   necessarily saying action.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:48.800]   I'm not a journalist.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.480]   I'm an entertainer.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.480]   They're saying awful things.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:58.560]   Joe Rogan says, Joe Rogan says, Joe Rogan says, I'm an effing moron.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.200]   Does that let him off the hook?
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.200]   No.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   Yes, that's what he's saying.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.200]   It was a joke.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.720]   It was, I was just joking.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.680]   You should decide whether you want to get a vaccine or not.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.280]   I was just joking.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.080]   But then this doctor comes on and says, well, it's much more harmful for young people and
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.240]   you shouldn't get it.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.520]   You know, I don't know.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.520]   I don't know.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.520]   I don't know.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:29.680]   Spotify has taken the measure of pulling down old, some Joe Rogan content that was bad.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.600]   He's now shutting down Spotify.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:35.240]   Well, yeah, bad to find bad, but they've pulled stuff.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:38.320]   They've even pulled some of his shows, more recent shows.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.520]   I don't know.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.720]   The issue is a moral responsibility, not a legal one.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:43.720]   That's a good point.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:44.720]   Okay.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:45.720]   There you go.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:46.720]   That's really the point.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:47.720]   There you go.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:48.720]   It's a moral or ethical responsibility.
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.960]   We can yell all we want, but I'm not arguing for any kind of legal action.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:52.960]   They are protected.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.720]   I'm a First Amendment, but moral responsibility is.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:04.920]   I think as long as subscribers are still rolling into Spotify, Spotify is just going to get
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.560]   cash in those checks.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:12.240]   And, you know, I mean, they're making money on Joe Rogan.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:16.120]   So theoretically, we don't actually know that.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.040]   Yeah, actually, I think they probably lost money.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.040]   Okay.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.040]   Yeah, to be honest.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.040]   They paid him like, what was that?
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.040]   100 million dollars.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.040]   100 million dollars.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.680]   Have they made good on that yet?
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.680]   I doubt.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.680]   That is a substantial amount of money.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.680]   Direct TV has dumped OAN.
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:33.920]   Your favorite network.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.920]   Yes.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:38.760]   Yes, because especially it came out there, this is bad publicity.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:44.560]   This is the moral, not panic, not panic, a moral issue where, and it was a business
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:49.640]   issue where when the stories came out that AT&T was the primary supporter of OAN was their
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:50.640]   biggest revenue source.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:54.040]   Oh, that doesn't make us look too good.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.440]   Do they own direct TV?
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:01.680]   Wait, that sounds more like a commercial and not a moral issue, Jeff.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.520]   But the reason it's a commercial issue is because people have a moral objection.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.520]   Right.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:09.080]   So I don't know if they actually funded OAN.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:12.440]   They funded, it was indirect, but you're right.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.440]   I mean, that's why AT&T-
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.360]   Well, they were revenue source to them.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:20.800]   So, AT&T, which does own direct TV apparently has decided to-
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:21.800]   I don't know.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:27.080]   Or maybe just direct TV is autonomous anyway, they're not renewing the contract for OAN.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:32.640]   But I think that's related because OAN is also a source of a lot of weird disinformation
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:38.520]   and propaganda and conspiracy theories, even if you like it a lot.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:48.760]   OAN's market, according to Brian Stelter, is a couple of years ago, OAN's total subscriber
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:53.840]   account is far lower than Fox News or even Newsmax.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:54.840]   It's heavy Newsmax.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:55.840]   Right.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.840]   So it's a-
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.200]   Yeah, because it is a crazy person network.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.680]   Have you watched the link?
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:01.680]   I've never seen it.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.680]   Is it?
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   I should watch it.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.840]   Is it entertaining anyway?
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:06.840]   If you don't mind your voice for-
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.840]   You feel like my wife's a promise is funny.
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:13.000]   Yeah, I was like, it's only entertaining except you were like, oh, no, people actually
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   believe this.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.600]   Nope, it's not entertaining anymore.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:19.240]   They claim that COVID was created in a North Carolina lab.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.240]   Hmm.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.680]   What a surprise.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:24.080]   We all thought it was funny, but that's how we got here.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.840]   We laughed at that.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.840]   Oof.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.160]   Well, and that's the same thing with Joe Rogan.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.960]   He says, I'm a comic.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.120]   I'm a comic.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:33.400]   I'm making jokes.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.800]   How about-
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:36.800]   There's-
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:37.800]   There's-
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.240]   There's not on the rundown, but Brandi's a Drosni, if you know of her, she's a brilliant
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:47.480]   Oh, yeah, that story with the January 6th person.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:53.200]   And Brandi's great because she's- What I- What I- What I so love about her is that she's
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:54:00.040]   a librarian who became a reporter who reports on the worst of conspiracy theorists and awful
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.040]   things.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.160]   But she's still a librarian, right?
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.720]   I love that combination.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:04.720]   And she's very good at it.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:05.720]   She had a really good story.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.720]   She spent a year on not like the New York Times saying-
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:09.720]   I'm trying to find it.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.120]   I'm going to go to the South Sea and find the eating pedera.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.040]   This is somebody who tried to really understand what was going on in his head.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:21.360]   Somebody who got up to the steps of the Capitol on January 6th and then said, "Um, no."
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.360]   This is from-
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.360]   And what happened to that process?
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:24.520]   This is from NVC.
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:30.520]   Escape from Pheasant on how January 6th changed one person's path.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.520]   And it's not-
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.520]   The point here is-
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:33.520]   The guy changes his mind.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.520]   The guy changes his mind.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:35.520]   Places like that.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.520]   They're not- She makes the point.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.520]   There's no one source.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.520]   Facebook that a turn off Facebook is okay or turn off all the way in and everything's
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:42.520]   okay.
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.920]   No, it feeds- It's a whole bunch of stuff that feeds in.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.080]   Media have a major role here.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:52.920]   And once he was primed to believe crazy stuff, his first one was the pizza conspiracy in
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.920]   Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:54.920]   Right.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:56.920]   Right.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.600]   And once he was down that rabbit hole, there was nothing but down toward the center of the
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.520]   earth to go and a lot of things push him there.
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:05.160]   And so all the way in has- It doesn't have to have a large audience.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:12.480]   His experience, I've had that experience when you're in a mob, in my case it was anti-Vietnam
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:15.560]   protests in the 70s, but when you're in a mob-
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:16.560]   Oh.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:23.720]   He talks about- He says, "I saw their eyes change.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.800]   You know when somebody gets really angry and you just feel like they're going to go nuts.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.720]   I feel like I was watching people get radicalized."
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.520]   And that's what happens in a mob.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:35.200]   It was a much more mellow, anti-mortory, marches Leo.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:36.840]   What kind of nasty marches were you in?
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.520]   We were all trying to save the world.
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:45.080]   Well, we thought we were trying to save the world, but in particular in one, in the mining
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:50.600]   of Haifang Harbor, do you remember that when we mined the harbor?
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:51.760]   It was in Santa Cruz.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.800]   I was in high school still.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:59.800]   And somebody decided we should march down Ocean Street and block the highway exit.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:04.640]   Go out and block Highway 1 or Highway 1, I guess it was.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.920]   And I have a vivid memory of this.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.760]   I was carrying a Viet Cong flag.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:14.440]   In fact, I believe in case anybody wants to keep me from running for president, you'll
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:20.800]   find a picture on the front page of the Santa Cruz Sentinel of me holding a Viet Cong flag.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:21.800]   Oh my.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:25.000]   I thought, "Well, there goes my political career."
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.600]   But oh, shucks.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.080]   But I remember getting-
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.080]   What are you making me an actor?
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:32.600]   Getting- You know, I didn't think this was a good idea.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.880]   I thought, "This is just going to piss people off."
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:38.160]   But you get swept away by it and then they started rocking cars.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:40.840]   And I could see how you slowly gradually escalate.
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:43.960]   And then the next thing you do is you set a car on fire.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:48.520]   If you're angry enough and it doesn't take- That's the point is maybe it's only 10%
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.680]   of the crowd, but it spreads.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:52.680]   It's infectious.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.520]   Yeah, I covered the Harvey Milk line.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.520]   You get angry.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:57.520]   I forget, I'm for Dan White.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.520]   Yes, there was this going.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:56:59.520]   Yes, yes, I saw that.
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.520]   I know we were going to- I was talking about it.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:03.520]   The moratorium marsh that was very mellow.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:07.240]   Oh, I went to all the teach-ins and the mellow things.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.200]   I did that too, you know.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.120]   I'm going to take off sixth period.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:14.280]   I'm going to a teach-in up at the university.
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:15.280]   Okay.
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.280]   Wow.
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:18.120]   My parents were hippies.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.120]   It was okay.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.120]   I was a lot.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:25.960]   You know how paths diverge in the woods, you know?
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.760]   We're back on the porch, Grandpa.
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:31.200]   So let me tell you what the 60s.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.840]   Here it comes.
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:36.160]   I'm going to stop right there.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:38.040]   But I do understand this article.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:41.880]   I mean, it has nothing to do with anything, but I do understand this article that Brandi
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:45.480]   Zadrosni wrote and reported on for NBC.
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:51.400]   And I understand this guy, which is interesting because I don't think most people pull back
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.400]   from the brink.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.960]   I think you get sucked into it.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.960]   Exactly.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:55.960]   Exactly.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.960]   So a unique perspective where he went, "Whoa, this is getting out of here."
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:01.040]   Well, as of his family, he also, he arrived home.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:03.160]   His family could see where he was on his phone.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.920]   They knew he was at the Capitol.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.920]   They were afraid to death.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.840]   He arrives home and they did an intervention.
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:14.240]   And it was kind of a light bulb moment to say, "Oh, what was I thinking?"
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:19.680]   What's fascinating about this too is Brandi, my respect immensely, as a journalist, on
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:23.480]   Twitter said she has a Miranda statement that she gives to sources.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:24.480]   That's smart.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:27.520]   And if this is going to affect your life.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:28.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:29.520]   That's really smart.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.800]   And all journalists should do this.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.800]   You should write this up and take it to your mic.
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:36.640]   And this guy, the story took three months longer because he wasn't ready three months
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:37.640]   ago.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:38.640]   And now he was ready and gave a permission.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:42.920]   They changed his last name, but people use their names.
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:46.600]   But really, really interesting piece because it's not that usual, "Let's go to the diner
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:49.200]   and understand what the crazies are saying."
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:52.320]   This was trying to understand his real thinking and how it's valuable.
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:54.760]   I think everybody gets a Miranda.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:58.600]   I will talk to people and explain to them, "Look, you are clearly on the record when
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:59.880]   you talk to me."
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:06.800]   But I would say it's a very rare story that I would, if it's more of a human interest,
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:10.640]   I know this feels more than a human interest, but it is kind of human interest-y.
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:15.440]   But otherwise, in certain people, in certain positions of power, you know what you're doing.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.440]   And if you don't--
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.440]   I think--
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.440]   Stacy, you're right.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.000]   If you're talking about politicians, you don't need to Mirandaize them.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   It's huge more--
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   Okay.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   I was like, "I am not Mirandaizing."
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   That's not--
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   I'm not doing that until you're professional.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.520]   No, but when you're talking to a normal person and you're about to write a story that
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.520]   is going to change their lives--
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:30.520]   Change their lives.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.240]   --I think it's appropriate to be honest and forward.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.240]   Okay, yes.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.240]   I will--
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:39.120]   And I bet you, you do do things like say, "I just want you to know I'm recording this,"
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.120]   et cetera.
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:45.660]   I do it when I even do it for the CEO of a startup because I have had so many of them
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:47.480]   just say that dumbest things to me.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:49.920]   I'm like, "I am not your friend."
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:51.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.440]   They should know that.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:54.640]   But they don't often or they don't--
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.640]   Some of the--
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:59.360]   If they have PR representation, I don't go out of it.
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:03.000]   But if it's like, "There's a lot of people listen to the show and they're starting up
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.480]   a company and they're trying to do something cool," and I'm like, "Hey, I'll write about
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.880]   your gadget."
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.440]   But then I'm pretty clear with them because they're like--
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.840]   --this is going to change your life.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.320]   You are going to sell a new new--
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.200]   No, I don't do that.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.200]   Are you ready?
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.440]   Hey, speaking of which, I blame you for the success of Nano Leaf.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:26.360]   You were the first person that told me about it and then Micah Sargent.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:30.840]   They are retiring those original home kit light panels that you showed us.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:31.840]   Yes.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.840]   But that's good news.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.840]   They're not home kit.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.840]   Electra's item is stacy.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.880]   Oh, they're not home kit.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.920]   So, well, they work with Apple, but they're not home--
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.080]   This was pre-home kit.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:44.040]   They launched these in 2016.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.080]   But they're 50% off now if you want to snag them.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.080]   They are.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.440]   They're not going to sell anymore.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:54.680]   You can only buy expansion packs for the original triangles for like till they run out.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.480]   Now, I did ask them.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:00.440]   I said, "Hey, how long are you going to do security updates and support?"
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.440]   Oh.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.880]   And the answer, if you're wondering, since we're talking about it, I'm just going to
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.720]   tell you, they are going to offer it indefinitely.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:13.240]   Custom support and app features will be available, including group scenes allowing users to control
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:16.000]   their light panels with current and future Nanoleaf products.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.680]   So all of that is still going to stay.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:22.400]   And even a year after this, they launched the Nanoleaf canvases.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.720]   And I was like, "Are we going to expect those to become a legacy product in a year or so
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.720]   from now?"
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.920]   And she's like, "At this time, there are no plans to transition."
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:42.680]   So what was normally, say, $680 for the 30-panel rhythm starter kit is now $499-- $19.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:48.840]   And panels, that's not quite half off, but a pretty significant reduction.
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:53.720]   So if you've thought, "Oh, I'd like to have these Wi-Fi-controlled LED panels."
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:59.240]   Oh, they're 30% off the light panels promo in 50% off accessories.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.240]   I'm so sorry.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.800]   Well, it said the article we were reading said 50, so you were not mistaken.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.560]   I'm reading the original press statement.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.560]   Sorry.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.560]   Up, oh, I see.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.560]   The article says, "Up to--"
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.560]   Up to.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.560]   Up to.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.560]   As well as--
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.560]   All right.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:21.000]   So anyway, that's-- but the thing they're replacing it with is better.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.560]   The Nanoleaf shapes it is.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.040]   And they have a-- they've done a really-- okay.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.160]   Let me just be real for you all for a second.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.160]   Be real.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.160]   I now have my elements.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.160]   Please, and thank you.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.160]   You're always real, Stacy.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.160]   I know.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.440]   I've never known you to not be.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.520]   The secret here, what I say, I'm going to be real.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.520]   That means I'm about to say something bad about something.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.520]   I know.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.520]   This is--
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.520]   The Nanoleaf elements.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.520]   Yes.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.400]   It's a major life.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.400]   They suck.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.400]   Oh, no.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:53.160]   They are the most frustrating product I have.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.640]   You never tell us that before, young--
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.880]   Well, that's it for snapper.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:04.880]   We were-- so I was in love with them, and then I updated it to the Thread Border Router,
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.880]   because, you know, it's a Thread Border Router, and I love matter.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.880]   Right.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.880]   Who doesn't love that?
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.880]   And-- wonky.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.880]   Wonky?
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.880]   Wonky?
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.120]   And I was like, oh.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.160]   They would do things like turn on in the middle of the night for no reason.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.600]   They would do things like not turn on at all.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600]   That's awesome.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600]   And I was like, what the--
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.920]   Sounds like the IoT life, frankly.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:30.840]   It is kind of-- so then what happened is I talked to them, and they were like, it's
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.240]   a software update, only a few people are affected.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.400]   It's an IoT life for us.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.360]   An IoT life for us.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.360]   Lights go on.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.160]   It's a good thing to go off.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.160]   I don't switch.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.160]   I don't know.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.160]   It's an IoT life.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:47.200]   I'll leave the things in that just because it's in bad taste.
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.000]   They promised an update.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.720]   The update came through.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:56.800]   It did not fix the problem of them randomly turning on, which is why I'm finally giving
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.800]   up on them.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.240]   And I think if they don't-- I've emailed them again this week.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:05.600]   I was like, look, if these don't stop turning on in the middle of the night, I mean, we
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.000]   have to literally unplug them when we go to bed.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.720]   I'm like, what the hell?
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.720]   Are we going to fix this?
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:15.000]   Twindle has the elevator pitch for these when they came out.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.360]   He says, the elevator pitch was disco floors for your wall.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.360]   That's not bad.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.160]   I think Twindle has got it.
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.720]   So I can't recommend them anymore.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:30.400]   So don't buy them because their software is glitchy unless-- and if you do buy them,
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.480]   don't put them anywhere near a room that you sleep.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.120]   I learned that way back when we were the first huleites.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.040]   OK, those are fine.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.520]   And they fixed the issue.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.840]   I know they fixed it, but that was it for me.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:51.600]   What's on top of your IoT buyers remorseless?
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.840]   Right now, that is the device causing the most pain in my marriage.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.040]   Do you still have one at all?
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.280]   Yeah, they're still in the wall.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:03.760]   Does Andrew do things like Stacy, the Nano leafs are on again?
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:08.080]   OK, two nights ago, four in the morning, they had turned on at 1.30,
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.880]   and I turned them off.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:13.840]   At four in the morning, he pokes me hard in the shoulder.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.480]   And he's like, the Nano leafs are on again.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.160]   He's saying, you're dental lights?
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.640]   As he should.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.480]   Nailed it.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.560]   Yep, yep.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.560]   When Andrew suffers, I--
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.560]   I know.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:36.360]   Have I told you the story of the mattress pad that's cool?
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.040]   I feel your pain, man.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.560]   I really do.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.040]   Please do tell it again.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.560]   You're first to pray it's for eight months.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:46.120]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, because we got to end the show by five.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:46.480]   Y'all.
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.080]   You know it was 10 years ago today?
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:50.920]   Was it so per--
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:51.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.240]   --for the good guys.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.280]   Yeah, I remember--
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:53.920]   I remember this.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.480]   I remember this.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.400]   Well, John, remember we went black and white for the whole day.
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:04.480]   SOPA, which was the Stop Online Privacy Act.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.960]   Privacy.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.520]   Privacy.
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:06.520]   Privacy.
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.040]   Privacy.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:07.040]   Privacy.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.040]   Privacy.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:08.560]   Privacy.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.560]   Privacy.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.560]   Stop online privacy.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.880]   I have in favor of the Stop the Privacy Act.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.360]   Yes.
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:13.360]   What?
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.680]   I just changed.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:18.800]   It was the largest-- even to this day, the largest online protest
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.040]   ever.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:27.160]   SOPA was considering it, but the blackout, which
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.880]   was 24 million people did it.
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.880]   Many sites just went dark.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:35.960]   That was the most how you did it, which is a black page.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.520]   We didn't want to go dark that day.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.640]   So in support, we went to black and white.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:43.640]   We became-- all of our shows were black and white that day,
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:44.800]   which I think was good.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.880]   And we wanted to keep doing it.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.680]   And during the show, say, here's why we're black and white,
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:49.960]   here's what you could do.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.240]   It worked.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.480]   Congress was spooked by the whole thing.
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.880]   They killed the bill in 2012.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.800]   And no significant copyright legislation
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:04.280]   has been introduced in the 10 years since.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.080]   So--
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:08.920]   That was an amazing victory for digital activism.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:13.160]   And it also set the-- it set actually a lot of things
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:18.160]   in motion for how activists deal with issues online.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:22.720]   So it's definitely not just our websites going dark,
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.960]   but even how people communicated about it in Twitter
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.320]   and shared information.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.920]   And remember, they got us to--
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.800]   they set up a bunch of Twilio kind of things
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.400]   where you could automatically dial your congressman
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.040]   and leave message.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:37.480]   I mean--
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.480]   Brilliant.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.440]   It was the--
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.280]   It was well organized.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.200]   Even at the beginning of digital activism,
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:45.160]   but it was a case study that helped--
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.400]   But what is-- what is--
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:52.840]   No, it's a bunch of white geeks fighting for the technology.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:55.280]   Where is the effort to do the same right now for voting
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.360]   rights?
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.120]   Good point.
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.440]   I wish we could see the same kind of mobilization.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:00.920]   Good point.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:07.320]   Now, in its defense, SOPA was a direct attack on the internet.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:10.800]   So it was reasonable for the internet to respond that way.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.600]   But I think you're right.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:14.520]   I think-- I just don't think there's a unity in the same way
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.160]   as the internet had unity over that,
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.280]   in the same way over voting rights.
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:19.080]   I think that's--
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.000]   But I think some leadership could get us there.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.040]   If somebody would stand up--
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:22.800]   Well, I agree.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.440]   We're going to bring a bat signal.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.080]   It's a bat signal.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:29.760]   I'm a-- here's what I-- when they said I watch a TV,
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.720]   and we go, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:32.920]   I just say, you know what?
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.280]   There's only one solution to this,
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.960]   which is elect more Democrats.
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:41.440]   The reason people like Kirsten Cinema and Joe Manchin
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.240]   have so much power is we have a razor thin majority.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.840]   If there were 60 or 70 Democrats in the Senate,
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.080]   this wouldn't be happening.
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.960]   So in a way, this is reflecting the will of the people.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.040]   This is who got elected.
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:54.760]   So--
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.960]   Well, it's-- I mean, OK, but no, we're not going to talk about it.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:08:59.800]   Let's not do this.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:00.600]   It's politics.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.720]   I'm just saying, it's not like--
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.320]   He's already lost under Republicans.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:07.080]   It's not like Joe Biden's blowing it.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.040]   No, I'm just saying--
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.160]   There's 50 Democrats.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.040]   It's not a--
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:14.600]   It's hard to like Democrats because there's
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.960]   gerrymandering.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:18.680]   There's also the fact that it's hard to like to Democrats
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.560]   because no, it's true.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.200]   If you've got two senators and, you know,
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.880]   California sends two and--
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.880]   I understand.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.720]   We have a structural problem.
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:30.960]   The electoral college has broken two, but that's the way it is.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.400]   So if you care about that, Democrats,
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.160]   if this is something that's an issue for you,
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.480]   here's what you do.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:39.520]   You don't say, White House, you do something about it.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.080]   You go out and you elect Democrats.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.080]   You go campaign for them.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.160]   You fund, raise for them.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.760]   And you get them elected because that's
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.880]   the way to solve this.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.160]   That's the way to solve the filler.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.040]   The filibuster just reflects the fact
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.480]   that we don't have a super majority.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.480]   Period.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:54.200]   I shouldn't say wait, they, Democrats,
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.200]   don't have a super majority.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.200]   So that's the solution.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.120]   I mean, it's not--
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.280]   Go out and get people elected.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.040]   That's the way--
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:06.240]   But if you can't give water to the people who vote,
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:08.120]   if they have to wait six hours to vote--
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:12.960]   Look, there's a lot of people trying hard to make this hard
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:13.960]   and unbalanced.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.160]   I understand that.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.280]   You have to overcome that.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.280]   OK.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.840]   But there is a path.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:20.960]   That's the path.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.240]   Instead, people are going, "Wait, wait, wait,"
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:26.600]   and come November of this year,
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.560]   you're going to really be crying when we lose the House
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.840]   and the Senate.
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:33.960]   Yeah, I mean, while media, my damn colleagues
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:37.000]   are presumed-- who should never be allowed
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   to predict the future are just presuming that it's lost
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.160]   because it wasn't the past.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.160]   Right.
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.360]   They didn't predict much.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.680]   They didn't predict much before.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.400]   But usually loses the midterms.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.360]   But I'm saying, "Wah, wah, wah,"
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.640]   is not the answer.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:52.040]   Go out, do something.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.680]   Fund raise, if you care about this, there is a path.
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:56.720]   But you've got to follow it.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.760]   You can't just whine about it and say,
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.800]   well, it's Joe Biden's job to do it.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:02.560]   No action.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.240]   Bernie Sanders is not going to convince
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:08.000]   Kirsten Sinema and Joe Manchin to change.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:08.800]   You know what it is?
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.800]   Who is the voters?
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.840]   So go vote.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.480]   And admittedly, it's an uphill battle
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:18.000]   because of things like the voting rights.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.360]   I think it's an impossible battle.
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.800]   You should look at how Texas, Jerry--
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.480]   Oh my God, it's terrible.
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.280]   Oh, I know, it's terrible.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.280]   I know it's terrible.
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:27.240]   The same structural inequities that are--
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.000]   But that happens because there's a Republican
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.640]   legislature in Texas.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:30.880]   Right.
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.840]   But we have a Republican legislature in Texas
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:40.080]   because the people in certain areas have--
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.200]   the people in liberal areas have half the people--
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.040]   I understand.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:44.800]   --representing them.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.280]   I mean, it's the same structural issue.
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:48.360]   So that's why we went-- why are we talking?
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:48.800]   No.
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.880]   Well, it's a good thing to talk about.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.040]   Let's talk about soap on Pippa.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.160]   This is a really good report.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.400]   I found this in the Tech Took article by Yochai Benkler
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.560]   at the Berkman Center.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.880]   A couple of years after the big protest--
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.360]   Look at this.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:03.800]   This is--
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.520]   There is a book based on this.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:09.080]   Yochai loves these things, these network maps.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:13.440]   This is where the big dots or where the organization happened.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.440]   Look, TechTook's a big dot there, right there.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.240]   There's almost as big as Cnet there.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.080]   So this is-- and Wikipedia went dark.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:20.840]   I remember that.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:21.920]   There's a big deal.
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.920]   Somewhere there's a little dot for Twit here somewhere.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.320]   Somewhere there's this little dot for Giga.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.160]   Oh, my remember.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:27.160]   Giga.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.160]   Playing our coverage.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.160]   There's a point in Boeing.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:32.160]   There's a decade ago.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:32.960]   Hard to believe.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:33.960]   I know.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:38.560]   I remember turning on the stream, just plain as day.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.440]   I can see it right now and just black and white
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.760]   like it happened yesterday.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.920]   That this is the decade ago.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.600]   That's neat.
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.400]   That was a tough decision because I really wanted to support it.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.040]   I really was a strong believer.
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:50.840]   But I also didn't want to go--
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.000]   We also had to talk about it.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   We had to--
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.080]   That's why I did that.
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:57.760]   Yeah, that's what we ended up doing something similar
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:58.440]   because we were like--
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.440]   Put a banner on--
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:00.280]   --in a news site.
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.280]   Right.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:01.280]   Right.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:02.760]   10 years ago--
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:06.200]   I recommend Yochai Bankler's network propaganda, which is--
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.320]   He's great.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.720]   And the wealth of networks--
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.600]   And you know what he does?
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.600]   Well, for the children.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.000]   He offers them for free.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.800]   He's a kind of creative commons download.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.000]   You can buy the book and you should.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.960]   But you can also download it for free if you want.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.920]   At least he did that with the wealth of networks.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.200]   I don't know if he did it with the internet.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.600]   I don't know if it was for the letter one.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.400]   I think that's his policy anyway.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.840]   If the publisher lets you--
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.120]   Hey, big props to I/O.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.000]   Do you know who I/O is?
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.320]   I/O I/O, it's off to work we go.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.120]   This is a court action.
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:45.480]   A landmark-- kind of like the SOPA-PIPA battle--
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:48.360]   a landmark copyright decision.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.760]   I/O is in Hamburg, Germany.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.920]   We've talked about them before.
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:57.400]   They run a number of ad blocking tools, extensions.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.880]   Adblock plus is the best known.
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:07.160]   They went to court over whether--
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:09.160]   I think they're going to court against that.
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.440]   Actual Springer said--
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:11.440]   Actual Springer.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.640]   Actual Springer said--
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:13.240]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.680]   I/O's ad blocking violates our copyright
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:22.680]   because it looks at our HTML on our website.
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.560]   So I/O, to their credit, fought this.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.160]   And this is in Hamburg.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.640]   And I/O won.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:35.520]   This is the 16th time I/O has prevailed against lawsuits
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.800]   and defended the rights of internet users,
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.320]   co-developers, publishers.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:44.240]   In 2021, the lawsuit was brought by Axl Springer,
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.000]   which is the big publisher, right?
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.400]   They publish a lot of stuff.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.000]   Yeah, they all are also the kind of the Fox--
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.680]   They're the Murdoch of Germany.
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:56.080]   Bilt is the very conservative template paper.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.240]   The lawsuit sought to dictate that the HTML language used
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.600]   to render a website page should be protected
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.760]   under copyright law, which would make it illegal for any
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:09.040]   technology or even an individual to change the appearance.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.640]   So if you ever use your own custom CSS
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:14.760]   to make the page look different, if you make the text bigger,
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.080]   is that violating the copyright?
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.040]   Maybe.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:21.080]   Of course, the W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium,
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.480]   and a lot of us believe that that's
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:28.000]   the whole premise of the web is that you should be able to modify
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:28.400]   that.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.040]   I/O's model, though, has always been questionable to me,
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:36.160]   where we block ads, except unless you pay us,
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.520]   and we'll look through it.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.200]   Well, that's why they have the money to fight this.
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:43.520]   So, OK, I don't recommend adblock plus.
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.560]   We always tell everybody use ublock origin.
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.160]   It's free because Gore such the guy--
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.920]   Gore Hill rather the guy who does it.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.440]   Gore such as somebody else.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.840]   The Gore Hill--
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.680]   The guy who does it is kind of cantankerous.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:56.800]   Doesn't want to make money on it.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.080]   He just hates ads.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.960]   So he makes the best ad blocker out there.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.680]   But he has no money, nowhere with all the fight,
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.040]   axial Springer.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.760]   So on the other hand, Springer, I think,
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.080]   understands that I/O is probably much more of a problem
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.280]   for them.
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:14.680]   So the Hamburg court rejected the copyright argument,
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.640]   once again decided, flavor of I/O.
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:21.880]   And thanks to them, you can still use HTML in any way
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:22.760]   you want to.
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.200]   It's still an open standard.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.160]   Thank you.
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:29.800]   And yeah, I/O has this acceptable ad standard thing
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.880]   where we've talked about this before where--
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:32.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.200]   Over the years.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.600]   You know, I understand that's a problem on the one hand,
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:39.800]   but on the other hand, it's because it's
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:42.120]   how they have the money to fight this stuff.
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:44.360]   I actually put the story on the rundown first in German,
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:45.960]   because it's the only version I could find.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.680]   Thank you for finding the version.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.800]   I had bookmarked in this one.
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.320]   The non-German version.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.680]   See, I was on one.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.080]   I had bookmarked in this one.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:53.800]   Maybe it ends up--
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:54.800]   Aagout.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:57.080]   --into English.
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:58.640]   You see crypto.com everywhere.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.640]   Have you seen--
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.200]   And I know you watch football.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.240]   You cannot watch a football game without Matt Damon saying--
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.440]   The fortune favors the brave.
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:11.040]   That commercial confuses the heck out of me every time
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.640]   I watch it, but I'm still more fascinated by the fact
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.560]   that they bought the name and rights to the Coliseum
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.400]   in Los Angeles.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:19.880]   Staple center.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:22.680]   And they are all over F1.
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:23.720]   No one's watching F1.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:24.800]   They got a lot of money.
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:25.960]   No, they got a lot of money.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.200]   Crypto.com.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.200]   It's like, wow.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:33.320]   I have some strong feelings.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.600]   I'm starting to have stronger feelings about NFTs and crypto
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.720]   that it's a scam.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.720]   All in told, it's a scam.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:44.240]   But I know that that will make people yell at me.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.720]   So I won't say it out loud.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.680]   However--
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:51.520]   OK.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:52.280]   I see.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.280]   I was thinking that.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:55.160]   Did I say that out loud?
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.920]   Did you say that?
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:57.920]   It's a scam.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:03.840]   No, because I know that I'm uphill on this one.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.800]   Everybody says, no, it's a great thing,
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.800]   and it's going to change the world.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.560]   I think all it's doing is a big transfer of wealth
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:15.440]   from the suckers into the--
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.480]   From stupid to smart.
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.040]   The bros.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.680]   Stupid bad, the good or good to bad?
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.480]   I don't think stupid and smart is right.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.440]   I think it's suckers and bros.
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:25.800]   Or con men, PT Barnum's.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.720]   And anyway, crypto.com just suffered a hack
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:30.240]   from 50 million--
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.080]   Oh, we've got to talk about my favorite story of the week.
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.760]   Well, let me finish this story, and then we will.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:35.000]   OK, fine.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.400]   Crypto.com just suffered a--
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.840]   I was just explaining the background.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:38.240]   Oh, sorry.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.080]   Yes, I'm sorry.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.400]   I forgot who's the intro.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.760]   It's like a morning joke question that goes on forever.
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:46.760]   Wow.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:50.240]   So much love.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:50.760]   I'm just going to--
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:51.240]   Popcorn.
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.400]   I need my popcorn.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.560]   Oh, so much love.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.200]   I was trying to do my job here.
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.400]   Do you think I'm verbose?
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.600]   Am I-- if I'm verbose?
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.240]   I'm embarrassed that I forgot you were doing a story.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.720]   So I had to--
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.680]   I had to last time.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:06.240]   Jeff was on Twitter while you were doing that, Leo.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.240]   I heard that type of business.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.480]   Jeff lost his train of thought.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.480]   This guy was over-bose and never-studdled.
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.040]   I was totally over-bose.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.200]   What is it, my turn?
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:14.800]   I don't care.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:15.960]   I don't even like this story.
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.560]   What's your story, Jeff?
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.480]   You know, it's just the related one.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.280]   It's the dune guys, the dune doors.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.120]   Oh, I love this story.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:26.680]   OK, this is what I can really dig my teeth into.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:29.160]   So you know what a doubt is?
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:30.400]   The really--
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:34.600]   A D-A-O is--
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.200]   DURPS.
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.280]   --dirps and--
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.800]   DURPS and DURBERS.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.800]   No, it's distributed-- anyway, it's the idea of the first doubt--
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.280]   Oh, no, decentralized autonomous organization.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:45.440]   --stentialized organization.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.440]   It's a decentralized autonomous organization, which
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.600]   is basically a group of people get together
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.480]   to try to raise money.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.120]   The first one I heard about was to buy
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.560]   the Constitution, a copy of the Constitution, the Constitution
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:55.160]   Dow.
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:01.600]   Well, this summarizes the whole problem.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:07.120]   So there was a Dow put together to buy a copy of Dune,
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:07.760]   the book.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:14.240]   It's called the Spice Dow, because as you know in Dune,
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.440]   it's all about the spice.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:20.720]   They raised--
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:21.680]   Keep going.
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:29.000]   They raised 2.26 million euros for to buy a book.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.240]   There's the book, a rare copy, I guess--
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.640]   A Lieutenant copies extent.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:34.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:37.560]   It's not even Frank Herbert's Dune.
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:41.640]   It's like some sort of graphic novel or something.
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:45.320]   So their goal now-- they raised all this money
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:47.920]   from all these suckers-- I mean contributors--
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:49.520]   their goal is to make the book public--
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:52.560]   to the extent permitted by law, which is none.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.800]   Yeah, well, that's--
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.040]   They edited that.
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.040]   "Reduce an original animated, limited series
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.800]   inspired by the book and sell it to a streaming service
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.680]   support to revision products from the community."
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:04.080]   They apparently think that if you buy a book--
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.520]   like if you go to the bookstore and you
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.080]   buy a copy of the latest Danielle Steele novel,
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.560]   that you have now the rights to make a movie out of it,
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:17.200]   it doesn't work that way.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.240]   But apparently--
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.480]   I didn't really-- I thought that was people making fun of--
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:22.200]   I didn't actually think that's what they thought.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.560]   That's actually what they thought.
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.560]   Yeah, that's real tough.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.160]   People looked into it.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:25.840]   Yep.
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:28.600]   But-- but-- because I thought--
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.480]   there were actually two stories that were done early
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.960]   on this, I forget which one I put in the Kotaku.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:38.840]   There was also a BuzzFeed version that
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:41.920]   linked to another report that said that, well,
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.680]   after this guy supposedly put in three million euros of his own
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.080]   to prime the pump here and get it going,
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:50.720]   then he supposedly raised something like 12 million euros
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:52.400]   to make the damn movie.
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:57.520]   So the question is, was this to prove your point, Leo,
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:00.880]   just a front to raise a lot of money from a lot of idiots?
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:04.240]   This is Alejandro Jodorowski, who
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:08.120]   is, according to BuzzFeed, legendary.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.120]   What?
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.120]   I don't know.
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:11.600]   Yeah, I'm like--
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:15.080]   So they have apparently liberated--
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:18.080]   they raised the money and liberated
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:22.560]   his Bible for a movie, which was never produced.
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:27.360]   Orson Welles was going to play the Baron Harkonnen.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.720]   Mick Jagger had signed on.
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:29.920]   I'm not sure for which part.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.760]   Pink Floyd had agreed to do the music.
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:36.200]   And Salvador Dali would play the emperor of the universe.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:41.800]   By the way, Dali's fee was $100,000 per minute of screen time.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:44.240]   He printed 20 luxurious volumes,
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:47.400]   detailing the screenplay, illustrations, and designs.
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.840]   He called it "Directors Bible."
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:50.800]   That's commonplace the TV show.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.760]   You make a Bible, which is kind of like everything
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.000]   you need to know about this.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.400]   The studio said, nah, nah, nah.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.120]   And the film was never made.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.240]   There have been other adaptations, as you know.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.080]   Over time, the Bibles--
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:04.760]   this is the BuzzFeed story--
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:08.160]   attained almost religious status among reverendials,
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.600]   scholars, and sci-fi obsessives.
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.080]   It vanished from the public eye until this November,
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:18.040]   when number five of the 20 came up for auction at Christie's.
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:20.920]   Appraisers thought it would sell for $40,000.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:25.480]   They never heard of Bitcoin, baby.
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:28.040]   The winning bid, $2.9 billion--
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:28.880]   I'm sorry, million.
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.680]   It should have been billion.
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:31.600]   Million.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:35.040]   Placed by Sobon Sakeb, he's a 25-year-old cryptocurrency
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.080]   nerd, NFT collector.
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.680]   And this is the most important part-- freshly
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:43.120]   minted millionaire from Woodland, California.
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:46.600]   He says, this is pretty much my entire liquid net worth.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.040]   But I front of the three million knowing
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.800]   that the community has my back.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:54.800]   The community is the Spiced Dow, this cryptocurrency,
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:24:00.000]   distributed autonomous organization.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.200]   So apparently, by the way, a week later, they went back
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:06.040]   and said, we need $6 million to buy--
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.080]   That's the thing.
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.000]   --to buy the buy.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:09.520]   Buy it.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.280]   Copy right, lawyer.
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:12.400]   Another $2.2 million to make an animated film
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.080]   inspired by the vision.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.400]   I guess that makes sense.
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:18.600]   If Jadarovsky is behind this, he's saying, yeah, yeah, it's OK.
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.400]   You make the movie.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:23.400]   He probably is one who has the copyright for it.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:24.640]   Well, but he doesn't have the copyright for--
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.000]   He doesn't have the copyright for Dune.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000]   Oh, well, so call it June or Spoon.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.200]   June or--
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:32.640]   And I was more lawyer.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.040]   The Spice Chronicles.
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.760]   The Spice Chronicles.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:38.320]   The Pepper Chronicles.
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:38.960]   The Book of Spice--
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.560]   With the Spice Boys.
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:40.960]   Spice Boys.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:41.960]   The Spice Boys.
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.680]   This is not Sobey's first NFT.
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:50.800]   He sold in August an NFT that looks like Odell Beckham
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:55.440]   Jr. He sold it to Adecco Eldell Beckham Jr, who
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.840]   was on the LA Rams.
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:57.600]   Unbelievable.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.760]   Himself for $2.7 million worth of the--
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.880]   This really got the $2.7 million.
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:06.080]   It was a crypto punk of Ode BJ.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:12.880]   I know, Aunt, you have NFTs, and I don't want to rent on your product.
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.400]   No, no, no, sir.
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:17.120]   I've said before, I have a love-hate relationship with it.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.840]   I know you're not scamming anybody at all.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:20.840]   No.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:24.240]   It's-- I look at stuff like this, and it just--
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:25.640]   It burns me up.
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.480]   It grows for me.
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.800]   Yet, then there's a lot of other artists out there
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:32.080]   that are making some unbelievable art and are getting
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.040]   stiffed.
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:36.480]   But yet, somebody just throws eight pixels on the screen,
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.840]   and it's popular.
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.760]   Really?
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:44.240]   When you pay gas money, who's pocket--
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.240]   The miners.
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.240]   Who's pocket is that?
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.480]   That's the miners.
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:52.160]   So this is-- one of the elements of crypto
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.640]   is that not only does the initial coin have to be mined
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:00.440]   by a computer or a bunch of computers
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:04.600]   doing hard math problems, but it also, all transactions,
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:08.120]   have to be registered in the blockchain by a miner.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.560]   So miners can do either.
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.680]   They can-- or both, and many do.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:14.080]   And you make money for either.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.400]   In the case of mining, you get the crypto.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.600]   In the case of verifying transactions,
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.080]   putting transactions in the blockchain,
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.880]   you get paid some crypto.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:27.320]   And often, if you notice when you do a transaction--
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.880]   I've seen this with Bitcoin-- you
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:31.800]   can decide how fast you want that transaction to occur.
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:35.160]   And if you are willing to pay more Bitcoin to do it,
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.000]   you'll transaction will occur quickly.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.400]   Bitcoin is very sluggish.
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.400]   And so sometimes the transaction might--
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.520]   Usually half an hour.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:42.960]   Or days, even.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:44.880]   Maybe it's down to half an hour now.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:47.400]   So that really-- so in other words,
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.440]   if you don't pay anything, it may take days or may never
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:51.080]   be registered.
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.200]   So I think it's honestly--
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:27:00.160]   Personally, I'm looking at some of the other options.
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:00.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.760]   The people who cheerlead this are, I think, mostly people
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.720]   who stand and make money for it probably.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:08.480]   And it's a very much--
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.480]   And it's a very much insane--
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:15.120]   That the people who own, say, NFTs
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:18.720]   can't say this is bunk because the whole premise is
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:22.360]   they got to find somebody else who pay more than they paid for it.
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.720]   So they've got to promote it up.
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:27.680]   So it's kind of this ginned up propaganda.
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:29.120]   It's a bubble.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.680]   I've moved my stuff.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.720]   Well, I'm still in the process of moving it all.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:36.440]   I'm trying to move it to something beyond ethereum
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:39.840]   and all of that gas stuff because there's
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.960]   other protocols out there that are a lot cheaper and people
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:43.720]   are still in the art.
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:44.640]   Or what about an art?
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.480]   I will sell you a print of my photo.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.480]   I do that too.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.840]   That-- I mean--
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:50.560]   Sorry, I didn't--
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.000]   --the number.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.800]   That seems to be an honest--
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:55.440]   relatively honest transaction to me.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.640]   I do that too.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.960]   Yeah, signed and numbered, and now you have it.
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:01.880]   And maybe you don't have the provenance of this photo
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:04.840]   on your blockchain so you can't prove it signed and numbered
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.000]   by Aunt Pruitt.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.560]   But I don't think that's the end of the world.
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:09.680]   At least you have the photo you could put on your wall.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.480]   All right.
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:15.000]   And the thing is my audience or slash customers
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.400]   or what have you are the people that
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.240]   could care less about blockchain authenticity.
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.040]   If it says it came from me, they're probably happy.
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:25.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.840]   I think honestly, if you're a big dune fan,
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:31.040]   you might want to own this book and have it on your coffee
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:32.400]   table.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:32.960]   Awesome.
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:35.520]   Now, for only a few hundred dollars,
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:42.040]   you can own a link to something.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:43.320]   You don't-- what?
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:44.440]   I don't know.
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.200]   You own the right to resell the link, which
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.240]   is I think what this is all about.
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:50.600]   Anyway.
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:53.680]   Again, it's a love-hate relationship for me
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:57.920]   because I do like the idea that artists can continue
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:03.200]   to have another revenue stream for their work.
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:07.040]   But at the same time, it can cost that artist a lot of money
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.160]   and a lot of headache.
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:10.400]   And then there's ways of getting ripped off
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:12.920]   with just people right clicking and downloading
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:18.640]   or the hack, as we saw, on Crypto.com.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:24.640]   But art is stolen and pirated or what have you
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:27.880]   in regular life outside of the digital world.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:30.240]   So the risk are there either way you look at it.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.200]   Oh, that's true.
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.840]   What's cool is, Sakib actually bought the physical book.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.320]   He has the book now.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:37.920]   And it sounds awesome.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:44.880]   It's got illustrations by H.R. Geiger and Mobius and Jean
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:45.960]   Giro-- that's Jean Giro.
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:48.000]   And so, I mean, it's really--
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:48.840]   This is a real--
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:52.320]   Who was bidding against him to get to that price?
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:52.800]   I don't know.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:53.280]   But I could say--
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.200]   How did that process happen?
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:57.360]   If you love these guys and you love dune, this is historic.
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.640]   And there's only 20 of them.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.560]   So it has value.
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.800]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:03.400]   Christie's-- Well, it has scarcity.
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:04.040]   Scarcity's.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:07.360]   Christie's thought it'd be worth $40,000, not 2.000.
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.840]   So how did it get from there?
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:11.320]   I mean, what-- I'll bid $5.
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:12.800]   I would have bid $2.6 million.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.520]   Is there another Dow?
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:15.400]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:20.680]   It's-- I think everybody-- when I love about the stories,
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:22.640]   everybody's looking at it and say, no, they can't be that stupid.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.600]   No, they can't be.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.960]   So either they are that stupid or it's a scam--
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:29.360]   I am almost as stupid.
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:29.880]   You don't know.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:33.080]   I think-- after reading the BuzzFeed story,
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:35.200]   I think it's a little bit misrepresented
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.040]   that they thought, oh, good.
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.400]   Now we can make this movie.
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:41.040]   I don't-- I think they must have known better.
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.040]   But on the other hand, now they want to raise more money
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:45.320]   to make the movie.
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:47.320]   But--
[01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:48.760]   Mm.
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:50.320]   Anyway, I don't know.
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:53.920]   Look, if you want to throw your money away, go right ahead.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:57.400]   There's worse things to do with your money.
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:58.800]   There are also better things.
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.640]   And there are much better things.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:01.920]   You could buy some nanometers.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:04.000]   You could-- yeah, exactly.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.440]   Wait, no, no, that's not an option.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:08.360]   You could-- you could annoy your husband.
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:09.840]   It's close to Stacy.
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.360]   Let's take-- you know, probably hers.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.720]   Let's take a bit.
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.840]   Hey, I do want to tell you about something that everybody--
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:18.080]   now that we are-- you know, in-- what is this?
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:20.640]   Year two?
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:22.760]   Oh, my god.
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:25.360]   It soon will be year three, won't it?
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:27.360]   When you're-- if you have people going back to work,
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:31.040]   of course, you want to have your huddle room well-equipped
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:31.920]   for meetings.
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:35.600]   You don't want to have to make people sit side by side.
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:38.800]   You want to be able to have people socially distance.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:41.920]   But this means your audio suffers, doesn't it?
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:43.320]   No, it doesn't.
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:47.920]   Because Noreva solves this problem.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:50.000]   Normally, I mean, I think if you've ever set up
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.720]   a big audio conferencing room, especially the big ones,
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:56.040]   the larger ones, you realize how expensive it can be.
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:57.680]   You've got to get-- you've got to design it.
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:01.360]   You've got to hire a team to install it, technicians
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:04.760]   to configure it, a dizzying array of mic speakers,
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:08.000]   DSPs, and then there's the wires.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.680]   And it's just-- you know, it's just crazy.
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:11.640]   Your room will be offline for days
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.760]   and will have to be regularly calibrated.
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:16.480]   Noreva is so much better.
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:18.280]   They have something they've patented
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:20.880]   called the Microphone Mist Technology.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.880]   All it takes is one or-- depending on the size of room--
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:26.120]   one or two integrated microphone and speaker bars--
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.760]   they fill the room with thousands of virtual microphones.
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:30.320]   There's no dead zones.
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.760]   Everyone in the room could be heard,
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.880]   no matter which way they're facing.
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:36.480]   It means people can talk and move naturally in the space.
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:38.080]   They can socially distance.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:41.280]   You don't have to sterilize microphones or anything.
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.080]   Because it's all in this sound bar, which you, by the way,
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:44.720]   can mount.
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:47.520]   You don't need some fancy guy coming in.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.000]   You can just hang it up on the wall yourself.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.240]   Noreva's sound microphone is technology.
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:55.640]   Continuously auto-calibrates.
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:59.320]   So your room is instantly and always ready with optimized audio.
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:01.360]   You don't need an outside technician.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.840]   This installation is trivially easy.
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.800]   You can do it yourself.
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:08.880]   Or you can get your handy guy to come in and do it.
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:10.160]   It's a simple thing.
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:11.480]   Management's simple, too.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:13.360]   You get an Noreva console.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.520]   So you have multiple Noreva rooms.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:18.080]   You can monitor, manager, adjust the systems.
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.560]   You don't even have to be on site.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.600]   So IT doesn't have to go from room to room.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.120]   They can do it all remotely if they need to.
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:26.360]   So look, this is the installation.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:28.200]   In fact, you should go to the website and find out all about it.
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:31.240]   N-U-R-E-V-A.com.
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:33.600]   N-U-R-E-V-A.com.
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.520]   By the way, it's also an attractive solution.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:37.640]   It's kind of magic when people come into the conference room
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.320]   and they'll say, where are the mics?
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:41.520]   Where should I talk to?
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.640]   Which way should I face?
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:44.320]   Any way that you're comfortable.
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:47.080]   Because you're going to be clearly heard no matter where you are.
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:47.800]   Ask yourself.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:51.880]   Do you want to go with that costly, crazy, complicated, traditional system
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:55.320]   or make the leap to the simple and economical Noreva?
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:57.320]   I think I know the answer.
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:33:59.280]   N-U-R-E-V-A.
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:01.560]   Noreva.com.
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.040]   N-U-R-E-V-A.
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:04.600]   Noreva.com.
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:08.880]   What a great way to get that huddle room sounding good.
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:11.320]   And you know I'm all about good sound.
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:13.720]   Really important.
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:19.480]   And who of us hasn't had a horrible experience with the phone
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.600]   in the middle of the table?
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.680]   I mean, you can do better.
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.680]   Noreva.com.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:30.440]   Thank you, Noreva, for supporting our fine program.
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:31.280]   We talked about--
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:32.240]   Go ahead.
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:32.800]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.320]   You just saying, woohoo.
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:40.960]   I'm so used to Jeff saying line 29 that I thought--
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:42.480]   Can I go back to the DURPS for one second?
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.720]   Yes, the DURPS, Dow DURPS.
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:48.800]   So the Dow DURPS, because I happen to look at Twitter,
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:51.160]   even though I'm not allowed to, I did.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.760]   There's a guy named Mike Dunford, who's a lawyer,
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:54.840]   who's trying to give them advice.
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:57.120]   And one thing I had-- what angle I had thought of here
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:01.200]   is the tax situation.
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:03.000]   He says that you made an agreement
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.480]   to raise money under certain promises.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.760]   And that gives you all kinds of legal issues.
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:07.560]   That's one.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.560]   The other one that occurs to me is somebody now
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:11.600]   got a whole bunch of money.
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:16.040]   And doesn't that somebody owe a whole bunch of money?
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:17.400]   I don't know.
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:18.520]   I guess so.
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:21.000]   Christie's, I guess, and whoever--
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.880]   Buying and holding art is subject to different tax
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.560]   arrangements, because it's considered a collectible.
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.400]   Oh.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:33.120]   So collectibles-- and don't ask me what the rules are,
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:34.120]   because I don't remember.
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:36.160]   But collectibles, they're different for inheritance
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:36.800]   taxes.
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.440]   They're different when you buy it.
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.240]   Yeah.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:40.600]   Have fun.
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:41.200]   OK.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:47.120]   By the way, if you do go to forum.spicedow.xyz,
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:49.200]   you can read what they're proposing to do.
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:54.200]   One of the things is to upload individual pages
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:56.400]   so that the ownership is democratized
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.400]   and then burn the books.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:35:59.400]   Yeah, that's--
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:35:59.900]   No.
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:00.400]   No.
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.120]   That's a bad idea.
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:02.960]   Never burn anything.
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:02.960]   Well--
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.480]   Anything that involves burning a book--
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:05.480]   It is optional.
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:06.720]   It is optional.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:07.720]   You don't have to.
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:13.720]   It's like taking a Gutenberg Bible, cutting it up into pieces,
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:16.160]   making zero axis of it, and then burning it.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:18.840]   Here, by the way, is the--
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:21.840]   it's both a meme and a bell curve.
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:25.880]   The meme and bell curve of what people want to do,
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.840]   of course, on the thin ends of the bell curve,
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:31.040]   burn the book and burning achieves many goals at once
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:32.640]   in the middle, the fat wedge.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:35.880]   No, you cannot burn the book, which is our single asset.
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:37.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.760]   [SNIFFLING]
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:42.240]   But that's only 34%.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:44.080]   So it's definitely--
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:46.520]   we got a ways to go.
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:47.520]   All right, thank you for that.
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:55.360]   A one megabyte page would cost 177M gas approximately,
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:02.800]   which at a cost of 100 GWEIs per gas results in 18 ETH per page.
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:04.960]   I'd bark too.
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:05.460]   It's--
[01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:06.000]   Thank you, biscuit.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.640]   That's the gas fees are 18 ETH.
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:10.440]   That's cray-cray.
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:19.760]   Oh, and the guy who wrote this is, of course, anonymous.
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:22.960]   Pseudo-anon, X-E-E, postdoc in a university,
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:29.160]   now full-time and crypto, inventor of JPEG mining.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:32.320]   JPEG mining.
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:33.360]   I'm sorry, I shouldn't--
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:34.520]   Wow.
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:35.800]   It's the wave of the future.
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:38.120]   Lucky students who don't have that person anymore.
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:39.680]   How's your word will score, Jeff?
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:42.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:44.960]   Get them fired up now.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:46.720]   I thought I blocked that word everywhere.
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:48.840]   You got it in three?
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:51.640]   I would have got it in three, but I
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:54.800]   guessed the less obvious version of the word,
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.000]   and I got it in five.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:56.840]   I should have got it in four.
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:01.040]   I'd rather see you do user interface than this.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:02.760]   OK, let's do user interface.
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:08.880]   You said it, not me.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.400]   Let's see, what else?
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:18.280]   Oh, this is another one, kind of like the other one.
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:20.400]   An Austrian watchdog--
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:23.320]   I think that would be pronounced a watchdog.
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:24.240]   How do you say watchdog?
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:26.240]   Oh, that was Hunt.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:27.080]   Hunt.
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:29.880]   An Austrian Hunt dog.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:31.040]   No, what's his dog?
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:32.520]   Hunt.
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:33.760]   Hunt this one.
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:36.160]   So what's a Vachunt?
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.280]   Ah, OK, I don't know.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.280]   Anywhere looking up?
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.880]   A Venus-Nitzel.
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:44.640]   An Austrian Venus-Nitzel rules.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:47.280]   German company's use of Google Analytics.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.200]   Vachunt.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:48.680]   Vachunt.
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:49.960]   A Vachunt.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:50.960]   A Vachunt.
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:51.360]   A Vachunt.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.800]   I'm watching your Hunt.
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:59.520]   Is breaking GDPR because it sends data to the US.
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:00.960]   Where the government might get it.
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.280]   Thanks to Shrimms 2, which is the--
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.480]   It's UUS data sharing rule.
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:11.120]   The Austrian data protection, Vachunt,
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:14.640]   has ruled that you can't use Google Analytics
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:18.320]   because it sends data to the US.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:20.080]   It's getting ridiculous.
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:21.680]   It's a violation of GDPR.
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:25.520]   Isn't that fair?
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.480]   This is maturation of an industry, y'all.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.080]   This is what happens.
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:30.600]   Do we still use Google Analytics?
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:35.760]   I tried, I tried really hard to convince management here
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:38.080]   not to use Google Analytics on.
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:40.960]   She said not until you fix the band.
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:43.240]   Management is going to come run in here again
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:45.080]   and start throwing things at you.
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.400]   There's more than one person in management.
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.400]   I tried to convince them that we should not
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:52.320]   have good old analytics on our web page because who cares--
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:53.840]   Like Mike Masnick, who got rid of the--
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:55.760]   Yeah, that's when I try.
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:57.080]   I said, look, what-- see, Mike did this,
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.600]   and I think it's the right thing to do.
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:39:59.160]   And no.
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:03.520]   So now maybe we have to because we don't want to violate GDPR.
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:05.520]   You're not in Europe.
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.320]   They're what are they going to do to arrest you?
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:08.320]   Oh, OK.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.160]   So that's a good point.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:10.760]   No, fine you.
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:12.760]   But that's an interesting point.
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:15.960]   Should I say, if you're in Europe, you can't look at our site?
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:16.960]   That's what I was going to ask.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:19.520]   We have European listeners.
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:22.240]   Well, that happens with a lot of news sites
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:22.960]   where they just--
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:23.760]   They just--
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:24.760]   They block Europe.
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:26.840]   So you're not-- you're worth nothing to us.
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.720]   You're dead to us.
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:31.040]   It makes sense for the Chicago Tribune.
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.840]   I mean, given their--
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:36.600]   Well, we went GDPR when an action a year ago--
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:39.400]   it's been a year now.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.600]   We had this debate.
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.000]   Well, wasn't it January?
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.320]   Maybe it was last 29.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:47.720]   So GDPR went into effect May 18th on 20th.
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:48.240]   Oh, good.
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.080]   You know this?
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.280]   19 or 2.
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:51.280]   I think it's just--
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.000]   She's the ring.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000]   Watching the universe.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.840]   But in ocean, this is definitely April.
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:56.200]   Definitely April.
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:56.760]   Wow.
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:57.360]   Oh, you see.
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.280]   Wow.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.280]   No, I--
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.280]   You ain't going to get a whole life.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.320]   I could be-- let me just double check that.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.960]   No, no, I take you as my--
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.760]   In effect.
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:06.560]   I thought it was--
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:07.680]   May 25th, 2018.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:10.000]   So May 25th, 2018.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.040]   So it'll be three--
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:11.960]   It'll be four years.
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:12.480]   That's amazing.
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:13.800]   That's amazing.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:16.760]   Anyway, at that time, we thought, well, what should we do?
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:21.560]   And you know the shruggy guy?
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:24.480]   All right.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.320]   That's what we decided to do.
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:27.080]   Oh, here.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.120]   There's a new thing.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.160]   All of us shruggin'.
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:33.400]   And?
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:34.520]   It can't shruggin'.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:37.360]   Take the screenshot and produce.
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:38.640]   He's very hard to do it.
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:40.040]   He is really multitasking.
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:41.960]   He's producing the show.
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.120]   He's doing it.
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:43.760]   It's like the--
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:47.720]   Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:48.680]   So I don't--
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:55.000]   That was good.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000]   He turned into those--
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:56.680]   Was all on the moment.
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:58.560]   Just played these Stacey Flailing Arms.
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:00.680]   He's turning this Stacey.
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:02.000]   Search Engine Land.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.960]   What happened, they say, when we turned off AMP.
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:08.880]   AMP, of course, the Google technology,
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:11.640]   we've gone back and forth over the years,
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:13.160]   intended to speed up pages.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:16.120]   But I think lately we've realized maybe also intended
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:20.040]   to kind of centralize Google's control of the internet.
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.520]   Search Engine Land made the decision
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.880]   to stop publishing AMP versions.
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:27.840]   Google's accelerated mobile pages.
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:30.280]   They said, just, you know, we didn't
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:32.000]   want to have to put our content at third party
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.800]   service, et cetera.
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:35.360]   So since then, a lot has happened.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:38.160]   But bottom line is, according to Search Engine Land,
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:41.120]   we've seen very little disruption in our traffic.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:42.920]   And now, have a much clearer picture
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:44.160]   of our audience analytics.
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:51.440]   Sometimes, using that middleman, not great.
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:52.440]   That's what I want to know.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.960]   How do they get a better vision?
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:57.160]   Well, with AMP, everything comes off their server.
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:57.720]   It's all cached.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:58.560]   Going through other servers.
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:42:59.360]   That was just cached.
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:42:59.720]   Got it.
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.720]   Gotcha.
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:03.920]   Which has speed up things, but it also centralizes
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:04.800]   control in Google.
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:07.520]   And at the time, Google said, oh, no, it's an open standard.
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:10.120]   Anybody can run AMP servers, and nobody else runs AMP.
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:11.160]   Nobody's done it, right?
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:12.000]   Right.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.720]   Chat room does the shrug.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:16.920]   I love our RSE.
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.840]   Shruggy.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:21.960]   Google kills YouTube originals.
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:24.960]   Did you know that they had originals?
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:25.960]   Sure you did.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:27.760]   Because Cobra Kai was also--
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:28.640]   I was just kidding.
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:30.000]   Only when I knew it was Cobra Kai.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.040]   Yeah.
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:32.720]   Huh?
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:33.480]   What, Jeff?
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:34.880]   Your PewDiePie has gone.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:35.400]   Oh, no.
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:36.760]   Your PewDiePie.
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:39.000]   So that was basically-- there were two.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.160]   There was more than two.
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:43.640]   But that, honestly, I think Google's probably
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:48.280]   right to shudder it, because anyway, according to Variety,
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:51.120]   this YouTube Originals division founded six years ago
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:54.280]   to make exclusive original content for the Pay Per Month
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:55.600]   YouTube Premium service.
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:56.480]   I do pay for that.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.760]   But that's not because I want to see Cobra Kai.
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:00.800]   It's because I don't want to add.
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.800]   Now the group is being shuttered in YouTube's head
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:04.320]   of original content.
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:08.400]   Suzanne Daniels has announced she's leaving in March.
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:12.040]   So that was the whole pitch at--
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:12.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:14.640]   What's the conference I used to go to in Anaheim
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:16.640]   with all the video people in the mid-con?
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:18.400]   Thank you, VidCon.
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:19.680]   That was a big deal at VidCon.
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:21.880]   Oh my god, the huge banners were going to--
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:22.800]   it could be the new network.
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:24.960]   And then never mind.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:25.800]   It's funny.
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:26.760]   This is everybody else--
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.520]   Everybody else started doing original content too.
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:31.240]   So it helped them.
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:33.400]   It was stiff competition out there.
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:36.520]   Remember when Google had $100 million
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:38.480]   that they were going to give creators?
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:39.880]   They've done that a couple of times.
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:41.040]   Creators fund.
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:43.800]   TikTok does it.
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:46.360]   Instagram's starting to do it now.
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:48.920]   And I remember we were told--
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:52.240]   we had a big time entertainment attorney in here.
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:54.560]   He said, you guys really ought to go after that Google money.
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:57.920]   You could-- they could give you $10 million.
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:02.760]   But here's from Robert.
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:05.360]   Is it-- we've had this conversation many times.
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.720]   KYNCL.
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:08.560]   Kinkle.
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:09.120]   Dear creators.
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:11.040]   Good question.
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:12.200]   I think you know him.
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:13.760]   Don't you, Jeff?
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.480]   Consum-- yeah, I've met him.
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:17.600]   Yeah, I hate to think of a doubles, I think.
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:18.960]   He's chief business officer.
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:21.440]   Yeah.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:24.800]   You mean it's a third economic form?
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:26.400]   Those days are overstacy.
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:28.840]   I'm just not on the knees not to invite--
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:31.520]   We got a Davos and a Gutenberg in this show.
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:32.360]   I'm liking it.
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:33.840]   And a few anecdotes.
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:36.320]   There's your bingo card.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:38.640]   Jarvis Bingo.
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:40.720]   Today says Robert.
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:43.120]   There are over 2 million creators in the YouTube Partner
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:43.960]   Program.
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:46.600]   Our creator of community has never been more successful.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:51.000]   We've paid more than $30 billion to creators, artists,
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.120]   and media companies.
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:56.000]   Oh, probably more to the media companies
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.120]   than to the creators.
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:58.120]   I'm guessing.
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:45:59.320]   So they don't sue us, yeah.
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.200]   Things like license fees.
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:05.280]   However, with rapid growth--
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:07.640]   this is going to be fun.
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:10.840]   However, as soon as I see that in the memo, we're going,
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:12.360]   oh, this should be interesting.
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:17.160]   However, with rapid growth comes new opportunities.
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:20.120]   And now our investments can make a greater impact
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:25.480]   on even more creators when applied to other initiatives,
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:29.520]   like our Creative Shorts Fund.
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:33.120]   Is this for people who have new design ideas for shorts?
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:34.960]   Underwear, yeah.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:37.400]   Black Voices Fund, that's good.
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:40.200]   Live shopping programming.
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:41.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:42.840]   Oh, no.
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:43.720]   Oh, no.
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:45.840]   Live shopping is a big deal.
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:46.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:47.320]   It makes over the world.
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:52.760]   But in the case of YouTube, what are you shopping for?
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:53.280]   I don't know.
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:54.000]   Makeup.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:54.480]   Let me see.
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.560]   Slime.
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:56.240]   Humbly.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:57.400]   Jewelry.
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:58.520]   Do they have ours?
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:00.400]   Do they have a live shopping channel?
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:00.960]   What do they call it?
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:02.840]   Brick or brat?
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:03.440]   Brick or brat?
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:04.000]   Brick or brat?
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000]   Oh.
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.200]   Humbl-- Humbl figurines.
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:07.880]   It's the Humbl--
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:09.640]   No, my friend--
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:12.040]   A friend of mine used to do it in China,
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:15.160]   because that's where this kind of concept, I think--
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:16.760]   I don't know if it came from there, but--
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:17.120]   QVC says--
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:19.680]   It's influencers, right, selling stuff that they--
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:20.800]   I would guess.
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:21.880]   YouTube, Monte--
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:23.240]   Katchuae Pepe.
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:24.160]   YouTube, here it is.
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:24.720]   I know it's--
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:25.560]   Katchuae Pepe.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:28.920]   YouTube.com/shopping, it says.
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:30.520]   And there's nothing there.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:33.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:33.920]   What?
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:35.560]   Nothing but growth, then, Leo?
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:36.400]   There's nothing.
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:39.160]   Do you remember the beta store?
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:40.280]   Do you remember the beta store?
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:41.160]   They're doing shopping.
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:43.600]   If you go to their website, they do live shopping now
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:45.160]   for gadgets.
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:46.440]   What's the beta store?
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:47.920]   It's beta store.
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:49.680]   Brick or-- OK, the beta store, it
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:51.960]   was created by some of the founders of Nest.
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:54.880]   And they had physical stores where
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:59.000]   you could go in and touch complicated products
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.720]   and play with them and then buy them if you wanted to.
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:02.400]   And it was more--
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:02.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:03.880]   That was--
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:04.440]   Was that--
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:06.440]   Was that the-- like, the come on?
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:09.240]   Come in and touch complicated products.
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:12.520]   Well, no, that's the Stacey Real Talk right there.
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:13.400]   I like it.
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:17.440]   And companies would pay-- it was like a marketing expense
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:20.120]   for companies, not like a retail strategy for them,
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:20.920]   if that makes sense.
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:21.920]   Although they did sell--
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:23.520]   We're shopping right now.
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:27.640]   Here's the VAC1 Coffee Air Brewer, a complicated product
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:30.280]   to make a simple drink.
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.920]   Yeah, so they've pivoted to doing video shopping
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:33.480]   because of the beta store.
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:35.360]   You'll be buying one before the show is over.
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:36.360]   Yeah, they got the right--
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:36.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:37.640]   --that guy.
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:39.200]   Look at that.
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:44.560]   Oh, she's doing the universal sign for Chef's Kiss.
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:45.680]   Water should drop, yes.
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:47.480]   Water should drop.
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:48.720]   Oh, my god.
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:52.000]   We went to a fancy Michelin 2-star restaurant
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.400]   a couple of months ago, or maybe a month ago.
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:56.640]   It was my birthday present from Lisa.
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:01.880]   And they had the most elaborate Victorian era coffee
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:05.600]   making machine I've ever seen.
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:07.160]   It was like a show.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:10.160]   They have this vacuum tubes and these chambers,
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:12.080]   and they pour water in there.
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:14.320]   And then they turn it upside down and it goes,
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:16.760]   siphon's up into the thing, and then you wait,
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:19.920]   and then you pull the thing and it siphons back down.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:21.320]   And now you have coffee.
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:22.840]   And it tastes exactly like--
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:25.760]   Oh, man.
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:26.720]   Like a little--
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:27.640]   Maxwell house.
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:28.760]   Like a Maxwell house.
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:29.360]   It was a fine--
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:29.880]   Oh, no.
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:30.800]   --funky.
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:33.360]   And even the guy who's doing it, like the waiter's doing it,
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:35.760]   it's like 10 minute process he's doing this whole thing.
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:37.880]   Even he says, yeah, it's just kind of for fun.
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:41.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.880]   I think this might be the modern version
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:46.920]   of this VAC 1 coffee air brewer.
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:49.480]   I think it's the same idea where it's using--
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:50.800]   yeah, it is.
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:51.480]   Well, it's brought out.
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:53.400]   They have other products.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:53.900]   OK.
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:56.400]   So Willow toothbrush FAQ.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:00.360]   Oh, I need this, the Navy in bed warmer.
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.360]   Oh.
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:01.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.320]   Now that I have a bed cooler--
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:03.880]   Does it have--
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.040]   I should really have a bed warmer.
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:08.560]   --a bed warmer because, you know, what goes--
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:09.200]   How does that work?
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:11.520]   Microwave your head?
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:12.600]   Oh, it's exactly like--
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:13.600]   It's a bedside table.
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:14.680]   It's exactly like that.
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:16.360]   It's just a small version.
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:17.720]   It's got a little water pumper.
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:22.800]   But instead of-- this is exactly what the sleep looks like.
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:26.840]   But it just goes into a little pillow instead of the old bed.
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:27.240]   Here's--
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:27.920]   Just buy an electric blanket.
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:29.360]   Here's something I could get.
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.480]   The hypnosis-- oh, I'm sorry--
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:33.160]   hypnosis.
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:35.400]   And he's snoring sleep mask.
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:39.480]   Sure, I'll be wearing that tonight.
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:40.800]   If you want-- and it's got an app.
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:43.040]   If you want to look like the elephant man,
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:45.400]   you need the hypnosis.
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:46.960]   What else we got?
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:48.680]   Silken pure silk pillowcase.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:49.360]   So this is it.
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:51.480]   This is home shopping.
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:52.000]   Interesting.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.200]   I don't know what happened to YouTube's home shopping.
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:55.800]   It's funny that Robert Kinselson say,
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:57.440]   we're going to put more money into that one.
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:01.640]   In fact, if you go to youtube.com/shopping, nothing happens.
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:03.560]   Well, that's why they're putting more money,
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:05.600]   because there wasn't any before.
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:07.320]   Nothing but growth, man.
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:08.280]   Nothing but growth.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:09.360]   Exactly.
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:12.800]   I guess they did it for the holidays, I guess.
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:14.960]   Holiday stream and shop.
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:15.800]   But then they stopped.
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:17.400]   They should be doing it for a single stay.
[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:17.900]   Yeah.
[01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:18.240]   Just coming up.
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:19.680]   Oh, look, the Morel twins.
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:20.880]   Gordon Ramsay.
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:22.920]   Who can't donut media?
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:26.600]   Patrick Starr, Jackie Aina.
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:27.880]   Manny Mua.
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:33.080]   Mr. Bass, the richest man on YouTube.
[01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:36.480]   He is, by the way, according to Forbes, the richest man
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.200]   on YouTube.
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:40.360]   I don't know if Kaki Lackey.
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:42.440]   Mr. Beast.
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:46.720]   Renee said he and his other YouTube creator friends
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:50.080]   thought that that list was not exactly accurate.
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:51.920]   But I think Mr. Beast makes a lot.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:55.280]   Anyway, Robert Kinsels, together these factors,
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:57.360]   contributed to our decision to reduce our YouTube's
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:00.880]   original slate to nothing going forward.
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:02.200]   We'll only be funding programs that
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:05.160]   are part of our Black Voices and YouTube Kids Fund.
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:07.640]   We will honor our commitments for already contracted shows
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:10.000]   in progress, and creators who involved with these shows
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.680]   should expect to hear from us in the coming days.
[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:15.360]   OK.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:16.080]   All right.
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:17.760]   The issue I have with some of that stuff,
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:21.520]   like you mentioned the Black Voices stuff,
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:24.720]   I looked at at least two different things on there.
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:29.560]   Maybe three, and did nothing for me.
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:31.960]   And I think that's why a lot of these things just sort of
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:34.320]   followed through to cracks, because sometimes the content
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:35.080]   just isn't good.
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:37.480]   There's just too much competition out there.
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:39.120]   It's hard to do good content.
[01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:42.560]   I think a lot of--
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:43.600]   Let me look at us.
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:44.200]   I know.
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:45.640]   See what you're saying?
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:49.440]   I've been trying for 15 freaking years.
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:53.160]   I think a lot of people, executives, people in LA,
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:55.000]   just say, oh, you throw money at it.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.360]   This is what YouTube learned.
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:57.320]   You throw money at it.
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:58.440]   Good content.
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:52:59.280]   Magic.
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:00.440]   And it's not.
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:03.920]   In fact, YouTube's real model is not so much throw money at it.
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:05.200]   In fact, I don't think they believe
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:07.360]   that throwing money at it does anything.
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:08.000]   Their model is--
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:08.880]   It will, for Netflix.
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:10.840]   Attract-- yeah, this is the difference.
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:12.920]   YouTube's got a better model.
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:15.840]   Act as if you're going to make a lot of money and attract--
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:16.200]   what is it?
[01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:19.280]   500 hours a minute are uploaded, something like that?
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:20.920]   We'll attract a ton of stuff.
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:23.440]   And we'll just let the crap float away.
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:25.200]   And the gold will rise.
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:26.840]   Or I guess gold sinks.
[01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:27.520]   And--
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:28.640]   It was like--
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:31.120]   Both the crap and the gold should sink.
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:33.520]   But sometimes it craps floats.
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:34.880]   And the gold sinks.
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:38.000]   And then you dig up the gold.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.160]   But you have to get past the crap.
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:44.000]   When you pan for gold, you slosh the water around.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.920]   And the silt comes off.
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:49.360]   And what's left in the bottom of the pan is solid gold nuggets.
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:52.560]   What if we let the cream float to the top?
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.520]   The cream will rise.
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:57.200]   And we'll put the crap of the 500 hours.
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:02.120]   491 hours and 59 minutes will float down the river.
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:04.520]   And be somebody else's problem.
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:05.480]   They sink.
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:07.440]   The 491 sinks.
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.800]   The other 8 minutes is the cream.
[01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:13.600]   The 9 minutes floats to the top where we see it
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:14.640]   in the recommendations.
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:16.080]   They rise to the recommendations.
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:16.600]   You know what?
[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:21.240]   The number one viewed video on YouTube is.
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:22.080]   It is the cream.
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:23.320]   This is the cream.
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:24.240]   Oh, man.
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:25.240]   Do you know what it is?
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.160]   Do you know what it is?
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:27.560]   Do you know what it is?
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:33.880]   10 billion views.
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:35.840]   10 billion views.
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:37.920]   And you just gave it another.
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:39.080]   I just gave it another.
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:40.760]   Actually, this one's only got 2 billion.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:46.560]   Oh, this is a special World Children's Day, Pinkfong.
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:50.960]   But baby shark, the original baby shark, 10 billion views.
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:54.000]   How many people are there in the world?
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.440]   Like 7.000 billion.
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:59.720]   So who are these extra 3 billion people?
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:01.680]   I've never met a toddler.
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:02.240]   Children.
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.080]   A toddler's play this thing.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:06.240]   Like, yeah.
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:11.040]   I don't understand how any video could be viewed 10 billion times
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:13.720]   and there are only 7 billion people.
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:16.000]   There are 7.9 billion people now.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.000]   So here it is.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000]   We're almost 10.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000]   Oh, I was wrong.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.360]   It's 10 billion, 45 million, 696,506 views.
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:24.360]   Unbelievable.
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:26.360]   So where is the?
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:27.360]   Where is the?
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:28.360]   Where is the?
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:29.360]   The coming from.
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:32.880]   So Leo, before you went to LAN, I just tweeted what was on OAN
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:33.880]   two minutes ago.
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:34.880]   Oh, really?
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:37.640]   Are you watching OAN as we do the show?
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:38.640]   It's on my TV.
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:40.160]   I just want to see if they have the on the.
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:42.080]   It's better than baby shark right now.
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:43.240]   I would watch it too.
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:44.960]   I think it's if I had the pillow guy on.
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:46.360]   Then they have an ad for this.
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:47.560]   You'll see it on Twitter feed.
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:48.560]   All right.
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:49.560]   All right.
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:50.560]   On his Twitter feed.
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:55.560]   Ladies and gentlemen, here is the free Trump gift for kids from Mike Huckabee.
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:57.080]   The kids guy.
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:00.560]   The president Trump first family.
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:03.440]   Why did Donald Trump decide to run for president?
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:05.240]   Drain the swamp.
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:07.520]   What is mega?
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:08.520]   That's great.
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:09.520]   Good for them.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:13.000]   Oh, look, there's a picture of Baron the youngest Trump.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.680]   That's great.
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:15.680]   Very fun.
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:18.360]   And this was an ad like to buy this.
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:19.360]   Yes.
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:20.360]   Yes.
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:22.160]   It was Mike Huckabee pushing this.
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:28.560]   That's the thing I think is most interesting is how all these people who hated him until
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:29.560]   he got nominated.
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:31.040]   That's the Republican party grift.
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:32.040]   Yeah.
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:34.200]   And I thought you were talking about how they're all making money.
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:35.200]   Well, it is.
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:37.880]   It's like, A, I think they're scared of them.
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:41.920]   But B also, it's a great opportunity to cash in.
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:43.960]   It's just like buying the dune book.
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:45.960]   Wow.
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:51.240]   So I'm going to tell you all that at five o'clock, I have to wander off.
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:54.360]   Let's wrap this up and get your pick of the week.
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:55.360]   Stacey is.
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:56.360]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:57.360]   What have we not done here?
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:58.360]   What do we not done?
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:02.360]   I'm giving you 30 minutes to get us time to get to change logs and other stories.
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:03.360]   Well, it is.
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:06.080]   Did you forget to do a certain beloved feature of the show?
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:08.960]   I don't think there's a change log in this rundown today.
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:10.160]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:12.000]   Oh, there was a whole blank white space.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.560]   And now there's a lot more.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:15.960]   It's like we didn't talk about Google.
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:17.160]   Oh, we talked about.
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:18.880]   There's a McDonald's eggs.
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:20.680]   Can we talk about four free?
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:22.840]   Oh, this actually is a big story.
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:30.480]   For the first time ever, a driver using Tesla's full self driving is facing felony charges
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:31.480]   in a crash.
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:32.960]   Actually, it is an FSD.
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:35.280]   It was the autopilot.
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:39.080]   California prosecutors have filed two because this has been the question all along.
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:41.120]   Thankfully, it's just the other day.
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:43.680]   Who's liable if I have an auto park thing?
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:45.280]   I stand out there, press the button.
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:47.240]   My car crashes in another car.
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:48.240]   Who's liable?
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:50.880]   Well, California prosecutors have solved that question.
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:55.960]   They filed two manslaughter charges against the driver of a Tesla who ran a red light
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:59.600]   and killed two people in 2019 while using autopilot.
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:06.840]   Now, I think that this isn't going to be the test case because at that time, in fact,
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:08.120]   I don't know if it even does now.
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:12.400]   But at that time, autopilot didn't know about stop signs or red lights.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:16.680]   So I used it a lot on my Model X, but you know, when you come to a red light, you got
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:17.680]   to stop.
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:19.160]   The car doesn't know that.
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:23.720]   So I think maybe this is really is the guy's fault, not autopilots.
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:25.480]   I don't think what it is.
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:26.480]   What?
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:27.680]   Because he's responsible for his car.
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:28.680]   Yeah.
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:31.680]   Andrew Leon, Tally, he just don't think.
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:32.680]   Did that happen?
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:33.680]   No.
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:34.680]   When did this happen?
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:35.680]   Who died?
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:37.680]   Andre Leon Tally died.
[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:38.680]   Fashioned.
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:39.680]   Yesterday.
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:40.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:42.680]   He was sorry, y'all.
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:45.520]   I have apparently been under a rock.
[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:46.600]   I'm under such a rock.
[01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:49.040]   I don't know who he is.
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:53.040]   He was the amazing creative director of Vogue.
[01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:56.040]   Oh, did he invent the giant puffy jacket?
[01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:57.040]   Kind of.
[01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:58.040]   No.
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:58:59.840]   He just styled it.
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:00.840]   Quite possibly.
[01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:02.320]   He's just rocking it.
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:03.920]   He's just rocking it.
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:10.880]   He was on a wind tours right arm and then she dropped him.
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:12.840]   Oh, no.
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:14.640]   He ended life.
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:15.640]   Poor.
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:21.160]   Arguing over if he could live in a house funded by a witch fashion house, it was crazy.
[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:24.960]   Anyway, the point is the man was a genius.
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:25.960]   Anyway, sorry.
[01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:26.960]   Totally not.
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:27.960]   Stay on it for a second.
[01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:33.680]   Just for a second, Stacy, because actually I worked at Conne asked, I know he was beloved.
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:37.160]   What was his primary contribution to fashion?
[01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:39.920]   What was his giant jacket?
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:41.520]   Well, that's what he got.
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:48.400]   No, he recognized he, he, like Anna wind tour and possibly more than her.
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:56.480]   Recognized designers and promoted and styled and then styled the clothes for the fashion.
[01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:00.120]   He did Michelle Obama's clothes for many years in the White House.
[02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:01.480]   No, he was brilliant.
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:06.080]   I just, I never saw the, the essence of under the on telly.
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:08.280]   What was a lot of this risk?
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:13.320]   Yeah, that's because Anna wind tour took a lot of his.
[02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:14.320]   Exactly.
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:18.480]   But, well, but yeah, that's what she does.
[02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:24.280]   Oh, Anna, Anna used to have in her, in her office and I've sat in them with fabled the
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:27.960]   most uncomfortable possible chairs.
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:36.480]   Here is, here is Anna wind tour with Mr. Tally in 1989 before her hair went white.
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:40.600]   That looks like a fun party, don't you think?
[02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:42.080]   Wait, her hair is a white.
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:43.400]   Is she wearing white hair?
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:46.600]   No, doesn't she have, well, it's gray.
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:47.600]   Or is it blonde?
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:49.600]   Anyway, she's, you know, it's dark.
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:51.320]   It's an ash blonde.
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:52.320]   Ash brown.
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:53.320]   Okay.
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:54.320]   Ash brown.
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:55.320]   Ash brown.
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:56.320]   Oh yeah, there she is.
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:00.200]   There they are in 2014 with her ash brown hair.
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:01.200]   Yeah.
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:04.360]   So that famous, was it, is it a pixie cut?
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:06.040]   The Bob, what has she got there?
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:07.040]   That's a Bob.
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:08.040]   Bob.
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:09.040]   It's the Anna wind tour hit.
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:10.760]   I mean, it might as well be a Jennifer.
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:13.080]   Like, you know, it's like, it's its own thing.
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:14.080]   No.
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:15.080]   Okay.
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:16.080]   I'm sorry.
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:17.880]   I'm like, I have to leave and then I sidetracked us total.
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:24.680]   Well, you know, I didn't know you were so into design because I just went to the San Francisco
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:28.720]   Museum of Arts, Patrick Kelly retrospective.
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:30.240]   And it was amazing.
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:37.080]   I mean, he, another very famous black designer passed away to far too young in his case,
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:40.040]   but he made some amazing stuff.
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.920]   And we saw this in San Francisco.
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:42.920]   I didn't even know it was going to be.
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:43.920]   Oh, that's cool.
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:45.640]   It was so cool to see this.
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:48.480]   So this is one of my favorite books right here.
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:49.480]   What?
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:51.480]   I'll show you how to read a dress.
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:52.480]   Oh, it talks.
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:53.480]   I wish I read that.
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:02:00.360]   It's just, well, this is for women's fashion specifically, but it's just like, I love, yeah.
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:01.640]   You would have loved this exhibit.
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:02.640]   It was.
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:03.640]   It was amazing.
[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:04.640]   I would have.
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:05.640]   I love all.
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:06.640]   Yeah.
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:08.200]   I'm the person the Met is pandering to with all of their.
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:10.400]   One of the things is interesting about Kelly.
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:14.820]   First of all, he fled to France because of course he couldn't, you know, get a fair hearing
[02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:21.600]   because he was black, but also in the US, but also he collected racist memorabilia and
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:25.920]   turned it into his fashions in many cases, which is pretty neat.
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:27.080]   That's crazy.
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:28.800]   He got a lot of heat for that.
[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:32.520]   You'll see in fact in this picture, he's wearing kind of a pin that's like a black
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:38.200]   sambos pin and it was a way of saying, you know what, take it back.
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:40.160]   Yeah, we're going to take it back.
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:43.040]   And I loved him and so did France.
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:47.800]   In fact, here's one of his collections had Eiffel Tower hats.
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:50.000]   They were so great.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.000]   So great.
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:55.160]   I didn't, I don't know this other guy, Tali, but if you like Kelly,
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:56.480]   what tell me was it a designer?
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:57.480]   Yeah, I know.
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:01.720]   He just discovered people like Patrick Kelly, but come to San Francisco and see this.
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:02.920]   It's an amazing show.
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:03.920]   Okay.
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:05.960]   I will highly recommend it.
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:06.960]   Look at this.
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:09.320]   Look at this lip hat with the lip suit.
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:10.560]   Isn't that hysterical?
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:13.320]   He had a great sense of humor.
[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:14.320]   All right.
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:17.800]   What else before we get rid of Stacey?
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:21.040]   Uh, Android 12 updates.
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:22.040]   I just got one.
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:23.040]   Did you do your update?
[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:24.920]   Did it make your pictures better?
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:27.200]   I think it broke my Bluetooth.
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:29.280]   Oh, really?
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:32.480]   And I think I'm having better performance.
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:33.480]   Good.
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:34.480]   Whoa.
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:40.440]   I could not connect my freaking headsets and get them to work for like, okay, I got a
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:41.440]   tip.
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:42.440]   Two or three days.
[02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:46.720]   I got a big tip and I did this on Windows weekly because both Paul and Mary Jo use
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:49.000]   Pixel six pros.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:54.240]   The new January, the January update did come out and it's supposed to fix all these problems.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:57.840]   But and I found this on Reddit.
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:02.360]   There is a trick at least with ambient lighting and I suspect with maybe fingerprint and other
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:05.160]   things, you almost need to do a reset of the phone.
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:08.280]   And there is a reset hidden in the weirdest place ever.
[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:12.080]   So I'm going to follow along over my shoulder if you would, John.
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:14.840]   Can you, can you pick up my, um, over the shoulder?
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:18.240]   He has to push some buttons and make it work.
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:20.880]   He was already for the change longer than you changed the button.
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:22.600]   I, I, this is the change.
[02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:25.560]   So this is my Pixel six, by the way.
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:29.720]   Uh, I think any knocker recommended this case I like or was it you, aunt?
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:30.720]   Maybe it's you.
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:31.720]   It's not.
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:32.720]   It's a nice case.
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:34.720]   Anyway, so go into settings.
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:38.400]   All of you who have a Pixel six follow along here because you'll never believe where you
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:39.400]   find this setting.
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:41.240]   Go to apps.
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:42.440]   Go to see apps.
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:44.160]   Hold on, see all apps.
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:49.240]   And this is because the only way you can get to this particular app device health services
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:51.240]   is through the apps settings.
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:52.240]   So this isn't okay.
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:56.680]   Remember when Google decided to move updates into the store in many cases, because companies
[02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:58.720]   weren't passing along your updates.
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:01.480]   This is one of the places where you have to do this.
[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:04.280]   Um, device health services.
[02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:15.840]   Uh, storage and cash, managed space.
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:16.840]   Holy cow.
[02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:17.840]   Did that have anything?
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:18.840]   Does this have anything to do with that?
[02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:21.240]   No, reset adaptive brightness.
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:24.240]   If you've been having trouble with adaptive brightness, do that.
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:29.640]   And then I think this actually is the one you want, which is clear all data for device
[02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:34.400]   health services, including battery statistics, adaptive, adaptive brightness data.
[02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:38.880]   I think that after you do the January update, you should do this because you have a lot
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:44.720]   of old cash data that we're moving that I think fixes a lot of things.
[02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:48.320]   The other advice that I strongly suggest you've had trouble with a fingerprint reader is
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:53.080]   deregister your fingerprints and re-register them after you get the January update.
[02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:54.760]   You mentioned something a while ago.
[02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:57.640]   There was a point with my phone where suddenly I'm at home.
[02:05:57.640 --> 02:06:04.440]   Which should, it should, I have to hit the power button before I can use your print.
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:05.440]   Yeah.
[02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:06.880]   I think this fixes that.
[02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:07.880]   I haven't had that happen.
[02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:09.760]   Actually, I haven't had that happen in a while.
[02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:12.800]   But again, I'm just going to run through this real quickly because I know it's weird.
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:14.520]   We'll put this, I guess, in the show notes.
[02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:15.520]   And I don't know.
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:16.520]   Jason is out.
[02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:19.520]   So I don't know if they talked about this yesterday and all about Android.
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:25.440]   But again, settings, apps, just because you have to get to this weird device health app,
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:27.880]   see all, and then device health.
[02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:33.680]   And this is a weird trick because you, I didn't even remember, okay, now I have to go to storage
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:37.160]   and cache, which makes no sense.
[02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:38.960]   Manage space.
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:42.400]   And then that's where you get these settings to reset adaptive brightness and clear all
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:43.400]   data.
[02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:45.320]   And I suspect that that's what's going on.
[02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:49.280]   There's cached bad stuff from the old days because this seems to help.
[02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:50.640]   I have one meg of it.
[02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:51.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:55.120]   I only have four kilobytes after clearing it.
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:59.360]   And if your fingerprints are still not working, we register those.
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:01.600]   So that's your Google change log.
[02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:02.600]   Jesus.
[02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:03.600]   Good stuff.
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:04.600]   I fell asleep.
[02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:13.800]   I actually pulled this for you.
[02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:15.800]   We do have to do an ad and then picks and then we'll go.
[02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:21.440]   But I do want to just read this, Jeff, how Campbell's soup turned New Jersey into a tomato
[02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:22.440]   growing state.
[02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:23.440]   I wonder how this ends up here.
[02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:25.440]   I'm going to tell you something in a second, but go ahead and put this one.
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:27.480]   It's from the Smithsonian magazine.
[02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:28.640]   And I had no idea.
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:31.640]   You know, they call New Jersey the garden state.
[02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:34.920]   My family was in Leonia just over the bridge.
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:38.360]   So it was kind of still Metro sprawl.
[02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:40.360]   But you're in a very nice part of New Jersey.
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:43.120]   And as you go as it sounds, it gets beautiful.
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:44.120]   Really is beautiful.
[02:07:44.120 --> 02:07:46.840]   So beautiful west to where I am.
[02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:51.560]   Yeah, but it turns out it's a perfect growing area for tomatoes.
[02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:56.120]   The soil, especially by the way, the inner coastal plain, which is the other.
[02:07:56.120 --> 02:07:58.360]   The other you scroll down just a little bit in that photo.
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:07:59.840]   Yeah, this one.
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:04.200]   No, no, the people, the meeting on the farm, maybe it's up now.
[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:05.400]   No, that one.
[02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:06.400]   There it is.
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:07.400]   I lived in cinnamon.
[02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:08.400]   I lived in cinnamon.
[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:09.400]   So I didn't just want to sit him in.
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:11.040]   I lived like there.
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:15.240]   I lived on the old tomato fields for Campbell soup.
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:17.200]   You lived in tomato fields.
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:19.520]   I lived on the old tomato fields.
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:26.400]   So because of the perfect soil for this, particularly in the inner coastal area, loamy soil, the
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:31.720]   very famous tomatoes were bred by Campbell soup, the Rutgers tomato, which is now gone,
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:35.480]   by the way, although Rutgers is trying to bring it back because a few seas remain in
[02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:37.640]   the Campbell's archives.
[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:42.440]   The Rutgers tomato, they stopped selling it or using it, even though it was perfectly
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:44.400]   uniform and everything, the skin was thin.
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:45.880]   So they wanted a thicker skin.
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:51.400]   But anyway, it was a great article by the founder of the Library Seed Bank.
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:55.480]   He's a seed activist, Jeff Quattrone.
[02:08:55.480 --> 02:09:02.120]   And he talks about the Garden State tomato, the Rutgers tomato, and most importantly, the
[02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:04.440]   JTD.
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:15.440]   If you like Campbell's tomato soup, it's because of the JTD, which is actually named after
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:17.760]   the CEO of Campbell's.
[02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:20.720]   Yeah, he was a dense, more something.
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:22.720]   John, John something.
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:23.920]   So did you read the article?
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:24.920]   John Thompson, Lawrence.
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:25.920]   That's it.
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:26.920]   I guess.
[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:31.480]   He was the president of the company, the JTD tomato released in 1918.
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:32.560]   Bred there in Cinnamonson.
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:35.320]   It's a medium-sized red tomato.
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:36.320]   Yeah, double N-A-M-I-N-S-O-N.
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:38.400]   You learned how to spell that early.
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:39.400]   Cinnamonson.
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:40.560]   So is that where you were born?
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:41.560]   No.
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:46.280]   I went there from second to seventh.
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:47.280]   That's cool.
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:48.280]   I had no idea.
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:49.280]   All right.
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:52.640]   Now we're going to take a quick break and then it's a picks of the week and then Stacy's
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:58.640]   going to go somewhere and do something we only wish we could follow along.
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:01.120]   Maybe make cookies, maybe have dinner.
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:03.680]   I don't know.
[02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:10.440]   This episode of Twig is brought to you by brand new sponsor, welcome CDW.
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:16.240]   HPE GreenLake orchestrated by the experts at CDW.
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:21.320]   Now, if you're an enterprise, I'm going to tell you something you should probably know
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:22.320]   by now.
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:27.960]   Yesterday's infrastructure is not going to help you meet the demands of tomorrow's innovation.
[02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:30.560]   May not even help you with today's innovation.
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:34.720]   And now more than ever, you have to quickly adapt to change, right?
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:39.400]   The consumption-oriented model of public cloud has revolutionized how organizations
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:44.600]   think about infrastructure, how organizations are now demanding the speed and agility of
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:46.840]   a public cloud experience.
[02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:51.400]   But still to this day, many workloads remain on-prem.
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:53.960]   You've got complicated legacy applications.
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:55.600]   There's also the issue we've talked about this.
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:01.920]   We just did about data sovereignty, compliance issues, or maybe just you're afraid.
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:04.920]   It's a serious thing to migrate sensitive data to the cloud.
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:07.160]   IT caught right in the middle, right?
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:10.960]   Trying to satisfy the demand and growth of their organization while struggling to manage
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:14.600]   disparate data expected to do it all at budget.
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:18.960]   Well, let me introduce you to HPE GreenLake and CDW.
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:23.880]   They can provide a seamless, scalable cloud experience across your entire organization
[02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:26.880]   that you can easily manage from anywhere.
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:31.720]   No matter where your data and applications live on-prem, public cloud, private cloud,
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:38.560]   you can trust HPE and CDW to automate your processes so that you can focus on the next
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:39.560]   big thing.
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:44.480]   CDW can help you get the most out of your unique, complex data needs by assessing your
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:50.920]   organization's needs and designing and implementing a tailored HPE GreenLake solution to modernize
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:56.240]   your business, to meet your digital transformation goals, and to kind of answer those questions
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:00.840]   and help with the nervousness of making this big transition.
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:06.160]   Unsimplimented CDW provides ongoing management, which means your staff could focus on innovation.
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:09.280]   They don't have to fiddle with the bits.
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:13.880]   Seamless cloud experience across all your organization's apps and data, thanks to a
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:17.320]   as-a-service model that meets you at the edge, you'll have scalability that provides
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:19.720]   instant increase in capacity.
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:20.720]   Love in that, right?
[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:24.080]   Giving you the flexibility to match your growth and meet demand.
[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:29.440]   And streamlined management of all your data, all your applications inside that single platform
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:33.320]   providing simplified operations and accessibility from everywhere.
[02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:35.720]   Giving you back time to focus on innovation.
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:38.360]   You get a, this is kind of a through line here.
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:44.400]   CDW not only helps assess an organization's needs and build a unique HPE GreenLake solution,
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:45.960]   they also remain an active partner.
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:49.520]   They're right there for you to provide support throughout the management process.

[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:06.640]   you back the time you need to what yes, innovate and dream bigger for a seamless cloud experience
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:13.640]   trust HPE and IT orchestration by CDW people who get it.
[02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:18.440]   Learn more at CDW.com/HPE.
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:32.160]   Easy to remember, CDW.com/HPE.
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:57.680]   Now, usually I start with Stacy and with Anne, let's reverse it.
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:13.840]   This is a new R5 with cinema capabilities and it sits right in between the R5 and the
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:15.360]   C70.
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:17.600]   So you're going to get cinema capability up to 8K.
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:20.600]   It even has an internal fan on it.
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:24.880]   You can record up to 8K raw internally.
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:29.360]   This looks like a beast of a camera and I believe it's going to start you at about 4,500
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:30.360]   bucks.
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:39.760]   I'm curious about the current R5 owners because this still allows you to shoot stills in addition
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:41.400]   to having all that extra video.
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:42.400]   And it's what?
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:43.400]   48 megapixels?
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:44.400]   48 megapixels.
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:45.400]   Wow.
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:51.840]   So I'm wondering what my R5 fans are thinking right about now.
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:54.200]   Will it use those lenses?
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:55.200]   Yes.
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:56.200]   Right.
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:57.200]   Yeah.
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:00.320]   But I don't know, that body is sitting right in between this one and the C70.
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:02.520]   The C70 is a dedicated video cinema camera.
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:04.120]   Looks like the best of both worlds, right?
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:05.120]   You can't both.
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:06.680]   In effect, I would guess.
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:07.680]   Right.
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:12.440]   So yeah, that was this morning and I think it's a pretty good price and hopefully I'll
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:15.000]   be able to get my hands on one to test it out soon.
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:18.600]   8K raw, 422 4K 120P.
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:23.160]   120P and you still get the audio for the slow motion.
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:24.920]   It doesn't totally warp it out.
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:27.440]   Still pretty good features built in here.
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:28.520]   No ND filters.
[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:33.440]   The N-body stabilization has a 1.4 crop on it.
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:36.120]   But again, all of that stuff can be worked around.
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:41.280]   When I got Henry in R6, because he needed to sit, I wish this had been out, but R6 was
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:42.560]   less expensive.
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:44.480]   But even it has very good video capabilities.
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:45.720]   Yeah, it's great.
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:46.720]   Yeah.
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:49.160]   He has all my old Canon EF lenses.
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:52.680]   So he just, like I said, we'll get an adapter and the one lenses work.
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:53.680]   Yep.
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:55.680]   So save a lot of money, sir.
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:56.680]   Yeah.
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:16:01.800]   So he has my old Mark 4, 5D Mark 4 and now he has the R5.
[02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:07.800]   And I bet you, if all things go well, did you see Chrissy Teigen retweeted his reel
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:08.800]   the other day?
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:09.800]   Yeah.
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:10.800]   Oh, good for him.
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:12.360]   He's been going back and forth with Chrissy Teigen.
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:14.320]   They want to do a cooking show together or something.
[02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:15.320]   But anyway, for him.
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:18.520]   If all that pans out, maybe he should get an R5C.
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:19.520]   I'm thinking.
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:22.000]   This would definitely be good for him.
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.840]   He's not buying it.
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:28.400]   But shout out to Salt Undiscore Hank for real.
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:29.400]   He's doing great.
[02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:32.680]   I really enjoyed the salt that we got here at the house.
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:34.240]   It's good salt, isn't it?
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:35.240]   Yeah.
[02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:36.240]   The Pesto one is really good.
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:38.080]   I'm a fan of the garlic truffle.
[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:40.520]   I just had that on an avocado toast.
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:42.160]   It was so good.
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:43.160]   So good.
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:44.160]   SaltHank.com.
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:48.720]   And Aproit is, of course, @_proit on Instagram.
[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:49.720]   Yeah.
[02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:50.720]   Give me a follow over there.
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:56.080]   I'm still putting stuff on Instagram and still interacting with people there.
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:59.960]   I tell the people that watch my show and listen to my show to just follow me over there and
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:01.160]   interact with me there.
[02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:06.240]   And I do my very best to follow up.
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:10.800]   When you took this profile photo, were you thinking, like you're looking at the camera,
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:13.040]   were you thinking, "I love you, man?"
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:17.640]   That's my normal, happy face.
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:18.640]   Okay.
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:19.880]   I'm stretching it.
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:21.040]   I can't read it.
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:22.040]   That's all.
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:25.000]   And so it's like the Mona Lisa that follows you around.
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:26.000]   I can't decide.
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000]   That's just the normal surface.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000]   I love you, man.
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:32.120]   Or I'm going to rip your heart out through your lungs.
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:33.120]   Or I don't know.
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:34.120]   I can't tell.
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:35.960]   I'm a damn good poker player.
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:36.960]   It's poker.
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:37.960]   That's what it is.
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:38.960]   Are you?
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:39.960]   I bet you are.
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:40.960]   It's a guy in the damn good poker player.
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:41.960]   Yes.
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:42.960]   Yeah.
[02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:43.960]   I see the smile here.
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:44.960]   There it's like, "I don't can't read him.
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:45.960]   What's he thinking?"
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:48.160]   "So you have a royal flush?
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:49.160]   I don't know."
[02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:50.160]   Maybe.
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:51.960]   "Number of the wake, Mr. Jeff Jarvis."
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:52.960]   All right.
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:54.320]   So this is the ultimate me.
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:57.160]   I said, "No one makes Stacy happy for me to bring up this word."
[02:17:57.160 --> 02:17:58.160]   Gutenberg.
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:17:59.160]   $200,000.
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:00.160]   What?
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:01.160]   This makes...
[02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:03.680]   You got to go to this page.
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:04.680]   Go to that page.
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:05.680]   All right.
[02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:11.960]   So this is a fragment, discovered fragment of the Donatoss, which was a grammar book that
[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:17.360]   Gutenberg, it is believed, you don't know anything, printed before the Bible.
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:24.000]   There's very few examples of this and they're all just pieces that were used in later bindings.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:32.160]   So this is a 1490 book and this book guy, Patrick Olson, is representing this thing.
[02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:33.160]   And if you go to...
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:34.160]   Oh, you can actually open it.
[02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:35.160]   Oh, my God.
[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:36.160]   Oh, yeah.
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:38.000]   So the book is not what you're thinking of it.
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:39.000]   Go to...
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.800]   Oh, it's column one, column one, row two.
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:42.800]   So you don't care about the book.
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:45.160]   It's the thing they make this book out of.
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:46.160]   Oh, don't care about the book.
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:47.160]   Exactly.
[02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:48.880]   So you want the book right there on the set?
[02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:49.880]   That's the Donatoss.
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:50.880]   That is the Donatoss.
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:53.600]   It's the sliver of the Donatoss.
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:58.960]   And the great thing is it's a wonderfully written explanation of why they know this and
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:02.040]   how, but it's $200,000, has a price on it.
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:07.160]   And as of yesterday, it had a put in cart button.
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:09.600]   And I have to admit that I did it for just two seconds.
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:10.600]   Oh, yeah.
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:11.600]   I just have it here.
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:15.000]   I want to know the sense that for one second, I had this in my cart.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:20.880]   So they reused this old book to make this newer book.
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:25.560]   But this old book has been identified as being a very early Gutenberg.
[02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:26.560]   Gutenberg.
[02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:27.560]   It was a kid's grammar.
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:29.960]   It was a school grammar book, a grammar book.
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:32.120]   So they weren't meant to be saved.
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:33.120]   Right?
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:37.160]   So if you go to that first photo right there, that's the outside of the body.
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:39.400]   And you see those little letters right there?
[02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:42.840]   Those are little tiny bits left of Gutenberg's Donatoss.
[02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:43.840]   Wow.
[02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:44.840]   Yeah.
[02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:46.480]   So I know this has nothing to do with the Google.
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:49.520]   I think you should buy this as an NFT and burn it.
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:51.160]   I was going to say I could then burn it.
[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:52.160]   Yeah.
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:53.160]   Who needs it?
[02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:54.560]   Just making an NFT.
[02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:55.560]   Yeah.
[02:19:55.560 --> 02:19:56.560]   Yeah.
[02:19:56.560 --> 02:19:57.560]   Wow.
[02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:02.800]   If you want it, go on over to ulsenraerbooks.com and peacemaker.
[02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:05.400]   We'll be glad to burn it for you.
[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:10.800]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, Stacey Higginbotham's pick of the wake.
[02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:12.640]   All right, y'all.
[02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:14.960]   This pick of the week is a little crazy.
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:16.200]   Let's see if we can get Leo to buy it.
[02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:17.400]   It's not as crazy as mine.
[02:20:17.400 --> 02:20:19.440]   I got a crazier one, but go ahead.
[02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:20.440]   Okay.
[02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:24.840]   Mine is the oven that I actually bought in November, but it arrived and I've gotten to
[02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:25.840]   play with it.
[02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:26.840]   Is it from June?
[02:20:26.840 --> 02:20:27.840]   And I am so excited.
[02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:28.840]   No.
[02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:37.800]   This is a slide in range and induction, smart range and oven from GE Cafe.
[02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:41.240]   And the reason I'm talking about it is because it's the first appliance that I've actually
[02:20:41.240 --> 02:20:46.720]   sold, like big appliance that I've connected to Wi-Fi because it's freaking awesome if
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:48.560]   you connect it to Wi-Fi.
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:50.640]   So I love the idea of an induction oven.
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:52.480]   We want to get induction cooktops.
[02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:53.960]   We actually have an order.
[02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:54.960]   This is an induction cooktop.
[02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:56.880]   It is an electric oven.
[02:20:56.880 --> 02:20:57.880]   I get it.
[02:20:57.880 --> 02:20:58.880]   It's still an oven.
[02:20:58.880 --> 02:20:59.880]   It's still an oven.
[02:20:59.880 --> 02:21:00.880]   It's still an oven.
[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:01.880]   Yeah.
[02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:02.880]   We love induction.
[02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:03.880]   Yeah.
[02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:04.880]   Do you love it?
[02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:05.880]   So it's good for your ketchup and paper.
[02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:06.880]   Oh, yeah.
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:07.880]   Well, I actually know.
[02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:08.880]   My core is what I do that.
[02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:09.880]   My core is what I do.
[02:21:09.880 --> 02:21:10.880]   That's not a story.
[02:21:10.880 --> 02:21:12.880]   But it's Wi-Fi and able.
[02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:13.880]   Yes.
[02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:14.880]   Yeah.
[02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:17.720]   So it is the first thing I've ever put on Wi-Fi.
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:21.840]   And the reason is it talks to both Madam A and Google.
[02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:26.040]   So I can tell Google to read my oven, which I still can't do from.
[02:21:26.040 --> 02:21:29.880]   And I can ask like how much time is left on the timer if I set it from the oven.
[02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:35.360]   But GE has also been very active in updating things.
[02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:40.360]   They actually prior to Thanksgiving did an update to these two, many of its ovens, not
[02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:41.360]   all of it.
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:44.840]   But any of those that were capable of it, they did the Turkey update that did a cook
[02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:46.240]   program for Turkey.
[02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:49.240]   So you just put the probe in the oven and said you were cooking the Turkey.
[02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:51.080]   And it was like, boom, I'm on it.
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:52.080]   Don't worry about it.
[02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:53.480]   I got this.
[02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:55.280]   It's got an air fryer mode.
[02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:56.280]   Yes.
[02:21:56.280 --> 02:22:00.840]   It's got even though it looks like a standard stove.
[02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:02.480]   It guys looks like it has two.
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:03.480]   It's got what do they call that?
[02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:04.480]   The Dutch oven.
[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:05.480]   It's got a Dutch oven.
[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:07.320]   Oh, this one's the one here.
[02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:08.320]   Mine is which one?
[02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:09.320]   The Dutch oven.
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:11.360]   I was looking at a video that had a Dutch oven.
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:12.360]   Mine is the...
[02:22:12.360 --> 02:22:13.360]   Because I already have the June as my...
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:14.360]   I don't need to.
[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:15.360]   Yeah, you need to.
[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:16.360]   I need a big oven.
[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:17.360]   This is not cheap though.
[02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:18.360]   It's $4,000 for this.
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:19.360]   No.
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:20.360]   Well, induction ovens are expensive.
[02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:21.360]   Yeah, that's my oven.
[02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:22.360]   Yeah.
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:24.000]   We want to get an induction cooktop.
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:25.000]   I'm really...
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:26.280]   It's been a while.
[02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:30.560]   So this gets into the next thing and in like two weeks I'm going to have a new thing related
[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:32.720]   to it, but I'll just sneak peek it.
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:35.560]   This works with the Heston Q's SmartPans.
[02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:37.720]   I have Heston Q SmartPans.
[02:22:37.720 --> 02:22:38.720]   Hands?
[02:22:38.720 --> 02:22:39.720]   Because?
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:40.720]   I have Heston.
[02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:41.720]   I have Heston.
[02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:47.080]   So because I have to buy new pans for the induction cooktop, I was like...
[02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:51.160]   The Heston's work with induction, in fact, they come with a little induction, a little
[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:52.160]   burner.
[02:22:52.160 --> 02:22:53.160]   Well, I don't need that.
[02:22:53.160 --> 02:22:55.160]   They're integrated with GE.
[02:22:55.160 --> 02:22:56.160]   Nice.
[02:22:56.160 --> 02:22:59.160]   So I will talk about...
[02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:00.160]   Oh, that's cool.
[02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:01.160]   So the pan...
[02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:02.160]   We'll hear about it in two weeks.
[02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:04.320]   This is SmartPans.
[02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:11.360]   So the pan recognizes information coming from the app or in this case with GE and the integration,
[02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:12.360]   the oven.
[02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:13.360]   So it will...
[02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:14.360]   It also sends us...
[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:15.360]   It sends us...
[02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:16.460]   And it's to detect how warm the pan is.
[02:23:16.460 --> 02:23:17.460]   So it will...
[02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:18.960]   There's a couple of things you can do with that.
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:23.160]   You can keep your pan at exactly the right temperature, which allows you to sous vide in
[02:23:23.160 --> 02:23:24.480]   it, if you would like.
[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:28.600]   It also allows you to do things like melt chocolate and delicate kind of heating things
[02:23:28.600 --> 02:23:31.320]   that normally have to babysit as a cook.
[02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:35.400]   The other thing it's going to do is you can tie it to some of the recipes and it will
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:36.680]   follow some of the recipes.
[02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:39.720]   It's not a thermomix, but it's still going to be pretty cool.
[02:23:39.720 --> 02:23:41.240]   Yeah, no, I have...
[02:23:41.240 --> 02:23:42.560]   Alex Lindsey talked me into getting these.
[02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:44.640]   I have a couple of has to accuse.
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:49.400]   And it, yeah, it comes with its little induction unit, but if you had a stove that was...
[02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:52.000]   The Stacy's call for empathy there.
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:55.000]   Not a thermomix, like Leo has one.
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000]   Oh, please, Sean.
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.840]   I have some more.
[02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:00.840]   Oh, Pashaw.
[02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:05.840]   I just fit $3,700 on a range, but I'm going to complain.
[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:07.640]   Oh, did you see you bought this range?
[02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:08.640]   When does it come?
[02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:09.640]   This is...
[02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:10.640]   It came...
[02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:11.640]   No, I bought it in November.
[02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:12.640]   It came.
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:13.640]   Oh, you have it.
[02:24:13.640 --> 02:24:14.640]   Oh, okay.
[02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:15.640]   I like set it up.
[02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:16.640]   That's why it's my thing.
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:19.720]   So did you have a nice stove you got rid of or you always do this?
[02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:21.160]   No, I had a failing...
[02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:25.640]   No, I had a failing Bosch and I was just like so...
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:27.640]   That oven, it was horrible, y'all.
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:28.640]   It like...
[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:29.640]   We had a Bosch dishwasher.
[02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:30.640]   I like that.
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:33.240]   Oh, I like my Bosch dishwasher.
[02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:37.040]   Well, this one, all the circuit boards fried, all of them.
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:39.040]   That would be a problem.
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:41.640]   It was a little too computer-y.
[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:43.400]   Hey, I got one for you, Stacy.
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:46.880]   This will go very well with your cocktail party later.
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:47.880]   This is...
[02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:49.600]   You know about Shazam, right?
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:51.320]   Which identifies music.
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:55.160]   This is Cheesam, which identifies French cheese.
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:56.160]   Yes.
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:57.160]   Yes.
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:24:58.160]   Is it based on smells?
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:24:59.160]   Yes.
[02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:05.160]   You have to take a picture of the cheese and then drag it to the dots here.
[02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:11.040]   Cheesam is the brainchild of a few data scientists at a company called Prevision.io.
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:16.200]   Over lunch a few months ago, the bay took places to which type of cheese we are served
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:17.880]   on a dessert tray.
[02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:22.920]   Yes, things get pretty wild at lunches outside of our Paris- France office.
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:25.800]   Just imagine what these folks are like on the weekend.
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:28.840]   From Zad lunch, an idea was bone.
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:33.960]   Can machine learning be used to identify a type of cheese?
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:41.200]   Now, I have to say, "Chazam," which is, by the way, literally trained, but was trained
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:44.840]   on a dataset of French cheeses only.
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:48.440]   So don't expect this to work on your cheddar, your eaters.
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:49.440]   So it's...
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:50.440]   Your Vermont.
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:51.440]   Your Vermont.
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:52.440]   Your Eaters.
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:53.440]   Yes.
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:58.440]   Compté, Rochefort, Le Bre, De l'Ecée.
[02:25:58.440 --> 02:25:59.440]   De l'Ecée.
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:00.440]   De l'Ecée.
[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:01.800]   That kind of thing.
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:04.440]   It can only predict the type of cheese.
[02:26:04.440 --> 02:26:07.440]   But I don't know.
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:08.440]   I guess it's good.
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:09.440]   You tried it?
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:11.440]   No, I haven't tried it.
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:12.440]   You can.
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:16.840]   But I just thought, "Wow, that's French right there.
[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:17.840]   Cheesam.
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:18.840]   Cheesam.
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:25.080]   It detect French cheese, and there's even an API, if you'd like to."
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:29.240]   There was a startup who actually used molecular chemistry.
[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:30.240]   Oh, yes.
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:31.240]   Smells it.
[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:32.240]   It's smelted.
[02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:37.400]   And this was a startup I saw present probably four years ago at a food tech conference.
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:40.640]   And I was like, "It was also a French person."
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:43.640]   I kind of respect that passion.
[02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:45.040]   Yeah, they have the big nose.
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:48.040]   It makes it easier to smell that.
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:50.040]   Let's be passionate about cheese.
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:51.040]   Oh, God, yes.
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:52.040]   Why wouldn't you?
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:53.040]   Yeah.
[02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:54.040]   It's the best.
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:55.440]   By the way, you will like this, Stacey.
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:27:00.040]   If you do use it for cheese recognition, it will also recommend wine pairings.
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:02.040]   No, excellent.
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:07.040]   We saw this cheese that makes us thirsty announcing the newest features of Cheesam.
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:11.040]   Wine pairings with direct purchasing enabled.
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:15.440]   All right.
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:16.880]   Stacey gets to go now.
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:17.880]   Thank you.
[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:18.880]   It's waffle on me.
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:22.280]   Stacey Hagenbotham, Stacey on IOT.com.

[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:31.680]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:32.680]   Thank you.
[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:34.400]   Thank you, Aunt Pruitt.

[02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:40.040]   He's at twit.tv/hop.
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:45.240]   Community manager at our club where he's bringing in some great stuff.
[02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:46.880]   George, you're one of my best.
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:48.680]   George, it's coming up.
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:50.080]   Mike Elgin.
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:52.360]   Thank you for all that you do there.
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:57.560]   And then of course, there's this guy, the director of the Townite Center for entrepreneurial
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:07.520]   journalism at the Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:08.520]   Former talent.
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:10.800]   And it inspires me a different time I hear.
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:11.800]   I love it.
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:12.800]   I love it.
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:13.800]   Absolutely.
[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:16.720]   My friend, Pete Domenick, the podcast I mentioned.
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:20.520]   He's, you know, I'm like, I have another, another family.
[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:21.760]   I occasionally am on Pete's.
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:23.840]   He was just on Sirius for 12 years.
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:25.120]   He's a comedian.
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:29.320]   He has people in his audience who do jingles.
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:30.320]   Oh.
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:33.520]   And he decided that I was jingle worthy.
[02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:34.520]   Oh, no.
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:35.520]   Oh my goodness.
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:36.520]   Jingle.
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:37.520]   You have a jingle package.
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:38.520]   No, that's not how.
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:40.760]   No, I talked about this.
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:42.240]   Where can I, where can I hear you?
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:43.400]   I've not yet stopped.
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:44.400]   He's not put on the area yet.
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:46.480]   He played it for me today, but he hasn't put on his area.
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:47.480]   So when is there?
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:50.120]   I will play my jingle for you.
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:52.520]   I'm kind of feeling bad about this now.
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:53.520]   Yeah.
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:54.520]   I don't know.
[02:28:54.520 --> 02:28:55.520]   We got what we talked about this, sir.
[02:28:55.520 --> 02:28:57.600]   And he got your jingle.
[02:28:57.600 --> 02:28:59.920]   Is this going to be my real friend?
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:00.920]   Yeah.
[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:01.920]   Are we going to have like a yes?
[02:29:01.920 --> 02:29:03.960]   Oh, when it's all 10.
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:04.960]   Wow.
[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:05.960]   Wow.
[02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:06.960]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:07.960]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:29:07.960 --> 02:29:08.960]   Thank you.
[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:13.800]   And we'll see you all next time we do this show every Wednesday, 2 p.m.
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:14.800]   Pacific, 5 p.m.
[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:15.800]   Eastern.
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:20.240]   And early for the anecdotes from the front porch.
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:22.920]   From the old man rambling.
[02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:25.800]   Mark and roll rambling on the porch.
[02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:28.840]   Let me tell you about the time.
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:33.400]   If you stick around, I'll show you my Dijkstra later.
[02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:34.800]   That's a coding joke.
[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:36.280]   You just understand.
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:38.960]   If you want to watch us live live.twit.tv.
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:45.440]   That is a joke that literally like one tenth of one one percent, one thousandth of a percent
[02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:46.440]   got.
[02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:49.040]   But those of you who know, you know, that's big enough for you.
[02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:50.040]   Yeah, big enough for me.
[02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:51.040]   I don't care.
[02:29:51.040 --> 02:29:52.040]   I'll take it all.
[02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:54.240]   I see that Twitter TV.
[02:29:54.240 --> 02:29:58.080]   If you want to chat with us, join the club club twit at twit.tv/club twit.

[02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:12.440]   Look for twig.
[02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:14.440]   And subscribe in that way.
[02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:15.560]   You'll get it automatically.
[02:30:15.560 --> 02:30:16.560]   Every time it's available.
[02:30:16.560 --> 02:30:19.520]   Thank you everybody for putting up with us.
[02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:22.120]   We'll see you next time on this week at Google.
[02:30:22.120 --> 02:30:28.120]   Have I ever told you the one about?
[02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:30.040]   Android is constantly evolving.
[02:30:30.040 --> 02:30:34.600]   And if you're part of the Android faithful, then you'll be just as excited about it as
[02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:35.600]   I am.
[02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:39.640]   I'm Jason Howell, host of all about Android, along with my co-hosts Florence Ion and Ron
[02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:45.160]   Richards, where every week we cover the news, we cover the hardware, and we cover the apps
[02:30:45.160 --> 02:30:47.400]   that are driving the Android ecosystem.
[02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:52.160]   Plus, we invite people who are writing about Android, talking about Android, and making
[02:30:52.160 --> 02:30:54.360]   Android onto the show.
[02:30:54.360 --> 02:30:57.480]   Every Tuesday at twit.tv, look for all about Android.
