[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Oh yeah, we'll throw in a little Google news as well. It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Including the last 20 minutes before the show began junk mail.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Let's say hello.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Starting left to right with Gina Trepenten of smarterware.org.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   The author, think up and the recipient soon of a gold plated Mac mini.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I'm so excited.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Gold plating, awesome.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Yeah, we decided because Gina, you know, we want to see the perfection that is Gina.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   My CPU, it's too busy on this machine.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   We decided that.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And we did this with any in our code.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   If we give you a dedicated Mac mini that's got nothing else going on, you can't use it for anything else.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   It's just a Skype machine.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   That seems to be better.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I believe you when I look for testing that theory with my brand new Mac mini.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Were you just doing the Skype hesitation with your voice or did that actually happen?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I believe.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Also with us, Jeff Jarvis at home because son Jake has his 21st coming up.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   That's right.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   That's exciting.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Big deal.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I see behind you a whiteboard easel.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Do you generate ideas on that thing?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I love whiteboards.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I adore whiteboards.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   When I worked at Connie Nast, I insisted that they do whiteboard wallpaper on the whole
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   round.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   It was a huge thing.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I absolutely love it.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   That's how I take notes.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   And it's how I work with my students.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I have the world's worst handwriting so I don't recognize it five minutes later.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   But that's how I do it.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   They have paint now, whiteboard paint.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   We weren't actually thinking of painting the offices that way.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   It's great.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's kind of expensive.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   It's great.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   It's expensive.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Make sure the wall is super smooth.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   If you get the good whiteboard paint.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   It's a neat idea.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Check home.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   You guys need to be here for a layer.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   You guys need to be here for a couple of years.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   That's Kevin.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I'm decorating.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Sorry.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   No, no, no.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It's good.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   We kind of got the life hacker how to make my life better crew in here.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   The Purdman is the author of what's the latest?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Android?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   The complete Android guide.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And I also blog at IT World quite often.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   So both those things.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Or go to the Purdman.com.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Yeah, you could.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   He's where you can read his year 2012 in review.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Yes.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I am one of those reticent personal bloggers.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   But you know, already professionally everywhere else.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I hate it.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   But we got two life former life hackers here.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I think that's good.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   The first thing we go to is the ins and outs of whiteboard paint.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Yes.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Getting things done on your wall.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I think just the--
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I haven't done the post-test.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It's so exciting.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Can you do blackboard?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Yeah, there's blackboard paint as well.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   That's interesting.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Yeah, friend of mine painted a tire wall with a calendar and uses chalk to kind of add a little
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   once.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yeah, it's really nice.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   That's cool.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Here's the sad thing for me.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Let's see if I do this right.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Actually, I have-- there we go.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   A stack of whiteboards.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Oh, look at that.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   With an easel.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I used to-- I years ago, when I started E.W., Ikea had the best wall whiteboards and I loved
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   them.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And I had them on an easel and would use them all the time.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I love whiteboards.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Now you make me want to buy 10 or 11.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Jeff prefers to buy new whiteboards to erasing them.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Well, there always comes a day somebody uses a magic marker.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Right.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And then you've got to get a new one.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Yeah, the ghosting is the issue.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Yep.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Let's see.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Let's talk about the news.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Should we talk antitrust?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Is that exciting?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Google stock?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   That's exciting if you hold any.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   French people?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   French people?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Always fun?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Always exciting.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Always exciting.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I know it excites me the most.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   And I'm sure you talked about it on all about Android yesterday.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   But now it sounds like March 15th will be the day that Samsung will announce the Galaxy S4.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   How does it fit?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   4.99 inch screen.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   An octoprocessor, 8-way processor.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Although all 8 processors are never engaged at once.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Surely they have to get Octomom to your--
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And she might do a better commercial than Paul Rudd and that other guy.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   OK.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Let's talk about that.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Because the Super Bowl had a very strange long ad for Samsung.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   They didn't actually really-- they had LeBron James.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   They had Paul Rudd.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   They had the other guy.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Jonah.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Jonah Hill.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Jonah Hill.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I was confused with Zach Galafianakis.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Jonah Hill.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And who was the guy, the ad agency guy?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Because he looked really familiar too.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   He's in Breaking Bad?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Was he?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   I can't-- oh, yeah.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   He was the lawyer in Breaking Bad.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   That's where I saw him before.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And what-- and did they ever even show a-- they showed a galaxy note.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Briefly.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   He's even drawn on someone's face.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Peripherally.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Better call Saul.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Yeah, we talked about this on all but Android last night.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   It was weird commercial.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   The whole commercial was like these guys sitting around a table trying to come up with a concept
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   for commercial.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Which, you know, just seems sort of lazy to me.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I would have liked to see more about what the device could do.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   It was only bested by or worsted by the Blackberry ad, which said there's-- the new Blackberry
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   does so many things.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   We couldn't show you what it can do, so we're just going to show you what it can't do.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It was a terrible ad.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   More Blackberry.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   The pride of Canada.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Samsung is a little bit more surprising because Samsung has done such good ads.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Yes.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Up to now, and I just was kind of-- I guess I could play this.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   We won't get-- we won't get yanked from YouTube for playing an ad for an Android device.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Oh, no.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Oh, this is last year's Super Bowl.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Actually, you know what?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I should show you last year's Super Bowl ad, which was even just as incomprehensible.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   So maybe this is a Samsung tradition.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Remember the one they said, "The Thing Called Love?"
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Remember that ad?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   At least this was fun.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Are you not getting my audio?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   I'm getting that-- I'm getting that--
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   I have this year's ad if you want.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Let's see.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Watch a little bit of it.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Okay, here we go.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   It was long.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   It seemed longer than--
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   It was long.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Yeah, no.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   $4 million for half a minute, so that's like an $8 million or $12 million ad.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Yeah, I started it 55 seconds and-- good.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   If it will-- so Paul Rudd and the other guy, Jonah Hill, show up on a bench and they say
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   "You're both-- they were both called for this ad."
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And then they fight with each other.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Then they go in and talk to Saul.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Babies.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   So we just use Seth in a diaper?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   I don't wear a diaper.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   You would wear a diaper for Samsung, though, right?
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   I would wear a diaper for Samsung.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   What else you got?
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Crowdsourcing.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I love it.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Put out on the internet that you want people to send you ideas
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   and you don't have to think of an idea.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   That might be good for this spot.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Seth Rogen, not Jonah Hill.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Yeah, I'm going to send them to the--
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Get all the same to me.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Do you know what this is? This is the problem with actors' ad-lady.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Oh, let us-- let's live in.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   We're a fun-- let's have some--
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Well, I thought this was funny, but I don't know if it was an ad.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   That's me.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I have LeBron James.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Hi, Braun.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   You win on Samsung?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Yeah, totally.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Maybe I do a cameo on the tablet or something.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   That's awesome.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   I don't know what LeBron James is.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   I mean, that's incredible.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   You get LeBron James.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   You got the next big thing.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   You don't even need anybody else.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   That's right.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   We don't-- we don't-- don't need anyone else.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   I got it.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   I'm having breakfast with LeBron's kids.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   I don't-- I don't get it.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   So that was the whole ad, right?
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   It never was-- there was nothing more.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   There was not like, hey, we make a great phone.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Hey, I guess that's cocky.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   That's when you know, hey, we got it.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   We don't have to tell anybody what we do.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   We just have to say Samsung and they go, yeah, I love it.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Paul Rudd.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   The main thing they wanted to get across is that marketing is soulless.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Well, they succeeded.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Right.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And also, it was a biophone.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:09.800]   Well, you know, there's a piece up on the rundown, arguing that Apple is-- the iPhone is the
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.000]   Model T. And it was the first one.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Everybody loved having it.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   We're all standardized.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And each color you want, as long as it's black or white.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Exactly.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   All of that, right?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   So you will do what Mr. Ford wants you to do.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And the reason that Samsung is doing so well is because it, in the ecosystem of Android,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   is offering lots of choices.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And we like choices.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Right.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I agree with that.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   That's not even-- I don't even know if that's a insightful observation.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   It's yes, obviously.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Well, the argument further is the Model T faded away.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Yes.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And Ford continued on with great success by eventually offering choice.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   I mean, from an Android point of view, it's kind of interesting that the Galaxy brand is
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   probably the most popular Android handset brand right now.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   At this point-- well, it's not even that.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   At this point, when you talk about smartphones, number one is Apple.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Number two is Samsung, not Android.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Samsung.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Right.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Samsung or Samsung Galaxy?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Benedict Evans did a blog post just looking at Google Trends during the Super Bowl.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And the word Samsung and Samsung Galaxy were about the same kind of traffic.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   As each other and more than Android.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I mean, I don't even know if they said the word Android.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   They don't say the word Android in any of these commercials.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Nope.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And a couple of them will say, you know, with Google built in, right?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Which kind of implies Android.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   This is actually an issue for Google.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   I mean, I think on the one hand, Google says we don't care because we don't make money on
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Android.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   We want everybody just to get used Google stuff and we make money on that, including on the
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   iPhone.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Is it an issue?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Like, do they want to build an Android brand?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   There was a--
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Not necessarily.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   There was a meme or a thought piece going around a little while ago that Samsung was somehow
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   strategizing to actually step away from Android and pull an Amazon.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And do Tizen.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Or do Tizen.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Or do Tizen.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Or do Tizen or fork away from Android and do their own build.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   And I think the thought at the time was, well, what's stopping them?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   You know, they've got the kind of brand.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   I had never bought one.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   You know, it just keeps on occurring with it.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   I want the official build because I get the latest version.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   I don't get the bloatware.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I don't get the junk mail of mobile, right?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And that's why I have this thing.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   And if they went farther away, I'd never get one.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Right, but they're hitting different retail channels than you're going through.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Oh, that's true.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   I'm weird.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Chris, Chris, Chris Jaw in the chat room does point out Samsung, in fact, does sell Windows
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   phone, the ATEve.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Which we conveniently forget.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   You know, I was thinking back today with Dell going private.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   And some might say I have a role in that story.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Oh, you do?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Oh, I want to hear about that.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Well, no, no, back in the days of Dell Hell.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Dell Hell?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   That was the beginning.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.360]   But, you know, I wish the Dell were in a position now to make really great Chromebooks and really
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.000]   great Android devices.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Right.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And if somebody pointed out, they had, well, I forget the name of it again.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   What was their five-inch?
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   What was their note to?
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Streak.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Streak, which, you know, I liked in form, but somebody else pointed out Android wasn't
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   ready yet.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   It wasn't tablet-ready.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   And the streak was clunky, thick, and heavy.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   It was not anywhere near.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   At the time.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   But the whole point of it was it was the biggest screen.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   It was like an unbelievable size.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Right.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   So they were ahead on the...
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Seven nations?
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   But they were too far ahead and didn't know it was.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   What was it?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Five-inch.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   It's funny.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   It seems so big at the time.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Let me look it up.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Streak seven is a seven-inch tablet.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.640]   How big is the note to officially?
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.560]   And then they had the Streak five, which is five inches.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.560]   And this is five and a half.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.560]   The note to...
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.560]   Five and a half.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.560]   I think it was five.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.840]   The Dell Streak was five, and they had a seven-inch tablet, both of which nobody cared
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.480]   about when they were now gone.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.040]   There was a story last week that more than 60% of Dell employees were using Blackberries
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:55.760]   and implying that therefore none of them ever used their own Dell's own phone.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.600]   I remember seeing one at South by Southwest two years ago and thinking, "That thing's
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.600]   huge."
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   I like...
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.600]   Did you use a Streak?
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.040]   No, I never used it, but I said, "Well, I think I want this."
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.040]   Well, what you wanted...
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.040]   I wasn't at the right day.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.120]   What you wanted was a mature Android that could compete with the iPhone, and a big screen
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.120]   was what you liked.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.920]   And I think there's no question now, looking at the success of the note, that people do
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.720]   want bigger screens.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.200]   There's even a lot of rumor that Apple's going to do a bigger screen.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.200]   iPhone Plus.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   Plus-sized iPhone.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   Plus-sized iPhone.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.000]   I mean, after switching to the Galaxy Nexus, which isn't even one of the bigger phones, I
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.080]   mean, I pick up the iPhone now.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.160]   It just seems tiny.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.480]   It seems antiquated a little bit too, does it not?
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.480]   It does.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.480]   It feels like...
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.480]   Oh, fresh.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.480]   I feel like a toy.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.480]   It feels small and toy-ish.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.480]   I don't know why.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.120]   It's just something about just the interface too.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.480]   It's so interesting that it changes your perspective on it.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.480]   Or toy-ish?
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.320]   Toy-ish, really?
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.120]   No, but it just shows...
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.120]   It's not toy-ish, obviously.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.560]   And a lot of people use it still the number one phone.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.080]   But I think what it shows, though, is how quickly styles change.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.200]   And you can't rest on your laurels in this business by any means.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.200]   I mean, I don't mean to put it down.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   I develop for iOS.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.200]   I love iOS, whatever.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.840]   I just, you know, like the rounded corners and the bright icons and the grid of icons,
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.600]   just...it's just a different feeling.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.920]   And it's when you look back at it after you're on a big Android phone with like widgets and
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.360]   live wallpapers and all those things, it just feels really different.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.080]   We're going to take a break.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.840]   Let's come back and do the change log.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.240]   Gina, you can get your costume on.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.240]   Okay.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.600]   And we can prepare the trumpets.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.520]   The change log coming up in just a moment.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.480]   But first, I want to tell you about something new from Citrix.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.800]   Our friends at Citrix are always adding new products, new capabilities.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.960]   The tie in, which is nice to tie in with the old.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.560]   And this is something I'm very excited about.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:57.160]   I first saw before Citrix acquired them and then started playing with it and fell in
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.160]   love with it.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.920]   It's called PODIO.com.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.880]   The hardest thing about PODIO is to explain what it does.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.560]   You know, it's...you know, right now, if you're in business, the way you work together, you
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:20.360]   collaborate with both your colleagues and your clients via email and, you know, sharing
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.840]   documents on maybe on Google Docs.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.800]   And it gets very complicated to manage products, very complicated to keep track of what people
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.800]   are up to.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.560]   The solution, which by the way, does not eliminate all the ways you're doing this stuff, is
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.560]   called PODIO.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:38.000]   It unifies it all together so you can escape email overload and document chaos.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.640]   It's a collaborative work platform.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.200]   But the key here is it's free to try.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.120]   And I want you to get in there and try it right.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.920]   Here's...I'll even go through this process for you.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:54.760]   By the way, you notice you can log in with Google or Facebook or Microsoft Live or Go
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.480]   to Meeting or just enter your work email.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.600]   So I'm on Leo@twit.tv.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.840]   I think I already have an account.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.840]   So that's at that address.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.160]   In fact, so it's going to say, "Oh, hi, Leo.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.400]   Welcome back."
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.360]   But what I want you to do is you know what happens here is it says, "Okay, you're a Google
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.360]   user.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.360]   What do you want to connect?"
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.520]   Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Contacts.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.760]   Let's connect all that stuff.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.920]   That's good.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:21.400]   So it's now connected to all my Google stuff into this.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.800]   I can set up things like project management.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.240]   Now here's my...I've set it up a whole workflow in here.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.240]   There's an activity stream.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.840]   It's kind of like an in-house Twitter.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:37.160]   It's like the ultimate social network that combines, in fact, Jeff and Gina, you're in
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.160]   here.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.160]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.160]   I would hope so.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.120]   So this is really a cool way.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.760]   You saw how quickly that all kind of got set up.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.400]   We've got...in fact, we're going to start using an editorial advisory board here on
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.600]   PODEO that we will advise you of so that people in our chat room who are regulars,
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.200]   this is by invitation, are going to be able to come in here and we can talk about ideas
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.080]   we have going forward.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.440]   I want you to go and sign up for free and set up your first workspace.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.440]   The workspace kind of will guide you.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.320]   It's so free form it will guide you in a form so that you can start using it right away.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.680]   My contact list is in here.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.240]   Don't show this though because I want to make sure...
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.760]   Yeah, we'll just...you could just assume that my contact list is in here.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.760]   It's mostly just emails.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.440]   I don't think it's going to.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.080]   My calendar is in here.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.080]   It's just fantastic.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.840]   I want you to try PODEO.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:36.280]   If you work with a team, whether it's a company, a nonprofit, a theater group, a club, whatever
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.480]   it is, this is the new way to do it and it is better than anything I've seen before.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.640]   So complete.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.240]   And of course it works with your Google Docs.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.120]   You don't have to abandon your current way of working.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.320]   It just enhances it.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.880]   We have an employee network that we use it for so we can communicate.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.680]   It's just fantastic.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.880]   Sarah Lane has already posted in here saying everybody's going to get a raise so that's
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.880]   good news.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.880]   P-O-C-I-O.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.880]   PODEO.com.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:07.120]   Get in there, set up your first workspace right now.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.960]   It's absolutely free to do so.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.960]   Lisa's using it.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.960]   Lisa really liked it when she saw it.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.560]   She said, "We can definitely use this.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:20.120]   We've been looking for a workflow solution that says manage all the big projects we've
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.120]   got going on.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.320]   It's a really great solution."
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.320]   All right.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.800]   We're getting Gina back.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:31.840]   She had to step out to get on her glittery costume for the big change log.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.840]   Can you not?
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.840]   Oh, you're not getting my video.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.840]   Here's the reveal.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.840]   We're not going to see it.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.640]   Oh, no.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.640]   Go ahead.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.640]   Start the video.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.160]   This is why we're getting you a new gold plated computer, by the way.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.160]   Here we go.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.160]   Here we go.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.160]   That should help.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.160]   Oh, that's the wrong camera.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.160]   You're on camera.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.160]   You're on camera.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.160]   Don't worry.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.160]   That's a good camera.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.160]   Just face us.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.160]   Just look over here.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.120]   As we get the trumpets ready.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.200]   That should be better.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.200]   Much better.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.200]   All right.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.200]   Sorry about that.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.200]   There we go.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.200]   Oh, there we go.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.200]   Oh, oh.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.200]   And there we go.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.280]   By the way, what is this sweatshirt?
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.280]   What does that say?
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.280]   Pratt.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.280]   Pratt?
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.280]   Do you go to Pratt?
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.720]   I didn't go to Pratt, but my wife worked at Pratt.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.720]   Great design school.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.400]   Art Institute, yeah, in Brooklyn.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.360]   Really, one of the best.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.080]   Ladies and gentlemen, breaking out the trumpets.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.320]   It's time for...
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:26.800]   The Google change log.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:32.880]   It's especially like the tapping at the edge there.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.880]   It never gets old.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.840]   The comets never get old.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.760]   I just love them.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:44.400]   So Google straps on one of those crazy backpack 360 degree cameras on a bunch of Googlers and
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.480]   sent them down into the Grand Canyon.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.720]   So the result is Street View within the Grand Canyon.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.480]   There is some amazing imagery here.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.840]   You can just go to maps.google.com/grandcanyon.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.840]   And it's just incredible.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.840]   It's incredible.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.520]   This really made me want to get off my butt and actually go toward the Grand Canyon myself.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.520]   Check that out.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.520]   That's all new.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.520]   Well, check it out.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.520]   That's all new.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.520]   Great.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.520]   Well, it's funny.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.520]   It made me say, oh, good.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.520]   I don't have to write a donkey.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.000]   I guess it depends where you're coming from.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.400]   You don't have to go to the Grand Canyon or you really want to go.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.000]   We each have our own point of view on this.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.600]   Yeah, I mean, these are some beautiful images.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.120]   It's really-- I've been there and I've actually walked down some of these trails and it actually
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.120]   is a better way to go.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.320]   Just do it in the browser.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.320]   Just do it.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.320]   Make Googlers do all that.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.960]   Yeah, let them do the work.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.960]   So cool.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:39.080]   Also, new in Google Maps ski resorts, new run and lift maps, 38 new run and lift maps
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:44.080]   for some of the most popular mountains in the US and Canada, including Squaw Valley, Big
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.080]   Sky, Okemo.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.320]   So you can check those out as well.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:53.640]   There's some images there and Google+ showing some of the run maps so you can kind of see
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.920]   that the best way to get down the hill is right there in Google Maps.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.840]   Google Play Music for Android has updated.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:06.440]   A couple of nice little features, new features, instant mixes, continued playing beyond 25
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.440]   songs.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.880]   You can shuffle an album, artist or playlist and the previous button got added to the widget,
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.720]   which sounds like a really small, simple thing but much, much needed.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.400]   So that's Google Play Music on Android.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:27.760]   Google Flight Search has a new useful little feature that skiff.com picked up.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.120]   You can search for regions, not just airports.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.120]   So if you want to fly from Petaluma and you want to go to Hawaii, you don't care what
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.640]   island, you can just type in Hawaii and Google Flight Search will show you flights to all
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.640]   the different islands.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.320]   So you can do the same to say for the Caribbean if you're planning vacation.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.160]   So it's just regions.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.160]   What's there?
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.160]   Works for even just Europe.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.480]   If you say, "I want to get away," what's the price?
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:55.400]   So I found, I tried this out and I found that it was cheapest to fly to Moscow versus Western
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.920]   European places, $531.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.920]   And what the hell?
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.920]   Let's go to Moscow.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.920]   Let's go to Moscow.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:05.240]   Try to get a damn visa is another question, but put that aside.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.080]   And last thing, this is kind of a new to me.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.240]   I'm not sure how long this has been in place, but Life Hacker wrote this up.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.960]   You know when sometimes your friend's email account gets hacked basically and you get
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.760]   spam from your friends and you want to mark those messages as spam, but you don't want
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.040]   Gmail to know, do you want Gmail to think that all of your friend's messages are spam?
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.480]   Well, when you do mark a contact message as spam now, Gmail pops a box that says, "Is
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:34.720]   just this one message suspicious or should you mark this person's messages as spam in
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.720]   general?"
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.000]   It just looks suspicious versus messages just spam.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.600]   It's kind of a way of letting Gmail know, "Hey, something went wrong here.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.480]   Somebody may have hacked a friend's account."
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.880]   So that's a nice thing that Adam and Life Hacker noticed.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.880]   And that's all I got today for the Change Log.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:59.280]   Thank you, Gina, for the Google Change Log.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.560]   That's really handy because you always want to be the only person to write your friend
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.920]   and let them know that they've been infected, but you don't want to be the 34th person.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.360]   Well, you also may not want to be the first person.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.360]   Right.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.360]   It's really nice to let Gmail handle it.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.280]   I'd like to be the second person that sells that.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:25.040]   So I was at a big game on Sunday and everywhere you look, including the scoreboards everywhere,
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:32.680]   hashtags, and the implication of course you want to tweet hashtag SB47.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.160]   They did a little count at marketingland.com.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:43.400]   Matt McGee said Twitter was mentioned in 26 of 52 commercials, half of the commercials.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.200]   I'm surprised it was only half.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.080]   Facebook mentioned only in four.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.400]   How many times do you think Google+ was mentioned?
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.400]   Well, the Google+ers are arguing that they support hashtags too.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   But that's not what they were.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.880]   And then they wrote an update to that post saying, "Oh no, we searched.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.480]   None of these hashtags were on Google+.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.480]   They really did.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.480]   You can also add notes."
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.480]   Well, I'll try it this way.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.480]   I'll try the fanboy with his wife.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.480]   Google+ is not a place to get bombarded with marketers.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.480]   It's a place to have conversations with people you like.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.480]   I really don't want to see a lot of people hashtagging the kiss for GoDaddy.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:30.800]   For instance, I watched that again because I didn't see the game because I was at the
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.040]   game, but last night I watched the TV broadcast.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.640]   It's very different, by the way.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.800]   It's kind of an interesting experience.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.640]   Almost a totally different experience.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.720]   How you feel about the game is different.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.440]   Well, if you don't think you have lights and power?
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.160]   Yeah, well, that's for one thing.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.400]   Actually, you didn't.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.520]   You didn't because in the middle of the game when the power goes out, the announcer's just
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.400]   disappear in the mid-sentence.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.640]   It takes them a while to say anything.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.520]   Then they get a sideline guy who's clearly ill-prepared and has never been on camera before, I
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.880]   think, because he doesn't.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.400]   A local reporter could have done a better job setting the scene.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.320]   He was like, "Flumford."
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.320]   Anyway, I watched it again.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.320]   You said it called UN Leo.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.400]   Yeah, I could have filled an hour.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.400]   You absolutely did.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.400]   I actually did.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.280]   I tweeted about 80 times during the...
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.720]   Because I figured, "You know what?
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.240]   I bet you people don't know what's going on.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.720]   I bet you the broadcast isn't going to tell you because they're dead in the water."
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.720]   So I thought, "I may be the..."
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.960]   One of the broadcast said they were waiting on a statement from the NFL about what happened.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.960]   Like, they needed the NFL to tell them.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.120]   We don't know what happened.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.040]   NFL, what happened?
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.600]   So I tweeted a bunch, but I did not use #TheKiss.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.720]   Now that I saw the commercial, I'm glad.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.200]   That was definitely sweetened with slurping sounds.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.120]   It sweetens the right word.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.120]   Was there Wi-Fi?
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.920]   There was not Wi-Fi, right?
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.920]   It was really almost like...
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.720]   Wi-Fi, in fact, they made a big deal about the fact that they had a lot of Wi-Fi.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.640]   71,000 people in that super dumb.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.120]   It's huge.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.200]   And that they had a ton of Wi-Fi.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.880]   It worked very, very well.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.600]   They had some interesting security things that they did.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:19.320]   Apparently, they looked at every device coming through the perimeter and checked its MAC address
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.560]   and what it was and would block it if it was a rogue device.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.120]   All sorts of interesting stuff they were doing.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.360]   The Wi-Fi was excellent.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.160]   I heard some sort of crazy statistic.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.360]   Like 38 gigabytes of data was uploaded from the super dumb that day.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.640]   833 gigabytes of data.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.640]   Oh, 833.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.640]   That's insane.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.800]   And a goodly amount was mine.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.600]   I uploaded video, audio.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.960]   We even made a Skype call to Twit.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.960]   And it worked okay.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.960]   I mean, it wasn't choppy.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.960]   It was choppy.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.560]   I mean, I was doing it on a smartphone for one out on iPhone.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.120]   Was this like bored by during the blackout kind of time?
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.200]   No, before the game, they were doing the show and the chat texted me.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.640]   So you want to try it?
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.040]   Because the Wi-Fi was part of the store was a news story.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.440]   But for surfing and uploading video and Instagram pictures and tweeting and everything, it was
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.440]   great.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.440]   Except, and it lasted into the power blackout for about 15 minutes.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.280]   And then it died too.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.280]   But I had 3G.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.760]   I was able to use 3G, so I continued tweeting.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.280]   Yeah, there were hashtags everywhere.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.480]   These are the top hashtags.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.840]   Better with MMs.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.840]   Bravery wins.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.240]   Pick your team for Hyundai.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.480]   There were some social attempts that I think were particularly stupid, like the Coca-Cola
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.480]   race.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.480]   Who's going to win?
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.480]   You get to choose.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.480]   I don't care.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.480]   Right.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.760]   I mean, really, seriously, do people care whether the showgirls, the cowboys, or the
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.760]   bikers win?
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.120]   I mean, who cares?
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.840]   Doritos has in the past on more crowd sourcing.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.840]   Remember, they were like a couple of years ago had fan-made ads.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.680]   Right.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.080]   I don't think they do that this year.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:02.320]   They had some weird kind of goat.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.320]   Attack goat.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.720]   It was an attack goat thing.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.720]   It was very strange.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.720]   It was terrible.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.880]   The ads were, not that this is a show that, but we can comment on ads.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.880]   We do everything else.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.880]   The ads were terrible.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.640]   There were only a couple of good ads.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.280]   The Clydesdale ad literally made me cry.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.280]   But you know what's interesting?
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.240]   The web version made me cry.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:27.800]   The long web version when I saw it on TV, dry eyed.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.720]   You need a little more time to develop that story.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.720]   I think.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.080]   If I could comment on that one, it was like when you were in a room full of your friends,
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:40.040]   you don't want to be like, so there was this moment of like, that was really touching,
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.320]   but I'm going to make fun of it because I don't want to be the guy in the party being
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.880]   like, what a cucking lame friends do you have?
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.800]   They don't support man tears.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.800]   Come on.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   Come on.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   You need better friends, Chad.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.720]   Your friends would say, go ahead, cry it out.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.040]   Do you want a tissue?
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.040]   Do you want a tissue?
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.040]   We were all crying.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.040]   There was a guy watching the grammar ad.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.040]   You were like, oh, you wish you could scroll your TV down to see the angry comments.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.440]   That's the bottom of it.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.680]   But there was none because it was a TV ad.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:13.640]   The ad 10 million views on YouTube.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.800]   And I have to say it was much more touching on YouTube.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   I guess it's longer.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.360]   It's a minute 13 on YouTube, but of course, only 30 seconds.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.880]   You got to develop a relationship.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.720]   The horse, the man, they bonded.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.920]   They got to know each other.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.160]   They really care.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.760]   And then of course, the big Budweiser truck pulls up.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:40.080]   I thought the choice of the goat girl, Fleetwood Max, landslide.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.920]   Landslide was a little odd.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:47.320]   And he goes to Chicago to see his horse that he gave up three years ago.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.920]   The horse drives by without even a look.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.760]   And wait, they've unharnessed the horse.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:57.480]   And now somehow, unacadably, they took the blinders off and unacadably, the horse gets
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:02.800]   away and runs down the empty streets of Chicago.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.960]   You've heard of war horse.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.960]   This is beer horse.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.280]   This is beer horse.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.960]   I love war horse.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:14.960]   This made me, I swear to God, I was, I was.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.560]   My friends did mock me.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.560]   In some ways it almost seems like my wife and dad have to have to have to have to be.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:22.360]   And then what did you see the end?
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.840]   Because at the end it says, tweet your name because that's a real baby horse.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.360]   You know, a Clydesdale coat.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.360]   We haven't named it yet.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.360]   So tweet your name.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:35.440]   Now we haven't heard anything from Budweiser about what name they want to give that horse.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.720]   Tweet us your names using the four-act crime.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.720]   The four-act was crying for other.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:45.320]   We were crying because of the Niners, not because of any old horse.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.640]   Name the baby Clydesdale.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.760]   Seen in this commercial, tweet us your names.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.560]   I don't know if they ever did name that horse.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:57.080]   That's a problem with a lot of this stuff because Twitter is so evanescent.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:03.000]   The biggest winner according to everybody I read was Oreo.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.280]   And not because of their ad or because of their hashtags, but because when the lights
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:13.520]   went out, Oreo thought fast.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.760]   Somebody thought very fast.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:21.200]   The Oreo ad was a fight, I guess, about how to, I don't know what it was.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.960]   There was a library and there was a fight.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.560]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:30.440]   And that didn't really get anybody excited about Oreos, but boy, when the lights went
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.680]   out at the Super Bowl and Oreo, how fast did they tweet that?
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.880]   It was really soon.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:43.320]   They tweeted out a picture and they said, "You could still dunk in the dark."
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.000]   Which in fact had nothing to do with the ad.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.560]   It didn't matter.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:48.560]   Didn't matter.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.120]   And they added a hashtag, "Dunk in the dark."
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:57.440]   Got retweeted more than 14,000 times.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.360]   That's an ad.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.360]   Cost him nothing.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:05.320]   Did you ever see the 30 Rock where they came up with telethons for every possible emergency
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.960]   that could happen?
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   That's what it like.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:14.480]   Because Oreo had the whole contingency of Ray Lewis leaves the stadium and flies to Hawaii.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.480]   They have a whole--
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:19.440]   There's no way they had somebody planning for a power outage.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.440]   That couldn't--
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.600]   Well, they had someone who was good with Photoshop and had a pipeline to summon a Twitter-promoted
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.600]   ads, right?
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:31.920]   And more importantly, had permission from Oreo to act on his or her own.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.920]   Right?
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:33.920]   Because that's the big thing.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.760]   Normally, you've got to get that ad passed 20 people.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.600]   Three weeks from now, you can tweet.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.600]   Sure.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.480]   Usually that works not exactly anything.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.080]   That's the last tweet from the wrong account.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.840]   20,000 likes on Facebook.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:53.000]   Oreo went from 2,000 Instagram followers pregame to 36,000 after the game.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.360]   It was a huge success.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.280]   And it wasn't the library where they're fighting over cookie or cream.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.280]   That was stupid.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.440]   It was dunking in the dark.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.040]   It was appropriate to the medium.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.440]   It was having a conversation.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.680]   It was added something.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.520]   The VP of cookies, honestly.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.960]   That's her title.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.960]   Lisa Mann.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.240]   That's the title I aspire to.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:21.680]   She has led marketing efforts for Oreo for the last two years and the Super Bowl ad.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.680]   She explained it was the result of a carefully architected social media strategy.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.840]   This is from Forbes that made the brand ready to respond to whatever the big game through.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.200]   It's way so you're right, Kevin Purdy.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.200]   Yes.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.600]   The way-- here's the quote.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.320]   The way this all came about is because of the Super Bowl spot and we were coming off
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.600]   the 100th birthday, we chose the Super Bowl to kick off this campaign of which part of
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.160]   the cookie to love more.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:48.640]   But because we picked such a big stage, we decided to have a social media command center
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.840]   so that we could respond--
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.480]   That's the hot thing ever since Delos started one.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.200]   Everybody goes down and see Delos.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.120]   Everybody wants a command center.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:00.640]   And old Spice 2 really showed that you can use Twitter very effectively to market.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.640]   Right.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:06.520]   It's a response to what's going on live versus plan something months ahead.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.680]   Of course, we couldn't have anticipated the blackout.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.480]   But in that command center, we had brand people, agency people.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:17.040]   So you had the people who could say yes.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:23.920]   It was within the agency's 360I's Tribeca's office, representation from all of Oreo's
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.920]   agencies.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.920]   Oreo doesn't have just one agency.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.440]   They've got Widen and Kennedy, which of course is the creators of the old Spice ad, one
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:36.560]   of the best in terms of managing social media, media vest, and Weber-Shandwick 360I.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.200]   So four agencies are there.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.200]   She's sitting there.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   She's dialed in.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.200]   What's happening?
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   What's happening?
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.320]   Several members of the brand team from Oreo were in the room as well.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.760]   They're all emailing each other.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.240]   Because everyone was together, she said they had everyone in place to jump on a real-time
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.640]   marketing opportunity, which was how would Oreo see the blackout?
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.000]   You could-- they got to make a movie.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.960]   Oh, this is an HBO movie.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.600]   The blackout.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.080]   Cookie Crisis.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.880]   How would Oreo see that?
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.880]   Yes.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.040]   And the team.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.120]   And you can just see, Aaron Sorkin's got to write this dialogue.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.560]   This is so much better than the Samsung crap, because it kind of is probably very similar,
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.800]   but it was real.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:22.040]   And Oreo saw the blackout, she says, as an opportunity to dunk in the dark.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.200]   Dozens of interns getting ads ready for like marauding alligators.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   Earthquake, hurricane.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.200]   Okay.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.200]   Oreo.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.480]   The best thing in a national crisis.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.480]   No.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.480]   Oreo.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.480]   Terrorist attack.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.480]   No, it's a cookie.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.480]   No, Oreo.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.480]   Dunk in the dark.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.480]   Yes, Dunk in the dark.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.480]   I just--
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.480]   Got to make sure you fire off the right ad though, right?
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.880]   And now it's not a really tough Photoshop job.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.200]   You got a cookie, and you got a gradient.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.760]   Yeah, it's pretty simple.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:54.000]   And honestly, even the tagline, I mean, it's not that-- what was interesting about it is
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.560]   that it responded to the event real-time.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.560]   Right.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.560]   You know, the most clever--
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.800]   No, but it didn't mean to be.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.240]   Although Dunk in the dark, you can still dunk in the dark is pretty good.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.240]   Yeah, I think it--
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.240]   That's a good slogan.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.240]   Yeah, it worked.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.240]   It was fun.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.040]   Much better than cookie or cream.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.880]   No doubt.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.840]   Anyway, yeah.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.680]   This week in cookies.
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:21.640]   Well, I think this just shows that, yeah, you do need a social media command center.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.920]   But what you need is people you trust.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.240]   And-- Because they had about 1,000 people in that room.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.240]   Yeah, because it's--
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.240]   Amen to that stuff.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.520]   But I think that's the best way to do it.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:38.120]   But no big-- no, Bisco is not going to trust anybody to say, "Okay, yeah, here's the Twitter
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.120]   password.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.920]   Just go ahead and tweet there.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.480]   Whatever you say, I'm sure it'll be good."
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.640]   I don't even do that.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.560]   Actually, I do.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:49.360]   I heard Donald Trump on Howard Stern today talking about how he has four people who have
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.240]   his passport for Twitter.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:57.200]   And one of them, he said he fired an assistant because he doesn't-- does he write the tweets?
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.640]   Well, I dictate them, he said.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.160]   Twitter person, come here and take my tweet.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.840]   And so before the game, he said something about congratulating Bill Belichick and the
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.560]   person got it to be Bob Billichech.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.560]   Oh, no.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.680]   He was all mad and had a fit.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.200]   Well, I would too.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.520]   That's why you don't-- yeah.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:24.600]   By the way, I was at Regis and Kelly two years ago or a year ago, and that exact thing happened.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.400]   Regis said, "Get our Twitter person."
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.160]   And there's a full-time person, probably underpaid--
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.880]   It ties him to a box.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.480]   And he says, "Hey, tweet this."
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.600]   And that's exactly what they did.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.640]   I mean, they-- and I imagine that's what a lot of people do.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.880]   What Trump needs to know is that he should let his Twitter people just owe off into his
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.880]   account.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:46.880]   He's a very low-level guy.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.880]   Much easier.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.880]   He wanted to, but of course, sharing his password.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.880]   Or use who's sweeter.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.880]   Or who's sweeter.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.880]   Or who's sweeter.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.280]   He's a social flow or something, yeah.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.760]   Don't give Trump an eight-minute tips.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.760]   Nah, that's true.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.760]   I won't give him any advice.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.760]   He's a social flow.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.760]   For that guy, let him give his password away.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.680]   Meanwhile, there's Applebee's.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.520]   And this is from Tally in our chatroom.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.960]   Applebee's overnight social media meltdown.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.960]   Oh, yes.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.640]   That's a good one.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.640]   So I don't-- I'm seeing this for the first time, Jeff.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.640]   What happened?
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.640]   Waitress, waitress put up.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:23.280]   A minister crossed out the 18% tip and said, "I give to God.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.280]   10% to God.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.280]   Why should I give to you?"
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.480]   Waitress said, "Oh my God, this ridiculous."
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.400]   Waitress's friend, the waitress who got it didn't do it.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.440]   The waitress, the other waitress did it and posted it online.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:38.400]   Applebee's fired that waitress for doing that, for violating policies, da da da da.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.000]   And of course, the world goes nuts.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.480]   Because they're siding with the waitress.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.480]   Yeah, she gets stiffed.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.480]   She did this on her personal Twitter account.
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.480]   OK, not the Applebee's.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.480]   Not Applebee's.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.480]   No, not Applebee's.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.480]   Waitress did it.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:55.720]   It was another waitress who put it up and just showed the picture of the bill.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:00.480]   Chelsea Welch, a colleague of the Stift server-- sounds like a Perry Mason episode-- the
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:05.000]   case of the Stift server-- took a picture of-- it could mean many things-- took a picture
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.560]   of the receipt and uploaded it to Reddit, not to Twitter, to Reddit.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.520]   Oh, yeah, sorry.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.760]   She lost her job.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.360]   Smoking gun, though, preserved the image.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:19.000]   She lost her job for violating a customer's privacy, which I think actually is probably--
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.160]   you can't mock your customers on Reddit.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:25.920]   Yeah, there is issue there.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:30.600]   But of course, as a result, there were numerous boycott Applebee's groups on Facebook, along
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:36.080]   with Rehire, Chelsea, Welch, and other similar groups.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.760]   Applebee's website has a, "What's the Buzz widget that shows what people are saying on
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.840]   Twitter about the company?"
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:46.600]   It's all nonstop attacks right on their own home page.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.000]   People can't help talk about Applebee's every day.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.360]   See what they have to say.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.360]   Applebee, it's been one day.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.360]   This controversy hasn't gone away.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.360]   It won't go away until you hire back.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.520]   Chelsea Welch.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.520]   That's a stir.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.160]   They need a war room.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.520]   Yeah, they do.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.320]   Didn't there just come down a case or at least some kind of ruling about what you can and
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.840]   cannot say that is protected about your employer on social media?
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.840]   Oh, interesting.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.840]   Oh, let's say we've been--
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.920]   It was on the media this last weekend.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.760]   I assume you listen to it every week, I'd like it.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.120]   I do, but I didn't run this last weekend.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.120]   I don't want this.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:24.160]   Well, unfortunately, Applebee seems to have put somebody editing the Applebee's "What's
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.160]   the Buzz widget?"
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:30.120]   Because it's now all nice stuff about Applebee's.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.160]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:36.360]   Here's a really great running on the biggest social media PR fail I've seen in a while.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.840]   Applebee's overnight social media meltdown of photo-essity.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.720]   Okay, so maybe they're not editing this.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.720]   Huh.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.360]   Good for them, actually.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.280]   If you're going to put a buzz, what's the buzz?
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.360]   You probably should just do it unedited, right?
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.360]   Or not.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.360]   What's your advice?
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.960]   Yeah, do it unedited.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.440]   Yeah, do it unedited.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.320]   At least it's authentic then, right?
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:06.880]   That is the National Labor Relations Board weighed in recently about what you can and cannot
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.800]   say about your employer.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:13.040]   And basically what they said before, whatever applies to the water cooler applies at Facebook
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.040]   and Twitter.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:19.320]   But I don't know if this waitress kind of overstepped the bounds of maybe by singling
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:24.960]   out a customer who was then immediately in Reddit style identified through a series of
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.440]   investigative reporter techniques.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.920]   But let's take it further.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.520]   So what if the customer had said something racist?
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.520]   Right.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.600]   You'd probably say, "Well, they deserve it."
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.640]   So you do what you do.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.920]   It's kind of in public.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.680]   The waitress could have just told a friend, it could have been repeated.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.240]   At some point, yeah, I think, importantly, though, that you don't want as a policy your
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.360]   employees mocking your customers.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:54.760]   But at some point, the customer did something boneheaded and probably deserved mockery.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.280]   Here's the article from the New York Times, "Steve and Greenhouse."
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:02.600]   As Facebook and Twitter become central to the workplace conversation, federal regulators
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:07.120]   are ordering employers, employers, to scale back policies that limit what workers can
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.120]   say online.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.120]   Right.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.040]   Which could even affect news organizations.
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.040]   News organizations.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.320]   And LRB says, "Workers have a right to discuss work conditions freely and without fear of
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:20.200]   retribution, whether the discussion takes place at the office or on Facebook."
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:25.000]   So the case that they affirmed was actually from Buffalo was Hispanics United.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   It was a bunch of employees talking about how they had too much to do at work and were
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.600]   being told to do something else.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:36.200]   The one that they said this was a legal firing was a bartender, unhappy about not getting
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.560]   a raise for five years.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:41.760]   And he posted about how the customers were rednecks and he helped they choked on glasses
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.440]   they drove home drunk.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.360]   So don't do that.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:53.520]   On the other hand, there's the Arizona Daily Star reporter who got fired for tweeting because
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.240]   of the lack of news.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.240]   What?
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.240]   No overnight homicide?
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.760]   You're slacking Tucson.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.200]   And you stay homicidal, Tucson.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.360]   Newspaper fired the reporter, NLRB, found the dismissal.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.840]   Legal saying the posts were offensive and not about working conditions.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.840]   How did he say it?
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:11.840]   It's about working conditions.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.840]   He could have said it.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.520]   One of the first reporters fired for failing to get a hashtag going.
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.560]   Interesting.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:27.240]   So if it's legal and it's the kind of thing you might say, "Wow, the water cooler, the
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:30.280]   NLRB will defend you."
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.280]   Theoretically.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.280]   Theoretically.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.280]   You're unemployed.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.680]   Well, this is very narrow to discussing the workplace.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:36.680]   This is an NLR right?
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:37.680]   I'll be thinking.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.480]   So this goes to organizing unions and complaints and so on.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.680]   What if, what about this?
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.680]   Free speech issue.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.320]   Every employer's nightmare.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:51.040]   Employees create a group on Facebook to compare salaries.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:54.860]   Well there are, sometimes you sign a policy, you sign a contract saying that you will not
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:55.860]   reveal your salary.
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:56.860]   Right.
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.180]   But they're not the state employees actually.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.680]   Their salaries are public anyway.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.800]   Yeah, mine's public.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.560]   But a lot of private industry, it's not.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.320]   And people are worried that if the employees knew there would be a competitive workplace.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.240]   Well the other, the other dream of mine is that you go onto a plane and you immediately
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.160]   see what everybody else, everybody else paid for the seat.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.440]   Oh, I'd love that.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.200]   Oh yeah, that would be interesting.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.640]   Oh, I'd love that.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.240]   I'm actually totally for people discussing their salaries.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:25.680]   I think that things like gender pay gaps and, you know, various things get revealed.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.580]   I think when people know what their co-workers are making.
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:41.060]   Interesting article about the Applebee social media meltdown, R.L. Stoller.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:45.220]   .wordpress.com.
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.940]   Social media, fascinating.
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.860]   So back to Google for a minute, if we might?
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.060]   Oh Google, yeah, what the hell?
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.060]   Yeah, Google, we should probably go back to it.
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:55.020]   I'll tell you what, let's take a break and we'll come back to Google.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:58.060]   But I want to tell you about this is actually kind of apropos.
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:45:59.060]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.780]   Actually, LegalZoom is not a law firm.
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:04.540]   It's not going to offer you legal representation.
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:10.580]   What it does is make it possible for you to do a lot of the documents, a lot of the business
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.980]   stuff that you'd want to do, but you don't want to spend a lot of money on a lawyer for
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:18.420]   trademarks, trademark, Chads trademarking his blog name, right?
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.420]   Omgchat.
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.460]   Yeah, you should trademark that.
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:22.460]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:24.780]   You don't want some other OMG Chad to come along.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.940]   We certainly trademarked Twit right away.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.340]   Forming an LLC.
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.580]   That's something I did all by myself.
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:34.900]   I couldn't, when we started Twitter, I was just me, I didn't have a money for a lawyer.
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.180]   But the beauty is you walk through this questionnaire.
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:39.460]   It's very simple.
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:42.300]   It was 99 bucks.

[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:51.620]   Trademarks, copyrights, patents, NDAs, very affordable.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:52.620]   You could do a will.
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:53.620]   Do you have a will?
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:54.620]   You should have a will.
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.620]   You really should have.
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:58.860]   I'm sure that you have a will now, Gina, now that you have a daughter.
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.260]   It's really important.
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.260]   Mm-hmm.
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:02.260]   Yep.
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:05.740]   And it's $69 to establish a will or a living trust.
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:06.740]   That's great.
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:07.740]   Yeah.
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:08.740]   If you want, we'll set you up.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:09.740]   Unfortunately, much more than that.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:10.740]   You went to a lawyer.
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.740]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:12.740]   I did.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.700]   But a lot of this stuff, it's very straightforward.
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.260]   It's really just a simple questionnaire.
[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:18.380]   Step by step.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.900]   If you do get to the point where you go, "You know, I really think I should get some
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:21.900]   legal advice.
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:23.500]   You don't even have to stop using LegalZoom."

[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.060]   All right, Jeff Jarvis, some Google talk.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.420]   Well, there was just all kinds of interesting stuff on Google especially this afternoon.
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.820]   So let me give you a catalog and see where we want to go.
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:39.540]   One is that Google changed ads sense considerably.
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:40.540]   What happened?
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:46.740]   So that you can now combine a campaign across multiple platforms and target to those platforms
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:47.900]   and times and such.
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:49.900]   So I think this is huge in a few ways.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.940]   So if you want to just target people who are within 10 miles of your place only in the
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:49:00.180]   afternoon to push your, you know, your tea time muffins, you can do that and you can
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:01.740]   do that across platforms.
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.700]   So you can go to just people who are mobile on their phones.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:08.820]   So they're going to treat tablets like PCs as if you're sitting on a couch.
[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:10.540]   They're going to treat mobile phones differently.
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.820]   And you can target based on these factors.
[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:14.260]   To me that means a few things.
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:19.060]   One, it starts to get monetization to mobile looking more plausible because now the fact
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.620]   that you're mobile becomes valuable.
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:26.500]   Two, it has a big impact on local advertising because mobile is local.
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:31.540]   And so it's a big change to add sense that I think could have some real impact.
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:36.620]   Meanwhile, as we know, Facebook announced a huge amount of their traffic is mobile and
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:39.820]   the war to try to figure out how to finally monetize mobile starts.
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:40.980]   So I found that one interesting.
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.540]   That's what this strikes me as is a response to Facebook.
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.780]   You know, we're going to compete with Facebook mobile.
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:51.300]   Well, but it's also just, I've been arguing for some time that this is the power of mobile
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.740]   is we know where you are and where you're going and what you want.
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:58.700]   And they've got to make that, they've got to open that up to the advertisers to be able
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.740]   to monetize that and give that value.
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.140]   Greed.
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.980]   And they've been the competitions doing it.
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:05.980]   So they better.
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:06.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:11.000]   So I wonder when Google now is going to pop up a card when I'm nearby my favorite bubble
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.900]   tea place and they've got a special.
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.200]   You like bubble tea too?
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.640]   I love bubble tea.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.320]   It's my new thing.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.320]   It's a bad thing.
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:20.320]   It's just tapioca.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:21.320]   It's good for you.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:22.320]   Yeah, it's happy.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.320]   Okay.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.320]   It's good for you.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:28.440]   But you know, I wonder like I think about things like, I mean, I want these companies
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:31.120]   to crack the monetization not around mobile, right?
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.360]   Because that's where it's going.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:36.160]   And I and I love these services and I would like for them to be around, right?
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.840]   So they have to be able to monetize somehow.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:43.640]   We talked about the four square AMX specials, which I really liked as someone who's generally
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.200]   sort of ignores advertising as a rule.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.760]   I was really into that.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:48.760]   So yeah.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:49.760]   So this is interesting.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:54.160]   But I wonder how things like Google now, you know, which is that kind of on demand,
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.680]   hey, I'm in a location.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:00.960]   I have information for you that might be useful will be, you know, an ad and say, hey, you
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.400]   know, get bubble tea half off, whatever.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:09.160]   Yeah, I think when Google now gives you value that you respond to, that's what it works,
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.160]   right?
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.120]   And, you know, we know what's going to happen.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.320]   It's creepy.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:17.360]   But Google now is in a context where you know what's happening.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:22.240]   And so adding an advertising to that, if there's value in it, if it works for both sides of
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.040]   the transaction, I think makes some sense.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:30.080]   Jeff, I can't hear the word creepy anymore without sort of channeling someone on Twitter
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:33.520]   told me that it was their birthday and they went to the Google.com homepage and the Google
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.560]   Doodle was a birthday cake and it said like happy birthday, Phil.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.560]   What?
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.760]   Yeah, which is which I thought was a new thing.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:41.760]   It turns out it's not.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.160]   They've been doing this for a while.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:47.000]   If you went to your birthday on your Google profile, the Doodle will wish you happy birthday.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.560]   And then someone said, yeah, I got this on my birthday and it was creepy.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.160]   It was cool, but a little creepy.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.160]   And I totally channeled Jarvis.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.160]   You mean by creepy exactly.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:59.400]   Like, let's use more specific language to ruin me, Jeff.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:02.640]   I used to go inside your head.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.360]   You are your inside my head.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.880]   And the other what's the harm?
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:06.880]   That's the other question.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.800]   It's like Jarvis.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:14.280]   No one.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:20.600]   It's creepy because you ascribed a Google attributes of a human.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.600]   I think that's winnable.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.600]   That's all.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.360]   But that's there's another interesting story in the rundown.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.280]   The argument is the Google is getting more empathetic.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:30.000]   And then empathetic design is what we need.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.200]   And I think that's true that even in human Google is now becoming human and we don't
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:40.640]   expect it perhaps of Google, but that's what's going to be necessary for it to understand
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.640]   us.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.000]   Drew all enough writing on TechCrunch.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   Yes.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.760]   And then if you do say that, then you have to really deal with this creepy thing.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:55.320]   I think the creepy thing is more of a societal adjustment to technology that is particularly
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:56.320]   about Google.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.200]   It's about not understanding because we're humans.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:04.440]   So we look at everything like another human, but machines are not humans.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:09.840]   And if a machine knows it's your birthday and computationally puts a greeting up, there's
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.560]   no human involved.
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.880]   Nobody knows anything about you.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.600]   You haven't said it's all automatic.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:20.280]   And I think as we get used to machines doing, you know, we're going to have to robots, autonomous
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:25.240]   vehicles, it's all creepy because it's a machine doing something and we ascribe human attributes
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.240]   to it.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.240]   Okay.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.240]   Really rightly.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:33.280]   And I ran a session in Davos pardon me for place dropping on new social norms.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:38.560]   And I tell my story about fiendish Kodakers lying in the 1890s and talk about how norms
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.160]   or adjustments we make.
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.280]   So what you're saying right then is really interesting is that we're used to when technology
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:47.120]   comes in, we're used to figuring out our human norms around it.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:51.240]   If you have a camera, is it right to do this or that with a camera?
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.240]   Right?
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.240]   But it's the human norm.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.600]   What I said is that we have to have norms for machines.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.760]   It's also the uncanny, uncanny valley, right?
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.760]   Right.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:06.160]   So when you do animation, you want it to be really not human.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:12.240]   You want it to be clearly a cartoon because you make it too close to a human, but not
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.000]   perfect and it's almost impossible to make it perfect.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   It's uncanny.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.640]   It's weird.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.240]   It's like a corpse.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:25.000]   And I think this is built into us, by the way, as a way to protect us from corpses, zombies,
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   aliens.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.800]   I don't know.
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:33.040]   I think it's in the monkey mind that there's something wrong about this thing and it could
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.320]   be diseased, but we got to stay away from it.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:42.480]   And so what looks human but isn't quite human to us is dangerous in our monkey mind.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.840]   And so we have to back off.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.800]   And I think I really think it's at that level.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.720]   And I don't know how you train people around that.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.200]   But I think that's where it comes from.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:55.760]   It's like, we just have to train users that if you have entered your birthday on Google,
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:59.320]   there's nothing surprising about your birthday.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:02.280]   And your logical mind is clearly fine.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.680]   It's no different than Facebook.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:08.680]   It's no different than opening your user profile settings and seeing your birthday there.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:10.400]   It's exactly the same thing.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.040]   You put it there.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.800]   It's technically from a technical and you are a programmer.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:18.120]   So you understand that from a technical point of view, it's the same database.
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.240]   It's the same field.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:23.360]   You filled in the field so that the program goes.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.880]   But to the human, it's not a rational thing.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:26.880]   It's monkey mind.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:27.880]   But there's a difference.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:32.040]   So when I enter my birthday on Google profile, I assume that they're asking me because they
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:34.440]   have to make sure that I'm not a child.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.600]   I assume that they're just asserting that I'm an adult.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:41.640]   I'm not thinking, well, in September, I'm going to get a birthday cake on my homepage.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.000]   It stretches a little bit.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.360]   And now I'm getting used to that idea.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:49.200]   It's just the way that I was surprised the first time that my Facebook wall was covered
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:53.360]   in happy birthday wishes for my friends right on my birthday because I didn't realize that
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.840]   Facebook was telling all my friends.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:59.560]   But you made it uncorrect, unsupported assumption about why they wanted the birthday.
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:00.560]   Well, right.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.560]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:04.560]   They could have wanted it just to be nice to you.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.520]   And maybe it's something as simple as saying when you ask for a birthday, hey, so that
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.400]   we can wish you happy birthday and your birthday.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.400]   Would you enter your birthday?
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:15.000]   Yeah, but the reality is they want to know that I'm a 30-something female so that they
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:20.040]   can advertise to me more efficiently.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.880]   We didn't know that till now.
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:22.880]   No.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.880]   Very high in the 30-something.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:28.040]   We're higher than I'm comfortable.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.520]   Upper 30.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.480]   Upper 30.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:32.480]   So there was that.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:39.840]   There's also that I found interesting that Eric Schmidt, once a day, we forget him so
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:46.720]   soon, said that Google is giving precedence to content from known authors.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:50.480]   And that this has really interesting implications on identity online.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:53.640]   And I think we're all part of the authors program at Google.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:54.640]   That's good for us.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.640]   They know who we are.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:56.840]   It has more precedence.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:58.840]   People think anonymity leads to more crap.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:00.080]   It may be the case.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:05.000]   But interesting there that the argument can be that anonymous content in a revolution
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.320]   or something will get less precedence in search.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.680]   Do they-- does Google say this or somebody just kind of figure it out?
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.680]   Schmidt said it.
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:16.880]   And did he say that the signal was being in their program, the author program?
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:24.000]   No, I don't think that was it, but I think that's clearly the easiest signal they have.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.800]   Could be the page rank does it automatically?
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:28.800]   Yeah, that's what I was saying.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:29.800]   The more--
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:33.840]   Whether you're a recognized author or not, but that's how page rank works, it's not democratic.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.840]   The more people link to you, the more--
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:36.840]   It needs signals.
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:39.120]   And you know, cuts in the company have said this.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:43.920]   We need signals of authority and originality and authenticity.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:51.040]   So the other one is-- this last one, the last one of the Google section, a supposedly leaked
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:54.920]   video of the chromium of the Chromebook Pixel.
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:58:01.800]   Oh, yeah, I saw this in our community on the Google+, yeah, this is cool.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:03.800]   What is the Chromebook Pixel?
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:10.200]   It is a design machine, the videos at the bottom where it's kind of a high-end Chromebook.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.200]   Touch.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:14.880]   And they mentioned that they were going to do a Touch OS.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.640]   We hit kind of-- we kind of question, what do you mean?
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:21.120]   Isn't Android the Touch OS?
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.880]   But no, it's Chrome OS.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:24.880]   Let's see it.
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:26.880]   Is the video worth watching?
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:27.880]   It's--
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:28.880]   Speak through.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:29.880]   Speak through.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.880]   It's--
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:31.880]   This is from Android authority.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:32.880]   Yeah, it's not--
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.880]   It's not like a pulled from YouTube.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:35.880]   I think it did.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:36.880]   And then I think they moved it to the video.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:40.240]   But then I think it's the more where they have it there.
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.240]   OK, you should be there.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:47.240]   Yeah, but first, this word from a sponsor.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:50.080]   Virtually every YouTube video we go to now has pre-roll ad.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:51.800]   And this is a daily motion video.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:53.920]   Except ours.
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:55.320]   Do we not flip that?
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.600]   Do we not flip that?
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:58.160]   You may monetize me button.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.360]   Here we are.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.360]   You get paid.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:02.360]   Yeah, like this.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:05.040]   This is a pixel.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:09.320]   The smallest bit of a picture made from tiny red, green,
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.320]   and blue lights.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.400]   OK, OK.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:14.600]   Now by itself, the pixel isn't much.
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:20.520]   But together, pixels create entire worlds.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:25.480]   You could say, like an atom, a pixel is a building block.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:30.560]   And the more pixels we add, the more wonderful the world.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:36.280]   And from 4 million pixels, we created something new.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:39.480]   The Chromebook Pixel.
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.280]   This is a new kind of computer.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:41.800]   Kind of a lot.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.400]   It's not large entirely by Google.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.760]   It's got pixels.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:48.640]   And we asked ourselves, could this pixel create a new world
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:49.640]   of possibilities?
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:52.000]   Hey, you shooting this bot for the big game, Rich.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:53.520]   Totally.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:54.040]   Yep.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:54.560]   Is that me?
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:55.560]   I have a world.
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:56.560]   What's that sound?
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:58.360]   Totally.
[00:59:58.360 --> 00:59:58.880]   You?
[00:59:58.880 --> 00:59:59.360]   Yep.
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.360]   What's that sound?
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.360]   Quick.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.360]   Close every tab.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.360]   I'm just rolling.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.360]   You can't tweet.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.360]   I'm just rolling.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.360]   There must be you, Chad.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.360]   Yeah, no.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.360]   It's turning it off.
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.360]   It's a tab.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.840]   I'm pretty positive that it is an ad on this daily motion page.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.840]   You're kidding.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.840]   No.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.520]   I'm pretty positive that there's some real thing.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.520]   Oh, crap, Ola.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.320]   Well, anyway, that is the worst ad for a computer.
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.080]   The only thing it told us is something I just mentioned, it's touch.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.440]   But I do think that that's my-- it's my hoping here.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:32.720]   I think that Google has pushed the low end of the Chromebook by getting it to $249.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.120]   By the way, a very nice man named Roger Shelton.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.160]   I think has fixed my problem with the Chromebook.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.800]   The one thing that was driving me crazy about the Chromebook was that it dumps pages all the
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.760]   time because it runs on a memory.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.200]   And he got me to enable something Z-RAM swap.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.680]   So it now uses the memory, the machine better, so it can hold on to pages.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.680]   And I think this is going to work.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.400]   So I'm happy with the machine.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.400]   I'm full time on that machine, basically.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.360]   I told somebody, because we were talking about the Chromebook, when I didn't even remember
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:03.960]   where it was, I was maybe at a football game or something, and I said, "Yeah, Jeff Jarvis
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.160]   is using a Chromebook full time."
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.160]   And they said, "No."
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.160]   Yeah, you are.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.240]   I'm like, "Well, I use Chrome or Chromebook.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.040]   I've got a Mac at the office, but I just use Chrome there.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.280]   I do not use Microsoft and so on and so forth."
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.640]   But I also want to see them push the high end of the Chromebook.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:23.520]   So HP came out this week with an announcement of a new Chromebook for $303, I think, but
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.320]   less battery power.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.960]   Each one is compromising at the low end.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.960]   I wonder what a really good $600 Chromebook would look like.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:37.240]   With a high resolution, it's going to be amazing how many pixels you can't run Photoshop
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.240]   on now.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:43.320]   What do you need a retina display for?
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.000]   I love Chromebooks.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.360]   I just get this kind of anticipation.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.840]   Every time a new model is announced, just like...
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.440]   Maybe I'll get an operating system.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.640]   No.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.000]   I understand the Chrome idea.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.760]   It's just that they're going to put it out there.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.240]   It's going to be really nice screen.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.520]   It's going to be a good price point.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.560]   People are going to go, "Can't run Word."
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:05.560]   I don't care about it.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:06.560]   No, etc.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.920]   Are they wrong?
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.160]   Long estate to follow here.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.160]   Okay.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.400]   Kevin's a big...
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.400]   You love Chrome OS, right?
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.480]   Kevin, you're basically living in Chrome and Chrome OS.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.480]   I do.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.120]   It's just when you get to a certain point, people...
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:27.000]   The argument about what you can and can't do just goes on and on endlessly until people
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.760]   eventually say things like, "Oh, well...
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:31.000]   But then I have to do something."
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   That requires expending calories, which means buying more food.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.760]   And you're like, "Well, I can't help you there."
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.160]   Well, here's a question for you guys.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:43.920]   The other Google announcement, what is it called?
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:47.760]   Where Chrome and Mozilla could talk and video?
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.560]   What was that called?
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.560]   What is that?
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.560]   I saw this story.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.560]   WebRTC.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.880]   It's down under the other.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.400]   Real-time conversation.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.400]   Right.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:03.320]   So it enables just with the browser itself, video and audio.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:06.080]   Does that start to replace Skype for us?
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.920]   Yes, that's the idea.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.920]   Right?
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.120]   It's just built into the browser.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:19.120]   And I think we knew that WebRTC was being heavily used by some Google teams.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.120]   Yep.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:24.200]   That, in fact, who was it that said they were distributed all over?
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:31.520]   And they said that that's basically how we work together through RTC.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.340]   Knocking down Skype is a huge target, especially for Chrome and Chromebook.
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:41.160]   Like, besides Photoshop, maybe Skype is the number one thing that people feel like they
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.700]   can't live without.
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:43.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:44.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:45.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:47.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.700]   You do have Google Talk, but it's true.
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:50.700]   So just ingrained.
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:53.300]   Well, I'll use WebRTC if we can.
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:54.540]   I just--
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:57.540]   It's early still.
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:58.540]   It's in the beta.
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.780]   You have to enable it in a special flags.
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:03.340]   Hey, we're geeks.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.340]   We can do it.
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.340]   We can do it.
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.340]   Well, let's see now.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:10.780]   Remember, they're at the Googleplex, and they're probably using Gigabit Ethernet to do this
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.780]   conversation.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:15.420]   Plus, I look at the guy at Mozilla, and I look at the guy at Google, and he wants poor,
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.420]   and wants rich.
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.420]   Same job.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:19.420]   Interesting.
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:21.140]   So here's-- this is the video.
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.140]   WebRTC.
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:26.300]   Firefox asked me for permission to use the camera and microphone.
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.580]   That's Todd Simpson from Mozilla, the rich guy.
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.380]   More friends at Google.
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.380]   No, poor guy.
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:33.380]   Poor guy.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.380]   Oh, the Google guy is rich.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.380]   How are you?
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:36.380]   A nonprofit guy.
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:37.380]   Great.
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.380]   You're helping yourself.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:39.380]   Grace, it's good to be making the call.
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.380]   Poor, but OK.
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.380]   Chrome and Firefox using WebRTC.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:43.380]   Phil.
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:47.100]   I think for the folks at home, I should start by introducing myself.
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:49.220]   You should start by moving the mouse off your forehead.
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:52.060]   And then I'm working with Chrome media team.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.060]   Maybe that's a hat.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:54.500]   A very small hat.
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:55.500]   Excellent.
[01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.500]   Yeah, and I'm talking about--
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.500]   A little yum-a-cuff.
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:59.500]   A cheap of innovation over at Mozilla, and I love this type of thing.
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.500]   Well, this looks like Skype.
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.060]   I mean, if we could use this, I'd use this.
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:06.020]   I don't have a problem with it.
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.820]   It's using Opus and VP8.
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:09.860]   Those are the video codecs.
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:12.340]   Opus for audio, VP8 for video.
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:16.340]   I'd worry about it being full screen, and us being able to get rid of the--
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:17.340]   It's so funny.
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:19.660]   The little things that we care about are like that.
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:20.660]   Yeah.
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:22.660]   And you can't do that in this in a moment.
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:23.660]   Well, can you or can't you?
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.540]   I don't even understand what I'm looking at.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.860]   Is this looks like a--
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:31.460]   they have they edited these two pictures together, or is this what it looks like on
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.700]   your screen when you're seeing?
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.340]   I don't think so.
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.140]   It does look like you've got the little box.
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:37.700]   They had it together, because you see a box in the box.
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:38.700]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:42.060]   Gina's just being cautious, because she doesn't want to send her a Chromebook in sort
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.260]   of a Mac mini.
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.260]   Exactly.
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:47.460]   We could send you a Chromebook.
[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:50.300]   We could do that.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:55.500]   So it was added to Mozilla Firefox 18, which came out last month.
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:00.180]   They say do use the nightly, because they're still working out bugs.
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:05.620]   Chrome 25 beta, if you want to do it, or later, if you want to do it in Chrome.
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:07.540]   You're on the beta channel for Chrome.
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:10.100]   Are you on the beta channel for Chrome on your Chromebook?
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.100]   Yep.
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.100]   Yep.
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.740]   Not the dev channel, but the beta channel.
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.260]   I should see which version of Chrome I have here.
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.940]   It might be kind of interesting to try it.
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.420]   Maybe for next week.
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:20.420]   Maybe.
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:22.100]   I know we've been trying to get this work.
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:27.180]   The problem I had was I don't know how to control the camera and stuff in the Chromebook.
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:28.180]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:31.500]   You have to sacrifice so much.
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:32.500]   Maybe I can.
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:36.580]   I just-- nice people like Roger Shelton come in, and he wrote this incredibly long email
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:37.580]   telling me how to do it.
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:39.780]   And it was great.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:46.780]   This isn't peer to peer.
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:49.140]   My Chrome browser is calling your Firefox.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.140]   There's something in the middle.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.140]   Good question, Gina.
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.140]   I don't know.
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:55.020]   There'd have to be-- if you don't have-- there'd have to be.
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:58.020]   You'd have to do port forwarding and stuff.
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.620]   You've got to have-- just-- not traversal.
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:03.140]   Probably just a link you had to someone, right, though.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:07.860]   It just comes right to your computer, and Chrome knows what to do with it.
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:09.940]   I'm bearing, I'm saying it is peer to peer.
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:12.620]   RTC peer connection, Octrop, interoperability.
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:13.620]   Signaling.
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:18.260]   All you need is signaling to be managed by a server.
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:20.300]   You could have the call be peer to peer once it's signaled.
[01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:21.300]   Once this is my--
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:22.300]   Gotcha.
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:23.300]   The ASIP is having--
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.300]   OK, that makes sense.
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.660]   Chrome beta channel.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:29.660]   Google's just handing out server space everywhere.
[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:32.140]   Yeah, they can afford it.
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.140]   Nice shot.
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:34.140]   Oh, sorry.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:35.140]   Hello.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:39.060]   Fingers flipped.
[01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:41.860]   And that is why we can't have nice things.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:44.300]   Let's see.
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.900]   Anything else in your-- in your--
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.900]   Sorry, I know about Google.
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:48.900]   I just thought there was Google stuff up there that was good.
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:54.500]   No, I want you to do that because I haven't really had a chance to go through the stories.
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:08:00.900]   I don't think this is-- Google and Disney did a Mondo Chrome thing for the upcoming
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:04.300]   Oz movie, which is kind of interesting.
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:09.140]   And if you're into seeing stretches of HTML and what all it can do, it's kind of--
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:11.180]   that's still the deal.
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.380]   HBO takes down HBO.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:14.380]   Yeah, it's funny.
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:15.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:26.420]   So it's just one more wonderful DCMA story after another.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:31.500]   The request fired on behalf of HBO by a company it uses.
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.580]   It's a product monitor.
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:42.060]   It asked Google to remove links to the eastbound and down section of HBO's online store because
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.020]   it violated HBO's copyright.
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:45.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.860]   That's the eastbound and down too.
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:49.860]   Yeah.
[01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:50.860]   Yeah.
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:51.860]   DCMA, SNM.
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:52.860]   SNM DCMA.
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:57.300]   Oh, that's because all of this is automated.
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:58.300]   It's automated.
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.300]   It's fun.
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:08.620]   Never did get taken down by NBC for showing a video of me on NBC, did we?
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:10.900]   So I guess NBC must be smarter than we thought.
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:11.900]   Or maybe it'll come later.
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:15.540]   A lot of times these takedowns happen for a show that's a year later.
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:17.660]   They just can't keep up.
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:21.460]   Well, I'll go ahead and give up one of my numbers.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.460]   No, no, no.
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.460]   Save it.
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:28.260]   RIAA takedown requests have now added up to $10 million.
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:31.420]   Cheese Louise.
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:35.300]   That's either a statement about how much piracy is going on or how aggressive the RIA is.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.340]   Well, how the RIA needs life.
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:43.260]   Meanwhile, San Francisco is not happy.
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:44.260]   Here's my San Francisco.
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:45.260]   About Google buses.
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:46.260]   Geez.
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:47.260]   They're ruining.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.620]   What is going on?
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:53.220]   They're complaining that the Google buses mean that people from Google and the Valley
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.660]   can work in San Francisco.
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:58.180]   And there goes, it creates more demand for real estate.
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:00.340]   Ergo real estate prices go up and they're ruining it.
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:01.340]   Well, it's true.
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:02.340]   It's very expensive.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:03.340]   Well, yeah.
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.060]   Welcome to a market economy folks.
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:09.820]   But if you're a renter, I mean, if you're a landlord, this is good.
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:10.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:11.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:13.820]   This is typical of the city of San Francisco.
[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:15.820]   Who exactly side are they on?
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:16.820]   Exactly.
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:17.820]   This is why I don't miss the place.
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:18.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:20.820]   Somebody's going to complain about everything.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:21.820]   Everything.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:22.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:25.820]   And so somebody went for me Twitter and said, well, what about this?
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:26.820]   I said, well, what do you want to find?
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:30.860]   Would you prefer a city filled with joblessness and deteriorating real estate?
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:32.660]   You know, moving to Detroit.
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:36.940]   It's not by the way, it's not just Google Apple does the same thing.
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:38.620]   Oh, most of the company does it.
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.980]   And by the way, the buses mean that you reduce the traffic and that's good too.
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:43.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:44.980]   Somebody else can play.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:48.540]   Well, they're too good to take public transit.
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:51.220]   But this looks like an article in the London review of books.
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:53.900]   This doesn't look like the city of San Francisco complaining about this.
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:55.340]   No, it's San Francisco.
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:56.340]   It's a San Francisco.
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.460]   We always find one to complain about something.
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:59.460]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:01.980]   And she's not even writing in a San Francisco or even a US journal.
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:08.340]   She's writing a London review of books.
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:09.900]   How I met your mother?
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.460]   Did you see the Canadian?
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.180]   This is it.
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.380]   This is the spinoff from that.
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:20.480]   So in how I've never seen this show in my life, it was on the plane.
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:26.380]   But I'm laughing because it has the longest bit of Canadian humor I've ever seen on American
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:27.380]   television.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:29.660]   The clip is on that link.
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:34.020]   If you don't know what Tim Hortons is, it's not going to mean a thing to you.
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:37.420]   These donuts look amazing though.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:38.420]   So they are.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:42.540]   So they're Canadian Donut Company named for an expired hockey player by the way.
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:43.540]   Inspired, yes.
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.220]   We might point out the late Tim Hortons.
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:54.760]   So they have all these Canadians, Alan thick and Schafer.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.760]   Geddy Lee from Rush.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:58.760]   It's pretty funny.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:00.680]   So they talk to all these Canadians and it's about a fictional.
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:03.960]   I don't know if she's a character on the show, but she's like, girl on the show and she's
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:04.960]   a sweet singer.
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:05.960]   And then she goes wrong.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:11.440]   She kind of turns into Avril Lavigne, another Canadian and not really.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.420]   And then they're interviewing Paul Schafer and Geddy Lee and all these people.
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:23.300]   And then they say every Canadian knows exactly which Tim Hortons they were in and what Donut
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:26.620]   they were biting into when they heard the news.
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.980]   And everybody was really very funny.
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:34.380]   Geddy Lee says, yeah, Tim Hortons and I don't know, you know, New Brunswick.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:35.380]   Here we go.
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:56.320]   This is a long clip.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.720]   I don't know if you have time.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.720]   Robin is losing fiance.
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:05.360]   If you go fast forward, you'll see Jason Priestley suggesting a donut, which Tim Hortons
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.260]   then we may they made the Priestley.
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:10.700]   He said they named a donut after me and they did.
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:14.180]   It's a Tim, a Tim bit in a donut.
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:19.540]   A Tim bit to Americans translates as a munchkin or a donut hole, basic.
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:21.180]   Oh, donut hole, right?
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:22.180]   Okay.
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:26.060]   I only know this because I spent considerable amount of time in the wastelands of the Great
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:29.660]   White North eating at Tim Hortons.
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:30.660]   I like the mullet.
[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:31.660]   I thought that that was a hockey thing.
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.300]   I didn't realize it was a Canadian thing or is it the same thing, hockey?
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.300]   No, it's not.
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:37.300]   Things you don't know about Canada.
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:43.800]   Or things you don't know about fictional American Canada.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.540]   I wonder if Canadians would be a fit.
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:47.200]   I think probably Canadians would enjoy it.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.200]   It's pretty funny.
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.360]   Canadians, that's what I love about Canada.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.360]   Canadians have a sense that you were by Canadians.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.360]   But here's the interesting thing.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:55.200]   There's a kind of there in America's hat.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:58.760]   Believe it or not, Tim Hortons paid for this.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:03.120]   Our appearance on the How I Met Your Mother episode came as a result of product placement
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.320]   efforts by Tim Hortons.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.080]   Oh, I missed that line.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.060]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:11.320]   This is all more social media marketing.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:16.520]   So then afterwards they go out on Twitter and they announce that they started the Priestley.
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.520]   It's really amazing.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.720]   And all of this is because it's also used.
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:28.520]   Well, you know, what this is is it reflects the failure of generic advertising to drive
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:30.880]   traffic, to drive sales.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:34.200]   They've got to find other ways and everybody knew this day would come where they'd start
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:40.760]   embedding this stuff in the content, creating phony campaigns, complaints.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.920]   For all we know Applebee's made the whole thing up.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:50.640]   So the new advertising model is to pay a show to have its writers come up with crazy
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.640]   self-effacing versions of your product and then you have to make them.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.840]   Then you tweet and you make it happen.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:01.840]   Didn't GE kind of thank 30 Rock on their final episode?
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.760]   You know, like thanks for making us laugh because GE was kind of always like God.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:10.040]   They were in Comcast, cable town, making fun of them right and left.
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:15.000]   I think the people have learned they learned from Letterman that it's okay to have your
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.080]   talent mock you.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:22.960]   There was the first Letterman episode of the GE handshake.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.960]   So Letterman, when the takeover of NBC arrives with GE, of course now they've since sold
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.960]   it to Comcast, but when they took it over, Letterman goes to the GE building headquarters
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.640]   and tries to give them a basket of fruit.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:39.080]   And of course, as a camera crew behind and in those days that was really unusual and
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:40.080]   difficult.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:44.720]   So the poor security guard starts to shake Letterman's hand and then decides not to and
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.280]   the hand goes like this.
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:51.760]   So this was the GE handshake.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.800]   Hang a left.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.960]   Wow.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.960]   Wow.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:57.960]   Wow.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:04.520]   Our last story and I mentioned it more for our own historical reasons than anything else.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:10.920]   Stickam, which was the first service that we used to stream to it way back when is calling
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.920]   it quits.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:15.720]   Stickam was much like you stream.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:19.760]   They were a live free live streaming service.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:22.640]   Justin TV followed.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:29.800]   Now YouTube's offering some streaming and Stickam has decided all of a sudden that the
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.600]   site's going to be closing down immediately and you have till the end of the month to
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:36.200]   log in and download any videos you want to save.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:40.440]   I should probably do that because I bet you some early twits are on there.
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.840]   Oh, Johnny Carson losing all his tapes.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.600]   Kind of sad.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:52.620]   I wonder though, if this has anything to do with YouTube coming in, I wonder if this
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:53.620]   is a live stream.
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:55.600]   I guess you stream and Justin doing all right.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.440]   We still stream on a lot of other services.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:00.600]   We were exclusively on Stickam for a while.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:04.600]   Anyway, sad to hear that.
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.600]   Obviously nobody really cares.
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:09.440]   I'm okay till six.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:12.240]   Well, we're going to wrap it up now.
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.240]   How about boring?
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:14.240]   I'm bored.
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.240]   I'm done.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.880]   We've been going for an hour now.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.440]   One quick Chromium story.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.440]   Yes.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.440]   Chromium, baby.
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:28.380]   The new notification center just got committed to Chromium, which is the open source project
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:32.740]   that eventually gets productized and released as Chrome.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:36.620]   And they're basically like these notifications look like Google Now cards.
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:38.300]   That's where it gets burned.
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.300]   Google Now Chrome.
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:44.100]   Yeah, I'm sort of, you guys know, I'm a little bit of a Google Now fanatic these days.
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:45.100]   It's really, really interesting.
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:48.380]   I think it's kind of the future of the way that Google is going to push information out
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:49.380]   to you.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:51.600]   Like I said, this just got committed into Chromium.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.440]   She's not going to see it in Chrome for a while, but it looks a lot like a Google Now
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.440]   card.
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.120]   There's a screenshot on the story in the next web.
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.800]   So I'm just going to see.
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.120]   How does that get used, Gina?
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.120]   How does that get used?
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:08.200]   Well, you know, you think about, so right before Twig, I have Twig on my Google calendar.
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:10.200]   I get a little kind of pop up notification.
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:11.600]   That's like, it's kind of in line.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.600]   It's yellow.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:15.680]   It just says like, Twig starting in a minute or Twig starting at 1 p.m.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:18.880]   You imagine that that's a really obvious use of this kind of thing.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:23.460]   This kind of notification card of like calendar notifications or chats.
[01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:26.620]   Or somebody wants to call you on RTC.
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:27.620]   Right.
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.620]   So I want to call you on RTC exactly.
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:34.780]   And then you can get into things like, hey, you're nearby, the bubble tea shop.
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:40.060]   You can do all kind of the Google Now stuff, but kind of just based on what's going on
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:41.060]   in the browser.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:45.300]   As the one you call you, the notifications bar on your phone.
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:46.300]   Yeah.
[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:47.300]   Yeah.
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:49.000]   Why shouldn't that be on the browser?
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.560]   I mean, there's a lot of innovation around notifications.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.360]   I mean, I ran growl for years, right?
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.200]   Because I wanted better notifications.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.560]   And I, you know, an OS 10 did a lot of sort of, you know, with their new notification bar,
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:04.040]   which matches iOS and Android has always been kind of in my opinion, kind of superior
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:06.600]   when it came to notifications, rich notifications.
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:11.320]   And so, you know, you kind of see this trickle down into the, into the browser.
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.240]   So I'm, I'm excited about this.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.440]   I want to see this in my, in my Chrome browser.
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.180]   It almost is how did we live without notifications?
[01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:22.380]   Without like good, rich notifications that you could say, show me this, don't show me
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:23.380]   that.
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:24.740]   How did we know anything was happening in our lives?
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:27.420]   Well, it goes, it goes to another angle on this.
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.740]   I can't remember who wrote the story last week, but the idea that the, the, the web
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:33.180]   was the metaphor of a library.
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.100]   It was, you know, books in place.
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:38.740]   And now the web is a metaphor of a, of a stream, a river.
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:42.620]   And if it's a constant flow of information, how do you pluck things out of that that you
[01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:43.620]   need to know?
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:44.620]   Yep.
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:47.160]   And there's, there's value to be had there.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.160]   Mm hmm.
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:49.160]   Right.
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.160]   Right.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:54.320]   So web apps have an opportunity to push out, push out a notification, you know, in a standard
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.320]   way.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.480]   That's, that's kind of a, that's, that's really nice.
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:01.360]   And you think, I mean, a lot of the web apps that you use already have the little notification
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:04.960]   bar, hey, you've got a new message, hey, new activity, you should know.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:08.820]   So you can see them all kind of using this, this new notification scheme.
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:11.760]   I hope this becomes kind of a standard thing, not just a conversation.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:17.340]   The other good thing about it, it goes back to the problem of, of email that, uh, about
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:21.720]   women taught me years ago, which was, which was the problem with emails, the sender controls
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.760]   in notifications, the recipient controls.
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:29.440]   Ah, you're an exciting, who may notify you about what?
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.400]   And in fact, I wish Google and I would not find it out more things, right?
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.400]   But, but I'm choosing that.
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:37.880]   I think it's really, really important to, to this, this interruption.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.040]   Mm hmm.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:40.040]   Right.
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:41.040]   Controlling your own interruptions.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.000]   I'm actually kind of anti notifications.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.320]   I turn off most notifications on my phone.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:50.120]   What's that, Jeff?
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:58.840]   I'm just fixing your sound.
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:03.120]   Doesn't seem to help.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.680]   Something happened.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:08.480]   It sounds like you're underwater.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:12.760]   It's not a problem.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:16.600]   You may need to unplug and replay your, no, you think it's that or just bandwidth issue?
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.400]   It's just bandwidth.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:23.120]   No, I need to come over there and hit, hit whatever it is you're using.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.120]   So do I unplug?
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.120]   Oh, better.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.200]   That's better.
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:31.600]   I'm glad I fixed it.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:35.680]   Video conferencing and printing is like still 2013.
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:39.440]   We have not figured this out.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:41.320]   So how could I use WebM?
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.040]   I mean, WebRTC to call you.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.480]   I'd love to do that.
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:48.520]   Chad and I never even have done, you know, just the Google talk.
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:51.120]   I just, I have chroma and repeat it.
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.120]   I agree.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.120]   I agree.
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.120]   I updated it.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:55.720]   I'll have to figure that out.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:01.800]   There's a demo site from, there's a link in that, in that article, in the next WebRTC.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.320]   Maybe if I Googled WebRTC.
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:05.320]   WebRTC demo.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.320]   It's WebRTC.org/demo.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:10.280]   It didn't load for me, though.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:14.720]   It makes me think about new ways to do, I don't know, if you build it, you got to build it
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:15.720]   into an app.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.000]   But if you build it into an app, it's kind of a talk wall.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.760]   You could imagine doing some neat things with it.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:22.760]   Oh, I see.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:26.360]   Are those the standards that Google Hangouts are built on, too?
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.360]   Is it compatible with that?
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.360]   Yes, actually it is.
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.360]   It's VP8 and Opus.
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.360]   Right.
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.360]   Yes, I believe it is.
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:34.080]   Chrome and Firefox can have talk.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.800]   Do I need to install a plugin?
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:37.800]   It's an API.
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.240]   No, we need to have version 25 of Chrome.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.520]   Yeah, I've got that.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:46.160]   Then I think there's a flag you have to put on.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.120]   I have a couple of flags, where's my Niners flag?
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.120]   I don't know.
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.680]   Okay, well, I'll have to read this.
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:54.680]   Maybe next week we could do it, though.
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:55.680]   Pretty cool.
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.920]   WebRTC is now live in Chrome 23.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.920]   No flag needed, no special Chrome build.
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.880]   Required.
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:06.240]   That was in November.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.240]   I'm confused.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.480]   Yeah, that was a while ago.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.480]   I'm running for 25.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:14.840]   Yeah, there's an API.
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.800]   I'll be see Freeware.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.840]   Free speech codec for robust code.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.200]   It always makes me nervous.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:26.360]   There's in the chat room, people are appRTC.appspot.com.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.360]   So it is an app.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:32.520]   Well, I guess it's an app that would take advantage of this, but it's a function.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:33.520]   AppRTC.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:37.120]   Okay, I mean, they are now.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.600]   Oh, it wants to use my camera on my microphone.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:40.600]   Oh, allow that.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.200]   I would allow it to.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:44.760]   Now, Jeff, okay, here's what you do.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:45.760]   Oh, what?
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:48.480]   No, it's failed to get access because my camera is already in use.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.280]   I don't want to mess it up.
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:51.280]   Oh, there's Chad.
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.280]   How'd you get there, Chad?
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.280]   Are you doing it?
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.360]   Same thing, waiting for someone to join.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:58.040]   So I can send you a link.
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.920]   I'll give this to the chat room.
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:00.920]   Okay.
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:01.920]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:02.920]   Nothing.
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.800]   I'll just paste this link to the chat room.
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:09.880]   Now, you have to be using Chromium.
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.040]   There's my link.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.320]   I see other people in here too.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.920]   You have to be on 25 beta.
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:15.920]   There's my link.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.120]   Let's see how long before somebody calls me.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.320]   How exciting is this?
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.720]   I'm going to post mine into the chat.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:23.320]   What's your address to call?
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.320]   026055160.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.960]   Yeah, I got it.
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:28.920]   You'll have a number.
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:29.920]   Oh, see somebody's calling.
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:30.920]   Chad, show the screen.
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:31.920]   Whoa.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.920]   Hey, hey there.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.200]   You're the lucky winner.
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:39.040]   You got a 49er-
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.040]   News use ticket.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.040]   I just looks now.
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.280]   We got to figure out how to get this out of here.
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:44.280]   It's lower.
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:45.920]   But this is a reference app.
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:46.920]   It's an API chat.
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:49.920]   So all we have to do is write our own software.
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:50.920]   Yeah.
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:51.920]   Okay.
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.080]   So we would just write our own full screen software.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.520]   I can't hear you, but I think that's probably my problem.
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:59.560]   Because we were having audio issues where we went.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:04.000]   So I did a link in the doc chat, Leo.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000]   Okay.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   Shall I call you?
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000]   I'm going to hang up.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000]   Thank you, caller.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000]   Appreciate it.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000]   We never found out who you were.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000]   First time, caller, first time app.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   First time and goodbye.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.400]   First time, last time.
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:15.400]   Okay, I can't hang up.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:16.400]   The hang up button.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:17.400]   There we go.
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:18.400]   There it goes.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:19.400]   I've left the call.
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:22.200]   Now, what's interesting is it looks like I can just share a link.
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.520]   Yes, it's just a link.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.000]   That's so neat.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.520]   So or you could even give out the number because a link has a...
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.360]   A standard form.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.920]   So in the doc chat, highlighted Pink Highlight.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.680]   I see it.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.680]   I see it.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:41.080]   All right, let me click this link in my Chrome.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.960]   From the bleeding edge.
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:45.480]   Yes, this is exciting.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:47.000]   AppRTC.appspot.com.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.880]   So what we'd need to do is write a little app of our very own.
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:52.880]   Hello, chat.
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:53.880]   Hey, I'm going to...
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:54.880]   I'm going to...
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:55.880]   Oh.
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:56.880]   Oh.
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:01.400]   So show my screen.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.200]   So there's your screen.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.200]   There's your screen.
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.200]   Oh, wow.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.200]   He's getting fancy now.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.120]   There's a screen within screens.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.640]   Did you just show the full screen?
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.840]   Because that confuses the like the hell's bam.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.840]   Yeah, this is my laptop screen right now.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:16.840]   And we...
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:17.840]   Oh, I just went full screen.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.840]   Wow.
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:19.840]   Yeah, there's my full screen.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:20.840]   How did you do that?
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:21.840]   I double clicked it.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:22.840]   Oh.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:23.840]   So if I double click you...
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:24.840]   Oh, you did it.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.840]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:26.840]   So now we...
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:30.160]   Now it's not quite what we want because we still want to get rid of that in the picture
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:31.160]   in the picture.
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.160]   You could write that all about.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.160]   I'm sure we get rid of that.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.360]   And we're both in 4x3, which is no.
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:36.360]   That's all right.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.360]   It still...
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.360]   It looks pretty good.
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.360]   That's amazing.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:44.720]   This would have saved me carrying a 10-pound machine to Davos.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.720]   Exactly.
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:46.720]   Because this...
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.520]   Well, I don't know if Chrome OS has the requisite version.
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:51.520]   25.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:53.520]   Yeah, it has the beta channel.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.520]   Yep.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.520]   Beta 2.
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.520]   You're not.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.800]   No, that's the thing.
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:08.000]   If it was in Chrome 23, can you turn my mic off and turn the audio on from your computer?
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.240]   Let's just hear what the audio sounds like.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:14.480]   Things we care a lot about is audio.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.680]   It's okay.
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:16.680]   It's not great.
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:18.840]   Now I'm talking to my laptop, so I have to talk to you.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:19.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:20.840]   That's the problem.
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:21.840]   You got to...
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:22.840]   I'm gonna hit that.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:24.840]   So...
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:25.840]   ...a little bit of trouble.
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:26.840]   Well, but...
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:31.340]   This should be able to pull whatever we plug into it.
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:32.340]   Right.
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:33.340]   Yeah.
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:34.340]   Right.
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:35.340]   So...
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:38.120]   Now I don't have to send Gina a new Mac mini.
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.120]   See?
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.120]   There we go.
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:41.120]   I know.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:42.120]   I'll show you that.
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.120]   Yay!
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:44.120]   It's a...
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.360]   You know, this is the problem with open source codecs.
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:50.360]   Often, they prioritize for bandwidth not for quality.
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.120]   One of the things we like to back up...
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:53.120]   All my Chromebooks...
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:54.120]   Start using Skype so early.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:55.120]   Try it.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.120]   You got to call it.
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.000]   Can I call it Jeffrey?
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000]   So it's 1-6-4.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.760]   Oh, wait, wait.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.760]   Maybe you should just put it...
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.760]   Unduct check.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.480]   Isn't it only good that it must be once?
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.480]   All right.
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:08.480]   Hold on.
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:09.480]   Well, I just think a lot of people would try to call it.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:10.480]   Oh, I see.
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:11.480]   Okay.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:12.480]   I got it.
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:13.480]   Got it.
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:14.480]   Got it.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.480]   Got it.
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:16.480]   Hold on.
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:17.480]   One second.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:18.480]   One second.
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.480]   One second.
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:20.480]   Are you...
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.480]   Now you're not using your Chromebook for this, so you should be able to do that.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:22.480]   Oh, that's right.
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:23.480]   That's exactly why it won't.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.480]   I don't know what it means, but we got 10 minutes.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.080]   You got 10 minutes to the birthday party.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.080]   Got it.
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:28.080]   Send it to you, Chad.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:29.080]   Okay, while they're working on this, I'll tell you what, Chad.
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.680]   Let me do a hover commercial while they're working on this.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:32.680]   Good idea.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:35.560]   And I'll let you guys continue on.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:39.440]   Just show my screen and I'll show you hover.com.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.440]   Actually, it's...
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.440]   There we are.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:43.440]   Sorry.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.240]   Hover.com/twig.
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.240]   So what is hover?
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:53.440]   Hover is the alternative to bar Rafaeli kissing a nerd making loud slurping sounds.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:59.760]   It is the better way to register your domain and register your disgust.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.280]   Isn't that nice?
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:05.840]   You can register a domain and you're disgust at the same time with hover.com.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:09.480]   I think the folks at Two Cows, who are nice Canadians, by the way, and love their Tim
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:14.200]   Hortons, they said there's got to be a better way than the way some of these other registrars
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.200]   are doing.
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.200]   You know, you've had the experience.
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:19.480]   You go, you register domain name and then 50 clicks later, you finally got it because
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:21.120]   you have to say, "No, I know I don't want that service.
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.640]   No, I don't want that service.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:23.640]   No, I don't want that service."
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:25.200]   Not with hover.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.440]   Very simple.
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.680]   You're given the domain name.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:31.120]   Within two clicks you own it.
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.120]   It's affordable.
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:40.480]   They've got all the TLDs, you know, the top level domains you'd want, like.com.net.org.tv.pro.mobi.biz.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:45.200]   Country codes as well.us.ca.uk.asia.
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:49.080]   And by the way, because a lot of the .com addresses people want are not available, they
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:50.960]   will also suggest .net addresses to you.
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:54.640]   A lot of times the .net is really a great alternative to .com.
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:56.200]   Everybody recognizes it.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.200]   You don't have to explain it.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:01.600]   Even with Twit.tv, we often have to say, "No, it's not Twit.tv.com.
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:02.600]   It's Twit.tv."
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:04.280]   You don't have a problem with .net.
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:09.520]   Great support, great documentation, tutorials, forums.
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:11.920]   It is great for email.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:14.640]   They don't do hosting and they're not going to upsell you on the hosting, but it's very
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:18.640]   easy to use it for a website and set it up.
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:21.560]   They have a great, by the way, support policy.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:27.320]   When you call their toll-free number 8667316566, that's right on the webpage.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:28.520]   You don't have to remember that.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:33.840]   For support, you will get a support representative live, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern, Monday through
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.720]   Friday, and they will not put you on hold there and powered to fix your problem and
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:38.720]   get it done.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:39.840]   You know, "Oh, let me talk to somebody."
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:41.520]   No, they'll do it all.
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.840]   I am a big fan of Hover.
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.760]   All my domains are now registered at Hover.
[01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:45.760]   I moved them all over there.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:50.800]   They have a great concierge service to make that possible, very nice domain management
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.440]   console.
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:55.480]   And by the way, one of the reasons they don't have to upsell you so much is because they
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:57.040]   have built in who is privacy.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.800]   They know you're going to want that, so they just include it.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.320]   I wish you would try this.
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:07.600]   You can let those other companies know there's a better way.
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.600]   Hover.com/twig.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:14.000]   By the way, you'll get 10% off your domain name registration when you use that URL.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.880]   Hover.com/twig.
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:20.320]   All right, can we see Jeff now on his Chromebook?
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:21.320]   We can, indeed.
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:22.320]   We can.
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.320]   So here it is.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:24.560]   Oh, it looks just exactly.
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.080]   Actually, wait a minute.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:28.360]   That looks better than Skype.
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:31.800]   It's a better than Skype.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:34.960]   It's a stupid Chromebook camera.
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:35.960]   It's no worse.
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:38.640]   Frame rates a little slower, but it's not nearly as pixelated.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:41.320]   Sounds the same.
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:43.920]   I think we can start with the M Audio work.
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:44.920]   I guess it would.
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:45.920]   I bet you the Chromebook supports.
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:46.920]   I've got to play with that.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:47.920]   I don't know about it yet.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:48.920]   You're hearing me on it.
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:49.920]   You're hearing me on it.
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:50.920]   Okay.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.640]   So Kevin Purdy says it works.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:57.560]   Well, see, that's what I-- there is no way for me to talk to the browser to say only
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:59.320]   use this audio interface.
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:05.400]   And at the moment, this app doesn't-- or this web app doesn't have any integration for
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:07.080]   me to say, choose this one over a different one.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:09.320]   Well, this is, again, this app is just an example.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.320]   Right.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.320]   So, I think it's a good spot.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.320]   You could-- they have an API.
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.920]   And the point is, I think, that they would encourage you to write it wrong.
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:15.920]   Right.
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:16.920]   We just need a programmer.
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:21.720]   I don't even know how to just use the-- you know, use my headset.
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:25.320]   You should be able to just plug it in, right, Kevin?
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:29.320]   You know, most USB headsets in the most Chromebooks, yes.
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.760]   Now, the question is, would the web RTC use it?
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:34.400]   I guess it would.
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.480]   And you know, the good news is Google dog foods this.
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:43.520]   I mean, they've been using RTC to get work done for a long time.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.520]   Try again.
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:45.520]   No.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:50.680]   No, I don't think so.
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:53.080]   You might have to start a new call for that.
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:57.280]   Well, you guys are 0.1 alpha testing live on the air.
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:03.000]   Hey, tell me in the chat room that when you allow camera audio use, there is an options
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000]   drop-down.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.800]   It's with device selection, and it is in the API.
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:12.560]   So the first time-- so we really-- what we should do is use this API to write our own
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:13.560]   tool.
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:16.520]   Among other things, what it could do is local recording.
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:19.640]   So if there were audio issues, we could get the local audio.
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:23.000]   You know, open source option.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000]   I will--
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000]   Boy, I would be very interested.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000]   --it would be very interesting.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.280]   Kevin, as BLC, you have to have a programmer.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:30.280]   This is cool.
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.000]   This is really interesting to see.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.480]   And Gina, what is it in?
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:40.200]   Would you write it in C or Python?
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.600]   I mean, it's just an API.
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:43.600]   I guess you could write it--
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.600]   And this is an API.
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:45.600]   You can write it whenever you want.
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.600]   Java?
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:48.600]   I hate to do it in Java.
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:49.600]   It's not Java.
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:50.600]   I couldn't do it in JavaScript.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:51.600]   It's JavaScript.
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:52.600]   It's HTML5.
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:57.200]   I got a whole bunch of command before I can't get back.
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:00.120]   I don't remember how I got it.
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.880]   Don't worry about it.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:02.880]   All right.
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:03.880]   OK.
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:04.880]   Enough.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:05.880]   This is good.
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:06.880]   This is a good thing.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:07.880]   This is good.
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:08.880]   This is a good thing.
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:11.880]   And the fact that you're able to do both at the same time is a good thing.
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:12.880]   Yeah!
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:17.480]   For those listening on audio, just be glad.
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:22.280]   And now it's time for our tool, our tip, and our number of the week starting with a
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:23.280]   tip from Gina Trapani.
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:29.120]   This is a cool little Google Drive feature that I was unaware of.
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.520]   I guess it's been around for a while.
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:33.920]   Kevin actually has written this up in Fast Company, so I'm hoping he's going to back
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:35.000]   me up.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.800]   You can host web pages publicly on Google Drive.
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:40.520]   So what you do is you upload a folder.
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:41.520]   What?
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:42.520]   Yeah, I know.
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:43.520]   I'm crazy.
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:44.520]   I'm excited about this.
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:45.520]   Certain kind of web pages.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:49.160]   So you upload a folder and it's got to have, say, an index.html file.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:52.480]   And you can include CSS and JavaScript for your need.
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:54.160]   And then you can share that folder.
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:59.680]   And in the share options, there is an option to share publicly on the web.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:01.240]   And then you will get a URL.
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:07.280]   That's something like Google Drive.com/host and then some long folder name.
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:08.280]   And your site.
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.520]   So Kevin, you wrote this up on Fast Company.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:13.400]   In fact, you put together a little bootstrap based site.
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:19.240]   We've strapped his Twitter's HTML framework for making nice looking websites pretty quickly.
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:20.640]   This looks really nice.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.920]   This is pretty simple, matter of like, putting the folder to drive and then setting it to
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:26.920]   pop up.
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:32.360]   So anything that any site that basically is just text, images, CSS, and JavaScript can
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:33.560]   run off of Drive.
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:39.360]   Now, to get it published, you have to-- there's a complicated way of doing it through the
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:40.360]   API.
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.480]   And there's just a hacker way of modifying the URL.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:46.120]   So you have to kind of know how to create a folder in Google Drive and modify the URL
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.240]   to give out the right one.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:55.560]   But yeah, it's pretty great for testing sites, you know, and seeing how it looks to people.
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:58.800]   And it's pretty neat.
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:35:59.800]   One interesting use of this.
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:03.240]   So you can't upload PHP scripts or Python scripts or anything like that, right?
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:04.240]   But what do you think this--
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.240]   I don't think so.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:06.240]   No PHP, I know that.
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.240]   No PHP, I know that.
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:08.240]   They have to be just kind of flat HTML files.
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:13.200]   But I heard one person said that they downloaded their Twitter archive, which actually comes
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:17.480]   as a package of HTML files that you can search through and things and just uploaded it to
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:18.480]   Drive.
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:19.480]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:22.600]   So, you know, they can kind of make their Twitter archive public and anybody can search
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:23.600]   through it.
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:24.600]   It's got that nice search and stuff.
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:29.080]   So I think Facebook also offers a download with an export, which is just all HTML.
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:32.480]   Basically anything that's like a package, a folder full of HTML files that you want to
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:35.840]   quickly share, you can put this on Drive and make public on the web.
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:39.720]   Dropbox does offer something similar, but I just-- I didn't know the Drive did it.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:44.160]   So that was one of my fun little discoveries on Drive.
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:45.600]   And I guess this has been around for a couple of months.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:48.400]   I just didn't know about it.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:49.400]   Very cool.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:52.840]   Is there somewhere we can go to figure out how to do this?
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:59.120]   My hacker had a good post that explained how to do it and included the URL hack.
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:03.680]   I love the idea of downloading my Twitter, hosting my own Twitter account on Google.
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:06.040]   Yeah, I don't think it's a hack anymore.
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:07.840]   I think when you just share your folder--
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:08.840]   It just happens.
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:12.160]   You share a folder and the visibility options are private.
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.640]   Anyone with a link or public on the web.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.000]   And you just public on the web.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:17.960]   And then--
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:18.960]   Mm.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:19.960]   So wow.
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:25.000]   And it supports JavaScript, CSS, HTML.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.960]   So it sounds like almost any web page would work fine.
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:28.960]   Actually you're right, Kevin.
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:33.520]   You do have to kind of get the URL, to get the public URL, which kind of involves a
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:34.520]   long customer.
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:39.360]   Yeah, but there's a commenter on the life hacker page that's just titled Host Web Pages on
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:40.360]   Google Drive.
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:44.920]   And one of the commenters is like, just share the folder, remove all the nonsense from the
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:46.520]   URL and pretend this.
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:48.120]   So still a little hacky.
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:49.120]   Not too bad.
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.120]   Yes.
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:53.840]   So Google Host Web Pages on Google Drive at Life Hacker.
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:55.800]   The full instructions are there.
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:56.800]   Sure.
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:00.360]   And then you just modify your hover domain registration to point to that page.
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:01.360]   Yep.
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:02.360]   Yep.
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:03.360]   As you go.
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.360]   Talked about product placement.
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:05.360]   Bottom.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:06.360]   You're so good.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:09.680]   You could work at Tim Hortons.
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:11.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:17.440]   Did you-- Kevin, Purdy, find anything you wanted to tell us about?
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.880]   Yeah, sure.
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.760]   So I play ingress.
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:23.440]   I'm sorry to admit that.
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:24.480]   I should have played at New Orleans.
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:25.960]   I didn't even think of it.
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:27.920]   I have to apologize to Post Office Library.
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:29.480]   God knows where you would have ended up there early.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:30.480]   Oh, good thing.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:32.560]   It's much better if you're in a big metropolitan area.
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:35.840]   Buffalo is an ingress hotbed, Kevin?
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:39.640]   We are fighting the Enlightenment every day.
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:44.320]   So downtown got taken over and all the blue folks moved out to the suburbs.
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:46.000]   It's like weird kind of blue flight.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.280]   Don't-- let's not even talk about it.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.280]   So--
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.280]   Blue flight.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:54.040]   There's a really good blog post called the Demographics of ingress.
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:59.360]   And it was based on a survey, very unscientific, that someone just posted to Google+ Twitter,
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:04.360]   IRC, Reddit. So a little bit of self-selection in a self-selecting game.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:09.560]   But ingress the Google game that is kind of geo-based and everything.
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:13.360]   It's a really, really great post that talks about not only just kind of the some things
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:20.600]   you'd assume, like the breakup of gender, which is, I believe, mostly male.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.240]   Angle file males are kind of the main players of the game.
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:25.040]   And let's see.
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:29.960]   13% libertarian, which kind of breaks normal population stats.
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:31.880]   7% anarchist.
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:35.040]   But then it gets really interesting as you go through, because you find out, like, how
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:38.200]   many more people say that they're walking more because of ingress?
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:41.720]   How many more people are seeing public places they wouldn't have seen before?
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:42.720]   24% of the--
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:44.720]   Lots of post offices.
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:48.920]   24% have gone slightly to find a new spot.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:49.920]   And like--
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:50.920]   Sighling is a good way to do ingress.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.560]   You need to get around fast.
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:53.560]   You need mobility.
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:54.560]   Oh, exactly.
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:57.440]   So that points out how many people have said they've driven somewhere to play ingress,
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:00.840]   which I'm sure is not Google's idea of a great blah, blah, blah.
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:02.080]   It's a really cool post.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:06.600]   It talks all-- it gives you a great idea of a look at what is happening in ingress, who's
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:09.720]   playing it, how they're playing it, how often.
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:13.920]   And it opens up a very kind of quietly developing game.
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:18.120]   So the demographics of ingress, and that was on space druid.com.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.680]   Yeah, very interesting.
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:22.800]   I saw someone playing.
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.560]   And Petaluma, when I walked outside of the studio.
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:27.000]   And it was crazy.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.600]   It looked like you're really insane.
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:32.360]   Because they were walking by, and their phone was talking to them, going, oh, man, I don't
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.360]   know my other--
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.800]   Oh, you turn off sounds, the thing you do when you get the game.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:36.800]   Oh, really?
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:38.640]   Oh, because I haven't done that yet.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.640]   You should.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:40.640]   It's kind of embarrassing.
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:44.080]   You need to talk about your boss that way.
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.080]   Oh, sorry.
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:48.080]   In fact, you really pretty much sound like a terrorist.
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:51.800]   It sounds like you're getting instructions from going the office.
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:55.000]   Go to the node and hack it.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.880]   You're just trying to find a certain point on a school property, whatever.
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:00.040]   What's the big deal?
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:02.320]   What's the big deal?
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.440]   I think it's an interesting game.
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:04.440]   There's a very good ingress community.
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:05.440]   A acquiring position.
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:06.440]   Lock on established.
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:09.160]   That doesn't sound at all bad.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.160]   Downloading latest intel package.
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:12.160]   Look at that.
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:16.360]   It's been a long time since your last login.
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:17.360]   I know.
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.360]   I was getting worried about you.
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:19.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:20.360]   I've been busy.
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:24.040]   So now I'm not anywhere near.
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:27.960]   Petaluma is so small, there's really no point in playing the game.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:30.120]   There's only like, it's a triangle.
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:31.120]   There's three points.
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:32.120]   Are you in chat at the same--
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:33.800]   They don't work in your office.
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:34.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:36.000]   Well, it doesn't use our office.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.360]   It uses the post office, the fire station.
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.360]   Right chat?
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.360]   It's like, yeah.
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:42.360]   Yeah, it's put public places.
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.360]   Yeah.
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:45.640]   Are you in chat in the same faction?
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:47.520]   I am in the resistance.
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:48.520]   Resistance.
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:49.520]   Yeah, we are.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:50.520]   We're blue.
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:51.520]   What?
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:52.520]   You're enlightenment?
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:53.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:54.520]   Enlightened, baby.
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:55.520]   What?
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:56.920]   No, you're not enlightened.
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:58.520]   That's just a misnomer.
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.520]   You actually are the man.
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:02.520]   How could you say you're enlightened?
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:03.520]   I'm sorry I talked about this before.
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:08.000]   I think the idea was to make either side seem like it could be the good guys or the
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.240]   bad guys, but it's very vague.
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:14.520]   It's a free game, but you have to get an invite and apparently they're still not public,
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:17.520]   so good luck.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:23.240]   Nice to see new greens down near Petaluma.
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:25.120]   Gives my boys something to look forward to.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:26.120]   Oh boy.
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:30.240]   I think the war is on.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.520]   So you turn off the sound right away.
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:33.440]   I should have done that.
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:34.440]   It's just weird.
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:39.560]   By the way, another point from this article, the average amount of money people spent playing
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:40.720]   in Greece is $80.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.720]   Geez.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:43.360]   I don't know what that sounds like.
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:47.120]   If you count driving costs, you know, going to coffee shops they wouldn't have gone to
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.120]   do and things like that.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.280]   That's a number.
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:52.280]   But let's get the real number of the week from Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:57.680]   Well, because I forgot what they do with my son, I won't go into the launch into a
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:04.760]   long screed about how the French blackmailed Google and to give him €60 million to develop
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:07.240]   the future of newspapers, I won't go into that.
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:11.720]   Instead, how could I not on this show of all shows have as the number week?
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:13.920]   The largest prime number yet discovered.
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:22.920]   17,425, 170 digits is two times itself times of five hundred five thousand.
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:25.720]   I'm sorry, two multiply by itself.
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:27.720]   Fifty seven thousand eight hundred eighty five.
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:28.720]   Sorry.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:29.720]   All right.
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:31.320]   Well, two multiply by itself.
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:36.320]   Fifty seven million eight hundred eighty five thousand one hundred sixty one times minus one.
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:37.320]   Wow.
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:40.320]   Well, under the power of that minus one of that.
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.320]   Yes.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.320]   Wow.
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:44.320]   The largest prime number yet discovered.
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:46.240]   Our number of the week is actually twenty one.
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.600]   That's Jake Jarvis's birthday.
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:49.600]   Happy birthday, Jake.
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:51.160]   We'll see you later, Jeff.
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:52.560]   Happy birthday, Jake.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:53.560]   Take care.
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:56.600]   Jeff Jarvis, author of what will Google do is latest is public parts.
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:59.760]   And of course, he's a professor of journalism at City University of New York and blogs at
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:04.120]   Buzzmachine.com and has to go celebrate a birthday.
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:07.680]   Not exactly a tool, but you might want to update your Android version of Twitter.
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:11.520]   They pushed out a new one as well as mobile.towater.com.
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:17.200]   It all looks like the website now with embedded photos and unfortunately embedded things like
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:25.240]   trends, obviously sponsored links, all of that in a single stream on the iPhone and Android.
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:30.360]   So it has begun also new search results with a mix of tweets, photos and accounts all in
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:32.480]   one stream that's in the discover.
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:33.800]   It's kind of like the discover.
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:38.240]   I'm sorry, stream and new search button on the iPhone allowing you search from anywhere
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:40.040]   within the app.
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.840]   We already had that on the Android, so they finally added that.
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:44.440]   Are the notifications better?
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:46.840]   I'm so tired of getting new interactions.
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:47.960]   I just turned them off.
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:48.960]   I don't want to know.
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:49.960]   They're useless.
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:50.960]   They're useless.
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:52.960]   The only thing I want to know is a new direct message.
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:53.960]   Yep.
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:56.800]   That's the only thing I pay attention to.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.760]   Thank you, Gina Trapani.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:44:59.760]   Thank you very much.
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:00.760]   Fun show tonight.
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:02.520]   Your Mac Mini is in the mail.
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:03.520]   Thank you very much for that.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:04.520]   I appreciate it.
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:05.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:06.840]   Yeah, we don't want to pixelate it.
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:08.800]   We want a great Gina.
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:14.400]   We're going to investigate this new web RGC because I think that looks kind of good.
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:19.520]   Thanks to Kevin Purdy for joining us, the author of the ultimate guide to Android.
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:20.520]   Complete Android.
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:21.920]   Complete Android guy, whatever it was.
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:23.920]   Complete Android guide.
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:25.920]   Festidious Android compendium.
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:28.800]   That book, you know, at completeandroidguide.com.
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:29.800]   That's right.
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:36.000]   And also blogging an IT world about mobile and wireless in Android all the time.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000]   And occasionally putting up fake websites, a fast company.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.800]   Very good.
[01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:43.520]   Nice to have you.
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:44.520]   Thank you.
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:45.720]   Thank you for joining us, everybody.
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:51.760]   We do this show Wednesdays, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time 2100 UTC on Twit.tv.
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:54.080]   Watch live if you can, but if you can't, don't worry.
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:59.160]   On-demand audio and video available after the fact, as always, at Twit.tv/Twig.
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:04.040]   You can also watch the video on YouTube, YouTube.com/Twig.
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:06.040]   This week in Google?
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:08.040]   This week in Google, okay.
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:09.040]   And, uh...
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:10.040]   Nope, of course we're a minor pod.
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:11.040]   It is Twig.
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:12.040]   It is Twig.
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:18.040]   And we're a final podcaster, aggregated like iTunes and so forth.
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:19.040]   Dogcatcher.
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:20.040]   Thank you for being here.
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.040]   We'll see you next time.
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:22.040]   On Twig.
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:24.040]   Thank you for being here.
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:25.040]   We'll see you next time.
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:27.040]   On Twig.
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:34.040]   Thanks for watching.
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:36.040]   [acoustic guitar chords]
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:38.620]   (bell ringing)
