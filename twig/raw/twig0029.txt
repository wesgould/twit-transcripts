[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.520]   For February 14, 2010, the buzz is on.

[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.800]   It's time for Twig.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.040]   This week at Google to show the covers all the Google's
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.720]   fear, and boy, there's a lot of activity in the Google's fear
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.920]   right now.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.280]   Starting off today, Jeff Jarvis from New York City.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.560]   He is the man at buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.560]   Hi, Jeff.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.640]   Hey there.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.640]   And I welcome--
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.240]   Gina's not with us today.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   I'm sorry to say her grandfather passed away.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.120]   She's at his funeral.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   I know she would love to be here.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.280]   But we wish her the best with condolences.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.560]   Once noted, it takes two people to replace Gina.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.560]   It does.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.200]   And I flashed you with one of them,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.360]   which is, of course, a face you might recognize from--
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.040]   I don't know if you're on Google Buzz, for instance,
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.800]   Yuri Engestrum, who I've known for some time,
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.280]   one of the founders of Jikou.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.560]   And now an employee at Google.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.600]   He's based in Helsinki.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.120]   Hello, Yuri.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.720]   Here we go.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.080]   Is it Helsinki that you're--
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.080]   I know you're in Finland.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.920]   I assumed Helsinki.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.360]   That's right.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.360]   I recently moved back here from San Francisco.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.680]   Hey.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.680]   Also joining us, another former Googler, who's now
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.360]   at British Telecom at Ribbit.com.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.480]   Kevin Marks, also a very active buzzer.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.120]   Hi there.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.240]   Good to see you.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.560]   Buzzer or buzzer?
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.800]   You know, this is our chance to create
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.240]   all of those terms of fresh and anew,
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.040]   because I don't think anybody's done anything yet.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.640]   Well, the single post is a--
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.800]   We went-- we did--
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   Go ahead, Kevin.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.160]   We did post called Nevermind the Buzz Cox, which
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.360]   is a British TV show, which is very amusing.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.280]   Someone's already used the headline now.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.760]   Can I not be a buzzcock?
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.280]   I just-- I would prefer not to.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.000]   So Google surprised us all with this announcement of Buzz--
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.400]   was it Wednesday?
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.360]   And boom.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.640]   There it is.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.480]   And by the way, boom, early adopters just jumped on the platform
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.640]   and it took off and it's huge.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.400]   Now, I know Kevin and Yuri must have known this was coming,
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.000]   because Kevin, you were working on open social and Google
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.360]   profiles when you were at Google,
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.680]   and this must have been in the works even then.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.920]   Yeah, this is-- well, it builds on a lot of infrastructure
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.560]   that-- who's been put into place then.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.060]   Right.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.560]   I think Yuri was more closely involved with Buzz itself
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.320]   than I was.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.800]   This is not your product, is it, Yuri?
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.080]   Well, I don't think you could call it my product.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.600]   It's definitely the current product manager's product
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.000]   who was-- I've Jackson over at the Gmail team
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   when we talk about Buzz.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.200]   So it was under Gmail.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.040]   It was under Gmail.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.800]   That's interesting.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.800]   Right.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.880]   That said, there's a lot of elements that Buzz uses
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.400]   that I was involved with, such as Google profiles
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.240]   and activity streams.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.560]   It reminds me a lot of Jiku just on the face of it.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.800]   And I was a big Jiku, as you know, a big Jiku fan,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.880]   and I was very hopeful that Jiku could replace Twitter.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.360]   Never did.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.440]   But Google obviously saw some value in it.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.080]   And the acquired Jiku and you and Petri must have been three
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.760]   years ago now.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.320]   Yeah, it's about two and a half years.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.200]   Two and a half years.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.120]   And you've been working not on Buzz,
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.800]   but on location-based stuff, things like that?
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.840]   Well, I suppose-- yeah, I'm turning a line here, I guess,
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.160]   because I definitely wouldn't want to take credit
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.800]   for all the awesome work that Buzz team's been putting together.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.000]   But I worked on-- I suppose you could call it
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.120]   a precursor of Buzz, a project that became known as Google Buzz.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.360]   Like when I was product managing it,
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.000]   it didn't really have a name yet.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.320]   We were just calling it Google Social.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.200]   Oh, interesting.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.200]   Is there any Jiku code in this?
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.680]   No, there's no Jiku code in Buzz as far as I'm aware of.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.240]   Jiku, we should say for those who don't know,
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.040]   was open source by Google.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.880]   It's available in Google code.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.640]   You can use the source yourself.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.240]   And still runs, is still out there, and is still a community.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.200]   That's right.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.360]   We open source the code base as something
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.800]   called Jiku Engine on Google App Engine.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.680]   App Engine, I'm sorry, not Google code, App Engine, right?
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.160]   Right.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:08.440]   So how would you describe Buzz, Yuri?
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.480]   Well, I think the way I look at it
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.880]   is it's like an arcstone that connects together
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.000]   a lot of the social services that Google has in one place.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.160]   And not just Google, but from all over the web, is obvious.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.720]   And for instance, Google profiles, things like Google
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.880]   Attitude, this has emerged as a project
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.760]   that where incremental parts of it
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.880]   have been shipped over the last couple of years.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.400]   And really, we didn't have that central place
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.600]   until Buzz shipped inside of Gmail.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.360]   So for me, it was kind of like the completion
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.840]   of a fairly long road that started, for me,
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.800]   with the acquisition of Jiku, for some people
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.760]   it started much earlier.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.400]   Right.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.240]   And Kevin, what would you say your input is into this,
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.840]   and how would you characterize what has emerged?
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.520]   Well, I go along with Yuri there.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.360]   I think the exciting thing about Buzz for me
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.480]   is that they've taken a bunch of these open standards
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.120]   that we've been working on collectively as a part of the open
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.880]   web over the last few years and put them
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.320]   into a big mainstream product like Gmail.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.520]   That's a couple of that in fairly well.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.640]   But that's a striking achievement.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.040]   And the commentary that's come out
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.360]   saying that they're going to be maintaining this
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.000]   as using the open standards like activity streams,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.040]   Pub/Sub, Hub/Hub/Up, XFN, all the standards
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.000]   that I've been going around going, yay, about for a while.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.880]   It's really important.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.880]   Because in some ways, it's not something bad new.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.320]   If you actually look at it, click set or, oh,
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.480]   Superfeeder or setters.net, there's a whole bunch of sites
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.520]   that have been building on this stuff already.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.520]   Right.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.640]   To take those standards and put it bang into Gmail
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.000]   is a huge thing.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.440]   I mean, in some ways, a lot of this
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.000]   was already there in Google Reader.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.600]   If the way Google Reader handles sharing and following
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.160]   and stuff like that was there.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.080]   But the number of people who use Google Reader
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.800]   is orders of magnitude less than the number of people who use
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.300]   Gmail.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.240]   So bringing it into Gmail is a sort of major achievement.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.920]   And it suddenly raises the level of interest
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.600]   in supporting these open standards quite high,
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.160]   which is very good.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.280]   Google kind of just sprang in on everybody.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.040]   It was suddenly you go in your Gmail and it says, hey,
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.360]   would you want to try buzz?
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.840]   Anybody can say no, it still shows up.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.200]   Is that true, even if you say no?
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.440]   Anybody say no, you still got the little buzz.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:37.920]   It's an option.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.760]   I wasn't begging to get it and it didn't have to beg.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.400]   There it was.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.840]   I didn't get it right away.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.280]   And I was very disheartened, but I got it soon enough the next day.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:54.080]   Of course, there's been a lot of sound and fury around this.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.880]   First of all, because it was there,
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.920]   some people complained about the privacy issues raised by it.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.240]   One of the things that--
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.640]   and I'd love to get Yuri and Kevin
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.600]   to talk about what's going on here.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.400]   But what it looks like is it's looking at who you Gmail
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.280]   and G talk the most and adding them automatically.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.200]   When I got in there 41 people, I was following.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.120]   And the default is that those followers
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.400]   are visible out of the box.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.760]   And that caused a number of people
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.960]   some concern about privacy.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.760]   I think-- I don't know if that's changed yet,
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.480]   but I'm sure that Google plans to make that process
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.200]   a little bit different.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:29.700]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:34.400]   I mean, that's the concern that's been raised fairly significant.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.360]   And the thing-- what they did was they've taken what all the social networks do
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.520]   which is you sign up, you give them your email address,
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.360]   you give them your address book,
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.920]   you try to find out who your friends and joins you up.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.680]   And that's the onboarding process for Twitter and Facebook and everything.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.000]   Except the thing is they compressed it all into one button
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.800]   and they already have your email address book.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.680]   So it's there.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.880]   And they signed you up without asking you first.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.760]   So basically, they took the whole chain of going on board.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.240]   I mean, I think of the sites that do that--
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.720]   I think Friend Feed does the smoothest and nicest.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.160]   A lot of the others still do terrible things
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.400]   like ask you for your password and login as you.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.040]   But what they did with your buzz was basically do that automatically.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:20.240]   And the problem is that by choosing your most emailed and most
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.560]   chatted to people as your default set of followers,
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.960]   that's problematic because those aren't necessarily the same set of people.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.280]   And we had the shocking example of the woman whose ex-husband was suddenly--
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.960]   abusive ex-husband was suddenly showing up as a follower.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.920]   And some of the other cases, they were like, that's not what you want.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.560]   And then the second piece of that is that it wasn't clear that you were publishing that.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.960]   Now, Twitter has a public social graph.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.760]   Facebook has a semi-public social graph.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.120]   And MySpace has a fully public social graph as well.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.000]   So a lot of the sites already have this.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.080]   But again, there's been some assumption of that's what's going on when you go there.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.120]   Whereas this was creating one in a place that you assume was private
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.080]   and not making it clear that that's what it was doing.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.080]   That suddenly made it disturbing.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.680]   I think the particular case that the woman was complaining about
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.080]   was that she'd also been using Google Reader with an assumption that was private.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.000]   And actually, that was then brought into this as well.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.680]   So she had-- it was the crossing of the compartment from Gmail,
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.960]   which was seen as a private space where only she knew who she was talking to,
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.440]   and Reader, which she saw as a separate private space.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.200]   She had a small set of people.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.680]   And suddenly, those two strings merged together.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.840]   And David Boyd also blogged about lawyers beware because you're--
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.360]   Right.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.760]   --what you're following, it can now be visible.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.600]   Kevin--
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   I don't think I'm a conversation with--
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:50.240]   --kind of a hindsight easy, but it seems in hindsight that this was fairly obvious.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.920]   I blogged today that I wonder if it wasn't kind of a beta too soon,
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.880]   that if there'd been more use by the public rather than just Google employees,
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.160]   maybe they would have seen this?
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.200]   I think that's possible.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.240]   I think part of the problem is that they were using it internally.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.120]   So that is a very different test environment because you've got a homogenous set of people,
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:15.840]   or a homophilus set of people, if you like, who are all already have any male culture,
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.760]   and also tend to have, particularly for Googlers--
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.440]   and I think Facebook has this problem too--
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.040]   tend to be people whose work and friends and something are all clustered together.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.920]   And then-- and obviously have a sort of much smaller set of people
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.600]   with abusive ex-partners, large-class people.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.520]   So they didn't always see those issues.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.600]   The other thing is that in the test environment they were running,
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.880]   they were running it internally, so only people in hindsight Google could see it.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.600]   So you already had--
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.680]   There was no public issue with that.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.280]   There was no public issue.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.720]   But there was also no-- some of the other issues that gets you later,
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.560]   like suddenly you've got millions of comments from--
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.920]   you accidentally touch a scoble post in your inboxes,
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.920]   "Distly for days."
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.440]   I was getting to that.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.120]   That problem wouldn't sharpen turnily too.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.640]   Right.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.920]   So the publicness and the scale were both not there in the testing they had.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.680]   And-- but I also see the other problem is if they try to release it as more of the Google way,
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.280]   which is a beta.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.560]   I'm surprised I don't see the word beta, or you would say Kevin Bita anywhere near it,
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.280]   which is unusual for Google.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.440]   But I guess part of the problem is that it's a critical mass issue.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.440]   If all you have is 100 users outside, then you can't really--
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.440]   you can't really use it.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:32.240]   I think the other way of thinking of it is if you think about Google Reader as the testbed for this.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.640]   Because they basically-- you know, Reader, like 80 months ago or so, did something similar.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:42.160]   They put the automatic friends and following in to let you discover the shared items
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.400]   and did all that stuff.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.000]   There was some fuss about it then for the similar reasons.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.960]   And the eturegial and that for a while and got that working there.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.040]   So I suspect they may have thought they'd got some of the flaws out through that,
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.120]   because that was-- you know, but it is a lot smaller.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.440]   And a lot more different set of uses.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.240]   The degree we used--
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.240]   Are you surprised by these issues?
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:07.640]   Well, to a degree, yeah.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.920]   But to another degree, I wasn't.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:18.640]   It was obviously a very-- one could argue a brave choice from Google,
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:26.440]   who is, I think, for Google, really the key is as a brand to retain people's trust.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.360]   Because they're getting pretty big.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:35.440]   And I think that's probably the single largest threat to Google is that people would really,
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.440]   on a large scale, lose their trust in the brand.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.000]   So-- and I think this was one of those cases where a call had to be made.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.160]   And obviously, they chose to go for the alternative that they chose.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.920]   Now, I think that on a broader scope that we're going to see this,
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.800]   this is probably not the last time we're going to encounter something like this.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.960]   Because what's happening, if you look at-- like Kevin was just talking about Pub/Sub/Hubbub
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:09.200]   and all these open standards that are being built, which is, I think, probably the most
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   important thing about buzz in the long run.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.680]   That's all about bringing together these social networks that we're used to treating
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.320]   us disparate, separate social objects that we have different branded communities for
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.600]   where we interact with different groups of people.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.840]   And so on the broader scale of what I think we're experiencing here,
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.760]   and what we're going to have to come in terms with is this stuff happening more.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:42.560]   And honestly, I don't think it's a bad thing for people to be exposed to the issues this
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.840]   way and for us to be having this conversation right now.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:52.640]   Because it's kind of necessary for us to shift, I believe, from this world of the siloed social
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.920]   networks into a world where data can flow freely.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.160]   Absolutely agree with that.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.160]   I completely agree with that.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.680]   But as a PR issue for the company that's having some issues that way, at least in media,
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.560]   and this privacy bug, which I think is overused-- I mean, you live in a country where I believe
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.920]   you can look up your neighbor's income, right?
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.760]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.320]   So we have very different narratives.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.560]   I wrote this week about what I call the German privacy paradox.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.560]   I loved that.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:23.720]   They're private about everything except as I learned in the sauna, their private parts.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.880]   And Kevin wrote about that, too.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.280]   I thought it was very-- I don't know why.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.280]   So we all have different attitudes for privacy.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.120]   But it is an issue in Google now.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.520]   And I wonder, in part, why they didn't even slap the beta logo label on it, just to be
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.920]   able to hang behind that as a caveat.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.600]   Does they all caveat emperor?
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.760]   I don't think that would have really made a difference.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:51.720]   I don't think the beta logo would have prevented the tragedy of-- luckily, as far as I'm aware,
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.640]   so far, nobody's been hurt in a really bad way.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.760]   We have these-- hopefully, some narrow misses.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.120]   But that's kind of what I was saying about Google being brave about this is they've kind
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.640]   of stuck their neck out and done this.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.920]   And now we're having this conversation and kind of risked their brand.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.920]   And I don't think it was completely unknowingly that this decision was done.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.200]   I agree with Kevin.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:20.080]   I don't think anybody could really anticipate it coming this way because of the way it
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.080]   was tested.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:28.000]   And I do agree with the idea that maybe possibly more open testing could have led to a different
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   result.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.600]   But on the other hand, we kind of move forward pretty quickly.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:41.120]   And if this passes in a positive way and people kind of start to understand that they need
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.520]   to pay more attention to this, also talking about service builders here who may in the
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.520]   future be aggregating more services, then I think in the long run possibly this was a
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.520]   good thing.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:56.320]   Now, there were, of course, other complaints, as you mentioned, there are complaints about
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.480]   what it's done to my Gmail.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.600]   And I think a number of people said, boy, I almost want to create a separate Gmail account
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.160]   for buzz because Gmail suddenly become more about buzz than it is about mail.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.320]   Well, that's what I was saying the thing I wrote about.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:17.320]   I think the issue is that they're privileging replies over the followings, which is the opposite
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.320]   of Twitter.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.360]   The way that Twitter works is by default, you see the stuff when you're following, you
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.800]   have to click the mentions button to see replies.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.200]   Whereas what they've done with buzz is that if someone replies to you, that goes in your
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.680]   main inbox, not just in the buzz tab.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.960]   So suddenly anyone who replies to you can stick stuff in your inbox.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.560]   And anyone who asks you sticks that in your inbox too.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.400]   So the, in fact, it's like the Inverse is where the mentions tab is stronger than the
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.400]   main thing.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.560]   The other thing they do is they bring the whole thread in, which means that if I add
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:51.120]   reply to Leo, then suddenly, anytime anyone of the thousands of people watching Leo responds
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.040]   to that, that pops to the top of my inbox.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:58.640]   So it sits there in my main Gmail inbox poking away.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.040]   So that was part of the problem that they missed that.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:06.560]   I suspect they missed that internally because they didn't have people who were, you know,
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.560]   that much attention to them.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.040]   So somebody said, I think when Larry Page said something that had that effect inside
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.040]   Google.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:19.680]   But the problem is that then the people's first view of it, in many cases, will be, they'll
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.680]   see one of these things.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.120]   They'll see somebody's out and reply to it.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.080]   They'll see some stuff like that.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.240]   And they're sort of prioritizing the reply over the following.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.120]   So that combined with not choosing the following makes it very, very odd.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:37.760]   And then the feel of it, the sort of the thing that's comfortable about Twitter and Facebook
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.960]   is that you've chosen whom you're following.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.560]   So you see these little messages from people with faces next to them that you know, and
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.560]   that's comfortable.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.360]   And you get sort of comfortable with that and understand who's saying it and so on.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.000]   Whereas with this, the first thing you may see is one of these replies, just the name
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.960]   for someone you don't know.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:00.120]   And it feels like somebody's thrown a YouTube comments thread into your inbox.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.200]   It's the opposite social aspect.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.840]   So I think that part of it is a strongness step.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.800]   It's adding more noise when it's supposed to try to filter the noise for you.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   How would you fix that?
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:17.640]   Well, there's an easy way to, or an easy fix to that, Jeff, which is, you know, I'm sure
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.680]   anybody who's had to play around with designing systems like these will recognize immediately,
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:29.520]   which is that you, for instance, limit the replies that float up to the top to only replies
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.760]   from people who are also your contacts.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.400]   Does that make sense?
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.080]   So not everyone's reply causes the post to float up to the top only if it's someone you
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.360]   know, or possibly a one degree, one degree away.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.360]   Can you do that?
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.360]   Or does Google have to?
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.360]   Can I do that?
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.360]   Yeah, Google has to do that.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.360]   Google has to do that.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:51.160]   There's the short term fix, which life hacker published and has been buzzed about a thousand
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.200]   times, and I'm sure anybody who's interested has found it, which is to create a filter
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:59.880]   on the label colon buzz, and then just skip the inbox with anything that comes from buzz.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.880]   And so I did that.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:07.400]   And, you know, I'm completely content with the fact that I have now this massive buzz folder.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   That's one issue.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.800]   The other issue is in using buzz itself.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.880]   You've got a lot of you got a lot of chatter.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   Right.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.720]   I mean, you're used to that, right?
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.720]   You're used to having you.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.320]   This is my life.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.320]   So I didn't notice it.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.480]   But the challenge is if any, if some random person applies to you now, they get your life.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.480]   Right.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.480]   You get all the stuff that we used to do.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.080]   Welcome to my life.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:34.000]   Just your post from how many minutes ago, 530, so 11 minutes ago, if you look at the
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.800]   yours on buzz about saying, gee, we're talking buzz, the ratatatatat is incredible.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.800]   I love it.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   I love the real time of it.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   I love these things coming in.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.800]   I love the conversation.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.800]   You're a server killer.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.640]   You like you like, bring it all this stuff that I know.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.440]   Well, and I love the conversation and see one of the things that Twitter has become rapidly
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.240]   as a broadcast medium and with some very poor conversation tools.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:00.160]   And that's what I always liked about Jaiku the best is that the focus was on the conversation.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.360]   But they need, they just simply need some tools.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.600]   I remember Yuri when I talked to you about Jaiku, one of the first things I said is I
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.560]   want to be a way to collapse threads.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.200]   That's right.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.360]   It's just something you need.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.680]   It's an easy thing to implement.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.920]   I think the question that immediately for me came to mind is, I know it was beta.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.640]   It's obviously beta is what kind of commitment Google has to this.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:27.200]   We've seen Google throw stuff up and just leave it there and let it die a sad and neglected
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   death.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.200]   Side wiki.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.320]   Side wiki is a good example.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:36.400]   If on the other hand, Google has a strong commitment to this platform and responds to
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.080]   quickly, I don't know how many developers are working on this.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.600]   Is it one guy or is it a team?
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:47.080]   If they respond quickly to requests from users, this could very rapidly turn into the best
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.080]   platform on the net.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:57.560]   Listen, Leo, everyone who is, I think, even remotely involved with social stuff at Google
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.040]   is right now paying a lot of attention to this product.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.600]   A lot of attention, that's my belief.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:08.120]   So I would be very surprised if this was left to, you know, just kind of rot away on the
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.120]   sidelines.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.200]   It's a high priority for Google.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.200]   It ought to be.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   I mean, it's in Gmail.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.960]   You put it in your huge product for you.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.920]   It's more than that, I think, Leo, is that I've long said that there are three wars.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:27.120]   Google has not won the war for the social web, the live web and the local web.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.880]   And buzz hits all three battlefields, Square on.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.880]   Right?
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.120]   I've been accused of saying too often here, quote, Emerson Meyer talking about the hyper
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.440]   personal news stream and algorithms will help you prioritize your stream.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.480]   In buzz, I see the beginnings of that.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:48.160]   The ability to get to the annotated world of adding very easily, even through your voice,
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.520]   annotations about every damn restaurant there is in reaching maps and place pages and local
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.560]   advertising opportunities is huge.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.240]   I love the inclusion of location right in it.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.040]   I think it's gigantic.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.960]   The notion that we move to the personalized web from the one size fits all SEO web in
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.160]   how Google's going to learn more about us and give us more.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:13.320]   The fact that it uses voice, the fact that it's finally in a live, streamy web rather
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.680]   than just a page based web.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.560]   The opportunities here are profound, I think, for Google.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:24.200]   So if they let this drop, I think they're doing more than letting a product drop, they're
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.960]   showing that they don't have a strategy for some things that I think are critical to their
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.960]   growth.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.960]   100, 9.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.960]   Go ahead.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.520]   This is an illustration of what happens when you combine a lot of infrastructure that's
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.520]   been built actually over time.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.360]   It is in some ways it crystallizes stuff.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.640]   It was a huge effort to move that from being a Gmail specific thing to being a Google wide
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.200]   resource and something of the rest of the world can use too.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.680]   That's in there.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.560]   It's not very well expressed necessarily yet, but that's part of this.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.320]   The thing that Yuri Highlighter has posted earlier this week about being able to send
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:04.320]   messages to subgroups of people within this, that's there.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.360]   That works nicely, but unfortunately it's a little decoupled.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.400]   You have to go and create a contact group.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.560]   The contact group doesn't show you followers, so there's still a bit of a disconnect in
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.400]   there, but the pieces are starting to be there.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.760]   The fact that it's coupled up with activity streams of Pub/Sub/Hubbub, which means that
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.520]   it will propagate stuff out as they're posted to other sites and they can be updating real
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.520]   time.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.280]   There are already two or three sites doing that.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.760]   The first is stuff that you've fed in rapidly as well without the delays that we're seeing
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.760]   now.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.560]   At the moment, Buzz is polling Twitter and there are delays there, but the things that are
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.440]   set up with Pub/Sub/Hubbub will come in rapidly.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.920]   There's a lot of infrastructure and plumbing that's built on OpenSanner there.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:50.080]   I've seen a strong commitment from a lot of Googlers, Dewitt Clinton, Chris Messina,
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:55.560]   Joe Spore and others saying the point of this for us is to implement these OpenSanner as
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.960]   well and not be the centre of your web, but be a place where people can see this and they
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.960]   can propagate wherever it needs to go.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.200]   What about the other way, Kevin?
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.440]   Why can't I use Buzz as an authoring tool for Twitter now?
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.240]   Is there a political reason or is it?
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:17.200]   Because Twitter expects you to call Twitter's API and Buzz is supporting an OpenSanner.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.120]   That's a slight political reason.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.200]   The other thing is that you'd have to degrade the buzzers to get them into Twitter.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.320]   When you feed it to Twitter, you get the first 15 words and then a link.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.320]   It'd have to be something like that because Twitter doesn't have the space to put in the
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.320]   ...
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:36.400]   Yeah, but all my Facebook updates are now degraded to Twitter length and it's okay.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:43.560]   I would use Buzz as my authoring tool for social, if I could, and let the best one win.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.560]   Right.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.560]   Yeah, I don't think it's ...
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.320]   That's meant to be possible.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.680]   Sorry to cut in.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.120]   I think it's something ... Here we see the data products.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:59.600]   It's clearly a feature that everyone is expecting Google to build into Buzz.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:05.480]   My belief is just they just had to cut out some features in order to get this thing shipped.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.480]   That's my hunch.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:11.440]   By the way, I'm on ... I am with the lead engineer of Buzz right now who says it's 2PM
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.440]   Saturday.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.200]   Most of the team is working here and they're currently watching us live.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.200]   Wow.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   What's next?
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   What do you get to tell them what's next?
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.200]   What are you talking about?
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.720]   All right, Leo, what's the one thing you want most?
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:29.080]   I think certainly collapsible thread control is going to be huge because that's what turns
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.560]   down the annoyance factor.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:35.040]   You got to get people to use this before you can start really taking off with it.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.600]   I liked the fact it was very apparent to me that it was kind of a crystallization of a
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:44.320]   lot of things going on at Google, the fact that my contacts groups were the groups that
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:50.200]   appeared here that my profile finally had some value and it was using my social graph
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.560]   from my profile.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:56.160]   A lot of these things were just ... Clearly, it's a crystallization of stuff initiatives
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.520]   have been going on for some time at Google.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:04.800]   To me, but I'm watching Google maybe more closely than just the general user, this made
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.240]   sense.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.080]   I want to use it, but I think a lot of people are just going to come to it and look at the
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.600]   surface and say, "It's got to be less noisy.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.640]   I'm worried about privacy issues.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.400]   You got to make it easy for me to hide the buzzes in my ... You can't screw up with my
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.000]   Gmail.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.400]   That's the premier product for Google.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.680]   You can't screw Gmail to promote buzz."
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.680]   Those are things.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.640]   I would love to see a lot of ... Clearly, they're watched friend feed very closely and I'd
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.920]   love to see some more friend feed features like best of day, best of week, best of month.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.600]   I'm thrilled they put like in.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:41.800]   I think that's a very important way to way post.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:46.160]   I'd love to see inline enclosures in comments.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.640]   I think that would be very useful.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:54.640]   All the way, I think now that both Facebook and Buzz have made unlike popular, I registered
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.360]   the domain unlike.com.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.320]   Yeah, like as I was doing in bed.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.560]   Like has always been a bad term because it implies approval.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:07.560]   A lot of times you don't want to say approve this.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.320]   I just want people to pay attention to it.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.320]   I don't.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.840]   Maybe that's we've all learned to go beyond that.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.840]   I'd love to see ...
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.800]   Steve Ravelle, Leo, who's been I think too rapidly negative on this.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.840]   There's that kind of instant lover hate thing declared alive or dead.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.000]   I disagree with Steve about that.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.080]   He put up a post in Buzz collecting the wish list for people.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.640]   I think it's well over 30 now of things.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.360]   If you look up Steve Ravelle and Buzz, you'll find them.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:35.320]   Number one was create a single destination where you can see and search all of Buzz.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:39.360]   Number two, make it easy for profiles to follow who follows you, but lets you either
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.000]   hide individuals and so on and so forth.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   So it's like it's very detailed.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.360]   But I think there's a lot of ... To me, that's a good sign.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.680]   There's a wish list of saying it's a Valentine.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.680]   I want more.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.680]   Right.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.680]   But Search All of Buzz is what the Search Box the top does.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.680]   I mean, that's there.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.720]   The bit that I'm missing is search just the ones that I've been involved with.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.720]   Right.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.640]   You have to do magic keywords to make that work.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.040]   Well, and you know, friend feeds.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.480]   One of the friend feeds real strengths was this amazing search.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.280]   And you're able to say by the number of comments, by the number of likes, you could really
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.080]   use that to surface great content very quickly.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.520]   And nobody ever really figured out friend feed.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.480]   The few who did really valued it.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.000]   And I think there's a lot there.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.400]   I'm sure that what's going on with the Buzz team is they certainly know about those features,
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.920]   but they want to make sure that they can expose them in a way that's intuitive.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.880]   Friend feed never really was intuitive for a lot of people.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.000]   But having groups is huge.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.800]   You know, there's a there's some complaints.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:34.280]   For instance, as soon as I start typing at Kevin, I get your Gmail address.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.600]   I think there's a few people who wish that weren't the case.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.640]   I see people typing in the real name with the outside rather than the user name.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.640]   Yeah, it breaks it.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.640]   They want it to go.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.640]   People will figure that part out.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.640]   Right.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.640]   But it's not it's not clear what it's going to show directly as you type it.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.840]   You know, and you changes it afterwards, which is which is which is slightly tricky.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.560]   But also it doesn't let you add to external URLs, which is kind of a shame will be nice
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.160]   people to add out to someone's JQ account, so much Twitter account, someone's read
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.160]   feed account.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.400]   I mean, you know, clearly Federation is built into this.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.280]   And I think that as soon as you know, now we have namespaces, if you're going to do
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:13.040]   Federation, and so yes, absolutely, I should be able to convert, say, my Twitter army from
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.320]   Laconica to Buzz.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.720]   And now it's a namespace.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.160]   And so you should be able to say at Leo at Twitter.tv or whatever.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.720]   And that should be part of, you know, that's you need a good namespace convention to make.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.000]   And that's we've got one with email.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   So.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.600]   My only wishlist is I couldn't use my apps account, which is my main email.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.160]   Had to use my secondary Gmail account.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.120]   So now I'm going to start to build equity up in the account I don't really use with
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.800]   people I don't really talk too much.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.320]   So my wishlist is get apps on fast.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.360]   I think David Giro was saying they're going to do that.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.160]   He said that some time, some point this week.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.640]   So that's something we've talked about before, which is just essentially that the apps and
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.840]   needs to merge with Gmail.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.920]   Yeah, it's a second class citizen sometimes.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.080]   I really love phone integration.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.600]   Both of the iPhone and the Nexus one, the buzz interface is very usable, very strong.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.040]   I love the built in location.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.040]   The ability to say I'm here.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.040]   It completely.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:08.360]   I couldn't do Leo tip time was like I if it didn't, I couldn't add four square.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.800]   If it doesn't know where I am, I could add the place.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.240]   I couldn't figure out how to add it.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.640]   Yeah, that would be a nice feature.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.640]   It doesn't look like you.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.640]   I didn't see a way to do that.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.640]   Or make it smarter.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.640]   What do you think they have?
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.920]   Although it has because of Google Maps again, another technology.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.880]   It has more information about where you are than anybody else.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.040]   I love the Google map.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:32.200]   I don't know if this is only on Nexus one, but there's a Google Maps layer for buzz now.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:37.040]   You can turn that on and now you see a map with all the local buzzes.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.040]   That's a good one.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.040]   That's a good one.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.040]   Yes.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.720]   It's available on iPhone as well.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:49.720]   I have to say that for a very early first release, it has so many nice usable features
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.320]   that to me I had the exact opposite reaction that Steve did.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.520]   I thought not perfect, far from perfect, lots of rough edges.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:01.040]   But boy, you can see the outlines of something that will be a killer product.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:06.000]   And most importantly is open standards using Pub/Sub/Hub/Bub is federatable.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.720]   Am I correct in that assessment?
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.600]   I looked at the API, but I'm not a programmer.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.880]   It looked like though that my programmers said this is going to integrate very well with
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.160]   the stuff that we've been doing.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:22.080]   It looks like it's Google's essentially giving it away, yes?
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.080]   Yes.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.480]   It looks like they...
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.720]   Well, not all of it is there yet.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.640]   At the moment you've got feeds out and feeds in, you haven't got a way to post.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:33.320]   You've got a way to see your consumption stream, your list of everything you're following.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.320]   Right.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.800]   But they've said we're going to do this, we're going to make this available.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.040]   And they've been committed to that.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.320]   And I believe that they're likely to do that well and correct.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.400]   What about complete two-way...
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:48.640]   I know if you know what you're doing, you can write code to make, for instance, it gets
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.520]   your posts out to Twitter.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.520]   But that was...
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.160]   One of the things that's keeping me from using this exclusively and leaving FriendFeed is
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.640]   that I tweet when I post on FriendFeed.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.640]   I'd love to do that.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   Things like that would be very handy.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.640]   Right.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.960]   Two-way interactivity with all of my other sites.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.960]   Yes.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.520]   What I'd love to see is...
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.040]   This is kind of what I tried to blog about this notion of the beta too soon.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:13.880]   I'd like to see the product roadmap more public so that we could help prioritize it.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.120]   Help find the booby traps that are there and say, "Hey, don't forget about this."
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.240]   And if it's going to use open standards anyway, I don't see the harm.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.920]   And it's not as if Google's ahead on these things.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.120]   That's why they had to buy Jiku.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.120]   They're catching up.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.640]   So make it public and let us join in.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.960]   Not as a democracy, but as a...
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.960]   A throng.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.360]   Well, I think about this.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.360]   Well, I think about this.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.520]   The discussions are happening in public.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.520]   That's the thing.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.120]   If you actually joined the Open Standards mailing list, you would see that these discussions
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.400]   are going on and how these things should work already.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.240]   So that has been going on for a while.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:53.360]   It's more that that may not give a product roadmap, but it certainly gives more people
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.360]   thinking about.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.240]   The thing is what happens with the standardization stuff is that you tend to do that after two
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.560]   or three people have had to try it.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.720]   You say, "Okay, one of these things got in common is how to standardize that."
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.800]   And there's a good discussion going on about the actual structure of the feed formats and
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.960]   what goes where.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:15.160]   When you mix, at the moment when you bring a friend feed in, it shows your actual post
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.480]   twice and then it shows the friend feed set of responses in the body.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.120]   So it looks a bit odd in Google buzz.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.560]   I think Clickset has done a slightly smoother job of fitting the two together.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:30.720]   But as we start plugging these together, some of the other assumptions start being revealed
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.520]   as well about how these things interoperate.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.720]   And the thing I was saying about feeding out of Twitter is it is an issue because Twitter
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:42.440]   has the very tight number of characters constrained, which means that it's not obvious how you
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.160]   would then attach other bits of pieces and riches after that.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:52.600]   So that's always going to be a trickier final to get stuff through.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.600]   Any other wishlist items for you, Jeff, or things you'd like to see on this?
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.360]   I'd be curious what your is wishing for most next.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:03.680]   So you actually might be a window on.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.680]   You might win.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:10.040]   So there's two things that make this interesting.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:16.120]   One of them is maybe rather an organizational question for me because I think this is actually
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.760]   really transforming Google inside of Google.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:23.240]   This Google is sort of becoming more social.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:29.240]   This is infrastructure that's going to be available to all the different Google apps, Google Maps,
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:36.840]   Search, all these huge apps, and I think we're just kind of starting to enable new kinds
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.680]   of innovation that's going to take place there.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:43.000]   So I think that's part of the reason why I don't expect Google to sideline this product
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.280]   because it's so central to the future of the company.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.840]   And that's just my personal opinion.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.840]   But again, it's something I believe in.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:56.120]   Now secondly, about what I'd like to see in Buzz, I think we're barely scratching the
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.800]   surface of mobile today.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.320]   Just across the line, not just Buzz.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:07.440]   I think Buzz is doing a much more interesting opening to the mobile space than Facebook,
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.920]   than Twitter, than any of these guys are doing right now, or any of the big social services.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.920]   You know, especially with what you guys already mentioned, which is for instance, displaying,
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.600]   just displaying the location based, which I really like the UI.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.600]   I do too.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.840]   Props the UI designer there, Brett Lighter for a very great, you want for that?
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.840]   So I think that's the beginning.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.840]   And now I'll tell you something.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:34.200]   You know, when we were working on JaiKU, we were working for the Nokia I60 platform.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   Leo, you remember that.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.200]   You were on that platform.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.200]   Absolutely.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.200]   And it was about mobile.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.360]   I mean, mobile was, it was mobile centric.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:45.920]   So one of the things, or just to give some examples of stuff that we found exciting on
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.560]   that platform was, you know, we were able to access Bluetooth so we could actually detect
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:54.800]   who you were around and then possibly share that.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.640]   We could do stuff on the background, like, you know, the location detection.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.640]   We could tell what kind of music you were playing on your phone at the time.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:05.880]   You know, all this kind of stuff that when we got the iPhone, you know, branded it was
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.080]   great because we suddenly had distribution for mobile apps.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:13.320]   But personally, I was disappointed because it felt like a huge step backwards in terms
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:17.320]   of all the innovation that could be possible because we didn't have the open APIs to access
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.360]   all these parts of the platform.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.440]   Now with the new Androids and some of the new hass here coming out, I think we're going
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.800]   to see that stuff coming to play again.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.800]   And that's making me really excited because I think we're going to see finally some of
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:34.120]   that, you know, social innovation actually happen in the mobile space.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.960]   And I hope that's going to be plugged into buzz.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:40.200]   I remember on Jaiku, I could, as you said, I could just say who's around me?
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.480]   Who's, you know, it's really, I think it's the timing on this is interesting because,
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.160]   of course, South by Southwest is coming up.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.440]   And the history of South by Southwest is this is where these kinds of things break.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.240]   Twitter first, four square later.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:58.160]   I could see this especially with that location element being huge at South by Southwest.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.280]   I don't know if that's with Google's thinking, but I can just see how this is.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:06.520]   That's really interesting because, you know, to me, the bottom line importance of what
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.600]   they're trying to do here as part of the largest strategy is, of course, Google always wants
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.600]   to into it intent.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.400]   It needs ever better relevance machines.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:17.480]   And I heard that in the announcement strongly and I see it in this that the more Google
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.880]   can give us relevance, the more we get tied that way.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:26.320]   The notion of temporary relevance and geographic relevance, you know, you happen to be around
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.320]   these people right now.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.480]   You happen to be the spot right now on that basis.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.680]   Here's how I'm going to serve you.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.160]   I think it becomes huge and I'll be curious how people can use this as a Southwest to,
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.320]   you know, is there what's the next hashtag?
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:45.240]   You know, if we, the users made up the hashtag and made up that convention, how do we use
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:49.480]   buzz in ways that would make South by Southwest a killer experience?
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.880]   And I like the one to figure that out.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.080]   We're all looking at Yuri.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.480]   Go ahead, Yuri.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:06.800]   No, I was just joking that I guess I have to buy a plan to get to South by Southwest.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.800]   Yes.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.560]   Well, I'll tell you it makes, I'll be honest, it makes me want to go to South by Southwest
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.600]   because I can just see this thing coming alive there.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.600]   You should all be there.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.600]   Kevin, are you going?
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.400]   I'm going, I'm going to a plane yet, but I am going yet.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.400]   You know what?
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.400]   I'm going, Jake's going.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.400]   Come on.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.400]   I'll go, I'll go.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.400]   But you know what?
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.960]   The nature of buzz is even if you're not going to Southwest by Southwest, you are per force
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:31.760]   going to be there because it will completely occupy your inbox.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:38.040]   This might be the first time an established billion dollar company breaks at South by Southwest.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.800]   Well, that, Patrick, messaged me.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.720]   He said, I'm glad we could put this on a platform.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.880]   You can't break Lee.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.680]   But I may not be able to, but South by Southwest.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.680]   Good.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:52.400]   Well, last year, basically the phone networks broke at South by Southwest.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:57.200]   They were sort of shipping in new portable towers to try and cope with it.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.200]   So hopefully they've had that.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.200]   I got that.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.120]   I gave Jake a Nexus One for his birthday.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.120]   This is my son Yuri.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.200]   Wait a minute, not your, not your Nexus One.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.200]   No, not mine.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.200]   I got another one.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.200]   We're not one of them.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.200]   Interesting.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.200]   So you've come around a little bit on that.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.200]   I got a CLD.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.480]   And so, but he said one of the advantages is he'll actually have a phone that he can use
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.480]   at South by Southwest.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.480]   Nobody uses T-Mobile as hell.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.080]   You're safe there.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.240]   Stay off AT&T.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.400]   Anything works.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:29.880]   No, I think that it is, it is a nice combination with an Nexus One because you can kind of see
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.320]   it all in a piece, but it works beautifully on the iPhone.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.440]   It's just as good on the iPhone.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.120]   And I imagine on anything with a decent browser, it would be just as good.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:43.880]   You wrote, Kevin, a while ago when Twitter came out, your Twitter theory post on your
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.120]   blog, A Piggany.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.920]   And then now you've applied this to Google Buzz.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:54.360]   Remember, we talked about flow faces, Fadek following and all of that.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:59.200]   Tell me what you think now, looking at Buzz, knowing what you know about Twitter, how
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.200]   it fits in.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.680]   Well, I was saying some of it.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.760]   I think those same pieces apply, but some of them are slightly twisted.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:12.200]   So the flow isn't as good as Twitter because it's in your email box and they put an unread
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.200]   count on it.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.200]   Right.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   So that means it doesn't feel like a stream.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.360]   If you dip into and dip out of it.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.360]   That's why I moved it.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.480]   That's why I moved it to a folder where it's out of sight, out of mind.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.840]   And I just now dip in and I don't see it.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:28.280]   But that's part of the reason Twitter works so well is that you dip in and out of it.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.960]   You don't feel compelled to actually answer everything.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.880]   But isn't it nice to have the choice?
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.880]   Mm.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.880]   Potentially.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:38.560]   I talk to people who say when I go on Twitter, I read everything I missed since I was on
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.320]   last, which to me is nuts.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.920]   Well, it depends on people who are following.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.240]   But yeah, you can do that, certainly.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:49.280]   But the other thing that they did was they privileged the replies over the people you
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.280]   follow.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.280]   That's weird.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.520]   That changes the tone significantly.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:58.240]   Because the tone on Twitter when you're looking at it is that you're seeing comments from
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.720]   a bunch of people you've chose to see, but they're face next to them.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.720]   You can see the comment.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.720]   You can reply to it.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.720]   It's very comfortable.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.720]   Right.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.560]   If you want to see people sending stuff to you that you don't know, you click on the mentions
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.880]   thing and you find some people you may want to know.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.440]   But it's a separate space.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.960]   That's the sort of second order piece.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.520]   And some of the clients change that.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:22.120]   But that's the sort of basic UX that Twitter's got baked in.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.360]   And buzz inverts that.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:30.760]   It puts the staff and your friends in the little buzz tab and also it hides half of them.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:34.280]   The execs at the launch were saying, we want to make sure we're showing you important,
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:36.800]   relevant stuff, which is missing the static point.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.240]   It's missing the point that a lot of these communications actually just social intent.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:45.280]   If you look at people chatting on Twitter on Facebook, they're basically saying hi to
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.760]   each other, but I'm still here.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.760]   And there may not be much actual semantic content, but there is social content in that.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.760]   There's grooming.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:58.800]   And if some machine is hiding those from me, the place is going to feel much less comfortable.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:04.240]   So I've got to sense that they were missing that nuance of Twitter with buzz.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.680]   They were saying, we'll only show you the important ones, which they want someone else's
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.720]   reply to.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:16.120]   And then the other piece is that they don't put the faces on the replies.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.360]   So the stuff from the strangers doesn't have faces.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.960]   So you can't tell the friends from the strange nages.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:21.960]   They just got these names.
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.520]   And it's all a bit odd.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.720]   It feels like stepping back into IRC or using it or something.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.360]   You don't have the richness there that you have.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.320]   The contrast there, the opposite about is daily booth.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:38.280]   Daily booth, they let you not only put your face in the reply, but they let you change
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.000]   your photograph for each reply.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.840]   So that's making that enormously more engaging.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:47.280]   And they've missed a trip with the faces there.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:51.880]   The following staff, they've got the right following model, except the way their boot
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:58.800]   strapper is confusing, because they bootstrap it from your email and chat staff.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.360]   And then they don't show you it to edit first.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:04.880]   If you actually walk through the login stages on mostly social sites, they will do the give
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:09.600]   us your address book thing, and then they'll give you a check and uncheck people phase
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.000]   before you go on to the next one.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   With this, they don't do that.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   They just do that straight away.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.960]   And then you have to go and dig through and try and fix that.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:23.720]   So that has been a big part of the confusing onboarding, because people certainly find
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:28.360]   their following their bank manager or their following somebody they've had a lot of email
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:33.560]   correspondence with who isn't somebody they actually wanted to have that social connection
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.560]   to.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.160]   What are my other ones?
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.080]   I should actually read my post rather.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.080]   Sorry if you've been doing very well.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:45.960]   Let me see if I can pull it up.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.960]   The other.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.320]   Let me see.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.960]   I had it here.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.920]   Oh, the mutual media stuff, that's it.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.560]   So the publics and the mutual media.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:05.360]   The idea there is that we each have a different set of publics, but they overlap.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:10.480]   And so that actually ends up being more stable than showing everyone everything.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.160]   If we're all seeing a different subset of it, then for stuff to move between them, someone
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.760]   has to make a conscious choice, which is the mutual mediation thing that Jeff and I have
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:18.760]   talked about before.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.800]   If I care about this thing enough to say something about it, to like it, to share it,
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:26.440]   to pass it on, then that then I'm adding value to that news and I'm adding value to you
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.440]   if you value my opinion.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:35.960]   And by not putting some slight sort of damping there, but anyone replying can pop up, you're
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.800]   basically, my doing that signal quite a lot.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:43.000]   So I think that the mechanism is missed a bit there.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.720]   Now, you know, there's smart people to go with.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.680]   They'll probably figure some of this stuff out once they get more to play with.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:53.680]   But they may not be looking at it from this point of view because they culturally at
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.800]   Google, there's a lack of sociologists.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.960]   I'm not sure you really can comment on that.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:03.720]   But it tends to be a very, very engineering, their culture.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:08.400]   And so they won't actually have thought about saying, oh, maybe if we should get some social
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.160]   theorists in to talk to us about the information.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.280]   Do this.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.280]   It's interesting.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.480]   So this stuff as new as it is, there already sociology applies.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:20.880]   I mean, it's understood or is it something completely new and different?
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.720]   It's not, I guess.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.320]   Really?
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.040]   Are you a sociologist, Jerry?
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.360]   I am trained as a sociologist.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.520]   I didn't know that.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.520]   Oh, interesting.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.960]   That's why Kevin is giving me a hard time all the time.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:35.960]   I know.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.360]   I'm saying, you're important.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.000]   He's giving you credit.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Exactly.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.240]   I'm saying you're what they need.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:47.560]   So when you studied sociology, I mean, I guess they talk about things like the Dunbar
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.560]   number and so forth.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:51.240]   But do they, I mean, do we understand things like social graph?
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.320]   Isn't this awfully new?
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:56.840]   And I mean, in a digital context, kind of different from the social graph you might
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.240]   have talked about in a tribal context?
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:02.720]   Well, I think the fundamental number changed, Leo.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.560]   I mean, we all kind of know that just from experience that, you know, we're, there are
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.320]   certain things that people always look for.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.800]   And, you know, when new technologies and new types of media come along, we just kind
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.200]   of figure out new technical ways of getting what we want.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:22.000]   And you know, those things are, you know, things like attention, appreciation, you know,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.040]   for instance, the demonstration of face, which is actually what I was reading out of the
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.520]   comment that I think what was really perceptive of Kevin Marks there was, you know, pointing
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:35.520]   out the fact that the faces are missing from those replies.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:40.160]   And if you think about having a conversation with somebody and all of a sudden you no
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:45.840]   longer see their face, you know, it's just not something that's disruptive to the way
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:50.840]   we're built as, you know, animals and how we're, you know, we're expecting to be able
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:55.920]   to, you know, get some kind of a visual cue on what this person is and how they're feeling.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.200]   So to me, these all spell out opportunities.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.920]   And, you know, it's clear why, you know, this decision was made.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.440]   It's because they knew there was going to be a lot of conversation.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.520]   There were going to be a lot of comments and that takes up, you know, takes up screen
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.880]   real estate.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:17.120]   So you know, I'm expecting us to have an evolution right now, like for the next 12 to
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:21.040]   18 months, I'm expecting this product to really evolve rapidly.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:27.840]   And personally, like if that doesn't happen, if the Gmail team, if the Buzz team kind of
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:33.960]   gets stuck in a rut and isn't able to keep updating the product, then I think we have
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:37.280]   reason to start, you know, feeling critical and feeling worried.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.480]   But right now I'm pretty excited.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:44.400]   You know, it only took about 24 hours for Google to make the first changes based on
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.360]   some of his feedback about the privacy issues, right?
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.560]   And that's pretty incredible from, you know, a company this size.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.480]   So I'm really hopeful that we're going to see this thing evolve.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:59.080]   And I also liked the way the team and, you know, the extended team because there's also
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.040]   who goes who are not directly on the Buzz team, but who are very active right now on
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.320]   Buzz on the different discussion groups.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:09.280]   And frankly, looking at some of those other products that, you know, maybe didn't fare
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.280]   so well, we didn't see that kind of engaged.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:16.720]   You know, the actual engineers being that engaged with the publics.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.200]   So again, you know, that makes me hopeful.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:25.760]   In fact, by the way, talking about South by Southwest, the Buzz team members just ping
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:31.480]   me on IM saying that they will be having a panel, our session at South by Southwest,
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:35.480]   where all the Buzz creators are going to be on the same session.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.720]   And it's going to be called Gmail behind the scenes.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.440]   So if you're going to South by Southwest, make sure not to miss that panel.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.520]   Yeah, I want to take a little bit of a break.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.520]   When we come back, I want to talk about how hard it is or hard hard it will be for third
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.640]   parties to develop for Buzz, be part of Buzz.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.760]   But that was something that the ecosystem around Twitter that really propelled Twitter
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.760]   forward.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.480]   But if you guys want to take a short break, we're going to do a little commercial.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:02.480]   So Yuri and Jeff, I should say Yuri Angstrom is here.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.560]   He is with Google with the creator of Jaiku.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:09.360]   And he is working currently on what?
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.360]   I'm no longer at Google.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.080]   You're not at Google.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:12.920]   I love Google.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.200]   Where are you?
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.440]   I'm in Helsinki, Finland.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.440]   And what are you doing?
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.440]   I know I didn't realize that.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.440]   That's great.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.440]   What are you doing these days?
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.440]   Enjoying early retirement.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:22.440]   Excellent.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.440]   It's getting.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:27.240]   Yuri, you're going to be much more on this show more often than that case.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.240]   That's great.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.240]   Although we're keeping him up.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.240]   It's well after midnight.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.240]   Hard time.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.240]   Oh, it's so great.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.240]   All right.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.840]   Yuri Angstrom, you can go to zingestrum.com to see his postings.
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:41.000]   Of course, Jeff Jarvis is with us of zingestrum.com.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.360]   Kevin Marks from ribbit.com at British Telecom.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:47.600]   Gina has the day off.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.760]   And guys, take a break.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:52.040]   Smoke them if you got them because we're going to give you a minute here while we--
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.160]   Is that an anachronism?
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.200]   If we have a little moment here to talk about our friends at Citrix, the folks who do go
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:02.240]   to meeting, go to meeting is the online meeting service that makes it easy.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.840]   It's empowering this ability for people to be anywhere in the world and still work together,
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:11.960]   collaborate, pitch, train, go to meeting from Citrix makes it so easy to do that.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.360]   You just go to go to meeting.com/twig right now.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:20.600]   You could try it for free, a 30-day trial, so easy to install Mac or PC.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   When you go there within seconds, you'll have it running.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.240]   And now, the next time you have a meeting, you just go to go to meeting.com.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.840]   You click the start of meeting button.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:28.840]   Boom.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:29.840]   You got a meeting ID now.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:30.840]   You can hand that out.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.600]   And you can have people in there with you.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:33.840]   They'll see what's on your screen.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:34.840]   They can take over control.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.080]   So you can see what's on their screen.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.640]   They can run programs on your computer.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.640]   So it's great for training.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:43.040]   Of course, great for PowerPoint and keynote.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.160]   And for $49 a month, all the meetings you want, including VoiceOver, Internet and free
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:49.080]   teleconferencing, this is a great deal.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.640]   Sure, we'll save you a lot of money on travel.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:55.800]   We use it literally every day here at the TwiPcottage for something.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.940]   Either a meeting or one of our shows.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.240]   It's just been a great buy for us.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:01.120]   And I know you'll be very happy with it too.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.120]   But then you try it for free.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.520]   See if it fits into your workflow.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.520]   I bet it will.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:13.280]   At www.twegwethinkofsomuch for their support of this week in Google Show.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:17.680]   So your cigarettes are burned down and you're ready to continue on with our discussion of
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:23.760]   Google Buzz which came out three days ago and already has certainly gotten a lot of attention.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.320]   Some negative, I think mostly positive.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:31.400]   How easy will this be to develop, Kevin, for, you know, in terms of third party applications,
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.400]   things like this?
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.080]   Well-known standards, isn't it?
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.080]   Yes.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:40.520]   Yeah, the goal is for it to be using the set of open standards that we've been developing
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:44.000]   as some of them sort of started out as being part of open social.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.160]   Lots of them separate out into the minute standards.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.040]   Activity streams is the key one.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:53.920]   The idea of that is it gives you a way to express these richer updates in feeds and
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:54.920]   route them back and forth.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.920]   But there are others.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:01.400]   There's, XFN is the standard of saying, "I'm connecting these sites together.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.520]   This is me and other places that the Google profile is already used and used that to bring
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.520]   sites in."
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:11.520]   There's another program standard that's being debated which is salmon which is designed
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.080]   to let the comments flow from one side to another.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:19.480]   So if I comment on something, you want that comment to flow upstream to the source of
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.400]   it and then flow back downstream again.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:25.280]   So if you've started something in friend feed and it's gone over to bars and the comments
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.560]   are calling bars, you'd probably want those propagated back to friend feed as well, for
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:29.560]   example.
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.560]   That one's fairly nuanced and is still being debated.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.000]   The activity stream stuff is actually pretty well developed.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:42.600]   It's already supported by people as diverse as Facebook and MySpace and Netflix and Last
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:43.600]   FM.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:46.120]   So there's a whole set of stuff going on around that.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.920]   The other thing is, do you know the identical or?
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:51.920]   Say the Staunton ad.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:57.040]   Those guys have, although they implemented the Twitter API, they originally had their
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:01.280]   own API model called Open Micro-Blocking and they're now shifting that to use the same
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.280]   set of standards.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.280]   So that will be a reference on the team.
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:04.280]   So OMB-
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.280]   Oh, that's wonderful.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.440]   Kevin, your mic is rubbing against your collar by the way.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.440]   Sorry.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.720]   I actually run an electronic instance.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.200]   So I'm very interested in that.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:18.200]   OMB standard is a great federation standard.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:25.000]   Will it be possible, Yuri, for somebody to run an effect, run a buzz server?
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.760]   I don't know if it's going to be possible to run a buzz server.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:34.080]   I would be doubtful that there are options like Laconica, like the open source Jiku
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.040]   engine, that I would assume people would be running.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:42.160]   However, what we're all expecting is for these all to be pluggable to each other and
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:47.360]   actually just kind of what I'm hoping is that we can set up something similar to WordPress
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:51.840]   instances and create your own hosted identity on your own server.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:57.120]   And then you can use that as a way to publish to so that anybody can follow anyone regardless
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.280]   of what service we're on.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.760]   This is actually an important feature, by the way.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:04.080]   I should just mention, we've had a lot of conversation right now in the blogosphere about
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.080]   buzz.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.560]   We've had people going, like Jason Kalkon has said, "Game over.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.120]   Facebook is to advise base."
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:15.280]   He said, "Facebook in one fell swoop lost 50% of its value."
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.360]   He might have been overstating it a little bit.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.280]   That's Jason for you, I guess.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:26.480]   But others like the Newsweek tech blog wrote that buzz exists because Google feels threatened
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.600]   by Twitter and Facebook and wants to kill them.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.000]   This is actually a direct quote.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.400]   And what I just kind of want to point out, I actually wrote about some of my blog too,
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:44.320]   as entertaining as it is to look at this as a controversy and a competition really across
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:47.960]   over who gets to rule the social web.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.440]   Which one of the big companies is it going to be?
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:50.440]   Twitter is going to be Facebook.
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.760]   It's going to be Google.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:55.480]   That's really, I believe, missing the point.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:56:02.240]   The point is that this isn't a zero or some game.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:07.760]   We really need to look at this as something where the prize is not total domination of
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.160]   the social web by one single silo.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.640]   That's not going to serve anyone.
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:18.800]   In fact, the real enemy that we should be fighting here is not each other in terms of
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.800]   the companies.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:26.320]   It's this idea of totalitarianism, which we get in silos, where we basically have one
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:31.960]   person who gets to make all the decisions for the masses.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.360]   That's why these open standards are so important.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:41.600]   What I really want to have, frankly, personally is five years from now to be able to at reply
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:47.960]   or follow anybody on the web by putting in their email address or having some kind of
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:53.200]   an algorithm that is out there looking for conversations that might interest me in putting
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:59.080]   those together, regardless of which language they're being carried out in, regardless of
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:03.280]   which service these people are on, I should still be able to follow them and I should
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:08.200]   be able to take part in that without necessarily even knowing what service it is because of
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.280]   these open standards.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.600]   That's really when we get a global conversation going.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:15.000]   I think it's going to be very important to us as a society just globally.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.160]   I'm going to be very disappointed if we end up in these silos that don't talk to each
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.760]   other for a long time.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.520]   I'm so with you on this.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.680]   I've been saying this for so long.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.920]   I think for a long time it was unheard.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:32.800]   Twitter was such a success and nobody really wanted to even hear any negative about it.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.200]   This is so obviously a problem.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:40.240]   That's one of the reasons, regardless of flaws, that I would so quickly embrace buzz
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:44.240]   and so happy to see it as a chance to break through those silos.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.680]   Get the data out of there.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:52.560]   When I hear people complain about the privacy issues, the real but relatively minor privacy
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:58:00.840]   issues of buzz, I have to think, but you're using Facebook.
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.800]   I think that they're just not comparable.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:08.080]   We have a doctor in the chat room who says, "I use Gmail for confidential discussions
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:11.920]   with patients and revealing those patients' identities is a problem."
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:13.120]   I can understand that.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:15.040]   There are people who have to be very careful.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:19.240]   When I started the radio show today talking to a much more general audience, while I was
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:23.960]   glad to say how great buzz was, the first thing I had to say is, "But you should know
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:28.560]   that there's this privacy issue and you should not say yes to buzz until you are ready to
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:32.680]   deal with it or you find a way around it or maybe create a separate account."
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:36.440]   Those are minor, I think, compared to really the great value that buzz is going to add
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:40.320]   by being an open standard and using open standards.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:43.320]   People are open standards.
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:44.320]   I think that's it.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.600]   The thing is we've been discussing these open standards and there's always been a bit of
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.840]   what you go first to it.
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:51.240]   Google had to begin into this.
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:52.560]   Google will go first.
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.760]   They said, "Okay, they've done it with portable contacts.
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:58.920]   They've done it with WebFinger."
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:03.720]   You can straightforwardly log into Google and get the list of contacts out of there
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:07.080]   through OAuth without having to spoof anything.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:12.840]   You can get as much access to it as they have access to internally for the Google phone
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.400]   or whatever.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:19.440]   They've been a good citizen in that respect and saying that that's the way it should be.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.440]   That's good.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.880]   I agree very much with Yuri that this isn't a zero-sum game.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:27.520]   He's very much a positive-sum game when people are interoperating.
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:31.360]   The strongest test for openness is that if two people couldn't interoperate without knowing
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:33.440]   each other exist.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:37.520]   If you've got a protocol like HTTP or SMTP, that's how it works.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.640]   You write to the protocol.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.280]   You're not writing to a specific server.
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:44.040]   We're still a bit at the stage where we're trying to make the stuff fit together.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:47.600]   We're debating about what's the title, what goes in the title, what goes in the body and
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.400]   stuff like that.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:51.440]   We have ways of moving feeds between science.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:52.800]   We've had that for a while.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:55.920]   We're now discussing how to put rich data in those feeds so that we can do useful things
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:59.440]   with them, get rid of duplicates, know when they're photos embedded, know when they're
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.960]   people mentioned, things like that.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.560]   That stuff is starting to come together and make sense.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.360]   The other piece is that people are beginning to build stuff that are effectively self-hosted
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.600]   versions of this.
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:17.000]   I know there's a project called the Mind Project with the idea that the data is mine, that
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.840]   lets you host your own set of feeds and activities and feed them just to the people you want
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.680]   to see them rather than to attend them to a large corporation first.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:29.680]   I think we're going to see more of that made possible by this.
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:33.880]   I know Tintech, Chad, has been building something similar himself to have his own hosted blog
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:38.000]   thing that actually feeds updates into Twitter and pulses.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.280]   Obviously, I think there is an example of that too, where you can download the code
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.280]   and run it yourself.
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.920]   There are people that are starting to plug these projects together and make it possible
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.120]   to do this.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.080]   I think that will lead to a great set of creativity.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.920]   The other thing I said in my analysis of buzz was that they don't necessarily have to
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:58.560]   get it right themselves if they're supporting the open standards, but that somebody else
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.120]   can replace pieces of it too.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.680]   That's obviously very attractive.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:06.000]   In some ways, that's a risk of the strength of Google is that it might be very tempting
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.120]   for people to say, "Well, let's just let Google do it."
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:12.800]   They've got all the developers, they can do all the work, and there might be not so much
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.440]   incentive to participate in the ecosystem.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.360]   I think Twitter people felt like we have to help Twitter.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:23.200]   I'm not sure that I think there's a bit of both there.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.400]   I think the Twitter ecosystem was, it grew up because they did put a good API there.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:33.600]   I noticed that it's not an open standard API, but it's a pretty well designed API for Twitter.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.480]   It fits Twitter very well.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.760]   But also, they didn't build many features themselves.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.160]   There was a sort of obvious deficit that other developers wanted to make up.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.160]   Exactly.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.160]   That's the risk with Google.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.880]   The fear with Google maybe that, "Oh, Google's going to do this.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.520]   I shouldn't be in that space."
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.000]   But I'm not seeing that.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.240]   I'm seeing these other developers building things and plugging bits together.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:57.720]   I'm seeing lots of good conversations in the standards meetings about how do you make
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.720]   these pieces fit together to make them flow.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:05.440]   The great work that Monica's been doing at MySpace to make sure that their stuff can
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.240]   go in and out is part of that.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:13.240]   There are people at Facebook, like David Recordon, who are very sure they want to do this too.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:18.680]   We are seeing, and people at Microsoft like Rob Dodin and Dera Bissanjo are making sure
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.800]   that it plugs into their world too.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.760]   There's people at all these companies who get that the web is an agreement, a set of
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.880]   protocols that we move stuff around, and we want this to happen.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.080]   The occasionally bump into business disputes.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:36.520]   We had the whole thing with Google, Friend Connects and Facebook and the stand-off there
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.000]   where nobody could agree to do anything, just as you have the stand-off between Google
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.240]   and Apple about getting their apps into the store and things like that.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.120]   There will be bits like that, but overall, the standards world moves on and we find ways
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.640]   to move stuff back and forth between these things.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.920]   My take is that in the long run, the open stuff does win precisely because you can change
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.440]   it and interoperate with it and do useful things with it.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.000]   That's my optimism about this.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.880]   I don't expect that the closed thing will win out in the long run, precisely because
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.280]   it is much less generative.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:13.120]   This is the smartest people work for someone else issue.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.440]   We've wanted to have textual streaming as a third kind.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:19.080]   We do audio and video and I wanted to do text streaming because text has some real advantages.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:24.880]   We've been working on this concept using XMPP for a year over a year now.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.400]   The engineers who are working on this with us are actually really excited because our
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:36.000]   XMPP maps well to Pub/Sub/Hub/Bub and Salmon will be very valuable for us for in and out.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.080]   Really, because of the support of standards, it looks like we can take something that we
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:43.440]   wanted to do and make it work well with Buzz.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:47.240]   It is a platform that developers can use and we had some very specific needs.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:53.240]   Actually, I had initially misread Wave and thought Wave would be the thing we would use.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.560]   In that way, this is what I was hoping Wave would be.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.080]   Wave is different.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.080]   Oh, it is, obviously.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.080]   It's a collaboration tool.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.960]   I'm missing Gita here, obviously.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:07.560]   Wave is primarily a document editing system.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.200]   That's what it is underneath.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.360]   You're all editing the same document and the messages and updates are actually edits to
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.360]   that document.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.280]   Whereas, what Buzz is doing is building on these flows of individual messages that are
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:23.560]   connected together that we're seeing across the web.
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.520]   You're not trying to construct a document.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.040]   There's something that's not edited in the same way.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.040]   That is a difference.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.400]   It's a difference of approach.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.000]   I know that you can always transform one thing to something a bit like another.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.200]   I know a lot of the Wave thing was initially conversational, but actually, I think where
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:47.000]   Wave's place is to be a good place where you're co-editing something, where you're creating
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.720]   a work product, whereas this stuff is more about flows of events from one place to another.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.600]   Jeff, you wanted to say something?
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.600]   I absolutely agree.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:00.600]   I've long said that the winner in social is not going to be some site we all join.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.240]   It's he or she who brings organization to our lives across the web.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.840]   I think that's right.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:10.600]   I don't want to get into that kind of fighting thing that we were in.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.440]   Nonetheless, I still want to ask, if you are sitting at Twitter today and if you're sitting
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:21.880]   at Facebook today and for Square today, what's the smart strategy?
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.560]   That's what the strategy is to stick with what you're doing.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:29.440]   They have a strong set of users who go to their sites and care about the communities
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.120]   they have there.
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:37.560]   They will probably welcome more flow going in and out in some ways and connect the pieces
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.560]   together.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:44.400]   I think it would be great if the Facebook stream can plug into bars and vice versa.
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.160]   MySpace2 and Twitter and so on.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.960]   It already does.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:55.240]   The thing Facebook did today, or yes, this week by doing XMPP support, so you can use
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:06:02.640]   your chat client that you use for AM and for MG talk to Facebook chat as well.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:05.040]   That's a great step in the right direction as well.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.680]   Starting to see these pieces actually plug together and assume that you can have these
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:13.120]   different flows in different places is enormously important.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:17.560]   The right answer for them is to not put the barriers up and say, "Okay, we've got to
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:22.000]   compete with this and make sure this stuff doesn't plug together," but say, "We have
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.920]   enough faith in ourselves and the way that we construct things for our users that we
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:36.320]   can add, that we can keep adding value there and not fret about Google taking it all over."
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:40.960]   Some of the things I said about the difference between the feel of Twitter and bars are advantages
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:46.240]   for Twitter and Twitter can maintain those by plugging into that.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:54.840]   Facebook, I mean, these four square and these other sites are not going to go away.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:55.920]   You're right, they have a community.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:00.480]   The whole key is federation interoperability and it seems like it would be in their interest
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.480]   to support that.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:02.480]   Although-
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:08.280]   What about Friend Feed if it's the closest to Buzz and we've been declaring it sputtering
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.780]   for a while?
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:11.780]   This is a good excuse to shut it down.
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:12.780]   I disagree.
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:18.840]   I think Paul was talking about this week of saying, "This is great.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.520]   I'd love to be able to insert bits of stuff into Gmail like that.
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:26.240]   We'd like to work out how to connect the two together.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.840]   There's been discussion on how you make the comments flow back and forth in a useful
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.500]   way.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:35.520]   Friend Feed already has the power support so you can feed buzz into Friend Feed and it
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.520]   updates rapidly.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:40.740]   There's a whole bunch of bits where those two are starting to fit together.
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:46.460]   I'm hoping that that can inform Facebook's thinking across the broader use of Facebook
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:47.460]   as well.
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:49.460]   I think it will.
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:54.660]   Overall, my sense is that there's lots of support for the open standard stuff here.
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:58.300]   My hope is that this isn't going to suddenly make everyone else go, "Oh, well, Google's
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.940]   done this, but then we need to do something that shuts it down."
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:01.940]   Competive.
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:02.940]   Google's done this.
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:07.180]   You do something that supports the same standards so that our users can have this experience,
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:08.180]   too.
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:10.640]   A lot of them already been doing that.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:17.260]   The Microsoft Live experience for consuming activity streams is really good and has a huge
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.600]   number of users who like it a lot.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.320]   This is this week in Google.
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:25.560]   We're naturally Google users rather than Microsoft Live users here.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560]   It's the same thing.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:32.120]   There are all these sets of users in different places who are doing roughly the same thing
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.720]   underneath, which is why we can use common standards.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.280]   The places have a different feel to them.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.680]   Jesse Stay was saying, "Well, why didn't Google build this on Orchid?"
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:45.880]   Or, "Google didn't build this on Orchid because there aren't enough users in America on Orchid
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:46.880]   for it to make sense."
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:52.560]   But there are very, very loyal users of Orchid in Brazil and India who use it very much in
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:57.160]   this way already.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:01.600]   Bringing that to a different user base will be tricky because they've got their own sort
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.680]   of sense of who's there and who's in it.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.160]   I think having an open standard means that we can each choose the set of communities
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:12.240]   we want to interact with and have the stuff flow between them rather than have to adopt
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.960]   a particular site or a particular way of looking at it.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.280]   There is a little perception problem.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:21.840]   I showed this to a friend and her immediate reaction was, "Oh, God, not another place
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.760]   to go and share stuff."
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.760]   Exactly.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:31.160]   I mean, that's the natural reaction to a generation of social web users who've grown
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:37.160]   up with silos, right, where you've grown accustomed to the fact that every 18 months,
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:43.160]   the wild herd roams to some other place and suddenly you have to be creating your account
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.160]   all over again.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.160]   Or tries to roam and then is all alone on the plane.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.160]   All us yaks.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.160]   We yaks.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:54.160]   I should say reindeer, pardon me.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.160]   Don't do that again.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.160]   Remember, it's ranger, hot yaks.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.160]   This ain't Tibet.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:06.520]   Now, I agree with, just to come back to the original question about what Twitter should
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:12.960]   do, what Facebook should do, is I agree with Kevin in that these places have a different
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:13.960]   feel to them.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:19.160]   That's the whole point of trying to get the information to flow, is to actually get a
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:27.080]   situation going here where you differentiate with innovation rather than with owning the
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.160]   biggest user base.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.160]   Right.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.160]   That makes sense.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:36.560]   Now, like for Twitter, clearly, I mean, you look at Buzz and Buzz is about, it's much
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:42.800]   closer to, for instance, what Friend Feed and Jai Kubur, which is really about a conversation.
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.440]   I think Buzz is challenged as a product.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:53.680]   Now remember, when we talk about Google, Buzz is bigger than just Buzz for Google because
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:58.080]   underneath there's infrastructure that's shared and that's surfaced in lots of other
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.800]   Google services too, for instance, Google Attitude.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:06.320]   Now, but specifically for Buzz, I think inside of Gmail, it's about creating this flow of
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.240]   a conversation.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:13.640]   Whereas, you know, at least Twitter for me is really about the phatic stuff that Kevin
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.640]   was mentioning.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:20.200]   I think that's why we're going to see things like Four Square and probably, like, I believe
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.480]   personally, like, that's one of the things I'm looking at now is that there's probably
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:32.360]   a space for an even more simpler way to just update, like, hey, this is, I want to see
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:39.080]   a movie or, you know, I'm out with Kids at a Park right now with just, you know, short
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:42.120]   taps without even possibly needing to text anything.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:46.120]   Also, because, you know, a lot of us are now on touchscreen phones where, frankly, still,
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.960]   I don't think the text input is optimal.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.880]   So, I think there's an opportunity to figure out social interaction that doesn't require
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:52.880]   typing.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:58.000]   But, you know, so all of these should be different services.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.560]   You know, we should have this wealth of different services and they don't all need to copy each
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.560]   other.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.120]   We just want that basic information to flow.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.120]   Right.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:09.760]   What's the best way for Google to demonstrate the two way of this?
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:14.080]   I mean, at some point, not just that I can use it to author Twitter, but I want to be
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.000]   able to take my entire feed out of it.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   I don't know.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   Put it in.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   I look, God forbid.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.720]   If it's going to be that open standards way to just move things around kind of the new
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.800]   sip of the new age, then I think Google has to demonstrate that pretty quickly.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.120]   What would the clearest demonstration of that be?
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.480]   Well, you can do that today.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.960]   You can follow.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:41.560]   You can subscribe to any buzz users, public updates via Pub/SubHub them and get them in
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:42.560]   real time.
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:46.840]   So, there's a way, if you want to get the firehulls out of Google right now, for instance,
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:51.240]   you would just subscribe to each individual user's Pub/SubHub team.
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.240]   So that's huge.
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.840]   So, have you got a click set?
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.800]   CLIQ, S-E-T, clickset.com, they let you do that now.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.720]   They've built an activity streams based system there.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:06.040]   They've been hooking up to all the stuff and they make that work with the buzz now,
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:08.040]   so you can wire stuff both ways.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.000]   And you get a different view of it.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.080]   So, there's one example of somebody who's already built that.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.080]   And there are others.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:18.880]   I'm sure that the Microsoft team will be absorbing these feeds soon because they've already absorbed
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.760]   75 different kinds of activity streams from different sources.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:27.240]   So, at the moment, it's like, okay, they've launched this thing.
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.960]   It's outputting stuff in this standards form.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:32.800]   We're going to have a bit of iteration where we go, oh, you meant that by that and I meant
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.640]   this by that, we should clean that up.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:37.640]   Those discussions are already going on, but we're going to start seeing more and more
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.280]   of these things plug together and make sense.
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:43.120]   So, you believe there's incentive for companies that might be threatened by this to cooperate
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.000]   rather than to shut down too.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   Very much.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.080]   But there's also incentives for other companies as well.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.360]   The example of Netflix is a strong one.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.360]   No.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.160]   Netflix did try and build their own social stuff inside Netflix, but I haven't framed
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.160]   it anywhere on there.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.160]   I've put two people back to them, I think.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:02.600]   Whereas, they make it straightforward to get a stream out that says Kevin is watching
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.600]   this movie.
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.600]   Kevin has added this one to his queue.
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.320]   Kevin gave his one four stars or whatever.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.080]   They've got that there and it's coming out as an activist stream now, which we can then
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.840]   pipe into this system and decide who we share that with.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:13.840]   So, who that's interesting?
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:17.160]   So, who would be the company that would also best demonstrate from the other side?
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:21.160]   If Amazon pulled this stream in, I mean, who'd be somebody who could use this in a really
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.720]   creative way for their own strategy and own service?
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.720]   Well, that's what we don't know.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.360]   I think in your field in the news business, I think this is enormously significant.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:35.800]   Again, if you're right, New York Times and my friends in New York Times, I have none.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:36.800]   More recent one.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:37.800]   Right.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.800]   Right.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.440]   I've posted with bringing in friends from Twitter and from Facebook, was a good marker
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.440]   for that.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.440]   That's really...
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.800]   You had to write a separate one for Twitter and a separate one for Facebook.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.600]   The hope with doing these standards is that you can do one and you can choose which set
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:52.600]   it comes from.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:55.720]   You can say, "Okay, I've decided to keep my friends in Facebook.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.480]   I've decided to keep my friends here.
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:58.920]   I keep my activity updates there.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.920]   I want to watch them here.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:00.920]   I want to watch them there."
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:03.800]   That should be up to you, but you should be able to feed them back and forth to the
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.960]   other places as well.
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.760]   And conversely, you should potentially be able to feed a subset of them.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:12.880]   I think that's where the subgrouping thing that Yuri was talking about that isn't fully
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:13.880]   baked yet.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.240]   That's going to get interesting.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:20.640]   At some point, you're starting to find that when you sign up for a site, you want to delegate
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:21.640]   credentials to somewhere else.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:24.000]   You want to log in with Facebook, you want to log in with Twitter, you want to log in
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.440]   with Google.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.160]   We're seeing more and more of that.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.520]   That's a huge time saver over the import process.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:34.160]   But I suspect we're going to suddenly say, "Well, actually, I want to sign in that with
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.240]   just my work colleagues.
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.840]   I want to sign in that one with just my patients.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.760]   I want to sign in that one with just my family and do that."
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:42.760]   And so far, I think the...
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.080]   I'm not sure anyone's been doing that well yet.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:51.240]   I think the closest may be Ning where you can have separate sites, separate social networks
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:54.000]   for separate subsets of things.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.800]   I think that's going to start getting significant.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:00.520]   So it will be the same thing of, "I can take whichever place I'm using to the other place."
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:05.040]   And whichever identity I have, whichever identity I have, whichever subset of it, fast
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.440]   subset of that I want to do.
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.920]   The infrastructure is there for that.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:11.960]   That's supported in the APIs in the way that OAuth works and the way that portable contacts
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.160]   works and the way that activity streams works.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.560]   You can decide that different people get to see different views of it.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.360]   It's just a question of building a user interface that makes sense for that, making that stuff
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.120]   flow and actually having enough choices that the user can make sense of that.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.400]   So I think that's going to be a significant part of this going forward over the next couple
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.400]   of years.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.400]   I'm going to sign up for our marketing day.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:36.760]   A new Google service.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.680]   Which I was very happy with.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.800]   ArtVark is an interesting service that allows you to ask questions and have your answers
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:48.120]   come from your social graph and have them ask questions of you.
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:53.800]   And I asked a question today immediately and since we have Yuri here in honor of Finland,
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.720]   I actually do want to get a sauna for the house.
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.840]   And so I asked what company should I use.
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:02.280]   And it took about 20 minutes and somebody came back and gave an answer.
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.760]   Awesome.
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.760]   So what company was it?
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.760]   I actually didn't like it.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:07.760]   Diki sauna.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.240]   Do you have any recommendation here?
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:15.040]   Well, you can buy the lumber from me now because I've become a forest grower as of recent.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.040]   Really?
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.200]   So if you need any timber, let me know.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.680]   Do you have one in your house?
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.000]   Of course he does.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   He's finished.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   Come on.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.640]   Is it wood-fired or electric?
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.360]   I'm sorry, I'm just going to ask this.
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:30.680]   We don't have electric saunas.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.520]   I mean, we do something.
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:36.360]   Yeah, the real saunas are obviously all wood-fired.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.720]   There's a couple of different flavors.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:43.200]   The most exotic one is called the smoke sauna where you actually heat it up by, you know,
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.920]   there's no way for the smoke to get out so the room gets full of smoke and all the walls
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.800]   get covered in the suit and then you let the smoke out.
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:50.800]   It seems a little danger.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.800]   Oh, you let the smoke out.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.800]   Oh, good.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:53.800]   Oh, yeah, you let the smoke out first.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:54.800]   Okay.
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.800]   I'm sorry for that.
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:56.800]   No, I'm fascinated.
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:02.280]   I think that's how hard we're.
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:07.120]   So coming back to this question of, you know, buzz versus the other services though, I mean,
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:13.680]   I don't want to make it seem like a flat playing field where, you know, a thing where, you
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:18.360]   know, everyone should just coexist and be happy and I think competition is good.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:26.920]   And my question here for you guys is, do you believe that you will, you know, will buzz
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:33.680]   become a more central part of your social life going forward on the web or will it just
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:37.240]   kind of, you know, stay alongside there with Twitter and Facebook?
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:42.440]   I'll speak more myself because it's in Gmail and I think this is true for a lot of people.
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:47.520]   It's going to end up being the default just because you're there all the time anyway.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:51.640]   If you put in the features that make it easy to manage the information, easy to find the
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:56.520]   information, it's just kind of a natural thing to do to click the buzz to check it.
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.720]   And I hope actually to use it all the time.
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:03.840]   I'm already using it on my phone as an experiment today instead of posting in a friend feed room,
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:09.200]   I posted on buzz and we've got many of this far more comments.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:12.000]   I know a lot of the same kind of conversation going on.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:19.760]   So I'd say for me, in fact, I was even considering replacing everything with buzz.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.760]   How about you, Jeff?
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:22.760]   It depends.
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:29.600]   I think that it has to have the kind of controls to reduce the noise rather than add to it.
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:34.680]   That's one, two, I have to be able to use it and I'm no genie trapani, so I can't program
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.760]   anything.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:40.320]   So I want to be able to have people who create things for me so that I can not abandon, I
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:44.080]   don't want to abandon the public I have on Twitter.
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.640]   No, I can't do that either, actually.
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:49.920]   So I want to use this to publish to that and in a sense, Twitter made me abandon my blog
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.200]   too much and I regret that.
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.520]   So that I don't want to go through that again.
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:59.200]   I want to find ways to do what you're all promising will happen, but I don't see yet.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:07.520]   And I'm going to be impatient to get that I can use this as a tool for my avatars all
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:08.520]   over the web.
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:10.640]   And that's there and it's not there yet.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:14.960]   When that's there, yes, that's extremely powerful.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:15.960]   Kevin?
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.720]   Well, I think, you know, talking to pieces together important, one of the things we do
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:23.960]   at RIBIT is you have it set up so that when your phone rings, we show you the last data
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.480]   updates from your friends across to social networks.
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:29.960]   And again, at the moment, we're having to write per network code for that.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:34.840]   But the idea of being able to do that generically across open standards is a powerful thing.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:37.720]   And that's, you know, that's, again, we don't want to have to build that infrastructure
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:38.720]   ourselves for everything.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:42.760]   We much rather use the ones that you already use and connect you to the people you're already
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:46.360]   using there having to actually say, okay, no, in order to do this, we need to build a
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.160]   social network site would be a mistake.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:53.000]   So I think there's lots of opportunities for people to take pieces of this and say, how
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.160]   can I plug this stuff together?
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:58.480]   We've seen that with the ecosystem around Twitter, the ecosystem around Facebook, the
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:03.360]   other social sites, that it's possible to build applications that just do the piece
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.360]   that you want to do and not have to build this other infrastructure first.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.240]   You know, that's the huge value of this.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:14.560]   And I think that bringing that back to something that people use as regularly as Gmail is important.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.000]   You know, there are sets of people.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.960]   I think a big part of this is there are sets of people who live in Gmail, who live in email.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:24.440]   And a lot of them have moved to Gmail because it's a good way to live in email.
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:28.840]   And so this is going to bring the world that we're used to from the social web to that
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:29.840]   group of people.
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.600]   Now that, you know, and yeah, it's, they're a place where that's going to be uncomfortable
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.600]   for them.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:39.520]   And then Google needs to be more careful about not, you know, crossing compartments like
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.520]   they did for some of the people already.
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:46.040]   But I think that by bringing it to the tool they're already using, that's an actual added
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.800]   value point for those people because they don't want to go over to Twitter to look at
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.800]   stuff.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.840]   They don't want to go over to Facebook necessarily to look at stuff.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:57.440]   Whereas conversely, the people who are happy in Facebook and just use Gmail for talking
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:03.200]   to the bank and the, you know, the university, the way that we use paper mail before.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:07.080]   I'm not going to be as interested in bars, but I'm going to be focused on the stuff over
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.080]   there.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.160]   So just being able to pipe the stuff back and forth is going to be valuable for you wherever
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.600]   you decide to sort of send to your life on this.
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.840]   And I like, you know, it's my greatery herd thing.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:20.920]   I think that's a, that's a very good way of putting it.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:25.120]   The other thing I want to know, Leo, is I want to, I want to contact, let's say, John
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:30.080]   Borthwick at beta works who backed the original Twitter search engine and backed Bitly.
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:33.080]   And I think that there are going to be company, if this thing does take off the way we're
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.280]   going to know it takes off as people are going to start new companies.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:38.520]   I hope my son's one of them on top of this.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.160]   And that's where we're going to know the way it is.
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.160]   Yeah.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.160]   It really is a platform.
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:48.800]   It truly is a platform for our identities and communication and social life across the
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:49.800]   web.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:55.480]   Then let's hope that Google is once again creating opportunities for a lot of growth.
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:59.840]   I wonder, you know, I can see the value to a company like the New York Times.
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.840]   It doesn't have a social component.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:04.000]   And then of course they do, but you're right.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   Right.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.960]   And of course they must have looked at open social too as that kind of promise.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:11.320]   And this is really the delivering on that promise.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.680]   I have to think that companies like Twitter and Facebook will see it more as a threat than
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:15.680]   as a promise.
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.880]   I'm not convinced that they're going to say, Oh, great, wonderful.
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:18.880]   Come on.
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:23.200]   Let's let's all federate unless users really demand it.
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:26.240]   And I think a lot of users are not going to demand it.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.600]   I think it took a long time for people to get used to the ID of Twitter at all.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:35.640]   And now having become used to it, I think most people are just going to stop and say,
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:36.640]   that's it.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:37.640]   I got it.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:38.640]   I'm done.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:41.640]   I don't think they see the need for open standards or federation or, you know, I think
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:44.360]   I don't think silos bother them per se.
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:49.240]   Well, you know, it does in terms of who they can contact and where, you know, do you just
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:53.080]   having seen you go to where everybody's on Twitter that you want to talk to, then they
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.720]   don't see it as a silo.
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:55.720]   Sure.
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:59.800]   But yeah, but that's why my Facebook had a lot of.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:03.360]   You know, this is this is cut in some ways.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:08.640]   This is the replay of the right, the email wars of the early 90s, where it's like, Oh,
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.600]   you can't email people on another system.
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:11.600]   What are you talking about?
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:12.600]   Right.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:13.600]   Oh, you can, but it goes through it.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.480]   It gets it gets much worse and turns into something that it doesn't make sense.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.000]   It's not as good as we can do here.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   Right.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   In some ways, you know, the attachments go away or something.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.240]   And it's got wild for the standards to actually make stuff propagate back and forth better.
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:27.520]   This has been a great conversation.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.880]   I hope it stimulates our audience.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:32.000]   Well, of course, everybody listens to this show probably immediately jumped on buzz.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.080]   But I hope it stimulates some people to maybe take a second look if they were initially put
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:38.360]   off by the volume of content.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:43.680]   Don't follow me or scoble or Jason if you want to, if you want to avoid that.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:47.760]   There are a lot of nice, quieter conversations going on.
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:51.560]   But as soon as you come up with, there needs to be a way to say, okay, these high traffic,
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:56.360]   high volume threads, let me put them somewhere aside or collapse them or something so that
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:01.000]   I can see the low volume threads as well.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000]   I'm very excited about it.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000]   I think it's a really cool new platform.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.760]   Normally, we would be doing a tip and a number and a tool.
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:13.360]   We won't do the tip, although I think if you want a tip, and I bet you it would have
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.440]   been the tip that Gina would have given us.
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:18.480]   And I'm sure next week she'll have many buzz tips.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:23.440]   But of course, the very first thing I did with Buzz is create a filter that filtered
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.720]   the buzz content out of my inbox that I don't see it.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:31.280]   And I think if you are put off by the amount of traffic you're getting from buzz, it's
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.280]   very simple.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:34.000]   You just create a filter.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.880]   The key to this is that the filter, it has the words label colon buzz is legal, even though
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:43.160]   Google will actually complain about it.
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:48.560]   So say, have the words label colon buzz, Google will then say, warning, warning, filter searches
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:54.160]   containing label in or is criteria are not recommended as these criteria will never match
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:57.760]   incoming in mail, which is not true.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:03.480]   Maybe we can get that removed for whoever's watching from the Gmail team.
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:06.160]   I mean, maybe, I don't know, there's a reason for that.
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:13.960]   And then skip the inbox and all of your buzzes will then go into the buzz.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:18.280]   The first thing that took me a long time to figure out is that what Gmail calls a filter
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:21.480]   is what I call a folder or a filter plus a folder.
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:27.520]   So it'll go into the label buzz, which now is where all my buzzes are.
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:30.200]   And I can read them then.
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.320]   So that's a little tip that I'm sure Gina would have passed along and it does make your
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.400]   inbox a lot more manageable not to have.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:43.480]   I have to wonder if she's thinking, maybe I should have waited for buzz.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.240]   Do you have enough?
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:51.040]   Leah, Leah, Leah, you should tell the mute trip, sorry, tip two, just how you mute a thread.
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:55.400]   Yeah, of course this will be much more useful when you have unmute.
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:59.440]   But if a thread is getting to you, let's say you really have seen quite enough of this
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:05.180]   this week in Google thread, you can mute it by just clicking the down arrow in the upper
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:08.640]   right hand corner and mute this post and you won't see it anymore.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.280]   Unfortunately, I don't know how to unmute it.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:13.280]   So it's kind of gone forever.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.280]   I think you can search for it and then bring it back.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.280]   Okay.
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:22.000]   So if you can, so remember it, then you can find it, then you can unmute it.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.640]   You remember a magic word in it?
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:27.400]   Yeah, remember some magic word and then you can find it again.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.480]   Yeah, that is a good tip, Yuri.
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:32.880]   And you haven't, maybe Yuri, you have, you've probably used this more than anybody.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:35.360]   You've been using this for over a year.
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:39.760]   You got a tip for us to make buzz better?
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:44.760]   Well, one thing that I noticed a lot of people don't know exists, which is just kind of a
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.840]   general Gmail tip is the keyboard shortcuts for, so for instance, the muting.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:49.840]   Oh, M works.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:50.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:51.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:52.840]   Just press M on the keyboard.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:55.720]   You have to have keyboard shortcuts turned on in your settings, but I forgot that's a
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:56.720]   very good point.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.920]   Much easier than the dropdown.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.560]   Just type M.
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:04.280]   And then if you want to turn off buzz completely, it's in the footer.
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:07.200]   There's turn off chat, turn off buzz.
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:10.600]   Little tiny letters, but it is there.
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:11.600]   Turn off buzz.
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:15.480]   Are you sure you are?
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:18.120]   I should turn off chat because every time I show the screen, I'm afraid people are going
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:20.480]   to start chatting with me.
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.480]   So it is.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:22.480]   It's right down there.
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:25.600]   But now you can presumably turn it right back on at another time.
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.600]   If you decide to cut.
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:27.600]   That's right.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:28.600]   Okay.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:29.600]   Good tips.
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:30.600]   A number, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.000]   All right, I'll sneak in a news item this way.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.400]   Three numbers, 50,000, 500,000 and one gig.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.720]   Google's going to build one gig.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:39.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.120]   Networks in towns.
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:45.040]   And I'm trying to figure out how to get my town to a great, great, all-ar.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.120]   I've gone to the city council.
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.720]   It's a way to get us geeks out of the woodworking.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:54.200]   I didn't know you were a good neighbor, but Google's going to build a one gig open.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.520]   They say network.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:01.720]   And I think that's going to be incredibly and magnificently disruptive to show what life
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:02.880]   in America could be.
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:07.000]   So at some point here, I'm going to have both a gig network to my home and a sound.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.160]   It'll be just like Finland.
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.520]   Socialist.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:16.400]   My new rallying cry is light the dark fiber.
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.840]   And we'll all know how much you're making.
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:19.840]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:20.840]   It'll be online.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:21.840]   Very good.
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:22.840]   Good.
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:23.840]   Good.
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:24.840]   I forgot to, you know, there is actually a lot of news.
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:27.680]   I just wanted to spend some time since we have Kevin and Yuri here to talk about both.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:28.680]   But you're absolutely right.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:32.320]   That's a huge story and a very interesting story.
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:38.440]   Yuri or Kevin, you want to comment on that and all the gigabit Google?
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:41.480]   I think it's definitely an interesting move by then.
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:44.760]   And it's something that they want, what they've said.
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:49.880]   There was a good interview with Stacy Hickenbottom at Gigatome about this for this saying, "We're
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.480]   not trying to be the infrastructure provider.
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:55.160]   We're just trying to do a pilot to show what's possible and to debunk some of the things
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:30:00.240]   the incumbent carriers have said about, "Oh, this is a possible take as millions of years."
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:03.760]   And they say, "Okay, what is actually possible to do some action experiments on that?"
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:04.760]   And where am I?
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:08.680]   BT had, I think it'd be great if BT could start running fiber in America to the way it
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:09.680]   can run fiber in the UK.
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:10.680]   That'd be good.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:11.680]   Please, Kevin, please.
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:12.680]   I'm really juicy.
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:18.760]   But at the moment, the model in the US is that monopolies are handed out and they get
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:20.320]   to decide what they do and where.
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:23.960]   So if we can disrupt that, that's great.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:29.240]   I've read about this five years ago or something saying, "I would love to have access to the
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:33.080]   stuff out the back of my house on the fence where the things are running.
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:34.240]   I just want to run a bit of a glass.
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:36.440]   There's no electricity running through it.
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:38.920]   Just run a fiber along there and look at the other end.
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:42.200]   There's no fire hazard in a fiber.
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:48.280]   But being able to start from this end and run the fiber up would be great too, as well
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:50.880]   as running it down.
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:55.720]   We need more connectivity for all these things we're using and finding where to do that is
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:56.720]   a great thing.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:01.120]   To point out to civic fathers and mothers everywhere that a great way to get reelected would be
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:05.080]   to get Google to put gigabit fiber in your town.
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:08.280]   So maybe you ought to start preparing that.
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:09.360]   I don't need to mention a tool.
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.440]   I think Buzz is the tool.
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.480]   If you haven't tried it, I think it's well worth trying.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:15.440]   We're going to certainly use it more and more on the network.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:18.960]   I've got to play with all the interconnects because I think it should be simple for this
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:21.560]   to pipe into friendfeed so that we get both.
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:29.000]   I think you should have a competition to develop some kind of magnificent buzzy twig, etc.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000]   Ah!
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.040]   Well, Chris Messina posted on Buzz just a minute ago, or actually posted it on clickset, just
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:38.000]   a minute ago, the Fluid app makes it possible on a Mac and Croce Chrome would do this on
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:45.640]   a Windows machine to have an effective Buzz application just by making the Buzz page
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.160]   be a standalone app.
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:51.160]   You could do that with Fluid or with Chrome.
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.160]   That would be handy.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:56.400]   But yeah, I bet we could make a Twit specific one.
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:57.760]   Kevin Marks, thank you so much for being here.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:58.760]   We really appreciate it.
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:00.760]   Thanks for inviting me.
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:01.760]   A very interesting conversation.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:02.760]   Yeah, great.
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:07.080]   And of course, Kevin's a regular on another show on the Twit Network, which is rapidly
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.080]   becoming one of my favorites.
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.400]   It's called Tumble Vision.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:13.720]   It's all about keeping the party going in social media.
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:17.840]   And you can listen to that or watch it on the Twit Network.
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:18.840]   What days is it Thursday?
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:19.840]   You do that?
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:23.520]   Thursday night at 7pm Pacific, 10pm Eastern.
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:28.280]   And I think we're quickly going to turn that into a podcast because it's among the smartest
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:30.560]   people and the best conversations I've heard on that.
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:33.520]   Heather Golden, does that with Heather Gold with you?
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:34.520]   And then Deb Shultz, yeah.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:35.520]   And Deb Shultz, that's right.
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:36.520]   And was your idea?
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:37.520]   Wasn't it?
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:38.520]   I think you came to me with it anyway.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:41.200]   I think the three of us got together and said we need to do this.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.200]   I love it.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:44.240]   Because the concept is so important.
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:45.240]   Yeah.
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:48.000]   I just love it.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000]   It's so great to reconnect with you.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.400]   I'm glad that you are now retired and living in Finland.
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.400]   Growing forests.
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.400]   That's great.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:57.400]   Growing forests in Finland.
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:58.400]   We need more of them.
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:59.400]   It's good.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.880]   zenghastrum.com is his website.
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:06.040]   You can read his posts and I'm sure we'll hear a lot more from Yuri.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.600]   Founder of Jaiku, former Googler.
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:10.600]   And a great guy to have on.
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:11.600]   We'll have one.
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.600]   Once a Googler, always a Googler.
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:13.600]   Yeah, I know.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.600]   This is the former Googler show.
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:16.600]   Thank you, Yuri.
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:17.600]   This week and ex Googlers.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:20.680]   Did Petri leave or is he still at Google?
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:21.680]   He's now a venture capitalist.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.360]   Oh, see, you left as well.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.320]   I guess that nine could be right now.
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.320]   All right.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.320]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:29.320]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:29.320]   Bye bye.
