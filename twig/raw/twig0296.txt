[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.000]   professor of journalism, blogger at buzzmachine.com, author of so many great books.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.960]   What would Google do?
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.960]   Public parts.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.280]   You don't have to hold them all up.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.960]   Geeks bearing news, gifts.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.840]   I always want to say news, but it's gifts.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.160]   Say it's like at Gutenberg the Geek.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.640]   Thank you for being here, Jeff.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.640]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.640]   We love that.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.760]   And you know who's back or so happy to see her from ThinkUp.com.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.760]   It's Jean-in-Trap Panny.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.760]   Great to be here.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.760]   Hi.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.240]   Did you know about Android last night too?
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.240]   I didn't.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   I haven't been on all about Android in a while, but Jason and I are sure you've set
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.240]   updates.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.760]   I had this crazy bronchitis walking pneumonia thing happen.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.680]   I was just laid up for a couple of weeks there.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.680]   You feeling okay now?
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.600]   Yeah, feeling way, way better.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.200]   But yeah, it was six days in bed.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   I've never been.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   Geeks.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   That's what winter does to you.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.200]   Crazy, crazy.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.200]   It's not.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   So I didn't get on all of it Android this month, but I'll be back.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.840]   Well, we're just thrilled to see you.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.960]   You know, of course, has given up show business for her startup, ThinkUp.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.200]   You can see my ThinkUp.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.920]   I'll log in as me, but you can see it with, if you just go to leoloport.thinkup.com.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.280]   And you can see what it does for you.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   It's so good.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.040]   Yeah, we've been having a lot of fun.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.280]   I miss you guys, but we've been, we've been heads down building all kinds of things I'm
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.280]   really excited about.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.280]   I can't talk about it yet.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.720]   Does it scare you that Twitter is pulling the plug on the fire?
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.800]   You don't, you're not a fire host consumer.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   No, we're not.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.800]   We're a per user.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.240]   We use the, we're old school.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.080]   We use the per user rest API.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.600]   So we weren't affected by that.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   I get it.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.920]   So they got the whole point of this was these are companies that can you believe by the
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.920]   way?
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:54.840]   I spent a lot of energy crafting, hand crafting tweets, making the best possible tweets.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.640]   And then some, some weird API goes off.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.000]   There's a site called Twitter counter that's been around for ages.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.520]   That's how we used to keep track of who was number one on Twitter back when it was me
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.520]   versus Kevin Rose.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.160]   And I had set up like three weeks ago, their email thing so I could email tweets, never
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.560]   used it.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.080]   And I think something weird happened because all of a sudden I tweeted hi comma.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.920]   And I'm looking at my Twitter stream lights up.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.160]   I'm going, what?
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.600]   Four minutes ago, I tweeted hi comma.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.200]   No, I'm lying in bed.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.840]   So of course, I immediately went down the hall to Michael, the kid and said, Michael,
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.400]   did you, were you on my computer?
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   He said, no.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.800]   He said, Oh, okay.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.280]   Well, I could never figure it out.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.880]   Finally I figured out that was from Twitter counter.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.960]   They can't figure it out either.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.560]   But it doesn't matter.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.040]   Hi comma was the, not only the big tweet of the week, the big tweet of the year, 250
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.800]   replies, 456 favorites, a hut, 164 people retweeted hi comma.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.800]   That's incredible.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   I know we're all going to do it.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.760]   Your fans are thirsty for engagement, Leo.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.320]   Is that what it is?
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.280]   I'm just going to tweet non sequitur greetings every few days and I'll be huge.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.440]   You know, it's so funny.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.320]   I've had people say to me, I read your tweets and I don't know what you're talking about
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.320]   most of the time.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.320]   Maybe that's it.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.120]   And I think, I think that just happens, you know, when you're passionate about a topic
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.240]   or when you're talking to folks, you feel like, you know, like the twig audience, you
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.920]   know, you know, where I'm coming from.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.440]   I think you kind of just make assumptions.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.840]   I think when you say something like, did everybody understand?
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.840]   People like it.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.880]   Well, there's a real insight there.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.880]   Wow.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.880]   That's my theory.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.200]   And I love your, I love the insight that you wrote.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.760]   Whatever Leo LaPorte said must have been memorable.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.000]   I'll never forget it.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.560]   I thought that comma was a bug on thingups part, but no, it was hi comma.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.000]   It was also really a cliffhanger.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.720]   I knew that says punctuation is central to the how many how many buys did you get?
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.080]   Oh, I get a lot.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.960]   The first thing I got was from Jeff Neils who tweeted there.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.720]   Yes, he completed it.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.440]   Yeah, people's brains can't can't abide by those kinds of things just hanging there out
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.400]   in space.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.520]   It's like unclothes parentheses.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.800]   But that's when you're really glad you have think up because you can immediately, you
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.680]   know, this is not stuff that you can easily see, but think up will surface stuff.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.760]   It's also really fun to go back in time and see, you know, your big tweets from a year
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.880]   ago and two years ago.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.880]   I love that.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.440]   That's one of the reasons we subscribe to Time Hop.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.760]   Many of us.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.880]   I use 33 exclamation marks or 33 tweets with exclamation marks.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.120]   I do like the exclamation mark a little too much.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.280]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.280]   It's a love of life.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.960]   I wish you would do a think up for podcasts.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.960]   Mm.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.360]   And you could say Leo said actually 27 times this week.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.680]   Wouldn't that be useful?
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.680]   Or stole destroy.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.680]   I don't know.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.680]   So many of them of every time I said, and I apologize to everyone who's ever listened
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.680]   to Twig because I do that.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.520]   And it was just like, kill me now.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.320]   Just let me crawl under my desk and never speak again.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.960]   We all have verbal crutches.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.120]   Oh, it's not a good verbal crutch.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.120]   No, it's not a good one.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.280]   But actually, it's bad.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.920]   There's a lot of bad verbal crutches out there.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.400]   And all of us have some.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.400]   So.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.040]   I think NPR just did a piece on no totally as a linguist.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.040]   No, totally.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.040]   No, totally.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.040]   Totally.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   Oh, totally.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   You know what I hate and I do it all the time?
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.040]   Yeah, no.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.200]   Yeah, no.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.920]   And it's like, that I just said two contradictory things in one sense.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.040]   Yeah, no.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.080]   I say that a lot.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.240]   Google Ventures.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.040]   This makes me happy.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.040]   Can thank me for 185,000 more people seeing in their tweet.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.040]   You can include that in your pitch deck when you try to raise the--
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.040]   I know.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.040]   --reto it.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.040]   I know.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.040]   I'm bigger than you.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.040]   We're not.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.720]   Did you watch-- did you guys watch Silicon Valley on Sunday?
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.720]   I did.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.720]   I did.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.720]   I love that show.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.720]   What?
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.720]   Yeah, he dropped.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.320]   Oh, that's Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff like left it in protest.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.320]   I love that show.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.320]   So many--
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.320]   I know people hate it.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.320]   It's a satire.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.320]   I think it's funny.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.320]   I think it's funny.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.040]   Look, some jokes aren't, but it's interesting.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.040]   If you're--
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.880]   There's a little too many dick jokes, I understand that.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.760]   And unfortunately, Sunday was really full of them.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.360]   But if you're in the scene, you recognize so many things.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.320]   And I was just sure, and I was wrong, but I was just sure that there were tons of venture
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.680]   capitalists, real ones sprinkled through that episode on Sunday.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.680]   Definitely.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:54.040]   So to figure out, the story is that at the end of last season, they won Tech Grunch Disrupt.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.200]   And so, Pied Piper, which is this fictional company that's created this new compression
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.560]   algorithm that's better than any-- what is this that?
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.560]   We got pie--
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   We got pie from the Weismann scale.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.640]   And nobody's ever done that.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.440]   And there's a Google analog called hooly.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:21.240]   But so the story, this season begins with them going now out to get their AROUND of
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.080]   financing.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.600]   And actually, I really-- you can't spoil a comedy.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.560]   Can I spoil a comedy?
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.560]   You can spoil it.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.680]   I thought it was a great commentary.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.120]   So I'm going to-- you don't have to spoil it.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.120]   I'll spoil it.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.880]   So the bigger jokes they were in each meeting, like the bigger jerks and like the most dismissive
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.520]   and condescending that they could be, the bigger offers they would get.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.240]   And like, this is-- I think this is why the show is so great.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.000]   I mean, there's a commentary kind of on--
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Absolutely.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.240]   On what sort of behavior gets rewarded in an industry.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.080]   And it's so funny because, you know, people say that show is so sexist, there are no women.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.080]   How do you like the show?
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.080]   It's so sexist.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   It's a-- it's a commentary.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.040]   You know, the industry is sexist.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.640]   It's sexist because it's a commentary on the industry.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.840]   And I will point out that one of the few women in the show is like the only competent
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.840]   group person.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.320]   The only nice, intelligent person in the show is that woman right there.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.320]   Right.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.320]   Right.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.920]   I loved having been through a less intense and certainly smaller round of fundraising.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.760]   I really enjoyed watching those meetings.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.240]   It was a good episode.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.360]   Listen, it's a half an hour and a second.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.360]   It's fun.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.720]   I like Veeep a little better, but that's okay because Veeep, you've got to watch three
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.880]   times because the jokes are so fast.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.880]   Right.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.720]   But here's the thing that I thought was-- and the real reason I'm bringing it up.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.120]   Yes, they went and they got-- were able to get insane evaluations.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.160]   Only the last valuation was that they get what was it?
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.480]   $50 million and be for evaluation of $200 million.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.720]   That was the top they got.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.640]   And then somebody, the smart woman, said, "You don't want to take that money.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.680]   That's death.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:07.520]   You need to negotiate down because if you take too much money, then there's too much
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.320]   pressure to turn it around and you'll be out of business.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.920]   You'll lose your company because you can't live up to that.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.520]   You're not worth that."
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.600]   And I thought that was a-- I thought actually that was very astute.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.040]   Have you experienced that, Jeff ever?
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.040]   I mean, is that a thing?
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.720]   Well, you know, I love to tell the story that Nick Dent and when I was on the board of his
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.760]   last company moreover, he raised a lot of money.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.720]   It was in early 2000s.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.200]   And when we hit the bus, I said, "Boy, Nick, the best thing we ever did was raise too much
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   money."
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.600]   So we have a safety net and he said, "No, Jarvis, worst thing I ever did.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.080]   Let the CEO try things we shouldn't have tried.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.280]   Too much money is bad."
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.000]   Very, very Nick thing to say, Agie.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.120]   Yeah, yeah, he's extremely-- yes, that is very Nick thing to say.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.040]   He's very bearish on that kind of thing.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.600]   I was just reading about-- I think it's get satisfaction.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.360]   Lane Becker's company, they just got sold and he was one of the founders and he didn't
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.360]   make a dime.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.640]   It was a fire of sale, his work.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.640]   And when asked--
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.640]   I love Lane.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.440]   Yeah, I love Lane too.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.120]   He tweeted very frankly about what happened, but he basically said, you know, there was
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.920]   a point in the lifetime of the company where we had acquisition offers and then we had
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.600]   this round of fundraising that we could do and we took too much money.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.600]   The company wasn't worth it.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.880]   So it's exactly-- so this was prescient.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.040]   Silicon Valley, of course, recorded before this.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.040]   But this is prescient.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.280]   This is exactly-- wow.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.320]   You know who's writing for them?
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.320]   I didn't know this.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.000]   Dan Lyons.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.920]   So maybe-- for Silicon Valley, the TV show.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.920]   Oh, oh.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.920]   I didn't realize that.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.920]   Wow.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.840]   So maybe Nick told Dan and Dan told them.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.840]   I don't know.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   It's just Nick.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.840]   It's just Nick.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.840]   It is wisdom.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.840]   Yeah, I've seen it.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:53.760]   But that's the kind of reason I kind of like it because it's actually-- there's some real
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.000]   reality in all of the comedy.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.520]   There's an insider knowledge that's going on there that's pretty accurate.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.760]   And I think maybe some of that does come from Dan Lyons, who was, you know, was the fake
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.240]   Steve Jobs and is a character and a half.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:15.960]   And for five weeks or less was editor of Chief of Valley WAG and then quit.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.800]   And apparently I didn't know this because I'd seen it somewhere else.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.800]   But then I saw in the credits that he's a contributor.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   Wow.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.440]   So Lane sold Get Satisfaction.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.440]   That's so bad.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.440]   Lane is a really good guy.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.440]   You're right.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.440]   I love Lane.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.440]   He'd raised $50 million.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.440]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.440]   This is a good thought.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.880]   You raised $50 million valuation.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.520]   He'd raised $21 million.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.040]   Preference with Kiliya every time.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.720]   He was pushed out of the company in 2010.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.720]   Was he worse?
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:52.920]   Was one better if you kind of do it for yourself, but then you're powerless?
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.880]   But boy, you know, I hear that from a lot of entrepreneurs who've been pushed out of their
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.880]   companies.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.880]   It's not at all unusual.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.880]   No, no, no.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.760]   In fact, it's almost in the script.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.320]   I had a prenup with Lisa says she can't push me out of the company.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.720]   I don't think you're not kidding about that.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   Are you?
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   No, I am kidding.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.320]   But I mean, I did ask her, you're not going to push me out of the company now that you're
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.080]   married to me.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.720]   So he didn't make any money.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.720]   Now there was sold in a so-called fire sale to sprinkler.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.840]   I don't even know who sprinkler is.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.360]   There's an irony there.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.000]   I felt bad about this for him.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   I told him I was sorry.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   I just opened this way.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   This is tough.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.680]   But when you're a founder, particularly when you're going out trying to get funding, I
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:45.200]   mean, your job is to be as optimistic to the point of absurdity about the possibilities
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.400]   that are within your business.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.160]   So I think, particularly when you get into a bidding war situation, which is basically
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.160]   what they had in the show, which is a fictional course, but more money feels like more success.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.160]   That's more staff.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.160]   You can hire.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.160]   That's an office.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.560]   You can do so many different things.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.320]   So it's a tough thing, I think, for a founder at that early stage, especially when a company
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.480]   is basically just an idea to say, "We're not worth this much."
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.280]   In the show, he says, "Can we do that?
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.440]   Can we ask for less?
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.200]   Does anybody do that?"
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   But yes.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   And it was right on.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.960]   And Lane Becker says, "Ask for less."
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:25.720]   He says, "Although I thought it was more a game of chess, it's more a game of thrones."
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.720]   That's a great line.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.000]   Venture capital is a game and we lost.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   More guy.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.920]   Now, of course, the current CEO did fine and the CFO and late stage investors did fine,
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.720]   but the guy who thought up gets satisfaction, which is a brilliant idea.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.720]   Yep.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.200]   Got nothing.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.040]   So a little lesson there.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.960]   Ripped straight from the headlines.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   And HBO.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.960]   And HBO.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.400]   We didn't get your opinion.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.480]   You think Silicon Valley's okay, Jeff?
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.920]   I haven't watched the season yet.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.920]   Well, you didn't miss anything.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.120]   It's the first episode was Sunday.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   Yeah, I know.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.120]   But I've...
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.680]   You know, I'm such a habit now of watching everything on my Nexus 7.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.880]   I've been flying like crazy.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:11.040]   I was in Copenhagen for 24 hours last week in Italy in UK this week.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.600]   And so I just stock up on things on my Nexus 7.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.240]   And that's how I watch TV now.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.080]   Well, I was thinking that on Sunday because Sunday night, if you were a live TV viewer
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.800]   was purgatory because you had good wife, you had a new good wife episode, you had a
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.920]   new madman episode, the second in the season, the last, the final season.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:37.320]   And you had Game of Thrones, V and Silicon Valley, all on the same night and some against
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.840]   each other.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.840]   And that would not...
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.640]   I don't think that would have happened quite so readily in the pre-VCR on demand.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.360]   Well, you had a little bit of that.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.360]   But you did it.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.360]   But you did it on purpose.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.280]   You said like, we're going to take that guy down.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.280]   Exactly.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.280]   You don't.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.280]   Yes.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.280]   But you knew it was bad for viewers if they had to...
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.760]   And ultimately for you if they had to figure out, well, what are we...
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.640]   I'm just better in a fortune now by in shows.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.040]   Yes, I buy in content people.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.960]   No, I'm with you.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.080]   I mean, like good wife, I actually don't want to watch it too fast now.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.600]   I'm saying I know because you're coming to the end, right?
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.600]   Oh, I'm not.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.600]   No, I'm up season three.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.600]   Oh, we're on season two.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.600]   Good.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.600]   We're with you.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   It is so good.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.600]   I just...
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   But you know what?
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   It's a mindless show.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.600]   It's good.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.600]   You can sit there.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.600]   You don't have to...
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.600]   Game of Thrones.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.600]   If you miss 30 seconds...
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.600]   Who's that?
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.600]   Who are they?
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.000]   What is going on?
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.200]   Why did he do that?
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.600]   Oh my God.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.480]   But good wife, you can miss the whole thing and understand what happened.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.200]   I'm watching season one of Justified right now, which is dead.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   Love that show.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   Love that show.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   That's great.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.200]   Banshee, I'm watching.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.680]   Love, love, Over from Black.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.640]   Oh, Over from Black is that woman is a...
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.480]   She's amazing actress.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.480]   Amazing.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.560]   For those who don't know this show, she's a clone and plays many different versions of
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.880]   nine parts, nine parts, I think.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.880]   And it's really amazing because it's like nine different actors.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.880]   It's incredible.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.880]   It's wild.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.880]   Incredible.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.880]   But I do...
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.320]   I have to say, we live in a golden age for people who want to consume television.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.320]   Yeah, we do.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.320]   Oh, God.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.040]   You know, we cancel HBO.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.040]   We don't have HBO.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.120]   We cancel after Game of Thrones.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.480]   Basically, what we would do, we would subscribe during the Game of Thrones run and then watch
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.400]   girls and all the other stuff during that time.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.320]   And so we didn't even subscribe to HBO this time.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.840]   We just did HBO Now, which was nice and worked really well for us.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.160]   But I really liked that I could start, you know, the Game of Thrones new episode was
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.720]   available starting at 9 p.m. Eastern.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.920]   And we could start it when we wanted and we could, you know, pause it.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.880]   And, you know, we had a lot of functionality and it's a free trial.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.480]   You get it for, you know, it's free for 30 days right now to get all the HBO shows.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.480]   Their timing is good.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.400]   This is a good time to get people hooked on HBO.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.400]   It's brilliant.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.560]   One of my many weaknesses is popcorn.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.200]   I love to go to the movies just to have sit down and have receipt popcorn.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.080]   I have not seen a movie worth even considering in two months.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.000]   No, in fact, I actually don't actively don't go to movies so that I have something to watch
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.600]   at home.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.160]   But there's so little C is my point.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.160]   There's crap.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.840]   TV is so much better than the movies.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.200]   I said that when I was a TV critic and it was partly true.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.840]   Now it is really now it's actually true.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:23.480]   If we interviewed a guy on "Tryingulation" I highly recommend the book and his full premise
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.600]   is the Sopranos changed everything.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:35.800]   That with the rise of the writer/showrunner, suddenly people who wanted to make movies
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:41.000]   shifted to TV because you had so much more scope because instead of a two hour story,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.040]   you could tell a 60 hour story and you could really develop the characters.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:52.440]   And the power of the writer increased incredibly thanks to David Chase.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.320]   And it's probably started with NYPD and shows like that.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.640]   But now it's writ, there's no question about it.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.920]   Even a lot of filmmakers are making TV now.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.800]   Have you seen Daredevil on Netflix?
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.800]   That's supposed to be amazing.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.360]   No, I have it yet.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.240]   That's the CCC basic one.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.240]   I don't know.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.240]   It's a comic book.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.240]   Have you seen it Jason?
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.240]   It's the Netflix original.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.240]   And people are raving in that.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.680]   Yeah, people are going nuts about it.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.080]   I saw the first episode and I couldn't tell if it was just my disconnection with all things
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.080]   comic book because I was not a comic book.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.080]   Yeah, me neither.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.200]   But it's a Marvel comic from what I understand.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.200]   And I don't know.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.480]   I felt it was a little slow supposedly it picks up.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.480]   And some of the acting I thought was kind of...
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.480]   Maybe it's not that great.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.240]   But no, I put out that sentiment on Twitter a couple of days after I saw it.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.440]   And everybody came back and said, "Give it time."
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:51.560]   And usually with these longer form shows like this, yeah, you almost have to put your
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.560]   faith in it.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.240]   That five episodes in you're going to be hooked.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.120]   And usually by the time you get five episodes in you understand where they're going and
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.120]   kind of the theme.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.880]   Well, and I think that's what's changed.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.880]   So yeah, totally.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.680]   They made a movie of Daredevil, but it's two hours.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.160]   You don't have the leisure to waste the first hour.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.960]   Not waste, but to take the first hour to gradually set up characters, set up payoffs
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.960]   and things like that.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.240]   And you know you're going to, especially with nowadays where they buy a whole season and
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.920]   just say, "Here's a hundred million dollars, make 13 of them."
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.880]   You got at least 13 hours.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.880]   That's a big difference.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.760]   And for these great writers, they're just loving this.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.560]   What was the name of the book?
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.240]   It was such a good book.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.240]   You probably know the guy.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.680]   He was a TV critic.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.280]   I can go back to my Audible list and find it.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.720]   But there was one other thing I wanted to mention real quickly to you, Jeff, the Whirly
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.920]   Pop Stove Top Popcorn's Popper.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:55.880]   This will satisfy your need for high quality movie theater popcorn at home.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.880]   And it kind of looks fun to have in here.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.880]   Yeah, it does.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.040]   I'll get yelled at though.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.040]   Why?
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.040]   Because it smells like popcorn.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.040]   Because I shouldn't be eating it.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.320]   Popcorn's good for you, isn't it?
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   It's a whole grain.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.320]   It's oily as hell.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.240]   Yeah, the fat content is to...
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.240]   That's good for you.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.680]   Haven't you been keeping up?
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.680]   Everybody knows that.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.280]   I got enough of it, Leo.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.280]   I do too.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.280]   God knows.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.480]   So the movie popcorn is actually about getting out of the house and hiding out and eating
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.480]   something in here.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.160]   I'm with Salty and oily and death for you.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.160]   Salty and muddly and yeah.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.040]   Too much of it and I'm happy.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.920]   I hate people in movie theaters, but I like to popcorn.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.280]   I'm going to look at my...
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.280]   It was...
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.280]   They talk.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.280]   There's noises.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:46.080]   I still go to movies, but I notice now I'm much more likely to say, "Let's save that one
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.520]   for home."
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.320]   That kind of thing.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.840]   We just finished Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.440]   That grew on me.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.440]   It took a few episodes.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.440]   That's a weird show.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.280]   That's a very weird show.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.760]   It's very weird.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.760]   I'm trying.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.600]   For those who wanted another 30 Rock, it's not that.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.920]   It's very Tina Fey.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:12.720]   It took me a few episodes, but what drew me in was the song, the theme song.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.480]   I love the open.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.080]   The open is amazing.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.080]   Let's play.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.880]   And the process is kind of amazing.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.240]   Because it's a play on memes.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240]   It's a play on...
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:27.560]   In fact, much of the show is a play on memes and the modern world.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:33.200]   The plot is that Kimmy Schmidt was in...
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.840]   What was the name of the Reverend who put her down there?
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:43.000]   Reverend Gary Paul Gary or something like that took four Indiana women and told them
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.440]   the world had ended.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.360]   We got to stay down here in the bunker.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:56.160]   She was there for a long time.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.160]   It's Don Draper.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.360]   I mean, it's John Hamm who plays the Reverend.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.600]   I didn't see... Oh, that's a spoiler because I haven't gotten to that part yet.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.600]   The Reverend shows up.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   Yes.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.600]   Yes.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.400]   And they call them the Indiana mole women.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   Oh, women.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.400]   Yes.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.360]   So Kimmy Schmidt comes to New York to try to create a new life where she's somewhere
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.360]   where she's not known as a mole woman.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.360]   Let me see.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.360]   Is this the open?
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.760]   Richard Wayne Gary Wayne.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.760]   Richard Wayne Gary Wayne.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.760]   Yeah, this is the open.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.760]   No audio.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.760]   Unmute on.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.760]   All right.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.960]   Let's see it.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:36.280]   So what they've done, you remember, you know, what was the first one where some tragedy
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:42.800]   happened and they were interviewing a bystander and she was crazy.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.800]   Yeah, like hydro-wise, hydro-kid.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   Hydro-kid, hydro-wise, right.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.480]   And they made a song out of it.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.880]   So this open to the show is that.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.880]   This is it.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.960]   The women rescued from an underground apocalypse cult allegedly run by soap.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.840]   The men who proclaimed a messiah, Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.640]   Best known to Yelp users in this area.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.680]   As Durnesville's worst wedding DJ, I am now joined by a neighbor who wants all the
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   drama.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.680]   Okay.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.680]   So they got like four things in there already.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.680]   Right.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.680]   And Yelp to.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.680]   Okay.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.680]   Mr.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.680]   Bankston.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.680]   What had happened was I was outside.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.680]   I talked about time for my grandson.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.680]   When I didn't know it.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:43.120]   I think this is the best TV show theme ever.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.120]   This is the full version.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.880]   They don't usually show this whole thing.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.520]   They're using songify.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:56.760]   They love that.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.160]   This is actually all you really need to watch.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.160]   True.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:07.080]   I never seen the whole thing.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:15.800]   No, I didn't either.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   Two, three, four, two, one.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   As America.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   They love that it's so bad.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.800]   Females are strong as hell.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:39.080]   This is why I'm glad I live in the 21st century.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.080]   Seriously.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.760]   It's so meta.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.160]   It's meta meta meta.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.560]   I mean, why do it's hold the record for creepiest guy?
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.160]   You got to listen to every line he says.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.680]   Apparently you can get the video of him just doing the talking and that's hysterical.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.400]   So I'm not.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.440]   But the rest of the show, unless it's like less.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.440]   That's great.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.040]   It's a different definition of cringe worthy.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.600]   You're not cringe worthy because it's bad, but cringe worthy because the situation is
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.600]   just so.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.600]   Oh.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:15.120]   You know, I love it because I make fun of every one of you.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.800]   I mean, you know, rich New Yorkers.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.720]   I love the rich New Yorkers.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:23.400]   Hard weight types, you know, naive, you know, young white women.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.480]   I mean, there's just like, it's the whole gamut.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.760]   It took us a few episodes that we got into it.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.920]   Get to Richard Gary Wayne, Gary.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.920]   I haven't.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.920]   I didn't know it's John Hamm.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   That's going to change everything.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.640]   Yeah, completely different after than Mad Men, obviously.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.640]   Oh, I love him.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.640]   You know what?
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.640]   You know what?
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.640]   Okay.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.240]   Here, if you heard this confession from me, you don't like Mad Men?
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.160]   I cannot get past episode one.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.480]   I've tried four times.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.480]   Can't do it.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.280]   Episode one is just cliche, written over.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:57.560]   But you're going to really hate this season because it is everything you hate about Mad
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.560]   Men.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.200]   Oh, and then I tried the other day.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.520]   I think if we're talking last time, I tried and I went into episode two and I made like
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.240]   five minutes and I said, I can't do this.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.880]   I don't know why we love it, but we do.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.240]   This season's a little with the new seasons.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.240]   Rooting dawn.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.240]   I'm a little, a little, a little bit enough of that.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.240]   Okay.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:25.240]   There's the TV portion of this show.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.240]   I didn't mean to.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   I didn't mean to.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   I didn't mean to.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.240]   What do you mean you?
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.600]   I take full responsibility.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   We went there, man.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.600]   We did.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.640]   Actually, I was going to, I was going to segue into HBO now.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.360]   This was the launch of the over the top version of HBO.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.840]   You could, without a subscription to a cable company, pay $15, get HBO now on Apple TV,
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:52.400]   iPad or iPhone and watch Game of Thrones and VEEP and all of that.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.400]   I don't know.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.400]   Android?
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.000]   No, no Android yet.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.760]   They have an exclusive with Apple and I think it's just for the first few months.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.040]   But so far, no, it's, it's iOS only.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.040]   Snobs.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.680]   Well, I'm sure Apple.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.880]   It's in app purchases through the app store.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:15.560]   So Apple gets a little, it was a weird subscription experience, I thought.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.560]   Did you do it?
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.280]   Yeah, I thought about subscriptions a lot.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.480]   Yeah, I signed up for HBO now.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.720]   I did it on my iPad and then I wound up.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.840]   So if you signed up on your iPad or your iPhone, then you could watch it on the web.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.480]   So I watched it on the web and casted it to my TV.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.480]   Oh, nice.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.120]   Like casted the tab.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.240]   And given even all of that, it was very performant.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.400]   And this was Sunday night when Game of Thrones got released.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.800]   Well, that was the question mark was because remember last year, I was going to say,
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:44.440]   HBO Go had horrible problems.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:50.200]   Sling TV, similar problems during March Madness, the NCAA basketball tournament last month.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:56.880]   So HBO had gone to MLB TV, the Major League Baseball Network, to supply the feed this time.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.120]   Yeah, it's something got hired and hired.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.760]   Oh, yeah, they had spent millions on their own thing in Seattle and they fired the guy.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.600]   Yeah, they did a good job because it worked.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.160]   But the subscription process was a little weird.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:15.720]   So you download the app on the iPad and then you would opt into this free trial, which then
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.000]   just starts charging automatically after 30 days, which I kind of hate.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.040]   I know because you always forget.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.240]   So but then you so you would do that.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.680]   So now iTunes has all my information and I've opted into this free trial, 30 day free
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:32.000]   trial, which I got to tell you, very generous, 30 days of unlimited HBO on the web.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.200]   That's great.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.680]   But then I had to create an account, which I was like, why am I creating an HBO now account
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.280]   when the app store has me information?
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.800]   I know that the app store, Sandbox is that still felt like a weird experience.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.200]   And I also just wish that it had been on my, you know, I wish that I didn't have to go
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.120]   through my iPad, which I barely touched and it was kind of slow.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:55.680]   But you know, there's still that iOS first thing happening.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.960]   So it was a good experience, except I didn't like the opt out.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.120]   You could go in and then and then edit your subscription and say, don't auto renew this,
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.360]   but you had to opt out of that.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.040]   But for the most part, it was pretty great.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.400]   They learned that from porn.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.560]   Yeah, that's exciting.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.960]   They learned that from porn.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.080]   But haven't we learned from porn after all?
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.080]   Exactly.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.080]   Exactly.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:22.360]   By the way, Jeff, you auto renew was something that sorry, we need to auto renew your lighting
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.360]   system.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.360]   Oh, tell me about it.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.800]   They don't have auto renew for Jeff's rights.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.360]   Either that or they just think you're dead.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:34.560]   I tell you about the lines.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.800]   Yeah, auto renew is the bane of my existence in many cases.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.000]   But by the way, Jeff, the name of that book was difficult.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Men Brett Martin, did you know him?
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   No.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.240]   He's a TV reporter for, I think he was a New York magazine, a bunch of other places.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:54.640]   But the premise of this is there was a creative revolution in television that started with
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:59.000]   the Sopranos, the wire and up to more recently.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   He talks.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.440]   I think the point is right, but you can actually also go back in my era.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.480]   It was Hill Street Blues and Cosby.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.920]   I think you're right.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:07.920]   I think you're right.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.920]   I think that's where it begins.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.960]   In fact, he talks about Hill Street Blues in it.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:12.960]   Okay.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:18.680]   It's not popular to say anything about Cosby these days, but I think he had a big impact
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.600]   on TV and it's talking.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.320]   David Chase, David Simon, David Milch, Alan Ball.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.560]   He talks about Breaking Bad, Vince Gilligan.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   It's really good.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.560]   Difficult men is the name of the book.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.560]   I highly recommend it.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.560]   Let's take a break.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.800]   There is, and I know Jeff will have something to say about this.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.400]   I'm going to take my blood pressure pills.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.960]   Take your pills, Jeff.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:42.200]   There's something going on in Europe and Jeff is not going to be happy about it.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.480]   But first a word from zipprecruiter.com.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:50.360]   If you're in the unenviable position of having to hire for your company, whether you're
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:56.040]   the HR person or maybe it's a tiny company and it's just you and you need to hire an
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.040]   assistant.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.520]   This is a lifesaver.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.440]   You got to know about zipprecruiter.com.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:06.120]   It lets you post to, this is new, we say 50 plus job boards.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.960]   I just went to the site and asked us 100 plus job boards.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.800]   With one submission, couldn't be easier.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.400]   You also get social networks like Facebook and Twitter.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.240]   I know though some of you are saying, "Well, I don't want to post 100 job boards.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.640]   I'm going to get so many applicants."
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.240]   Well, you want that many applicants.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.160]   The reason you don't want them is because you got all those emails and phone calls, but
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.200]   zipprecruiter eliminates that.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.120]   They provide you with an interface.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:35.200]   All the calls, all the emails go to their interface making it very easy for you to screen
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:39.040]   candidates, pick the right candidate, very straightforward.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.480]   In fact, so much so we've arranged a four day trial.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.040]   That will be enough to hire your first person probably.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:52.800]   zipprecruiter.com/twig post to all the top job sites, all the social networks, single
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.840]   click of the mouse, find candidates in any industry nationwide.

[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.920]   boost which will give you as many as three times more candidates.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.920]   You don't care.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.480]   You don't mind because you've got a great way to handle them.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.200]   The more candidates means, the more likely you're going to find the right person.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.480]   As long as there's a way to handle it and zipprecruiter gives us to you, we love this,
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.480]   by the way.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.480]   We love it.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.280]   zipprecruiter.com/twig.

[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.080]   We thank, not only thank them for their support, but thank them for making a really great service.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:39.680]   It solves a very big problem for people who have to do hiring.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.680]   All righty.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.320]   So, of course, it's so really interesting.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:49.120]   I love hosting shows on Twit because every host has a different take.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:56.920]   All Thorot was thrilled that the European Union was finally, finally going after Google.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:01.680]   And you and I have had this discussion a couple of weeks ago because of the FTC documents
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.080]   that were leaked out to the Wall Street Journal by accident.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:09.760]   Apparently, the EU is reading the Wall Street Journal and it has now announced an investigation
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.160]   of Google on two different fronts.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:19.440]   One, in the shopping realm favoring their sites over competing sites and search results.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:29.880]   And two, the deals they make with Android phones, AOSP versus true Google experience.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:37.120]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:43.120]   It's kind of what I was saying though, Jeff, that they need to be above suspicion, right?
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.560]   Okay, so you're lying yourself with the EU.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.560]   Good Leo.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.560]   Good.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.560]   That's the place you want to be.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.560]   I'm just trying to get you really ripped.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.560]   I know you are.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.520]   I was getting by myself ready.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.560]   Leo was going to do the devil's advocate here today.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.040]   All right, a couple of things.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:02.800]   Number one, I'm shocked at how little they have on them, right?
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:08.040]   So, so BFD, Google points to its own shopping advertisers.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.040]   Right?
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.080]   And we've had this discussion last week and we've had it before that of course, we've
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.160]   had it before, of course, the media property promotes its advertisers.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.960]   No big deal there, but that's all they come up with.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:24.480]   And the actual formal complaint is that and that's the possibility of a $6 billion fine,
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.200]   $6 billion because of the points to a shopping advertisers.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:34.560]   Now, I got calls today from BBC and ORF in Austria and others.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.360]   And so they said, what's Google going to do?
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:40.760]   And I said, well, you know, at one level, if Google just kills comparison shopping in
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.240]   Europe, it'll be a blip on the PML.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.320]   They don't make that much money from that.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.320]   It's nothing.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.880]   So kill it, you know, screw it.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.880]   Okay, Europe.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.880]   And what good did that do?
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.880]   Consumers in Europe, not a there's no consumer.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:57.840]   There's absolutely no consumer damage that can be found here.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:03.480]   And then the follow up on the FTC story, by the way, that is Google's response exactly
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.400]   on the official blog.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.600]   They they title it the search for harm.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.240]   And they point out that these companies are doing great.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:17.640]   Well, the FTC, you know, let's follow up to that story was that it was not a political
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:22.920]   thing was both parties was an unanimous vote against going after Google because they found
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.440]   no consumer harm.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:29.800]   So that's this entire $6 billion fine because they promote their shopping advertisers.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.880]   Now again, the European, this is all European publishers because they had agreements with
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:39.720]   the EU a couple of times and and the political pressure stayed on from publishers to keep
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.760]   going after Google and also from Microsoft, you know, you have no shame.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:49.560]   You have no is it is it pure shot in Freuda Microsoft really, really you went through
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.160]   this you paid more than $3 billion and just for the sheer joy of seeing someone else
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.000]   screwed the way you were screwed.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.520]   You join in on this.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:01.720]   Um, so, you know, that's that's the one is the shopping thing.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.720]   And that's it.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.720]   It's kind of ridiculous.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.920]   They've announced they're going to investigate Android, but they're too.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.960]   I just find this amazing.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.240]   You know, Apple doesn't give away.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.240]   It's OS.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.240]   It doesn't do anything.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.920]   Yeah, that was my response to Paul.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:19.160]   It's as if you're penalizing Google for offering a free version of Android.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.760]   Yeah, maybe it's it's limited, but they're get, but Apple doesn't do that exactly right
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.800]   and you're and you're perfectly free to put business conditions on that.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:32.360]   And any company can say that with you, I'm going to use Symbian, you know, it's it's
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.800]   free and is it is it undue market power?
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:40.280]   Well, no, because Apple is still gets the lion's share of the attention.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:45.480]   Um, it's it's a this is a purely political act.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.280]   It's not a consumer protection act.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.840]   It's not an antitrust act.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:53.280]   It is an anti American act.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   Wow.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.280]   I don't know.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.240]   I don't know exactly where I stand on this.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.680]   I've heard both arguments, Paul's very strongly in the other camp.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.800]   I think I tend more to your side, Jeff.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.120]   I think mostly because it's hard to show how Google has harmed anybody.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:19.800]   Now the the Android investigation is as much to see if Google has reduced competition
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:23.600]   in handsets and mobile phones.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.120]   And but that's but if they've done it, they've done it by being successful.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.200]   It might be a successful and be free.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:35.480]   I mean, could you accuse them of dumping an OS and open, say an open source world?
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.040]   That kind of logic doesn't work anymore.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.840]   Yeah, I don't think so.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:45.120]   And you issue with Google's requirements over, you know, the fact that Android hand
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:51.760]   sets with the Google logo or that run Google's proprietary software, like half to meet particular
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:56.400]   if you want the play if you want the play store, which of course you do, you have to
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.760]   take everything else along with it.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.760]   Search, email, calendar, Chrome.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.680]   Yeah, that's a control.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.520]   That's that's a perfectly legitimate business room business demand.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.760]   A, you know, we're giving you the free website.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.160]   The condition is you take this off.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.160]   It's going to benefit us.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.160]   Don't don't want it.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.160]   Don't do it.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.160]   No problem.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.240]   B, you can go off and use one on your own.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.680]   You just won't get the play store and our stuff.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.600]   And and by the way, many have Amazon has done that.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.600]   Microsoft has done that.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:31.440]   Frankly, there's a there's a Microsoft X phone that is based on AOSP, the Google-less version
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.240]   of Android.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:38.720]   And I see that's that's what baffles me a little bit is that, look, Apple is totally
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.720]   proprietary.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.200]   It doesn't give away a free version.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.200]   They're okay.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:48.000]   But Google giving away a free version somehow is made that worse, made that bad?
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.040]   You don't think that's the message you want to send to people?
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.400]   Well, and once again, I'm going to argue this is what I call Eurotechno panic.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.680]   And Europe should be where the message that it has sent to the world.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.000]   I agree a little bit more on the danger danger.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.600]   I agree a little bit more on the on the first part.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:11.240]   This the I do worry and we've talked about this and I'm not going to belabor it, but
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:16.640]   I do worry Google has and Google, by the way, is more of a monopoly in the EU than it is
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.760]   here in the States.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.880]   But but there's nothing illegal about being a monopoly.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.160]   It's illegal is using monopoly power unfairly.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:32.160]   And I think if you're asked somebody and they would and say, do you think Google favors
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:36.000]   its own sites over competitor's sites in its search results?
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.560]   Most people would say, well, of course they do.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.560]   That's just good business.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.120]   In fact, they do it a lot less.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:46.960]   As we said on the show a few weeks ago, but yeah, the the the origin of of search based
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.880]   advertising was to buy position.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.520]   Right.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.800]   And I did in fact do that search that you recommended a videos on Bing versus videos on
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:00.160]   Google and Google doesn't even show up if you search for videos on Bing.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.000]   It's all Microsoft stuff.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.920]   So everybody does that.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.120]   I would I would argue that Google should be held to a higher standard.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.120]   We've had that argument.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.720]   I I wish Google was thinking about these related businesses.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.320]   And part of the argument is you know, you've argued to split up Google, you know, that
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.320]   it should be safe for they shouldn't do certain things.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:20.040]   But but as I was I was preparing for your counterintuitive argument.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.040]   Oh crap, you prepared for this?
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.040]   Oh shoot.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.680]   You know, we that's it.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.680]   We're screwed.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.200]   This goes this goes to the European privacy issues too.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.200]   Right.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.800]   So if you split up by one means or other by not allowing data to go across or by splitting
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   up the company or whatever, if you split up Google in some form or another, search will
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.440]   simply not be as good if it doesn't have Android.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.480]   Android will simply not be as good if it doesn't have search data.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.480]   Yes.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.600]   And on and on and on and on, whatever you use from Google, the more you use it, the better
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.600]   it's going to be for you.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.240]   And it's a new business reality.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.320]   The big data aspect of it is very valuable to me.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.120]   I use Google now and the more it knows about what I do, the better.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:00.440]   So I wish that were true for me, but that's another.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.840]   You don't actually get the benefit of it.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:08.960]   But I let me but speaking purely from my own perspective, and this is going to really
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:14.040]   come up because Google is changing the partnership agreements on YouTube, which may chase us
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:17.000]   from YouTube.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.080]   And if that, but so let's say they do because right now we are all our shows are available
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.560]   on YouTube.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:30.400]   But if you searched for this week in Google on Google and Google favorited the YouTube
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:37.880]   version versus some other version because it's YouTube and because they make money
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:42.960]   on it, that would, that could be a real detriment to my business.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.320]   What proportion of your, well, it's not.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.320]   It's not much.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.320]   It's not a big deal.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.880]   But let's put it this way.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:55.600]   The way Google wants to do it is we'll take care of all the advertising.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.240]   You don't have to think about that.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.040]   They don't like it that we sell our own advertising.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:03.680]   That's why we're going to be in from Google eventually, our YouTube eventually.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.640]   But they take 45%.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:11.800]   So I'm not interested, particularly in Google's participation in my advertising.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   I don't.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.800]   So here's a secret.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:19.480]   There is something worth watching from an anti-trust perspective is not about consumer
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.320]   services at all.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.760]   It's about Google's power and advertising.
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.440]   That's where Google is a monopoly.
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.440]   And we've had this discussion.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:34.680]   But the search results are all I care about and Google can put me out of business by making
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:39.800]   its search results favor Google properties or at least to stay in business forcing me
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.680]   to sell, you use Google's ad sales instead of my own.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:51.960]   And I feel like that's using its near monopoly in search to enter a new market.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.960]   They're in the YouTube business all of a sudden.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:58.160]   But you're right, it is advertising is the business and that's not a new market for them.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.040]   And they use in their market power sometimes, the other funny thing about it is Google
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.160]   Fiber has pushed competitors to offer better service.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:11.080]   And now the Google MbNO, the more we're starting to learn about it through leaks and such,
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:14.400]   the phone service is going to push the phone industry.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.960]   It's a weird thing.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:24.240]   I don't know what the analog is for your example of before there's a YouTube, there's
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.720]   no open platform you could have been on for your sake.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:31.880]   We don't need YouTube.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:38.560]   But if Google by changing its search results forces us to use Google, use YouTube, it
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.760]   will cost us a significant amount of revenue.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   Now I got it.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.760]   Okay, now I got it.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:43.760]   Okay.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:45.600]   We don't want, but I'm willing to put stuff on.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.080]   So here's the email I got updated YouTube partner terms.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.000]   Your fans want choices.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.200]   Hmm, that's a bad start.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.400]   Not only do they want to watch what they want whenever they want it anywhere on any
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.840]   device they choose, which by the way is a direct ripoff from a speech I gave 10 years
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.840]   ago.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:08.560]   They want YouTube features built specifically with their needs in mind over the past several
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:12.880]   months we've taken bold new steps to bring these experiences to life.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.760]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:18.880]   By to build on this momentum, taking another big step in favor of choice, offering fans
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:25.000]   an ad free version of YouTube for a monthly fee by creating a new paid offering will generate
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.160]   new sources of revenue that will supplement your fast growing advertising revenue.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:34.360]   By the way, from their point of view, that fast growing advertising revenue is from them
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.280]   and them alone.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.400]   Having a new paid offering will require us to update your terms through your creative
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:44.200]   studio dashboard, a process that should feel familiar.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:48.000]   If you look at it closely, what they say is if you, it's the same thing that they offered
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.360]   that musician we were talking about.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:55.960]   If you do not want to participate in this, no problem will make all your videos private.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:00.160]   Oh, well.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.200]   Hmm.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:08.880]   Oh, so I say have Adam, a European Union.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.200]   And if you want anybody to testify, I'll be glad to.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:17.280]   Well, this goes back to our discussions, Gina, about about Twitter and developers over the
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:22.280]   years to when you become and what they did by cutting off the fire hose people.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:27.120]   When you become dependent on the platform, we've had a discussion before, but there needs
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.400]   to be some major discussion about what about definitions of what's ethical behavior.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:37.920]   In fact, this doesn't really bother me because they aren't an important, I never did build
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:38.920]   on a YouTube platform.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.280]   I've always been against building on somebody else's platform, always.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.880]   So we now aren't so at risk because of that, but I think there are a lot of people might
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:46.880]   be.
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.960]   I mean, it seems like to me, Leo, it seems like YouTube, the best use of YouTube for
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   you.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.200]   And of course, this would require a lot more sort of editing and that kind of thing, but
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:48:00.400]   like Mimi 30 seconds, 30, 60 second mashups of, yeah, ads, ads for Twitch shows, you know,
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.520]   that people want to share, you know, best highlights.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.520]   And we do that.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.840]   And that's if in the worst case scenario, if this all happens, I don't know if it will,
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:11.440]   but if this all happens and they kick us off YouTube because we have our own ads, no problem
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:15.320]   because that's exactly what we do is add free versions of short versions of our show.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:18.480]   So that's we do it right now, YouTube.com/twit.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.480]   We do it right now.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.240]   You need to do it for Facebook too, because that's because shorter things.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.800]   And Gina is kind of brilliant because they don't want you to have your own ads.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.800]   So you just become an ad instead.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   Right.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:35.600]   But yeah, no, look, it's always, always a risk when you become dependent on a platform.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.000]   Listen, we just went through this with ThinkUp.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.880]   We built ThinkUp's billing system using Amazon payments and Amazon deprecated a sunset of
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.720]   the product and they didn't offer any sort of, well, they haven't yet.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.360]   I actually think they're changing their mind, but they didn't offer a way to take existing
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.640]   subscribers and move them into their new system.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.560]   And it's going to be a big hit to us.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:00.520]   I mean, it's subscribing, like customers who pay us through Amazon are going to have to
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.920]   come back and retay.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:02.920]   Wow.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.920]   And, you know, it's tremendous.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.840]   And actually I'm working with them now.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:10.120]   They are maybe going to create some sort of transition tool because so many people were
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.400]   so upset.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.240]   But it's one of those things, you know, as particularly as a small startup or any kind
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:20.680]   of startup, like you're going to depend on APIs and services and hope that they're going
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.440]   to do the right thing.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:27.840]   And you hope that these huge platforms like Amazon and YouTube and Twitter and Facebook
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.400]   are going to do the right thing.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.000]   We're going through a similar thing with Facebook.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   Facebook, the Graph API 2.0 is way more limited than it used to be.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.720]   And so we have to think up has to kind of pull back the data that we pull, which limits
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.600]   and the kind of insights that we can create.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.280]   But it's kind of like life in the big city.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.960]   I mean, I think it's really important for all of us as consumers as APIs and as consumers
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:53.360]   in general to ask these companies to do the right thing and Leo, you have a right to complain
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:58.600]   although I definitely would just keep doing the Twitter's or Twitter's the way that you're
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.600]   doing.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:03.480]   I mean, you were smart to not become dependent on your distribution channel.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.880]   Yes, I specifically did that.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:06.880]   But it's very tempting because it's free, right?
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.440]   So people would say, oh, this is great.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.440]   You could get.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.680]   And there are a lot of people built their business on YouTube.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:16.720]   Now when you do that, all along you knew you were going to only get 65% of the ad revenue.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:21.920]   Yeah, there's other examples of using, you know, I think we saw eBay got people addicted
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:22.920]   to them as a service.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:28.400]   And then when they own the market, they increased the rates opening up the door by the way for
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.400]   Amazon to come in the business.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.400]   It does.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.400]   It does market.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:35.480]   Part of the problem is there's no competition for YouTube at this moment.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.920]   But my larger issue wasn't with this.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:46.360]   What was this, this is my example of how a monopoly in search could promote a subsidiary
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.360]   business.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:54.800]   In this case, Google's search favoring YouTube results would harm me because I either have
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:00.600]   to exceed to Google's demands for 45% of my revenue or not be on YouTube.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:04.720]   And if YouTube is what shows up when you search for this week in Google, that may not be,
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.720]   I may not have a real choice.
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:13.080]   So that's where they can use the leverage of search to enter a new market streaming videos.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.080]   But it is all ad sales.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.080]   So I don't know if it's a new market.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:19.920]   I don't know, you know, I'm just, by the way, this process with the EU is much faster
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.080]   than it is in the United States.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:26.120]   Google has, I think, 10 weeks to respond.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.200]   And Google has immediately responded on their blog.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.160]   So here's the question I got asked today.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.160]   If you were Google, what do you do?
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.120]   Because they were saying, do you negotiate?
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.240]   Do you go to court?
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.240]   What do you do?
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:40.240]   Yeah, because I don't know if there's an appeals process in that.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.840]   I don't know what the process is, but I don't know if you go to court.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.680]   If you don't agree, then they'll soon go.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.680]   Then you can go to court.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:46.680]   Then you go to court.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.000]   Oh, whippy European court that's done the right to be forgotten position.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Right.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   Right.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.720]   It seems like this is the core of Google's business.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:58.080]   They've got to stand up as hard as they possibly can for what they're doing and fight it out.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:09.240]   So the memo that went out internally, of course, recode got, Googlers, as this I presume comes
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:10.880]   from Larry, but let me, I don't know.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.600]   I have to go to the very bottom.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.160]   It doesn't say.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:18.800]   As the financial times just reported, the European Commission will tomorrow issue a statement
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.720]   of objections, blah, blah, blah.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.080]   They say it's very disappointing.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:29.360]   We have a very strong case with especially good arguments, especially when it comes to
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:32.400]   better services for users in increased competition.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:38.520]   So they've laid out in this internal memo their defense and some of the same graphs
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:43.040]   that they showed today in the blogs.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:47.240]   I think this is to tell the employees, no, no, we're going to fight this.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.680]   And we think we have a good defense.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:55.640]   This is just the start of a process does not mean the EC will necessarily take action.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:53:00.720]   For example, they opened and closed an inquiry into iTunes a few years ago.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.880]   We have a very strong case on Android as well.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:06.600]   Finally, we know the upcoming announcements will be distracting, but you can help in two
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:07.600]   ways.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:12.320]   First, by not commenting on pending legal issues internally or externally in second, by focusing
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:17.480]   on what you do best building great products.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:23.200]   Meanwhile, today, I think the stuff that gets leaked up by the MVNO, the new phone service,
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.920]   is Google saying, "New business, too?
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:25.920]   Let's keep going."
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.920]   Yeah, good.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:29.920]   Because there might be some temptation to say, "Oh, let's not watch new businesses at
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:31.840]   this point.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:32.840]   Keep going."
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:40.160]   Again, I've said this before, I think Google did blow it to a rather considerable extent
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:46.120]   by not understanding the political clout of the especially German publishers.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.800]   They're late to the party now because those guys are saying, "Okay, now your position
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:50.800]   is the weakest.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.240]   What are you going to do to make us happy?"
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.560]   They could have had a better relationship with them earlier of mutual interest.
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:01.880]   It was possible that publishers were all FOS about their life-sto-gus-shoots-hract and
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.760]   all that stuff, but it was a game.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.560]   The game went way too far and they didn't understand the political clout.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:13.840]   They didn't understand pain, heed to politicians and the EU because they were all going after
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:14.840]   Google.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:17.000]   They were five years.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:23.800]   There is the Silicon Valley/American hubris here which is going to have some measure of
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.440]   business impact on them.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.600]   Of course, not just the German publishers, but the Wall Street Journal, which really
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:29.600]   kind of...
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.600]   Well, Bardock.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.040]   Sturd the pot there, full of it.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:34.040]   That's...
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.040]   That's...
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.040]   Mardock has an obvious...
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.040]   Well, you've been...
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.040]   But look at this.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:43.040]   So here's an article in the Wall Street Journal, "Five Ways Europe is gunning for Google.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:48.640]   "Feeling left behind by the digital revolution and scared its manufacturing and automotive
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:54.240]   industries could be next in line to fall to Silicon Valley is legislating on all fronts
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.480]   to create what it calls a level playing field for all digital companies."
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.640]   Google is the main target of this legislation.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.320]   This is like...
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:07.240]   Is Rupert having it both ways?
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.760]   I didn't go after Google.
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.360]   And by the way, I believe in America.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:16.360]   It's pretty funny.
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.760]   I think there's a story to be done here, but I think we'll get done.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:24.160]   Amir Mizrock wrote this antitrust tax.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.160]   That's right.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.160]   That's another front Google's fighting on.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.260]   The right to be forgotten.
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:28.760]   We know about that.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:35.960]   Copyright, that goes back to the Spanish attempt to get Google News to stop snippening and
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:39.560]   data protection, the privacy stuff.
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.160]   Meanwhile, Google stock is marginally up.
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.160]   Oh, really?
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:50.960]   That's why the market is saying this is Europe blowing smoke up America's rear.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:51.960]   Wow.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.760]   That sounds painful.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.960]   Allow me to get some tweets for that.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:56.960]   Yeah, what got already?
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:58.960]   Sounds like Leo's toilet.
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:03.360]   Where is the blowing smoke button?
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.360]   I need that button.
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.160]   Yeah, we need the blowing smoke button.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:09.360]   I wish more people would blow smoke up by...
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:14.560]   I just thought of a new feature.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:20.160]   Now, by the way, let's try to find the etymology of that.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.160]   What is blowing smoke up your rear?
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.360]   I don't think come from.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.360]   I'm Googling.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:27.360]   Google now.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:36.080]   I think it's a conflation of two different sayings because blowing smoke was like blowing
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.920]   smoke rings.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:45.400]   And then wasn't there a saying like blowing up your skirt?
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:49.120]   According to Gizmodo, it used to be literal.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.640]   It used to be literal.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.680]   I didn't know if I could.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.680]   No, this is...
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.680]   This is...
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:55.680]   This is not...
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:56.680]   No.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:01.600]   They actually did do it, but I don't think that's where the saying comes from is what
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.760]   I'm saying.
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:09.960]   It just shows they've been doing high colonics since before the beginning of time.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:14.480]   Google does is not reluctant to enforce its power in interesting ways.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:20.720]   We talk on security now all the time about how Google's telling websites, "You got to
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.720]   use SSL.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:26.320]   You got to stop using SHA1."
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:31.640]   And now with Chrome, the latest edition of Chrome, Chrome 42, which came out, I think
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.960]   today, I just got it.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:40.360]   You're turning off NPAPI, or NNPAPNPAPY.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.240]   How do you say that, Gina?
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.240]   NPAPY?
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.240]   Hey!
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:46.240]   I say NPAPY.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.240]   NPAPY.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:50.560]   Which really should have been deprecated a long time ago.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:53.480]   It comes from Netscape mid 90s.
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:57.960]   It stands for the Netscape plugin API.
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:02.160]   And that's how Flash worked and still relied.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:05.320]   Java.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:11.800]   If you're on a site that uses NPAPY to turn on Java in your browser, it won't work.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.840]   Now, IE dropped it in version 5.5.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:19.960]   So I have a feeling there are many sites that still do this.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:26.240]   If you're using Safari or Firefox, you can still use the NPAPY extensions.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.080]   But this is an example.
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:31.880]   Google using its weight.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:32.880]   I think for good.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.320]   Yeah, for our benefit.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:40.960]   There's been incredible leadership, I think, with Chrome.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.200]   Just making the web better.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.400]   Well, and then the Farhead module.
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:46.400]   Sorry, Gina.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:47.400]   No, go ahead.
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:53.880]   Farhead module in the Times after Google had a -- after the EU thing did look back as
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:58.280]   everyone was going to with a Microsoft decision and said, "How absurd now to think that not
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:01.080]   including a browser was the right thing to do?"
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:03.800]   Of course, you're going to include a browser.
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:04.800]   What's wrong with that?
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.480]   That's what Microsoft got trouble for.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:09.560]   I know, but that's what I'm saying is that's the perspective of the time.
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:13.880]   And he's saying, "Now look at the basis of the Microsoft decision and how absurd its
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.480]   assumption was."
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:21.880]   That's also the issue with how slow in the US anyway, these things move.
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:22.880]   Yes.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:29.240]   And tech moves so fast that -- Yeah, so basically he said that Google was going to outgrow
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:34.480]   this issue quickly and that the next -- and the web advertising is probably topping out.
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:36.640]   I think that's some fair statement.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:39.800]   And the next -- this goes back to your YouTube discussion.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:45.720]   The next wave of advertising disruption is going to be broadcast advertising coming
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:46.720]   to the web.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.880]   And guess who's in a great position to get that?
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:50.880]   Google.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.880]   Google.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:55.000]   Hey, are you in the mood, Gina?
[00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.440]   Do you ever -- when you're sitting there with your hot hero sandwich in hand, do you ever
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:05.840]   say, "Gosh, I wish I had a Google change log to do?"
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.800]   The Google change log.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:11.520]   The trumpets can be raised at any moment.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.200]   They are at the ready all the time.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.200]   Oh, it's ready.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.200]   Even when Gina's not here.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:20.280]   Just in case Gina flies in suddenly and says it's time for the change log.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.880]   Before you do the change log, we want to do an ad.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.880]   But would you be willing?
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:24.880]   Absolutely.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:25.880]   Let's change it up.
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:26.880]   Cool.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.880]   We'll get the trumpets again.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.880]   Oh, no.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.880]   You can't ever have too many change log.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.480]   That was a great transition there.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.760]   I should have warned you I was going to go to an ad.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.760]   I hear the words, Leo.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.760]   I've got an issue trigger figure.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.200]   I'm like, "Yes, let's go.
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.200]   Let's do this."
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.200]   Waste no time.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.840]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.960]   If you're a freelancer or small business, you know the worst part of the month is the
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.080]   last day of the month when you send out those invoices.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.000]   Well, for me, it was the last day.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.400]   Probably you're more organized, right?
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.960]   You send them five days before the end or ten days before the end.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.480]   I would wait till the end of the month going, "Well, I can send them out in the 30th, right?
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.480]   The 31st."
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.760]   Then I'd wait a little longer and say, "Well, I missed this month.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.520]   I'll send them at the 30th and this next month."
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.520]   Then I'd wait another month.
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.800]   By then I had five invoices and it was just not nice.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:21.800]   Back in the old days when I was doing my own thing, a freelancer, it was Amber MacArthur
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.360]   who saved my life.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.560]   I was complaining about this tour because I would go up to a candidate once a month
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.520]   for a week and do shows up there and I had to invoice Rogers.
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.880]   She said, "You need FreshBooks.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.600]   Nice Toronto boys.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.400]   Created a nice little company.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.400]   Cloud accounting.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.400]   Here we are.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.400]   10 years later.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.280]   5 million customers use FreshBooks.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.480]   Everybody knows about FreshBooks.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.480]   It's the super simple cloud accounting software.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:52.280]   It helps over 5 million people save time billing and get paid faster.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:58.000]   You'll create and send super slick personalized invoices in less than a minute.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.120]   It was such a revelation.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.560]   It makes it easy to capture and manage your expenses too with their FreshBooks apps.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:09.400]   You just use the camera on your phone to take pictures, to manage the receipts and the app
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.440]   also does time and hours.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.640]   You can keep track of all your billable hours while you're on the go.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.960]   Anywhere, press the button.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.240]   When you start, press the button when you stop.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.880]   It automatically goes right into the invoice.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.880]   It's so great.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:27.120]   They do multi-currency, which was a huge burden for me before I started using FreshBooks
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.200]   at a bill in Canadian dollars.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.720]   They do it all.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:36.280]   If you ever need help, and I never did, I have to say this, I loved it and I never,
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.440]   ever had a call for help.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.200]   If you do, the FreshBooks supports rock stars.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.560]   They're famous for their knowledge and a real person is there in the FreshBooks office.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:49.760]   There they are, ready to help you, to amaze you with their helpfulness.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:53.040]   I said the boys at FreshBooks, it's really the boys and girls at FreshBooks.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:58.560]   The folks at FreshBooks, really great team, very nice people.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.120]   Getting started is so easy and it's free for 30 days.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.120]   No obligation.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:08.040]   Just go to freshbooks.com/twig.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.320]   It's tax day today.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.400]   I bet you're wishing you'd been using FreshBooks the last 12 months.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.120]   I bet you anything.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.640]   Next April 15th, you'll feel much better.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:21.080]   FreshBooks.com/twig.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.080]   This is the time.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.520]   Don't put that off.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.760]   You know you want to change how you do it.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.480]   Today's the day.
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.920]   FreshBooks.com/twig.
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:31.920]   Just do me a favor.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.680]   There's a section where they say, "How did you hear about us?"
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.160]   Just write this week in Google or Twig.
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.320]   It'd be a great benefit to us.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.800]   Thank you.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.520]   Now ladies and gentlemen, the Google change log.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:49.200]   The Google change log.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.200]   Again.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.200]   Uncore, encore.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:58.840]   I'm a little rusty, so I may ask your help.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.840]   That's all right.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.560]   We're here for you, baby.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:08.440]   We were talking about Chrome 42 stable earlier, deprecating the NPAPI API.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:12.520]   Chrome 42 also got a really cool interesting new feature, which I'm very excited about,
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.520]   particularly for the app I work on.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:15.520]   Push notifications.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.720]   Web push notifications are now available to everyone.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.560]   This is in this stable version of Chrome 42.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:26.760]   What this means, if I understand it correctly, I'm still researching and trying this out.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:31.240]   Basically, your browser can send you push notifications, even if it's closed or the
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:34.120]   tab has closed, similar to your phone.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.640]   This is happening on Chrome on Android as well.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.080]   This is giving web apps the ability to send you push notification.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:49.280]   Of course, you get the ability to opt out and say, "This site should never send me notifications."
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.760]   This just went stable.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:54.680]   I actually was trying to find some examples of sites that are using this so far.
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:59.840]   I haven't found any except for developer demos, but I'm excited about this.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:05.480]   Chrome has had little pop-up notifications, but the key here is that apps can push to
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.160]   you even when the tab is closed.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.160]   Thank goodness.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:15.920]   Gina was here to explain that because I thought I was because I've been asked by websites,
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.120]   "Do you want notifications?"
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:20.480]   But I didn't know that that's the difference.
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.320]   Chrome has to be running.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.560]   I don't think that Chrome even has to be running.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.560]   I could be wrong.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:29.840]   I can chatroom, correct me if I'm wrong, but that's what makes these different than the
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.320]   little notifications that you're probably seeing on different apps.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.840]   It's pretty crazy.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.440]   It also has the potential to be super noisy.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:44.520]   I have a whole room in nation about everything is notifications now from the watch and the
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.520]   phone.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:50.640]   It seems like push notifications because email is a complete mess.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.560]   Users don't have home pages anymore.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:56.520]   This is how apps re-engage people by pushing and sometimes not so well, sometimes it's
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.520]   noisy.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.840]   Hopefully, these notifications haven't played with them too much, will be a little richer
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:06.640]   and will let you do things with them the way that the notification shade on Android
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.640]   lets you do things.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:11.160]   I don't think that they're at that level now, but it seems like that's the inevitable
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.160]   path that we're going down.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.720]   I'm excited about this.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.360]   I think this will be pretty cool.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.360]   Jeff, I'm sorry.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.360]   I think I stepped on you.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.200]   Did you have a question?
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.200]   No.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.200]   No.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.200]   No.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:26.240]   I'm trying to figure out, I have some notifications working on some sites.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:31.120]   I'm just trying to figure out which ones.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.840]   Does Hacker News do it?
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:33.840]   I get notifications.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.000]   Oh, that's from push bullet.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   I'm getting Hacker News.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.800]   Yeah, I've been using push bullet for a long time and I really like it.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:45.280]   A land statement in the chat room is saying it's using the GCM connection server, Google
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.280]   Cloud Messaging.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:51.400]   So that's, yeah, so even if Chrome is closed.
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.200]   So that's pretty new.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:58.360]   It's really interesting the strategy because I now have the Chrome app launcher in my dock
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:04.520]   on Mac, which means that all the extensions I add on my pixels show up as apps available
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.800]   on my Mac in the dock.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.800]   And it's a really interesting move into the desktop.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.800]   But I like it.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.800]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:19.600]   And this is huge for web developers who say only want to make an app for notifications.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.600]   You don't need to make an app.
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.880]   This will work through the web, which is huge.
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.040]   So you're going to do this with think.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.760]   News sites could use this.
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:29.760]   News sites, yeah, absolutely.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.840]   And news sites could do this, right?
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:34.840]   So ideally, so we think up when you get a new insight, you know, my sort of dream of the
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:37.720]   native app was like, hey, just let me know when I have a new website pushed to me when
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.800]   I get a new insight.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.760]   And now we can do that through the site.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.320]   Where all will it push to you?
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.400]   It'll push to you on your on your desktop.
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.440]   Will it also push to you?
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.640]   Anyway, we're signed into Chrome.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.480]   Yeah, this is working on Android as well.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.920]   So this is kind of a big deal.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:57.640]   So presumably we'll use the notification system native to the OS.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:02.640]   So on OS 10, for instance, still use the notifications there, right?
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.760]   Or is it going to give you its own unique style?
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.760]   I'm not sure.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.760]   I think it might actually be it might be a browser implemented.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:10.760]   No, no, no, no.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:13.640]   So I'm not sure if it's going to use the notification bar on the phone.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:14.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:19.600]   Possibly similar to how you get the Google Now card kind of overlay on the desktop.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.880]   So as you see the Google Now kind of notifications dropped out, maybe it'll be tight into something
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:24.880]   like that.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.880]   Might be similar to that.
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:26.880]   Look at my settings.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.480]   There must be a setting for notifications.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.680]   This is really new and I looked all around.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.200]   I was asking on Twitter, you know, where can I try where can I try this out?
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.680]   And there's a couple of Mozilla docs that are documenting the very new sort of web API,
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.680]   you know, that exists.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.440]   And I kind of saw, you know, I saw one that said, you know, hello world.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:46.040]   But I haven't actually seen this in action yet, but this is pretty new.
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.040]   I love that.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.040]   We are definitely looking into it.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.040]   I love that.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.040]   Where else do we have?
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.400]   Lance Seidman says use GCM.onMessage event.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.400]   Right.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.400]   So Google Cloud Messaging.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.400]   Right.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.840]   And you could just send a message to that and boom, you'd have a pop up.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.840]   Nice.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:03.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.840]   I mean, this is the dream.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:08.120]   This is the Google I/O conversation, you know, a couple of Google I/Os about ago about,
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:11.480]   you know, how all your all your devices are signed into your single account across all
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.080]   your devices and the devices are aware.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.600]   Have you dismissed a notification here?
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:18.120]   And so it gets dismissed across all your all your devices.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:22.720]   I mean, this is the, you know, the multi device world that we're living in.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:26.840]   And so hopefully all these notifications will be smart that way.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.480]   Google Cloud Messaging.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.760]   I'm looking in the in the settings.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:35.400]   It's in the content settings on your Chrome browser.
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:39.760]   I'm sorry, it's under privacy content settings.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.480]   And you have to scroll down a long ways and you'll get to notifications and you can block
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:48.840]   globally, allow all sites to know notifications, ask when a site wants to show notifications.
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.040]   That's the default.
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:54.320]   Do not allow any site to show notifications and then you can manage the exceptions.
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.720]   We see this again.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.560]   Yeah, this is what you were getting, Jeff.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.480]   In fact, that's what you were getting last week was an notification.
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.560]   Those gone are all spam notification.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.560]   They're gone.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:06.560]   Yeah, that worked.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.560]   People have people got mad at me on Twitter.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.960]   You took up an hour on your little problem.
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:11.960]   They all told me to.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:17.960]   No, first of all, that was a that was something we all needed to benefit from.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:23.560]   And it was a it was a kind of a not malicious, but aggressive.
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.560]   Yes.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.200]   Chrome extension, Netflix extension.
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.960]   It was called I can remember the name of it, but no, I think that's the one thing that
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:33.640]   I fear about this gene is that is that bad guys will use it.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.440]   You may sign up for something and not know how to get rid of it.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.520]   It keeps on bugging you.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.680]   I think actually on the notification panel itself on every single notification, there's
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:47.120]   a like adjust the settings or never show me this again.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.880]   I know that's how push bullet does it.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.600]   It'll say, you know, never show me this again or dismiss this across devices.
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.840]   So I think I think there's a pretty high level sort of front row level of control.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:01.200]   And the permissions prompt is similar to when a web page wants to use your location.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.640]   So before a site can send you notifications, it'll say, Hey, can this site send you notifications?
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.640]   So you actually opt in.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.360]   That's the default setting that Leo just showed us.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:15.040]   So you know, hopefully it'll be a good user experience user can control.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.680]   What else do you got?
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:20.760]   The Google handwriting input app is now in the play store.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:25.720]   Now Leo, you and I have sort of made fun of these handwriting things before.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:30.040]   We have we have and I get you, you know, I'm not going to be drawing on my screen very often,
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:35.400]   but I got to tell you, I downloaded this thing and I started writing and it was fun.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.640]   Like it was pretty good.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.040]   What I really like about this input.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.440]   So now this is, this is an alternate input.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.440]   It's not a keyboard.
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.440]   They're not calling it a keyboard.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.440]   They're calling it an input.
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:47.360]   So like voice input or an alternate keyboard, you can draw the letters on your screen and
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:51.080]   write that way and Google, you know, that that's how you can write text.
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.240]   It also works with emoji.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:59.200]   So you can draw emoji to enter emoji, which I got to tell you is kind of fun.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:05.720]   I spent a lot of time drawing a bunch of emoji just to see, you know, how they came up.
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:12.080]   So it's this, the handwriting input supports 82 languages and it's fun and it's fast.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:16.880]   It's just kind of an alternate keyboard to, you know, if you feel like if you've got a
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.360]   device with a stylus, for example, it installs as a keyboard.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.840]   Yeah, it's all as a keyboard.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.000]   You can switch the input, you know, just the way you switch to say swift key or some alternate
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.440]   keyboard, you can switch to this.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:34.440]   And yeah, you just tap that little and you scribble and it does cursive, it does handwriting,
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.440]   it does emoji.
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.440]   It's fun.
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:37.440]   Installing it right now.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.280]   Search for Google handwriting app.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.440]   Handwriting input.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.120]   So I got a new thing just came in.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.520]   Thank you to Alex Dennis in the chat room.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:54.240]   This is on the Google, the Google's Google plus page.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.240]   And I haven't had a chance to try this.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.960]   Maybe you can try this Leo.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.240]   You can now task your computer where your phone is.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.440]   So if you've lost your phone or it's stuck under the couch cushions, I guess you can
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.880]   say, find my phone.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:09.760]   I actually don't say what you need to say.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.960]   If you know where your computer is, you can now ask Google to find your Android phone
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.000]   from your desktop.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.480]   If the pesky phone is hiding nearby.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.480]   Say you type.
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.360]   Google can ring it for you.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.360]   Okay, fine.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:24.760]   So you're in Google and you type, find my phone in the Google search results.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.960]   And for your security sign in again to get your phone's location, I'm going to sign
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:30.960]   in.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:31.960]   Wow.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.760]   This is in the search results.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:35.760]   In the search results.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.240]   By the way, 1 billion, 840 million results.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.920]   I think that's all of them.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.880]   Oh, and you could choose the phone too.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:47.080]   So it's looking for my Nexus 6, but I want it to search Nexus 6 is in Petaluma.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.120]   Let me search for the phone I got with my hand right now.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.120]   Wow.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.120]   This is great.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.120]   So this is the Android device manager.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.800]   Do you have to, you must have to have that installed.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:59.320]   Apparently you have to have the latest Google search app installed.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.320]   Right.
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.320]   Oh.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.280]   And yeah, and it's got, this is got to be talking to device manager.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.000]   Oh, that's so cool.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:11.280]   So this says, and I'm getting a pop up notification that says Google Play Services, device location
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:15.600]   shared and raise device manager located this phone.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.600]   There it is.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:17.600]   Do you want to pound the back?
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:18.600]   What do you want?
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.600]   I'm so funny.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:24.040]   Let me let me search for the phone I got right now.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.040]   There it is.
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.040]   Wow.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.040]   That's pretty good.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.040]   Yeah, pretty fun.
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:29.040]   In a Google search.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.840]   Oh, Google knows where you are.
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:31.840]   Let me see.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.760]   I'm going to press the ring button because also on the search result is a button to ring
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.480]   it.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.160]   Your phone will ring it.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:41.120]   Five minutes.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:45.400]   How do I stop it?
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.600]   It says it's going to do this for five minutes.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.600]   You can't.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:49.600]   Just kidding.
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.600]   There's probably one.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.600]   There's got to be a little bit more.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.600]   You can't.
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.600]   There's probably one.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:56.600]   There's got to be a way.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:57.600]   I'm sure you.
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:02.600]   By the way, my new phone is such a pretty fun.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:05.040]   This is the Galaxy S.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.960]   You're still loving it?
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.920]   Yeah, the battery life is just horrific.
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:12.680]   But it's 10 hours.
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.200]   But I carry a quick charger with me in my pocket now.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.960]   I mean, what else are you going to do?
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.880]   You can't have an external battery, so you have an external battery.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:20.880]   But it's worth it.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.880]   I thought you were going to...
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:22.880]   Were you doing the watch?
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.480]   You were going iOS for the watch.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.800]   Yeah, but it's not out yet.
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:26.800]   Give me a break.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.800]   Wait, I thought...
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:28.800]   Give me a break.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.800]   Wait a minute.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.800]   Yeah, okay, sorry.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.360]   It's a few days from now.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.960]   For some reason I thought you would...
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.720]   I think on Instagram, I saw you getting set up to order.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.320]   Oh, I ordered the watch.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.320]   Okay.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.680]   Lisa's the Apple watch.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.680]   Because now we just call it The Watch.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.320]   But The Watch comes a week from Friday.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.320]   That's actually Lisa's, a 38 millimeter.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.880]   Mine will come a couple of weeks after that.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:55.920]   But Lisa's very generously said you can wear mine until yours comes.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.560]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.560]   Okay.
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.560]   So no iOS.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.560]   Good.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.560]   Well, not yet.
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.560]   Not yet.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.560]   Not yet.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.920]   Don't don't don't don't fence me in, man.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.880]   I love this phone.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:14.040]   The battery life is so horrible that I don't you know, but boy, I love this phone.
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.520]   The camera on the S6 is unbelievable.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:20.240]   And your fingers, they disabled touch on the on the edge there.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.240]   Like your fingers.
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:27.080]   You get a few extra little spurious flicks and flags, but mostly it's I don't think
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.200]   they're disabling.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.280]   They should do more to disable string.
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:35.200]   Is there any practical value to the curve?
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.160]   There's a very minor practical value.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.320]   You can activate it.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.120]   It can be a night, a night clock.
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:44.360]   And you if you do and I can never get this right.
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:45.360]   Don't forgive me.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.360]   If you do like this.
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:47.920]   Are you kidding me?
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:50.360]   This weird little swipe.
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.840]   Then you get some edge material.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.680]   That's the weather date and time.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.240]   It has notifications checking for news updates.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.600]   It'll do sports scores.
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.640]   That's completely oh, it's a ticker.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.360]   Looks like it's a Twitter ticker.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.320]   There's a stock results and stuff like that.
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:14.480]   I don't know what the value to that is, but and and because you can't you can't see it
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.280]   if it's faced down.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.520]   It's still upside down.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:19.880]   I thought I'd gotten that fixed, but maybe not.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:21.560]   It's still upside down.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:24.720]   It's just like Samsung is like there we go.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:25.720]   It's cool.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:26.720]   There you go.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:30.080]   But I still don't know why I'd want to do that.
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.240]   And then it does another thing.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:36.360]   You can have up to five people can have their own individual color.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:43.720]   And let me I don't know what this watery thing it does is so weird.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:48.520]   But you can have you can have up to five people have their own individual color and the phone
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:55.160]   the edge will glow in one of those colors if you get a texture of a phone call from them
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.080]   and it's faced down.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.080]   Which is like okay.
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.080]   Great.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.080]   Thank you.
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:06.160]   But there is no bezel to prevent your screen from scratching if it's faced down, right?
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:11.000]   Well, I kind of don't want to put my screen like why why encourage that?
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.240]   It's kind of begging to be scratched.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.240]   But the whole thing's glass.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.800]   So it's all begging to be scratched.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:19.240]   That's the whole thing is like anyway.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:24.520]   It's pretty cool looking, but it also I love the edge because it's just feels this is just
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.280]   it feels so nice.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:29.800]   This is the best looking best feeling smartphone I've ever used.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:30.800]   It's just gorgeous.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.960]   Oh, it's just really done a nice job.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.520]   Looks just like the iPhone.
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:40.960]   I'm just teasing you.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:43.680]   No, it is really gorgeous.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:44.680]   You hold it.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:45.680]   It feels like quality.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:46.680]   I just feel like wow.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.320]   It looks so dinky.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.320]   It is dinky.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.640]   It's only 5.1 inches.
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.800]   Who thought that ever thought that someday we'd say 5.1 inches was dinky?
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.800]   I know.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:56.800]   Only 5.1.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.120]   Only 5.1 inches.
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.440]   Only 577 dots per inch.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.440]   That's what's crazy.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:05.840]   I wish you could see this in person.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.320]   It's like what?
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:13.320]   It's okay.
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.520]   Let's continue with the change.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.520]   Okay.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.720]   Last thing in the change log.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:19.720]   Yes.
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:20.720]   Sorry.
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:21.720]   Divergence.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:22.720]   This is what I love about the show.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:23.720]   It's all about the versions.
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:24.720]   12.
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.720]   12.
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.720]   Step seed.
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:34.560]   Step seed is that that Google photo editing app that I think was powering a bunch of Google
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.960]   plus photos stuff there for a while.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:41.680]   Well, the mobile apps haven't gotten an update in two years, but they just got updated for
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.920]   both iOS and Android and pretty good.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.440]   I play with it for just a few months.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:47.440]   I love it.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.440]   Lots of new features.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:55.040]   Stacks let you go back into your edits and undo particular edits, much like kind of,
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.040]   I guess they're not comparable to layers.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.280]   But each edit that you do is its own thing and you can undo.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:03.360]   You can copy edits from one image to another.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.920]   Got a bunch of new filters, lens blur, tonal contrast, glamour.
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.120]   You can get a histogram.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.840]   I mean, this, this isn't nice.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:11.840]   Really nice.
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.840]   It's a very premium.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:13.840]   It's a bit funny.
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:16.000]   Image editor.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   What are they complaining about?
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.280]   They're complaining that the grunge filter has been taken off.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.280]   Aww.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.280]   Aww.
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.240]   That grunge filter.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.240]   So what's that?
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:27.240]   I just did the grunge filter.
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:30.160]   I don't know.
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.840]   The blend lens blur is really nice.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.040]   There's so many great things.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.360]   And then you can undo, redo.
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:39.480]   Once you select it, as you say, it becomes part of a stack of changes that you've made.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.760]   You can go back through.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.120]   This is photoshopping a can.
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.280]   I mean, this is amazing.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.280]   Yeah.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:48.400]   I mean, for these devices, there's a, there's a brush tool that you can apply effects to
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:55.600]   sections of an image, spot repair, for healing and retouching, certain pieces, transform,
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.600]   adjust perspective.
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:03.000]   It's a very professional, full-featured image editing app that does a lot on a time.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   It's a tiny screen.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.920]   And I think it's for Big Sur for tablets as well.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:09.080]   I'm crazy about it.
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:13.240]   It's funny because I was using Adobe's Aviary.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:15.640]   And as soon as I, I not even know they changed it.
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:19.320]   The only reason I knew is because they have a new icon that's kind of like a little leaf
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.320]   thing.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.760]   And when I said, "Well, that's different."
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:23.000]   And then I went, "Oh my God.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.280]   This is so much better than I've ever before.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.280]   I love it.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.520]   I love it."
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:29.520]   It's pretty pretty.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:34.880]   And the UI is a really good education in what can be done in a touch-first environment,
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:35.880]   I think.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.880]   They really, really...
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.880]   Yeah.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.880]   That's sliding up and down.
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:40.880]   Those sliding menus up and down.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.080]   Having just a few form slider across to adjust values.
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.280]   It's pretty, it's really great.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.000]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:54.280]   So you choose the filter like this way up and down and then you strengthen or weaken it
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.480]   by sliding left, right?
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.120]   Just fabulous.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.720]   You can then pull up more choices, nature, people.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.960]   Oh, this thing is so...
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.960]   It's deep.
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:05.960]   It's just deep.
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:06.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:08.960]   It looks like it.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:09.960]   That's very cool.
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:11.960]   I love it.
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:12.960]   And you can always go back.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:13.960]   Great.
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:14.960]   Right.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.200]   You can even undo something that's quite far down the stack.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:21.600]   So if you've got a stack of edits, you can undo one that's like two or three down.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.040]   It's very get like actually.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.040]   It is.
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.040]   It is.
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:26.520]   Look at so I can say, "I don't want that spot repair.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.520]   Let's get rid of that."
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.560]   Or you can change it.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:32.240]   Really nice.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:36.960]   This is an amazing piece of programming and it's free.
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:37.960]   Yep.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:38.960]   Yep.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:40.800]   So you combine that with this camera.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.280]   This is my new favorite photo tool.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.480]   I mean, this blows me away.
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.800]   Is that the best Android camera you use?
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:49.800]   Easy.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:53.600]   It's better that it's best camera ever and a phone.
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:54.600]   Easy.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.600]   Wow.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:58.960]   I'll point you to a, you can look at some pictures.
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:06.840]   leooport.smug mug.com is my, and I put them there because I could guarantee that these
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.640]   would be the unre-touched JPEGs.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.920]   Google was enhancing everything.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.120]   So that kind of, they do that.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.120]   They tend to do that.
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:16.680]   So I realized I was showing, these are unre-touched.
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:22.100]   These look as good as an SLR's picture in terms of color, accuracy, reproduction, tonal
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:28.220]   range, detail, low light is phenomenal.
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:29.460]   There's some panoramas in here.
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.220]   You'll see how good it is.
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:33.320]   This is just amazing.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.320]   Just amazing camera.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.660]   Oh, that's gorgeous.
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:41.420]   It makes you, it really, I feel like I don't need to carry an SLR with me.
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:42.420]   Wow.
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:43.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:47.220]   I mean, I do, but I don't know why.
[01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:48.220]   How is low light?
[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:49.220]   Like, it's very good.
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:52.540]   Low light in a dark room talking.
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:53.540]   It's superb.
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:54.540]   It's a F19.
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:24:02.260]   It's the fastest aperture made in a camera phone, which makes a difference.
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:05.760]   But also it's got, you know, I mean, look at, no camera phone is great, super great in
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:08.900]   low light because you have to pump it up and you get grainy.
[01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:09.900]   This is a pano.
[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:13.060]   I mean, it does a great job with the panos.
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:15.340]   It took it just a few seconds to take this.
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:16.900]   You just, you know, you don't take multiple images.
[01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:19.180]   You just slowly turn the camera.
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:20.660]   Oh, so this is an example of low light.
[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:23.580]   See the light up here is off.
[01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:24.980]   Looking in there, this is fairly murky.
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:27.860]   This was lit from window that was on the other side of the room.
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:35.140]   So by, to the naked eye, you couldn't see the detail inside the closet.
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:36.140]   Then I turned a light on.
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:38.980]   So this is with a single bulb.
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:41.060]   I would say spectacular.
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:43.860]   Just really great.
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:45.420]   So very happy.
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:46.420]   Very, very happy.
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:47.420]   Yeah.
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:49.340]   Battery life where twice is good, I'd be happier.
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:54.020]   But I'm starting to realize that that's an unreasonable expectation now.
[01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:56.300]   There's just nobody.
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:25:01.300]   If you're going to have a small light device that doesn't have an interchangeable battery,
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:06.220]   even the Galaxy Note 4 is 10 or 11 hours, but you can put another battery in it.
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:10.380]   You just, that's just an expectation I have to let go of.
[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:11.580]   Oh, I won't do it.
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.140]   I know it's a hard one to let go.
[01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:14.140]   I won't do it.
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:15.140]   I can't let go.
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:16.140]   I know.
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:17.140]   It's 20 hours.
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:18.980]   This is half that.
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:19.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:23.020]   Well, the one, and the OnePlus one is narrow.
[01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:27.100]   Like it's, it's a thin phone as well, but it doesn't have this crazy, you know, low
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:28.100]   resolution.
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:29.100]   Yeah, it's a tiny P.
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:30.100]   Yeah.
[01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:31.100]   Right.
[01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:32.340]   So it's almost like nowadays you need two things.
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:38.060]   You need to not go two nuts on the high resolution, you know, screen and you need fast
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:39.060]   charging.
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:40.060]   Turbo charging.
[01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:41.060]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:42.060]   I'm willing to give it because it has turbo charging.
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.060]   Yeah.
[01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:45.820]   I found by the way, one, and there may be more than one, but A.U.K.E.Y.
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:49.460]   A.U.K.E makes an external battery that does quick charging.
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:50.460]   Oh.
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:51.980]   10,000 milliamp hours.
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:54.740]   So I can charge this quick charge.
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:59.060]   It takes about half an hour to get 50% from zero, but in an hour you can fully charge
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:00.620]   it to 100%.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:03.580]   But I can do that with an portable battery now.
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:09.020]   So I just carry the portable battery with me and I just plug it in.
[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:12.500]   And frankly, it's worth it to have a phone that's this beautiful and compact.
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:15.780]   I'm just, I have to re calibrate my thinking.
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:16.780]   That's all.
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:17.780]   Yeah.
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:20.780]   Well, I mean, for a great camera, I think that's seems a little gimmicky, but for a great
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:21.780]   camera, I could.
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:25.540]   Yeah, you don't have to get the exact for a hundred bucks less.
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:26.540]   You can get the square one.
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:29.180]   I just think this looks unique and it's beautiful.
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:31.220]   Once you handle it, you kind of go.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:35.860]   And by the way, I was sad because T-Mobile only offered the black and the white, but they
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:39.060]   have like emerald green back and blue.
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:43.900]   They have different kind of in their subtle because it's kind of like, I don't know, built
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:46.220]   into the glass or something.
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:48.420]   And secretly you're a Japanese teenage girl.
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:52.220]   I got this great new emoji app.
[01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:56.140]   I love it.
[01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:04.020]   And that's my friends is the Google change law.
[01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:09.420]   Huawei has announced a new phone with a 5.2 inch full HD display, 8 megapixel front, 13
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:17.100]   megapixel back camera, 64 bit Kirin 930 octa core CPU, 2600 milliamp battery, 475 euros.
[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:19.340]   I don't know why we'd be excited about that.
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:24.860]   Sounds very kind of.
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:26.020]   But there you go.
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:29.940]   If you want 1080p with that battery in a 1080p screen, it probably does.
[01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:30.940]   It does great.
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:31.940]   That better.
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:32.940]   Yeah.
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:38.940]   Samsung does say, by the way, the S6 is selling better than they thought it would.
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:42.100]   Much higher than planned for.
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:46.660]   They said demand for both the flat and curved screen models.
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:48.500]   Very, very good.
[01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:52.420]   Investors and analysts say new devices will generate meaning, generate freight.
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:54.700]   Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer, meaning.
[01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:55.700]   How do you know?
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:28:00.020]   Well, Jennifer, meaning for earnings momentum in the quarter as the phones go on sale across
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:01.020]   the world.
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:02.020]   So they're not available everywhere.
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:08.620]   They just ended the US market this week, last week.
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:14.340]   I'm not crazy about, I haven't been in the past crazy about Samsung.
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:16.140]   I'm crazy about this phone.
[01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:17.140]   Wow.
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:18.740]   So tell us the software.
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:20.780]   There's still got to be some irritating software.
[01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:24.940]   As touch was, but I immediately, first thing I always do is replace the launcher with one
[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:29.580]   of my own, whether you want the Google now launcher or I use.
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:35.460]   Actually, there was a bug, I think, in Nova launcher that I've seen on other Android phones.
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:38.740]   I used to use Nova launcher and it was causing problems on this phone as well.
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:42.860]   So I went to Apex, which is very comparable.
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:47.420]   So I use Apex and that makes it look, you know, Samsung has a limit, has done their own weird
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:48.740]   skinning of Lollipop.
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.340]   I don't know why.
[01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:54.980]   The same problem I had on the Note 4, I don't use S finder or quick connect.
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:56.420]   I don't want to waste space on it.
[01:28:56.420 --> 01:29:00.440]   There's no way to get rid of those two dedicated buttons, which drives me crazy, but it is
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.820]   Lollipop sort of.
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:04.100]   It's Samsung Lollipop.
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:09.180]   You know, they have to have their little quick buttons, although I kind of appreciate that.
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:12.980]   Touch, but you know, you don't see a lot of touch was if you use your own launcher.
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.500]   I wouldn't use the Samsung launcher.
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:17.940]   It has Flipboard on the left.
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:25.060]   Unless you're like a major Flipboard advocate, I wouldn't bother.
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:27.460]   It's yeah, but it's not, it's not junked up.
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:31.980]   It's not, well, for instance, remember how awful the camera app was on the Samsung's
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:33.460]   they had all these special modes?
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:37.100]   Well, you still have modes, but they don't, they don't put little pictures in them.
[01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:38.860]   They just buttons now.
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:40.660]   And actually all these modes are useless useful.
[01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:44.300]   There's a promo that has completely manual.
[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:47.500]   It's like somebody, somebody shook them and said, Hey, stop it.
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:50.060]   Where does Google now fit in?
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:51.580]   You said the Flipboard's left.
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:52.740]   Google now.
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:54.820]   If you use the Google now launcher, yeah, Google.
[01:29:54.820 --> 01:30:01.820]   So that's the other thing that ours technical was complaining is that the, you have to use
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:06.540]   S voice if you want to talk to the phone with a screen off, but I don't want to talk to
[01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:07.940]   the phone with a screen off.
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:14.420]   So I have disabled a Samsung's S voice, which I loathe and I just use Google and it's got
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:18.700]   the same, by the way, the fingerprint reader really works.
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:22.580]   Just like Apple's fingerprint reader, you just put your finger on it and I can still
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:26.380]   do okay, Google.
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:27.380]   And it still launches.
[01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.100]   It's not super fast, but it still launches.
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:31.620]   So I know that's just how I do it.
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:36.020]   And Google now, I can't remember what I think I've, is it a double press on?
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:37.020]   That's the camera.
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:39.500]   I think if you hold it down, I've attached it to something.
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.500]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:42.300]   Oh, I see.
[01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:46.780]   But you can, you know, there you, all these launchers let you have a variety of push buttons
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:47.780]   and stuff.
[01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:49.780]   So how is that?
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:51.500]   That sounds like a great device.
[01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:54.380]   I'm well, you still have you with your one plus one.
[01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:57.060]   It's getting a little long in the tooth.
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:58.060]   I'm not sure.
[01:30:58.060 --> 01:30:59.900]   Did you get your lollipop update?
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:04.700]   No, no, it is allegedly coming now.
[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:05.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:08.900]   A few days, last a few days ago, I keep systems up to date.
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:10.700]   My system is up to date.
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:12.780]   Jason, that's what I keep telling me.
[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:14.860]   And it's not true.
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:16.420]   It's not true.
[01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:17.420]   It is not true.
[01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:20.020]   And at this point, I feel like there's going to be a new version of Android that comes
[01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:22.860]   out before I get lollipop in this thing.
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:24.460]   I love my Nexus 6.
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:37.020]   You know, can I, can I, I think I'm tired of big phones.
[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:39.620]   It's begun in the other direction.
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:42.660]   Smallet and smaller.
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:47.420]   I don't know.
[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:51.260]   Hot out now.
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:52.260]   Nexus 6 is fine.
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:53.740]   The camera is very disappointing.
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:56.580]   It's very average.
[01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:57.580]   Screen is very disappointing.
[01:31:57.580 --> 01:31:58.580]   It's very average.
[01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:02.380]   This screen below your thocks off.
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:06.020]   This is now that Leo is going in the reverse direction of size.
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.020]   This is where he will be.
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:10.100]   I just reread it in approximately two or three years.
[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:12.540]   No, I think this world's smallest phone.
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:14.460]   I thought 4.7 was actually perfect.
[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:15.460]   The Moto X size.
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:16.940]   I thought that actually was perfect.
[01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:17.940]   This is fine.
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:20.260]   Five one, this is good.
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:21.260]   And it's big enough.
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:24.620]   The screen is so good that you can hold it right up here and read stuff.
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:26.940]   So I'm fine with that.
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:27.940]   Anyway.
[01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:32.900]   I'm glad Samsung is doing well with this phone.
[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:34.780]   I am too because it was touching go.
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:36.620]   I don't know if they'd done another.
[01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:37.620]   Let's not even have competition.
[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:40.340]   Crap-ass phone like the S5, they would have been in trouble.
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:43.980]   I like the Note 4 because it is industrial.
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:47.780]   So what I think Samsung is going to do is this is going to be the pretty phone for people
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:50.260]   who care more about looks than functionality.
[01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:55.140]   And the Note 4 will be the pro phone where you can change batteries at SD card and all
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:56.780]   that stuff.
[01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:59.260]   Yeah.
[01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:03.260]   But of course with the Apple Watch, all of this, I'm just going to send it to Goodwill.
[01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:04.260]   That's it.
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:05.260]   It's all out the window.
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:07.180]   I really can't wait to hear what you're saying.
[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:09.580]   I don't know how I'm going to feel about it.
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:11.420]   I'm kind of interested.
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:12.420]   Yeah, I've been kind of interested.
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:15.220]   All of you so far have been kind of meh about it.
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:16.220]   Just don't know.
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:18.220]   But that's kind of the same ran for it where.
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:21.180]   My biggest fear is having to carry an iPhone for any length of time.
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:29.700]   I do not like, I got a little bit, I am afraid, I miffed, peeved a few iPhone fans on Sunday
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:30.940]   and Twit.
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:37.980]   Got into it with Ben Thompson as a trajectory because I said if an alien from space came
[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:42.780]   down and looked at a good quality Android phone and compared to the iPhone, there'd
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:46.260]   be no question the Android phone's far superior.
[01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:50.180]   Oh, I'm going to download that episode.
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:55.020]   And the reason people keep choosing the iPhone is because they're swayed by marketing.
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:59.420]   The same reason people chose Windows because everybody has one.
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.940]   Oh, it's the iPhone.
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:06.340]   I don't know the difference but I know that it's the iPhone, it's a safe buy.
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:10.540]   He says, you're saying the 75 million people were dumb to buy an iPhone last quarter.
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:13.180]   It's not dumb, not at all.
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.260]   That's not stupidity.
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:18.020]   It's just, I mean, I don't think you're dumb to carry a flip phone.
[01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:20.820]   You should get the phone that fits your needs the best.
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:23.900]   But it seems to me Android has lapped iOS.
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.820]   Yeah, but it was so irritating.
[01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:31.180]   All the coverage and greater New York Times about the Apple Watch didn't even mention
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:33.060]   the Android Wear existed.
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:34.060]   Yeah.
[01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:38.820]   I thought these similarly, it was these weird revelations about smart watches.
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:40.820]   I was kind of like, oh, guys.
[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:41.820]   Hello.
[01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:43.340]   Yeah, there's been, I mean, I don't know.
[01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:50.820]   I guess, like not, I mean, it felt a little bit like, yeah, this is what, well, but the
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:55.100]   Apple watches exist until Apple does it, right?
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:56.100]   And that's to their credit.
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:59.020]   I mean, you know, they've, you know, they've done that.
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:00.700]   And you know, I use Apple computer.
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:03.100]   I mean, I love my max.
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:09.140]   I've been an Apple fan since 1984 when I got in line and spent 2,500 bucks for a very limited
[01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:11.180]   computer.
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:16.020]   So I'm not an anti Apple guy by any means, but I think that I have to be objective and
[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:20.220]   iOS is so hobbled by Apple's insular point of view.
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:24.620]   You can't, no, no, no, only we can do that.
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:29.020]   So they have NFC, but they don't let it do the things that NFC can do.
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:33.220]   You know, they, they say, well, they allowed third party keyboards in this latest edition
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:36.180]   of iOS, but not well.
[01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:39.580]   So you still want to use the Apple keyboard, which is a terrible keyboard.
[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:43.340]   It's just, it's all these little things like Apple says, we know the right way.
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:46.060]   You don't shut up.
[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:47.060]   Do what we say.
[01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:48.060]   It's, it's Google.
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:51.220]   It's getting investigated for antitrust on Android.
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:55.820]   Well, I don't know what the, I wouldn't want Apple to get investigated for any interest.
[01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:56.820]   I don't see any.
[01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:57.820]   I don't see.
[01:35:57.820 --> 01:36:03.740]   What I'm saying is for what for controlling something.
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:07.300]   Anyway, welcome back there.
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:08.300]   Yeah.
[01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:11.900]   And I don't, I don't, I don't see that Apple's doing anything.
[01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:14.100]   No, that's what I'm saying.
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:19.660]   But by comparison, because Google is open and, and, and yet that's what, as you said before,
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:20.940]   that's what gets in trouble.
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:21.940]   Yeah.
[01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:24.340]   So I, it the only thing that bugs me at all.
[01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:27.540]   I mean, if you want an iPhone, get an iPhone by all means, I'm not saying you shouldn't
[01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:30.100]   get an iPhone by any stretch that matches it.
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:35.260]   But I just feel like it's, uh, Apple is not exactly innovating at this point in iOS.
[01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:36.260]   Oh.
[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:41.220]   And, uh, and so to, to, to point to Apple, say all the innovation and excitement in the,
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:45.380]   in the, in the space is happening there is to miss a lot of really interesting things
[01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:47.500]   that are happening out there in the real world.
[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:51.700]   And I love not having an OS essentially.
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:54.340]   Don't worry about it.
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:55.500]   It's, well, you shouldn't.
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:37:00.060]   And that's the, that's the, what the promise of the cloud is, is it, it's an OS independent,
[01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:01.060]   doesn't care.
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:02.060]   Yeah.
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:03.060]   So you're saying with your Chromebook.
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:04.060]   Yeah.
[01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:05.060]   Yeah.
[01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:07.580]   And you're having to install new software or this or that.
[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:12.900]   And I was looking for the, I don't know how to, yes, obviously install apps on, on this,
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:13.900]   but it's so easy.
[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:14.900]   It's, it's just no concern.
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:21.500]   There's no people say, they are saying iOS is simpler, but here's a really strong example.
[01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:25.860]   In my opinion, um, Apple for some reason, when Apple and the Mac came out, Apple had
[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:29.900]   very stringent human interface guidelines and said you'll do it this way.
[01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:31.520]   And you'll do it one way and you'll do it the right way.
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:32.760]   We don't do modal dialogues.
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:35.760]   You know, there was all these things, which I was thrilled about.
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:41.480]   I mean, that's, if you want to enforce rules and force user interface rules.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.660]   And, but they didn't for some reason iOS.
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:46.200]   So every app has its own UI.
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:49.000]   And there's, and the only thing Apple provides is a home button.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.080]   Your only recourse, if you can't figure out the UIs to exit the applications.
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:59.000]   I don't know how to use this, you know, so you have to really, but to, to Google's credit,
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.440]   they provide its rudimentary, but they provide enough UI that you can go back.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:04.440]   You can see recent apps.
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:09.400]   You can still go home and they have a menu, uh, button, a three dot menu button that's
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:12.080]   standard and almost all apps support it.
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:16.760]   It's Android apps tend to be easier to use.
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.600]   But so people think Apple is the iOS is easier to use.
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:20.600]   It's not.
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:21.600]   It's baffling.
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:28.160]   Most apps, you have to figure out individually, app by app, what the OS is, what the UI is.
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:29.160]   And it's possible.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:36.680]   In fact, it's often prized by Apple fanatics that app is completely out of left field.
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:39.200]   And Jean, do you think I'm off base on that?
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:40.200]   You're a developer.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.200]   I don't.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:44.560]   I mean, I've had a similar experience and, but part of me thinks it's because I've been
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:48.200]   and on Android for so long that I just, I maybe.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:49.200]   You could be that.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.200]   You're using Android.
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:51.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:52.200]   I have to stop the show.
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:56.840]   I see that Kanye West has just started following me on Kong.
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.520]   I now am retiring.
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:00.520]   Tiring.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.280]   Wait, he's following you.
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:03.280]   Where?
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:04.280]   You know about Kong?
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:05.280]   No.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:06.280]   Oh my God.
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:08.200]   You are so last week.
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:09.720]   I am so last week.
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:18.440]   Dave Moran's new app, which is a complete rip off of Kevin Rose's new app and Eve Williams
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.760]   new app, which cracks me up.
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:22.360]   It's called Kong K-O-N-G.
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.200]   Oh my God.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.200]   Super.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.200]   It's super.
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:28.200]   Hello, super.
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.800]   Oh, it's more than super because it's also a little bit of riff.
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:34.000]   Mark Zuckerberg's new app.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.920]   So the idea is it's a selfie app.
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:39.720]   This is where, for some reason, Kanye West is following me, probably because either it's
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.680]   not Kanye West or.
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:45.440]   There's no one else following me.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.440]   Or.
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.160]   Or.
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:51.320]   There's only four of us using this thing.
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:53.320]   Okay.
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.760]   So you're go home, then what happens?
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:55.760]   That's it.
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:00.440]   Now I can make a new one, but you want to don't you want to make it with a hashtag like
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:02.440]   something like Facebook.
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:03.440]   Good.
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:04.440]   Okay.
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:08.520]   Now I'm going to post to join Facebook.
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:10.080]   Okay.
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.520]   Now the frame rate is horrible.
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:14.520]   Okay.
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.200]   Now I'm going to use a filter.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:18.280]   It's pretty great.
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:20.080]   Where's the filter?
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:25.240]   I take everything I back about I ever said about about Android UI.
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:26.840]   I don't even know what to do next.
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.880]   Take this thing.
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:32.160]   That's doesn't undo what I just did.
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.320]   He says, yeah, but I did a perfect Facebook.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.320]   All right.
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:37.480]   So now swipe your face.
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:38.480]   Swipe my face.
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:43.240]   Oh, I don't know why I didn't think of that.
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:47.880]   Ginsburg, Rushmore, Midway citizen classic.
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:49.200]   Oh, Hurst.
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.320]   Oh, keep going.
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:52.320]   Warhol.
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:53.560]   Don't worry, Leo.
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:55.560]   Jeff's got this.
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:56.560]   Okay.
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:02.200]   I think that's a good face, bomb.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.200]   Can I set that?
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:04.200]   That's actually really good.
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:05.200]   I like that.
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:07.720]   So now I'm going to upload that.
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:10.320]   Do it was I supposed to put some text on there?
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:11.880]   You can super it with text.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.560]   All right.
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:17.320]   And I can also share this to hang out Twitter, Instagram or a GIF.
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:21.200]   That's why the frame rate so bad is because it's a GIF.
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:22.560]   It's really an animated GIF.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.360]   And there you go.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:29.520]   Now when Kanye responds to my face, palm, swipe it.
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:31.040]   Other way.
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:32.040]   Other way.
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:33.400]   Start at the end.
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.040]   Vogue instant.
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:36.040]   Keep going.
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:37.040]   What?
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.880]   Do you not get the star wipe on the Android?
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.440]   Android does not have star wipe.
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:41.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:42.440]   Oh, man.
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:43.440]   Whatever.
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:44.800]   Always left out.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:45.800]   Always left out.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:48.880]   So this is basically this is he released this.
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:49.880]   Hi, Sarah.
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:50.880]   He released this.
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.040]   I don't know why she popped up.
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:56.760]   He released this on both Android and iOS simultaneously today.
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:59.200]   Oh, that's at least.
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:00.200]   K-O-N-G.
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:03.560]   So here's what the star wipe looks like.
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:04.560]   Starburst.
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:05.560]   Wow.
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.360]   You've said so sad that I don't have that.
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:08.600]   See, iOS, you know what?
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:09.600]   I'm sorry everybody.
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:10.600]   I was wrong.
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:12.400]   iOS is better than Android.
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:13.880]   iOS exclusive.
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:15.720]   Star wipe.
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:17.640]   What does Kevin Rose's have?
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:18.640]   It's gone now, right?
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:19.640]   What was it?
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:20.640]   What was it called?
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:21.640]   Tiny.
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:22.640]   Did the same thing.
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:23.640]   And abs.
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:25.280]   But abs is super.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.280]   It's biz, actually.
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.280]   But yeah.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.280]   Oh, it's bibs, not abs.
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:29.760]   Sorry, biz, not abs.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.720]   I confused the two of them.
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:36.080]   Well, Twitter found short names in concert.
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:38.080]   Masters of the universe.
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:40.200]   What is path doing?
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:45.240]   I think path is nonexistent, which is why Kong is the new path.
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:46.240]   I used to love paths.
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:48.000]   I was a big path fanatic.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.320]   It smells like a pivot.
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:51.600]   It smells like a pivot.
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.800]   I think I read somewhere.
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:56.880]   Actually, that's a really great title.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:00.400]   Yeah, we have a title.
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:06.640]   I think the CEO opposed to somewhere late last year that path is going to a multi-app approach
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:07.640]   as opposed to--
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:08.640]   Oh, here we go.
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:13.000]   Because Dave basically does everything Mark does only later.
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.160]   All right, I'm sorry.
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:18.600]   I liked Dave more and actually quite a bit.
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:24.920]   And I think he's a very smart guy.
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:31.800]   iOS app store-wide Q1 revenue, 70% higher than on Google Play worldwide.
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:33.600]   Not up--
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.360]   70% higher.
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:40.520]   So that's why, if you wonder, why apps come out first on iOS revenue.
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:45.560]   What's the dynamic of that?
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:47.160]   Why is that?
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:54.960]   Well, anybody who's stupid enough to spend $1,000 on an iPhone is a sucker.
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:55.960]   Wow, Leo.
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:56.960]   I know.
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:59.200]   You're not getting any fans.
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.360]   Did we get him some Secret Service Protection?
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:02.480]   No, no, I'm just kidding.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.400]   I love the iPhone.
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:06.520]   I think it's a beautiful device.
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:11.240]   But I think it is the case that we've known this for years at iPhone users spend more money
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:13.400]   on apps.
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:16.240]   They have accounts with their credit cards attached to them.
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:18.040]   But everybody does.
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:21.360]   It doesn't Google Wallet automatically debit you?
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:21.800]   Well, right.
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:22.760]   But you have to set up a Google--
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:26.840]   I mean, you can create a Google account without ever entering your credit card.
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:30.520]   So you can have an Android phone and be logged to the Play Store and get tons of content
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:36.280]   for free, but never buy something because you just never gave them your payment information.
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:38.480]   Where payment information is sort of central to create--
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:39.240]   I don't know.
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:41.000]   I did it so many years ago.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.680]   But iTunes users are trying-- I mean, they spend money on stuff in the app.
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.320]   I was obviously being facetious.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:54.400]   But there's a little bit of truth to the fact that they're more affluent.
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:57.360]   They're willing to spend a lot more on a phone than others.
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.400]   And so that would also carry on to apps.
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:09.200]   And I guess then you could make arguments that maybe the apps are steamed more valuable.
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:12.880]   Or I don't know how that would be true, but maybe you can make that case.
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:21.720]   Well, that might be the perception because apps are approved first and vetted.
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:29.640]   And because the Apple culture revolves around design over functionality and customization,
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.960]   a lot of the apps are-- the design of the operating system was historically more beautiful
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:36.880]   than Android, although I would argue that's not the case now with material design.
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:39.520]   But it's been a long journey to material design.
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:44.800]   And just design and fashion and style is central to Apple's products.
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:48.440]   And I think then to the people who like them by them.
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:51.840]   But at some point, you're just playing in damn candy crush.
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:55.400]   And how was it 70% higher at Apple?
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:56.520]   Well, OK.
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:59.600]   There's also the other argument, which I think is true, is that people who buy--
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:02.040]   remember, Android phones are a broad range.
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:03.680]   There's the top of the line Android phones.
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:07.320]   But the vast majority of Android phones sold are under $200.
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:07.680]   Yes.
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:12.160]   So I think that the other side of the argument is maybe not so much that people are spending
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:15.280]   so much money on iOS, but that people don't spend any money.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:19.400]   Which also argues that there's a bit of technological redlining going on.
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:21.840]   Yes.
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:23.640]   But that's self-redlining in a way.
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:28.920]   Because you could, no matter where you are, buy any phone.
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:31.400]   Almost-- I mean, Apple's in almost every country.
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:31.880]   No, no, no, no.
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:36.800]   By redlining, I mean that if you can't afford an iPhone, you're also not going to get the
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:37.960]   latest apps.
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:38.960]   Right.
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:44.120]   Well, I think that's another thing that's interesting about Android is most apps are--
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:47.640]   or a lot more apps are free.
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:50.360]   Whether they're free or not, you're not going to get access to them.
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:52.440]   Because they're going to go to the rich people first.
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:53.440]   Right.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.440]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:57.720]   Yeah, Meerkat will come out on iOS and delay Android.
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:58.720]   Bingo.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:46:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:00.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:07.520]   And for Meerkat, since there's no purchase issue, there's not an in-app purchase or any
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:13.080]   money changing hands, why not go for the larger audience, which is the Android audience?
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.080]   Well, developers are not so different from real people.
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:18.280]   They have their favorites.
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:19.280]   Prejudices.
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:20.280]   Biases.
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:21.600]   I don't want to say biases.
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:26.320]   I think everybody's thinking I'm somehow putting Apple folk down.
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:28.520]   I bought several iPhones.
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:30.240]   I spent far more than a thousand dollars.
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:31.240]   Let's keep getting you in trouble.
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:33.240]   I like this.
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:35.640]   I am one of them.
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:38.880]   Yeah, likely story.
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:41.360]   Yeah, you're just scared.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:43.160]   Well, I'm not scared.
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:44.160]   Leo, such a yuppy.
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.880]   You spend so much money on stuff.
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:47.320]   It's like I can't win.
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:48.320]   Hey, I don't say yuppy.
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:49.320]   It's your job.
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.320]   It's your job.
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:51.320]   It's my job.
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:53.480]   I still feel sort of bitten by the iOS first stuff.
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:56.520]   Like, signing up for HBO Now, I had to break out the TV I've had.
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:57.520]   It's frustrating.
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:58.520]   Yeah.
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:00.520]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:03.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:05.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:06.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:07.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:08.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:09.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:10.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:12.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:13.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:14.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:15.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:16.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:17.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:18.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:19.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:26.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:27.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:28.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:29.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:30.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:31.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:32.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:33.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:34.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:35.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:37.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:38.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:39.520]   I think it's a really good thing.

[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:01.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:02.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:03.520]   I think it's a really good thing.

[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:07.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:08.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:09.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:10.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:11.520]   I think it's a really good thing.

[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:20.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:21.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:22.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:23.520]   I think it's a really good thing.

[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:25.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:26.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:27.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:28.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:29.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:30.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:31.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:32.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:33.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:34.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:35.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:36.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:37.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:38.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:39.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:40.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:41.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:42.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:43.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:44.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:45.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:46.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:47.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:48.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:49.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:50.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:51.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:52.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:53.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:55.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:56.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:57.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:58.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:52:59.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:00.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:01.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:02.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:03.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:04.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:05.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:06.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:07.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:08.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:09.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:10.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:11.520]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:13.520]   He showed me.
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:14.520]   He said, "Look Dad, it's all scored up."
[01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:15.520]   I said, "You're..."
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:16.520]   [Laughter]
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:17.520]   Oh.
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:18.520]   So he broke it.
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:20.520]   So Jennifer said, "I'm going out to see him.
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:22.520]   Why don't you give me an old phone?"
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:23.520]   I said, "Great.
[01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:24.520]   I have like four Android phones.
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:25.520]   I'd be glad to give him one."
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:26.520]   They're unlocked.
[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:30.520]   He says, "No, I want an iPhone."
[01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:33.520]   Stop opening those beer bottles, kid.
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:36.520]   Use your teeth like a normal frat boy.
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:38.520]   [Laughter]
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:40.520]   That's not cool, kids, that he's talking about.
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:42.520]   By the way, I'm wanting an iPhone.
[01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:43.520]   That's ecosystem.
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:44.520]   Yeah.
[01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:45.520]   Right.
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:46.520]   What do you mean?
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:48.520]   It's not the cool kid drive.
[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:52.520]   It's that he's invested himself completely in the iOS ecosystem.
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:53.520]   No, I don't think so.
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:55.520]   Everything he does he can do on Android.
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:56.520]   You know that.
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:58.520]   There's nothing he does.
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:00.520]   He's not a mere catter.
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:02.520]   It's an exclusive beer opening app.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:04.520]   Some people get really into iMessage.
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:05.520]   They get really embedded in iMessage.
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:06.520]   That's part of it.
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:11.520]   I'll grant you that.
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:14.520]   I miss, yeah, you want to be one of the green kids, not the blue kids.
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:20.520]   I do miss not having iMessage, not being able to send the audio with the up swipe.
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:29.520]   That's frankly why I want to get the iWatch, because I can do the same kind of creepy 3G emojis to my wife.
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:34.520]   All right, Gina, how long is he going to be extolling the virtues of saying let's do bets now.
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:36.520]   Let's start the pool.
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:38.520]   How long before he says, you know, iOS is good.
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:39.520]   It's the right thing to do.
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:41.520]   And then how long before he switches back to Android?
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:42.520]   What do you think?
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:43.520]   Over under here.
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:44.520]   What do you think?
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:50.520]   I think Leo is going to have a brief love affair with the lones.
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:52.520]   Yeah.
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:53.520]   Give it a couple of weeks.
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:57.520]   I think the watch is going to do a little couple of things, a little bit different than Android, where I mean, it's going to be a little fancier, whatever.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:54:59.520]   But yeah, I think I'm going to give about a month.
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:01.520]   Yeah, I was going to have to get some.
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:03.520]   And then back, I think back to Android.
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:04.520]   I think there's a serious risk.
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:06.520]   I might be permanently an iPhone user.
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:08.520]   He's already pre-empirated.
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:09.520]   Oh boy.
[01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:13.520]   I'm kind of gearing myself up.
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:15.520]   I'm going to be a self-loathing iPhone user.
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:17.520]   You'll be back.
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:20.520]   I really can't wait to hear what you think.
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:24.520]   You just spent time saying how the iOS is good.
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:25.520]   Well, all right.
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:26.520]   I've told you.
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:27.520]   I think this is my theory, though.
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.520]   But we'll see if this is true.
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:36.520]   One of the main things that I miss on Android is the fact that I can, without launching an app, I can see what's going on with the widgets.
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:39.520]   I really feel that that uses the screen well.
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:41.520]   I even have on here.
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:50.520]   And I'm not sure I'll ever use it, but Samsung bundles Peel because this phone has something, another thing that the iPhone does not have an infrared sensor.
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:52.520]   So you can use this phone as a remote control.
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:54.520]   Let me unlock it.
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:56.520]   Peel puts a widget on the screen.
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:58.520]   It's actually the remote control.
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:55:59.520]   Wow.
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:04.520]   And I use widgets a lot, as you can see, for quick and easy access to information.
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:06.520]   My whole calendar is here and all that.
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:14.520]   And so on iOS, where you merely get this, a grid of icons, and that's it, I feel it seems so primitive.
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:20.520]   But I feel like the watch is going to help because that's basically widgets.
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:26.520]   The watch is all of the UI stuff, all the sugar that I'm missing.
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:32.520]   We'll see though, you know, I'm really sad that the Galaxy S6 Edge came out.
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:36.520]   If I hated this, it would be so much easier.
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:40.520]   Now it's going to be a challenge.
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:42.520]   Look how you love turning it in your hand.
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:43.520]   It feels good.
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:46.520]   It's slightly warm.
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:51.520]   That's your battery draining.
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:52.520]   Oh, God.
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:55.520]   You can feel the battery actually going out of it.
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:57.520]   Like a life force draining from it.
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:58.520]   It gets cold.
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:56:59.520]   More than just friends with this phone.
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:00.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:03.520]   We went from inner child to going to cuddle with this thing.
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:04.520]   Okay.
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:07.520]   I know it's really getting weird.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:10.520]   I'm a terrible, terrible person.
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:12.520]   Leo redefines phone sex.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:15.520]   Sex with your phone.
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:16.520]   Oh, all right.
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:17.520]   We're going to take a break.
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:18.520]   Come back.
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:22.520]   We have your tip tool and number and pick and all that stuff.
[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:26.520]   I don't know if Gene, if you even remember what we used to do.
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:28.520]   Yeah, I got a tip.
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:29.520]   All right.
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:30.520]   Yay.
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:31.520]   Our show today brought you by LegalZoom.
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:32.520]   Oh, man.

[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:47.520]   Lisa did her will.
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:48.520]   It's beautiful.
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:53.840]   If you're looking to incorporate to create a nonprofit to get a DBA, LegalZoom can get

[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:06.800]   You can count on LegalZoom to handle all the details.
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:10.520]   They know what business owners need to do.
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:14.240]   Three, and by the way, that's a lot of what you go to a lawyer for is that kind of
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:16.080]   experience.
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:17.080]   Three helpful support.
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:18.720]   The right people are there to answer your questions.
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:20.080]   They're all based in the US.
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:21.080]   Legal advice.
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:22.160]   They're not a law firm.
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:25.800]   So they're not allowed to give you legal advice, but they're smart.
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:30.640]   They built a network of independent attorneys, which you can call on at a fixed rate available
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:32.560]   in almost every state.
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:37.120]   They can give advice on the best way to get started, provide contact, track, review,
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:38.120]   other useful services.
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:41.280]   I would have loved this just because they didn't have this when I was using them.
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:43.040]   But just to say, what state should I incorporate?
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:45.200]   And I've heard Delaware is good.
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:49.000]   Hoolie was incorporated in Delaware, but Pied Piper is incorporated in California, which
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.800]   is the best.
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:53.760]   Finally, number five, no surprises.
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:57.760]   LegalZoom provides complete transparency, upfront pricing, customer reviews.
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:01.840]   You know what you're going to get, and they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee.
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:03.160]   There's no risk.
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:04.160]   Just reward.
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:05.800]   I love LegalZoom.
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:06.800]   We chose it.
[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:11.440]   You should choose it too for all your businesses, your family needs, for incorporation, for
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:14.880]   trademarks, for patents, for wills.
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:15.880]   Just check it out.
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:17.000]   LegalZoom.com.

[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:24.880]   Offer code Twig.
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:29.240]   We thank them so much for their support of this week.
[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:30.240]   Google.
[01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:33.160]   Gina Trepani has a tip for us.
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:35.000]   How nice to be able to say that.
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.160]   So let's talk about Google Keep.
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:39.640]   I don't know how long it's been.
[01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:40.640]   I love Keep.
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:42.640]   Man, Keep is awesome.
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:46.080]   Keep is like the most underrated and unrecognized.
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:48.200]   And no iOS app.
[01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:49.200]   And oh, really?
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:50.360]   Is that cool?
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:52.520]   No, it's frustrating because I use it.
[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:56.640]   And Lisa and I use it for our shopping lists and everything.
[01:59:56.640 --> 01:59:59.160]   And she has to use the web version on iOS.
[01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:01.200]   And how does the web version do a mobile Safari?
[02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:02.200]   Okay.
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:03.200]   It's fine.
[02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:04.200]   But it'd be nice if she had an app.
[02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:05.200]   Well, this is the thing.
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:06.200]   The Android.
[02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:10.560]   Keep, particularly the home screen widget is amazing.
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:12.240]   And it's just got so many features.
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:16.400]   Like, look, I make a to-do list app and Keep is just awesome.
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:17.360]   You can do lists with it.
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:18.360]   You can share.
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:19.360]   We do the same thing in our house.
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:20.360]   We do share grocery lists.
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:24.280]   We share, order this on Amazon next time you're placing an order list.
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:26.760]   And it got a couple of new features.
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:27.920]   Recurring reminders.
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:33.160]   So once a week, remind me or once a month, you know, ones they remind me that Swig starts.
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:34.160]   And their reminders are great.
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:35.600]   You can do by locations.
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:39.040]   So you can say when it gets to the office, do this.
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:41.880]   Or when you get to the store, don't forget to get milk.
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:42.880]   It's awesome.
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:44.760]   Yeah, when you get to the store, yep, remember the milk.
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:48.120]   And they've got, you can color, you can, you know, make notes different colors.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:50.040]   And they also added labels.
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:55.120]   So you can label your notes as well, similar to the way that you would label things in
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:56.760]   Gmail.
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:58.720]   And you know, you can export all the stuff to Google Docs.
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:00.240]   You can very easily even know it gets long.
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:02.200]   Just convert it to a Google Doc and go from there.
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:04.920]   But yeah, this is a, this is, yeah, there's the widget right there.
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:05.920]   Love the widget.
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:09.840]   You can do voice input, camera input, just start a new note.
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:11.080]   So house crap.
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:12.080]   That's awesome.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:13.080]   That's our list.
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:14.840]   That's our house crap list.
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:16.480]   Things we got to do in the house.
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:17.480]   Yeah.
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:18.480]   Yeah.
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:20.080]   Whole food shopping list.
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:22.160]   That's automatically set when I go into Whole Foods.
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:24.560]   That's what I have to buy.
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:27.560]   This is our, our pedal in the market set the same way.
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:28.560]   It's great.
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:30.520]   Yeah, certain stores when you get there, it's fantastic.
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:31.520]   It's such a great app.
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:32.720]   And I just, I feel like it's kind of under song.
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:35.520]   So now we've got recurring reminders and labels.
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:38.120]   Yeah, the widget, the widget's great.
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:39.120]   It's awesome.
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:40.120]   Google Keep.
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:41.360]   I didn't realize that there wasn't an app on iOS.
[02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:42.360]   Sorry, iOS users.
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:45.600]   I mean, I don't think we have any iOS users actually listening.
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:46.600]   There's not anymore.
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:47.600]   We don't.
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:49.960]   I'm sure that we lost all of them about 20 minutes ago.
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:51.600]   They turned out a few minutes ago.
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:55.440]   But for the two or three masochists who are still around, I'm really sorry.
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:56.880]   I was.
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:59.240]   When I get my hyperlabs.
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:01.040]   So yeah, Google Keep.
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:02.040]   I love Google Keep.
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:03.560]   Yeah, good recommendation.
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:04.560]   Really useful.
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:06.000]   And they keep adding new features.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000]   I like the recurring reminders.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.000]   That's a really useful feature.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.000]   So it's good.
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:11.000]   Yeah.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.360]   Jeff, you has a number for us?
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:21.400]   Well, just as your expensive overpriced snob, where it comes out.
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:27.800]   Google dropped the price on Google Play or on whatever they call it now of the Motorola
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:29.760]   360 down to $165.
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:30.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:31.760]   $149.
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:32.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:34.640]   Well, that's obviously motivated by the snob.
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:35.640]   Yeah.
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:38.480]   So you can thank the snob where 240.
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:39.480]   What is it?
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:40.480]   170?
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:41.480]   165.
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:42.480]   165.
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:43.480]   That's reasonable.
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:44.480]   That's definitely.
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:47.000]   So they're going to compete on price.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:53.280]   The Android watches, which is smart because I think the Apple watches overpriced.
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:56.920]   And they're going to write Android Wear for iOS.
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:58.160]   That's what I'm really interested in.
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:01.600]   But see, that's where you're going to run up against what Apple's sandbox.
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:02.600]   Exactly.
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:03.600]   Yeah.
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:04.600]   Yeah.
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:05.760]   Because that's it.
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:08.800]   There's a lot of potential there.
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:09.800]   Yeah.
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:14.040]   Another little late breaking number.
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:17.720]   Etsy priced its IPO at 16 bucks a share of the high end.
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:18.720]   Oh, interesting.
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:20.440]   So it is worth 1.78 billion.
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:21.440]   Geez, miss.
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:22.440]   Wow.
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:23.440]   I'm in the wrong business.
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:24.440]   Yeah.
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:25.440]   You need to.
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:26.440]   I am in the wrong.
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.080]   Big crocheter is happy.
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:34.600]   I have an app that I installed when we went to Vegas called Silver Car.
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:37.640]   You guys know about Silver Car?
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:40.440]   It is a new kind of car rental system.
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:41.440]   They--
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:43.000]   I've heard of this.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000]   Yes.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.440]   They're all the cars are silver.
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:53.400]   And they're all Audi A4s with free GPS, free Wi-Fi, free satellite radio, and a much better
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:54.400]   fuel plan.
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:55.960]   So it's really interesting.
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:57.160]   You download the app.
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:00.520]   Yes, they have a free phone as well as Android.
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:03.000]   It's unfortunately not available everywhere yet.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.520]   But I think they're rolling out a lot faster very quickly.
[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:09.360]   What's the cost of the day?
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:11.400]   It's a good question.
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:12.400]   Don't know.
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:13.400]   It's affordable.
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:22.320]   It's not-- and the thing is, you don't get like the upgrade thing and all the little
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:27.080]   things that the car-- and the fee thing and the fuel thing, all the ways that little
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:34.040]   car companies kind of-- it hurts and all the others get you in the long run.
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:38.360]   We haven't used it yet because it hasn't been in an airport that I have been at.
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:39.360]   It's Dallas.
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:42.480]   It's limited, Austin.
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:45.520]   But it's cool because you don't have to go to a counter.
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:46.840]   It's like Uber.
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:50.760]   You book it on the phone and then you walk up to your car and you scan the QR code in
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:55.360]   the car's windshield and you get in and you go.
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:56.800]   That's like kind of like a zip car.
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:57.800]   Like zip car.
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:58.800]   Same idea.
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:04:59.800]   Yeah.
[02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:01.800]   So in that case, do you have a key at all or not?
[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:03.400]   That's a good question.
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:04.840]   Maybe they just-- what does a zip car do?
[02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:05.840]   They leave it in the car?
[02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:07.680]   Yeah, like those the keys in the car.
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:08.680]   Yeah.
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:11.600]   Those new fangled keys that don't-- aren't actually a key.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:12.600]   I like those.
[02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:15.320]   I never take my key out of my pocket no more.
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:20.560]   So we were up at one final college visit with our daughter and I went off to get
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:25.480]   a gas and my wife went up to the hotel room and she had the car key in her purse and
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:28.360]   the car keeps running and I saw this error sign on it.
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:29.360]   I don't know.
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:30.360]   What the heck is that?
[02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:32.600]   Good thing I didn't stop the car at the gas station because it wouldn't have started
[02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:33.600]   again.
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:34.600]   Oh yeah.
[02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:35.600]   You need that.
[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:36.600]   You need the dongle.
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:37.600]   You lost your dongle.
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:38.600]   Yeah.
[02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:40.800]   That's not the first time around that.
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:47.920]   Austin, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix and San Francisco.
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:49.320]   Yeah.
[02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:52.320]   Johnny Jet, our travel guy, told me about this silver car.
[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:53.960]   He likes it.
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:56.040]   Car rental that doesn't suck.
[02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:57.440]   And I love not having to go to the counter.
[02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:00.440]   I mean, that's why I do the emerald aisle just so I can just go.
[02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:03.320]   Yeah, same kind of thing.
[02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:07.640]   My friends, I hate to do it but we must call an end to this party.
[02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:13.480]   Cheater in a moment.
[02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:14.480]   Next month it'll be a shorter time.
[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:15.640]   I had so much fun.
[02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:17.360]   I really do miss you guys.
[02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:18.880]   I tried to make it a fun job for you.
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:19.880]   I miss you.
[02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:20.880]   We all miss you.
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:23.080]   And I get tweeted all the time.
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:24.080]   Why isn't Gina?
[02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:25.080]   Oh, get Gina.
[02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:26.640]   Do whatever you need to do.
[02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:28.440]   But we respect you.
[02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:33.680]   We honor your need for space.
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:39.360]   I promise not to text you in the middle of the night anymore.
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:40.360]   It's not Leo.
[02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:41.840]   It was totally me.
[02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:42.840]   It's not you.
[02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:43.840]   It's me.
[02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:44.840]   It's not me.
[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:45.840]   It's you.
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:48.480]   I'm so glad that I get to come and come back on.
[02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:49.480]   It was really fun.
[02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:51.640]   It was really great to see both of you.
[02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:52.640]   Everybody.
[02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:54.440]   You know how you get Gina back on Twig?

[02:06:56.240 --> 02:06:57.240]   Yes.

[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:05.080]   And then she can do whatever she wants.
[02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:07.280]   And then she buys, she buys Twit.

[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:35.880]   And full disclosure Gina gave me an account.
[02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:38.160]   But I would pay for it because it's really great.
[02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:40.000]   It's really, really great.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.640]   Jeff, we love you too.
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:43.160]   Thank God you're still here.
[02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:44.160]   Love you.
[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:45.160]   Love you.
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:54.920]   Oh, get your dongle out of your wife's purse.
[02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:55.920]   And get back to work.
[02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:57.920]   I don't love you anymore.
[02:07:57.920 --> 02:08:04.320]   Buzz machine.com the great books, public parts, geeks, bearing gifts.
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:05.720]   He's a legend.
[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:06.720]   Jeff Jarvis.

[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:13.520]   Even if you use an iPhone, it's okay.
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:15.520]   I won't hold it against you.
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:16.520]   My wife's sitting over there.
[02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:17.520]   Of course.
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:18.520]   What does she use?
[02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:19.520]   I gotta be careful.
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:20.520]   No mixed marriage.
[02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:22.520]   Yeah, we're a mixed marriage.
[02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:23.520]   Dangerous.
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:26.000]   She was a Windows user for a while.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000]   Oh boy.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.760]   Oh boy.
[02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:32.480]   She's she still uses windows.
