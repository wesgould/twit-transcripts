[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.560]   The show that talks about the latest in the cloud.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.760]   Boy, that's a that's a that's a mouthful right there.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.760]   This week especially.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.200]   Let's say hello to Gina Trappani from smarter where.org founding editor at life hacker.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   Hi Gina.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.280]   Hello.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.480]   And to my left, you're right to my right, you're left.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.240]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.480]   City University of New York journalism professor.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.600]   Long time journalist himself blogger at buzz machine.com and the author of a brand new book
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.280]   called public parts available everywhere.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280]   Hello everybody.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.400]   There's a lot to talk about.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.240]   Lots to talk about this week.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.600]   Lots to talk about.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.640]   Should we start with Marissa Meyer?
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.120]   We've talked for a long time about Yahoo and the struggles Yahoo was facing.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.040]   And the last we heard looked like Levinson.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.880]   Ross Levinson was going to keep the interim CEO title and be the CEO active forever because
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.320]   the guy at Hulu said, I don't want that job no matter what.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.440]   And then out of the blue out of the blue yesterday.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.240]   Marissa Meyer number 20 employee at Google takes the job as CEO.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.040]   There's people magazines.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.200]   I think very, very lovely.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   Very sexy.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.560]   Very lovely coverage of Marissa Meyer.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.800]   No, no one can let go of the glamour spread.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   No to self.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.960]   Never do glamour spread.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960]   And you know what?
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.680]   In a way, and we were talking about engineers because we had Jolie Odell who was quite the
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.480]   fashion plate and Becky Warley on Twitter on Sunday and both of them very attractive.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.880]   And I was talking a little bit.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.720]   So it seemed to me that maybe we were in a post feminist era where you could be a feminist
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.960]   and still dress up and be in a glamour and still be really accomplished and be judged
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.720]   for your skills.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.400]   But this I have to say is not.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.320]   I mean, Marissa has said for some time, I'm not a girl at Google.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.320]   I'm a geek at Google.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.000]   And I think it's really important.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Howard Kurtz from CNN said on Twitter, well, she getting all his attention just because
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.800]   she's a woman and pretty.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.080]   And I said, well, no, I think that's the sexist question right there.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.280]   No, she's getting all his attention.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.200]   She deserves all this attention because she's got vision and she's a hell of a geek and
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.120]   tough and this is a gutsy move to go to Yahoo.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.840]   And that's why she's getting all the attention.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.840]   But God damn.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.840]   Look at this.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.240]   People thing and it was a simple thing.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.040]   So number, you know, so here's it's not merely the picture.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.040]   Here's the list of things.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.880]   Five things you need to know about Yahoo's new leader.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.440]   She made history as a first female engineer at Google.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.400]   Okay, that's all well and good.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.480]   Number two, she's glamorous, glamour magazine.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.800]   So is her apartment.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.040]   This is these are the five things you need to know about Marissa Meyer.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.680]   Her cupcake recipe is better than yours.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.800]   And she's going to be a mom.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   Wow.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.520]   But you're right.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.800]   I mean, there's not a surge.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.560]   Yeah, that she changed our vision of web design.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.080]   But it is People magazine.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.880]   I mean, it's People magazine.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.240]   I really liked what Mike Errington wrote and uncrunched.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.800]   He's of course a good friends with Marissa has interviewed her many times, not only for
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.560]   tech crunch, but on stage at Lueb.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.280]   I've seen him three times, I think, interviewed Marissa Meyer.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   And I think this is kind of right on.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.920]   He says, it's not just another story about another exec playing musical chairs and switching
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.240]   jobs.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.760]   What the press has missed so far is this is a paradigm shift for Yahoo.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.640]   Meyer, I love this, is completely out of Yahoo's league.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.640]   She is.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.240]   This is what I loved is that the angle of the story was that this was a huge coup for Yahoo.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.640]   No, this was like a big accomplishment for Meyer, but that it was a huge coup for Yahoo.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.640]   It was.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.200]   That gets it right.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   It is right.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.040]   He says so far out, so far, so far out.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.120]   I'm surprised they even had the courage to approach her.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   Although it's possible she approached them.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:55.160]   That part makes sense because glass ceiling or no, there was a ceiling of having young
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.480]   people in charge of the company.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.760]   And she's, you know, they kind of passed her over this last time when she didn't get
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.760]   the senior VP level.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.440]   Even if she gets it, how far she going to go.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.920]   And now she can head a company.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.960]   And now you have two executives, three executives made by Google.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:21.600]   Cheryl at Samberg, Tim, Tim Armstrong at AOL and now Marissa at Yahoo.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   Each with tough jobs.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.760]   Errington goes on to say overnight, Yahoo's reputation will change.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.520]   At first it will just be in Silicon Valley.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.200]   But as of now, people won't be ashamed to say they work at Yahoo anymore.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.920]   And for the last several years, they certainly have been ashamed.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.680]   More key employees will stick around.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.920]   The company will be able to hire better people.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.640]   People will be proud to work at the company.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.120]   Morale will shift immediately.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.040]   There'll be lots more positive thinking.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.040]   All of this.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.040]   It'll actually be a vision.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.200]   All of this without her doing anything but walking in the door.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.200]   And I agree.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.760]   I think Mike hit the nail on the head on this.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.200]   It's great for Yahoo.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.240]   The biggest fan of Marissa, I think that, you know, I've met her at a lot of conferences
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.000]   and talked with her and interviewed her at CUNY.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.720]   And she has a vision.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.400]   You know, I've talked about the hyper personal news stream, about the new kinds of services
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.920]   that you can bring.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.240]   And I think that people are thinking way too small and just debating about whether, and
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.600]   she said this too.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.880]   But maybe whether Yahoo is a technology or a content company.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.200]   I'm sure she has wholly new things in mind.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.560]   You know, I, hearing about those news, I was looking at it.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.560]   I mean, I think it's great for Yahoo.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.240]   And I think it's great for the industry, right?
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.280]   Because I don't want to live in like a web industry with the two biggest companies or
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.280]   Google and Facebook.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.400]   I'm excited about, you know, the possibility for Yahoo.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.560]   And she did just make Yahoo a cool place to be, a place with opportunity and challenges
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.560]   ahead of it.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.000]   But I was looking at it from her perspective.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Okay.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   So let's look at it from her perspective.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.480]   This woman is, she's six months pregnant.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.760]   She has zero financial incentive to take any job.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.760]   She doesn't need to work.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.600]   She doesn't need to work.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.800]   This is the toughest job out there that, I mean, it's left a string of failures in its
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   way.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.240]   It's like the most public, highly scrutinized, high pressure.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.880]   She looked at that opportunity and was like, yeah, I'll do that.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.880]   I'll do that.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.520]   That's, I'm going to do that.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.680]   Man, I, that takes guts.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.040]   I'm just so impressed with her.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.560]   I mean, I mean, there was never any doubt in my mind that there was any lack of ambition
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.360]   or drive or vision on her part.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.520]   And I think that she's going to do great.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.320]   I know she's going to do great, but I just from a, like, from an individual opportunity,
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.080]   life choice point of view, I give her a lot of credit.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.080]   That takes guts.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.080]   Gutsy, gutsy move.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.080]   You bet.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.080]   Gutsy indeed.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.160]   Unfortunately, the headline in the Christian science monitor is, reignites debate over pregnant
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.880]   women in the workplace.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.880]   I just want to like this.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.880]   What debate?
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.880]   What debate?
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.880]   Slug them.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.120]   Interesting article from Jolio Dell actually, in Venture Beat.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.400]   She says the reason Marlissa Meyer left Google, she had to.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.400]   Now, I don't know if this is all speculation or...
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.240]   Well, she was saying that she wasn't going anywhere at Google.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.320]   I think that that's probably true.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.640]   You know, I thought, nobody thought this, but I thought when she didn't get selected for
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.760]   the five people running Google.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.680]   Yeah, you pointed that out, Leo.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.880]   I remembered that show.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   You mentioned that.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.360]   I thought that that was a slight.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.680]   It was, you know, it was a slight.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.680]   I kind of downplayed it and was kind of like, "No, it's fine because I just felt defensive
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.320]   of her because I've been an admirer of hers for a long time."
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.680]   But, you know, it's true.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.680]   She didn't kind of make it up until she got that.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.040]   She's employee at 20.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.480]   She did search.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.480]   She was responsible for searching Google's heyday and search.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:49.800]   They instead of putting her in that executive suite with the other four guys, Larry Page
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.440]   and the others, they said, "Oh, here, you take location."
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.000]   I mean, she was the face of the company really early on, but the last three Google I/O, she
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   was never on stage.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.120]   I mean, she spent a lot less public face of the company than she has been.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.320]   You know, it's interesting, the people article aside.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.120]   There's a business insider article.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.120]   Oh, I thought that was very interesting.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   Go ahead.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.120]   Yes, it was very interesting.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.120]   Yeah, it was business insider article.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.200]   It says, you know, the headline is, "The truth about Marissa Meyer.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.320]   She has two contrasting reputations and, you know, it's this conspiracy that she wears
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.080]   dresses and likes cupcakes and fashion, but she's also this like workaholic tyrant manager."
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.760]   And I find this to be kind of sexist.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.760]   Really, it's something.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.000]   Because it's like, so you can't wear a dress and be a tyrant.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And there was never any doubt in my mind that she was a tyrant to work for.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.840]   The woman is, she's like answering email at 4.30 in the morning.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:47.000]   I mean, she's notorious for being a relentless workaholic and extremely bright on top of
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   that.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.640]   And I mean, she never made any bones about that.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.080]   I mean, sure, she did a glamour spread, but she also obviously works really hard.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:59.160]   And so this business insider article interviewed people at Google who said, "Oh, she would
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.680]   make people sit outside her office, sign up for office hours and sit outside her office."
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.520]   And it was very condescending.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.520]   She was inaccessible.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.160]   I mean, I remember a fast company in different magazines kind of profiling the way that
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.160]   she worked.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.160]   And that opened office hours.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.720]   I mean, every day, her door was open to anyone at any level of the company could approach
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.040]   her and pitch her and talk over product with her.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.880]   And I always thought that that was a good thing.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.720]   So I just, this article bothered me a lot more than the people.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.320]   People magazine, I sort of expect fluff.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:35.560]   And I think this article might reflect, yes, I mean, obviously they have quotes from a lot
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:41.600]   of Googlers about how horrible Meyer was, but it might reflect what we might see more
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.640]   of, which is a campaign now, because frankly, a week, Yahoo is good for Google, right?
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.960]   A campaign now against Yahoo.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.920]   I don't think it was that notorious.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.400]   I see your point, Gina, and I agree with what you've said.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.360]   Cara Swisher called that same piece spot on.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.120]   What this piece also said was that Marissa, because when it said in the end was that Marissa
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:12.400]   has grown and matured and that in her early days at Google, she might have been more,
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.160]   I don't know what the word is.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.160]   Accommodating.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.560]   Apparently, she humiliates her people, who and who does that sound like, by the way.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.560]   Exactly.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.560]   That's the other point.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.560]   It's like a Steve Jobs.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.560]   Oh, okay.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.560]   I should just shut up there.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.960]   By the way, let's find out how many of her employees have an asset?
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.920]   Apparently, all of mine do.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.520]   Before the show, I asked for an asset and every single one of my team came up with an
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:48.040]   asset for me, they all are sitting there chewing thumbs all day and you think Marissa Myers
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.040]   at Tyrant.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.840]   I've talked to Googlers too about Marissa and I think that the part of it that was right
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.320]   is there are two views of her.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.560]   Some felt that she was a really good public spokesperson.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:04.120]   Some thought that she was very un-Google and how she was being public.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.000]   Some felt that she was tough and direct.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.840]   You're going to find that with any boss.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.840]   That's the reality.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:17.080]   The real skill of the manager then is to do the job well and as much as you can not care
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.400]   about the junk part of it and listen to the important part.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.760]   When I got out of that article was that she, I don't want to say "softened," that's the
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:30.280]   wrong word, but she changed some of her ways in a way that made her more effective and that
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.720]   means she learned.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.720]   She matured.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.720]   She matured.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.080]   She's been in Google for 13 years.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.080]   She's 37.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.760]   That put her in early 20s when she started there 24.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.760]   You change a lot.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.200]   A lot of changes between 24 and 37.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.320]   When you're at a place for that long, people remember you that early, it can hamper your
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.320]   growth.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.360]   Sometimes you do need to go someplace else too.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:57.720]   Gina, you tell me this is true or not too, but you live in a world filled with boy geeks.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.040]   I'll bet at some point she in a position of very high authority in this startup with
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:10.200]   a whole bunch of difficult boy geeks working for her had to decide to be tough, had to
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:19.160]   be demanding, couldn't play into parts and had to establish herself as a true authority
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.160]   in the company.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.440]   Then once that's established, then you can change the rules a little bit.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.400]   At first, I would imagine, I'm very sympathetic to the idea that she had to be no nonsense.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.400]   Absolutely.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.240]   Listen, I had one of my bloggers, Life Hacker worked for me for four years and were good
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.240]   friends.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.840]   It off-handedly during a conversation was like, "Oh, well, when you were being a tyrant,
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.720]   I mean, I'd be called a tyrant."
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.120]   To me, being a tyrant is like getting stuff done.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.720]   Sometimes you just, you need to set a high expectations and you don't suffer fools and
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:51.040]   you just say that this is what it is.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.120]   In this business insider article, this source, someone for Inside Google, described an executive
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.800]   who will work harder than anyone, great, is smarter than 99% of the people, great, but
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.400]   can't scale herself and doesn't understand managing any other way than intimidation
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   or humiliation.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:11.560]   I mean, anyone who's managed people, even if it's a small team to a huge company, knows
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.720]   that you grow as a manager and you definitely go through the bullying stage.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.280]   I certainly apparently did.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.640]   We're probably even sometimes you got to put your foot down.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.440]   The thing is that that does not, just because she likes cupcakes and fashion and interviewed
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.360]   Lady Gaga doesn't mean that she's not a tough manager and hey, she's got to be tough.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.480]   She's got a tough job ahead of her.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.680]   That's the real question here.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.720]   What the F do you do with Yahoo?
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.720]   Right.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.800]   That's where I want to go.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.720]   I don't want to spend a whole lot of time on the gossip side of this.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.720]   We did.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.720]   Oh.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.720]   And that's it.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   Done.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720]   It's BS.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   Yahoo scored.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:52.080]   They got perhaps the one person who could get people to go, Oh, Yahoo.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.680]   Fred Wilson said, Hey, suddenly Yahoo's interesting again.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.680]   That's big.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.120]   Others in my world said, Hey, New York Times looking for CEO.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   Beat that.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.080]   And she would have never taken a job at St. New York time.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.080]   I don't think I like Sferhard Manju's taken.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.840]   Slady says, Marissa Meyer is in over her head and that's just how she likes it.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.840]   This is she has bitten off a huge challenge.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.640]   So what do you do?
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:23.640]   I think that she's going to see beyond what Yahoo was and when she sloughed off that question
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.040]   about is a tech or content.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.760]   I think she sees beyond that.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.480]   She wants an extraordinary experience for people.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.600]   She sees being useful.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.480]   I think we're going to kiss goodbye to the overdone Yahoo structure and a simplification
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.480]   of Yahoo.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.200]   And I think she's going to invent some new services that are useful to people in their
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.800]   lives and see beyond search and beyond social and beyond content.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:52.080]   But I don't know what the hell that is that the betting sheet on her is that she's data
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.080]   driven.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.720]   Of course, yeah, you know, Google is data driven, right?
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.520]   Yeah, she's always said that.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.600]   So is there a data that you can use to decide?
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.120]   Well, first of all, one of the first things she probably has to do is kill stuff, decide
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.240]   what to kill and what to keep, right?
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.240]   Mm hmm.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:15.280]   And as a gift to all us geeks, throw some nice rose petals on top of Flickr and make it wonderful
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.280]   again.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.240]   If anybody would do that, it would just be dear Marissa Meyer dot com.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.600]   No, this is a website already dear Marissa Meyer dot com.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.600]   Wow.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.840]   And it's what to do.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.840]   And it just has one request.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.840]   One request.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.840]   Please make Flickr awesome.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.960]   Again, the internet.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.960]   Love the internet.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.960]   That is great.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.960]   But it's not just Flickr.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:45.600]   There's a lot of properties at Yahoo that are great, maybe underperforming Yahoo.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.920]   By the way, nobody noticed this in the announcement that they were hiring Marissa Meyer actually
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.680]   released their earnings at the same time.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.520]   And maybe challenge greater.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.520]   Right.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.360]   But they're not, they're not hemorrhaging.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.440]   They're just not growing.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.400]   They're not, you know, they're doing okay.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.920]   So kill stuff, right?
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.080]   Kill stuff products and staff.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.800]   I mean, downside staff and products.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.800]   Refocus.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.840]   There's a really great list of bits of advice from a former Yahoo.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.680]   I love that article.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.800]   Serum Krishnan, apologies for for messing up the name.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.600]   But there's this is, it's a list of 10 things.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.120]   This is, this is my favorite one, I think.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.280]   Well, there's a few of my favorites.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:34.000]   Number four, make a huge sign with the phrase, the premier digital media company.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.720]   Then make a video of you running a bulldozer over it, over it, crushing that sign.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.720]   No one knows what that phrase means.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.640]   Come up with a goal that people can actually visualize and isn't meaningless corporate
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.720]   mumbo jumbo.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.080]   This is best part.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.080]   Here's a suggestion.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.240]   Quote, a Yahoo app on every home screen.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.240]   That's a good mission statement.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.240]   That's a Microsoft.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.240]   That's a good goal.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.120]   Microsoftian mission statement.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:03.040]   He also says, "Item number six, find out what it would take to buy Cara Swisher's Silence
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.040]   Forever."
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:11.640]   Well, we ship code, not slide decks.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.040]   And this is actually what gave me this idea.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:21.400]   Make a table with the columns, invest, maintenance mode, kill, and fill it up with Yahoo's product
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.400]   before Leo.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.400]   Share it with the employees and press.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.280]   So everyone finds out from you rather than Cara as to what your priorities are.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.840]   And then favor the kill column whenever in doubt.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.840]   Yup.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.960]   Say no.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.880]   Which is a lesson I think that Larry has been teaching lately.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.880]   Mm-hmm.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.880]   Mm-hmm.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.880]   Mm-hmm.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:46.360]   So, yeah, I actually really enjoyed this article because I thought it was an insider's
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.360]   point of view.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.920]   So I still want to hear from both of you.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.920]   Where do you think?
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.080]   I think it's probably in personalized services that make your life better.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.760]   Where do you think the opportunity is?
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.160]   Well, I guess that's the question.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.400]   Is it a content company or a web service company?
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.400]   That's what she rejected.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   She said it's neither.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.360]   It's a place that makes magnificent experiences.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.600]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.600]   [laughter]
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   Okay.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.480]   That's the right thing for her to say on day one.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.040]   Right.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.040]   But at some point, don't you, maybe you don't.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.040]   Don't you have to make the distinction?
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.040]   Isn't that part of the same?
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.040]   I hope it's not a content company.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.080]   I mean, Tim Armstrong bet his farm on content.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:25.480]   And he, you know, one thing about AOL was that the brand of AOL turns out to be fairly
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.400]   positively viewed, but empty.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.400]   No one knows what it is.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.400]   You can make it anything.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.400]   You can make it anything.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   I would say Yahoo is the same to some degree.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.920]   There were negatively viewed I think right now, but is similarly empty because nobody
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.080]   knows what the hell it is, neither did any of it CEOs.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.800]   So it can be something new.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.280]   I mean, I'm going, part of what I've heard her say personally about the things like the
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.160]   hyper personal news stream that she has this vision of when I have this data on you, what
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.160]   can I give you?
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.520]   What can I do for you?
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.800]   Now to do that, to get the data on us, the problem is she doesn't have any relationship
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   with us.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   What is Yahoo's business?
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.800]   Oh, it's ad sales.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.800]   It's like it's just the same as Google.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.800]   Yep.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.560]   Well, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.560]   It's more like AOL's.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.600]   It's ad sales on top of content.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:15.800]   It doesn't have the kind of data that Google has and Facebook have.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.000]   But Yahoo Mail is bigger than Gmail.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.720]   So some question, like where is this content?
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.080]   So my Yahoo used to be my homepage, you know, forever ago.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.080]   I haven't looked at it.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.880]   But like when you say content, this is just like go to OMG.com.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:31.880]   Okay.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.880]   OMG.com.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.120]   This is one of the largest sites on the internet that you've never heard of.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.120]   Okay.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.560]   So this is just a goth.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.560]   This is a gossip.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.040]   Yahoo Finance is still gigantic.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.040]   Yep.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.000]   Katie Quark is doing a show for Yahoo.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.600]   ABC News is kind of a lot of video.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.880]   Becky Worley does Yahoo.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.280]   Here's Yahoo Kids.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.640]   This is a portal.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.640]   Okay.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.440]   So what's the kids do now?
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:05.280]   Yahoo in the days of when they hired Terry Semmel from Warner Brothers, been set up on
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.720]   the radio and studio and make it into that.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.280]   And that culture is still somewhat there.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.520]   It's an ad sales on top of content culture.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:16.960]   It's a I've always said, I've always said Yahoo is the last old media company.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.720]   And it still is just that.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.920]   Is that too much of a sea change to turn it into something like a web services company?
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.640]   I think if you favor the kill column and you bring in some talented technology people,
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.280]   a few technology people can create some great things.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.520]   Is Flickr a web service?
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.520]   I guess it is.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.720]   It's really not a content play.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   No, it's a web service.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.720]   It's a web service as is delicious.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.720]   Delicious.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   Well, I don't have that anymore.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.720]   It's right.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   They don't have delicious.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.720]   That's right.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.040]   Well, apparently Flickr is going to launch something a really great mobile app soon.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:52.000]   So did you hear that last year?
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.880]   I have to say right now it's finance sports.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.960]   It really is very much a content company right now.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.120]   So much so that it might be too late to change, right?
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.000]   Yeah, I mean, it might be.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.520]   But I think, well, let's go this way.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.600]   I think that it absolutely was too late to change.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.600]   I've written off Yahoo.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.600]   But give me two.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.600]   That's what changed it.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.600]   Right.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.440]   Marissa Meyer, I mean, changes that immensely.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.640]   And I believe the thing that I have faith in is that she has vision.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.640]   So here's a great.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.240]   And it wasn't able to execute on that vision at Google in the last two years.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.240]   Thanks to.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.840]   Thanks to Trip70 in the chat room who's pointed me to the Wikipedia list of Yahoo owned sites
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.840]   and services page.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.840]   Oh, very helpful.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.360]   Um, fire eagle.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.760]   I think that's gone now.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:43.400]   Flickr, Foxy tunes, browser extension upcoming, the invite site.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.560]   Wretch a Taiwanese social networking service.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.040]   Rivals.com's college recruiting site.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.040]   Yahoo answers.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.040]   Oh boy.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.000]   How is Babby formed?
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:02.080]   Uh, Yahoo avatars, Yahoo autos, Yahoo axis, Yahoo bookmarks, developer network directory
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:08.480]   finance games, Yahoo green, an environmentally conscious lifestyle site.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.040]   Yahoo groups, Yahoo kids, Yahoo.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.360]   Co-prawl and Indonesian social networking service.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.000]   Oh, Yahoo local.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.640]   Well, that and I mean, they tried to buy Yelp and Yelp said screw you.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:26.040]   And this was also a big deal that they had done with newspapers and Yahoo got newspapers
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.880]   to sell ads on there and it's sour badly.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.840]   Yahoo mail seems like an opportunity.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.280]   I think I think it is.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.280]   I agree.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.760]   I'd love to see Yahoo maps.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.760]   How about Yahoo maps?
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.000]   Is it dead is Bing and uh, Avi and Google and Apple maps?
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.960]   Yeah, I want to go back to mail.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:44.960]   I'm going to disagree.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.600]   I think that mail as a category is dead.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:55.320]   I hate to say no, not dead is is more wholly screwed up and there's an opportunity.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.320]   I think there is.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.560]   I think that's why we've talked about this in the show before where where Bob Whyman
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.320]   from Google taught me about the problem with emails and sender controlled and that's why
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.320]   I got all messed up.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:10.040]   And that's why I think Google plus is being controlled, but that's around a an odd mission
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.040]   of Google's to learn more about us.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:18.200]   I think you could reinvent mail in from radical new ways that really give the recipient control
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.200]   over it.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.200]   That's an opportunity.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.560]   That's a kind of serve magnificent service way that I think she'd think.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.280]   So not not straight straight web mail.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.280]   No, that's done.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.280]   Right.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.280]   Gmail and Hotmail.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.280]   How are you going to do?
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.280]   You can't compete with those at this point.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.480]   And I don't believe that the ad performance on Gmail is very good.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.800]   I think it's I think it tells them other things, but I can't imagine.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.120]   I've never clicked on a Gmail ad.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.120]   Right.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.120]   I just Yahoo Messenger.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.840]   A lot of people use to use them, right?
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.960]   I think I still log into that and my I am client.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.960]   Yahoo movies.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.120]   Yahoo even has a music service.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.120]   Remember launchcast?
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.120]   Wow.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.360]   Remember how they made Mark Cuban rich.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.360]   Right.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.360]   Broadcast.com.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.480]   Hot broadcast.com and how long did it last?
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.480]   I don't know.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.480]   Less than a year, right?
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.480]   It wasn't very long.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.480]   What was that worth?
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.480]   Like a billion and a half?
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.440]   Yeah, they paid him so much money.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.200]   In fact, I was hoping to get some of that stupid money early on.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.680]   Yahoo pipes is great.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   Yes.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.280]   But if this than that kind of right if this than that did it better and easier and cleaner.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.280]   They did.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.920]   And I have to think Yahoo has the engineers who in who maybe I mean I would I would hope
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.640]   that there's engineers in Yahoo go thank God I can go to Marissa and say look, this
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.280]   is pipes we could make this something really great.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.640]   And she would listen and she would get it.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.720]   Yahoo has shopping.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.720]   You know, Yahoo is a lot of like e-commerce small business sites, right?
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.920]   Well, when I started stuff at Conde and asked way back in the day, we couldn't you couldn't
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   do shopping.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.880]   There was a there's a fortune cover on the death of cash.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.040]   And back in the day if you what it took you for a large company like that to get a credit
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.480]   account to accept money.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.560]   So when we first started selling stuff, we used Yahoo store.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.560]   Sure was easy.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.760]   In fact, I'm looking at all the stuff they bought.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.760]   Remember they bought dial pad?
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.520]   Yeah, they have a voice.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.400]   They have a voice play.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.000]   They have web analytics to die.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.600]   They have voice and Yahoo voices, which is associated content.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.640]   Well, they bought they bought associated content, right?
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.640]   Yeah, it's the kind of better demand media, the less evil demand media.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:31.560]   So it's really interesting when you put this all together, it's it looks like Google's
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.600]   bizarro twin, but it looks like everything Google's killing.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.320]   It looks like there's no focus whatsoever to it.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.320]   None.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.320]   It hasn't been for a decade.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.000]   They had an auctions site that's gone.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.040]   I'd love to see the list of things they bought that they've messed up.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.040]   They ran babblefish.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.840]   They had the translation service.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.840]   Who 60?
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.840]   Yahoo 360.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.040]   Forget they bought Bill Gross's ad structure.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.840]   What was it called?
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.840]   I'm not.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.240]   I'm out cat.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:10.040]   Oh, but but but that was that was Google's ad model before Google had it.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.040]   Right.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.040]   Who had it?
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.360]   They didn't know what to do with it.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.440]   So I could totally understand you hit the nail on the head.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.720]   Gina when you said Marissa Maya doesn't need money.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.880]   She's she's set for life.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.200]   She wanted a challenge.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.480]   She wanted the biggest challenge in Silicon Valley.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.320]   And she took it.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.720]   And you know what?
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:32.560]   She's either going to make her reputation and be the be the you know, the next Steve
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.560]   Jobs.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.560]   Really great opportunity.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.560]   He'll be very happy.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.880]   Or she'll say, Hey, you know, it didn't work.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.240]   And she'll be the next Carol Bartz.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.880]   But but well, you know, no, I don't think so.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.080]   I mean, yeah, I guess there's a chance that she could just come in and surprise us.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.360]   All of this hype we're giving and say no, but let's let's let's play with it.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.760]   What if she even if she fails?
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:29:00.080]   There are some jobs in the world where even if you fail and you give it the college try
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.760]   and you show some vision, but you took over something.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:10.080]   Is it possible that she can not be that she can not succeed but not fail?
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.400]   Yeah, I do.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.400]   Not succeeding is failing though, right?
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.440]   Yeah, so I'm saying, but but not fail personally.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.440]   Oh, I see.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.720]   That not lose all respect that people have for her that they can admire.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.720]   Well, look at Kevin Rose.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:31.800]   You know, a good a good college try is definitely a part of the Silicon Valley culture.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   Exactly.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.160]   And and nobody's going to look at it and say, Oh, you took a great company and ran into
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.160]   the ground.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.200]   It's like if you took over rim, that'd be the only company she could take over that would
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.200]   have been worse.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.200]   Oh, hey, Marissa, by rim.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.960]   She'd get it tomorrow for that lunch, get some patents with it.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.360]   It's a deal.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.360]   So what are she?
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:54.440]   What's her relationship with Google and what's her relationship with Bing?
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.440]   What do you think?
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:00.120]   I think this business insider story tells you everything you need to know about her
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.120]   relationship with Google.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.720]   The Google long knives are out.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:08.840]   She left and Google is, I think it's Google PR right there in that business insider article.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.120]   They said, go get her.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.440]   Did you see her Twitter though?
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.720]   She took a picture of Google.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:19.080]   Her colleagues at Google gave her these big balloons, like each balloon for, you know,
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:25.720]   13 balloons a piece and with a purple one at the top, it was, you know, kind of sending
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.720]   her off to Yahoo.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.720]   I don't know.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.720]   I saw a lot of good.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.720]   I don't know.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:34.000]   Just just from the people I follow on Twitter and Google Plus, I saw a lot of goodwill from
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   her from the top.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.800]   Yeah, I'm not so sure, Leo.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:41.080]   I wonder whether your Tim Armstrong has a decent relationship with Google.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.840]   From AOL, they have a big business relationship.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.200]   Google's not foolish about this.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.920]   They're not going to dis her for the sake of dissing her.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.400]   She surely is not going to do anything in search.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.680]   I think she better off.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.680]   I said this yesterday.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.440]   I think what's going to happen is Microsoft Facebook Yahoo.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.240]   It's a new access powers aligned against Google.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   Interesting.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.320]   And maybe you throw Apple in there.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.600]   This is a real opportunity for Apple.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.680]   This is, we were talking about break weekly.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.640]   Apple should now, as it's done with Twitter and Facebook, include Yahoo as part of its,
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.040]   because they want to push out Google, right?
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.120]   So who are the access?
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.160]   Who is the access, the anti-Google access?
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.160]   Facebook.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.160]   Yeah, Facebook.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.440]   And Microsoft and Microsoft kind of kind of have a problem.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.000]   Maybe throwing Nokia, throwing Yahoo.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.280]   There's a few companies that might line up against Google.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.640]   I mean, no one knows Google strengths and weaknesses, I think, as well as--
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.640]   There you go.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.640]   --and she does.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.640]   That's for sure.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.640]   And she has the relationship there.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.360]   Google would be smart to continue that and cultivate that, I think.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.360]   They're not dumb.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.280]   They're not emotional there.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.280]   They're data driven.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.280]   They're data driven.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.280]   Look at these balloons.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.280]   Wow.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.680]   I mean, the purple one at the top, that's cute.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.560]   From her Yahoo, from her Google colleagues.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.560]   And then--
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.560]   She also put up a picture of--
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:32:02.120]   Yeah, from the Yahoo colleagues, she got a layette set with a purple rubber duck.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.520]   That's actually very sweet.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.720]   So she started today, right?
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.720]   Yesterday.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.720]   Yesterday.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.720]   So there was no transition.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.720]   It was like womb.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.240]   Yeah, and apparently no non-compete.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.520]   No non-compete, I guess, huh?
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.520]   That's what happens when you're a employee of 20.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.520]   Google didn't--
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.320]   Well, when you don't take anything to leave, there's no non-compete.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.680]   Non-compete's are illegal in California anyway.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.680]   Anyway.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.720]   And they're mainly used just when you quit and get severance.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.720]   Right.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.720]   Oh, I see.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.720]   Yeah, they could say, hey, OK, we'll give you some money.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.720]   Yeah, you know, I see.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.720]   But--
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.920]   If you walk out, they have absolutely no calling you.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.920]   Except, you know, unless she has corporate secrets and that kind of stuff.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.320]   But she's going to be smart about that.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.320]   You know, it's funny.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.480]   Two weeks before she took the job at Yahoo, she announced she was going to watch Breaking
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.120]   Bad and catch up an episode a day.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.120]   Sorry, Marissa.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.320]   I don't think you're ever going to get to season five.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.320]   I think you might want to--
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.320]   Well, of course she'll have--
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.720]   She'll have time when she's in her literature, one week we've heard the--
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.720]   Yeah, later.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.720]   --that's not it.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.320]   One week, but I believe when she's working through it.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:16.320]   In between emails and nursing, you can watch maybe 10 minutes at a time.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.920]   So get granular.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.920]   Search in Yahoo.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.920]   What do you do?
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.600]   Well, does Yahoo not use Bing?
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.800]   Isn't that what Yahoo's search has become Bing?
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   Isn't that right?
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.800]   Yes.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   Yes.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   So they don't have a search product.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.000]   Yeah, search is so yesterday.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Exactly.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   So--
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   So what do you do?
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Social, right?
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Social--
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Social--
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   As replaced search, right?
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Social and content, content social.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.920]   Does Yahoo have a good social play?
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.560]   What if you went after Facebook?
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.560]   I wouldn't go after Facebook.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.560]   I'd go for it.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.720]   Oh, that's actually right because remember they sued Facebook and the part of the settlement
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.360]   was we're now intertwined.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.160]   I would go after Twitter if I were her.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.160]   Or purchase Twitter.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.680]   She understands feeds of information and data around that.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.720]   And she's got to try to get a relationship going with people and data around that relationship.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.280]   Do you remember a little something called Yahoo meme?
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.280]   No.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.280]   Me?
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.280]   Me?
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.280]   It was a Twitter clone.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.280]   They killed it two months ago.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.280]   She's.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.320]   I guess they probably still have the code in a drawer somewhere.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.560]   They could pull it out.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.120]   Does she have any war chest to buy anything?
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.160]   Oh, sure.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.280]   Let me just look at the Yahoo earnings.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.920]   I don't know how much cash they have, but let's just see.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.960]   Because this was a good way to hide the earnings report.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:40.320]   Oh, and by the way, before we talk about how much money we lost, I don't think they did.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.320]   I think they did all right.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.080]   Let me just see if I can find that.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.800]   All right on Yahoo terms.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.800]   Yahoo.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:52.560]   I can't, I'm going to find it.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:58.280]   I probably could get it on finance.yahoo.com.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.080]   Yahoo beats Q2 earnings with $0.27 a share.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.080]   Let's see what the cash position is though.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.720]   That's what you mean by a war chest, right?
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:05.720]   Yes.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:12.800]   They had $1 billion in revenue, earnings of $0.27 a share, search revenue $461 million.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.600]   I mean, this is not a poor, tiny company.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.240]   You don't just throw that away.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.520]   That was down but 1% year over year.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:27.800]   Display revenue up 2% to $535 million.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:32.440]   Do you have their, this is great.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.680]   We'll have the chatroom to the research.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.920]   What is Yahoo's cash position?
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.760]   I don't see it.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:42.480]   Cringley just posted the chatroom says this afternoon by Yahoo's relatively good financial
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.480]   standing.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.560]   I don't know if that's.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.520]   All right.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:53.640]   You can see why an engineer would say, would grasp this bull by the horn and say, this
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.200]   is a challenge.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.400]   How do you take this company, this venerable company?
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.120]   One of the old internet stalwarts.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.800]   How do you change it?
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.600]   Not the market cap, the cash position.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.320]   How do you save it?
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.320]   It's an opportunity.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.320]   Right?
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.320]   You're right.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.240]   I mean, that's the way the engineer looks at it.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.240]   It's a problem.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.080]   So how would she define the problem?
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:19.120]   Well, with that from Yahoo perspective and a consumer perspective, she's clearly thinking
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.120]   consumer.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.960]   So they don't have a lot of cash, $2.2 billion.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.960]   Yeah, I can't buy much.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.200]   Can't buy Twitter.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.240]   You can't buy Twitter for instance.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.880]   But so you're going to be building that buying.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.880]   Yep.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.880]   But she can attract the talent.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.520]   She can attract the talent.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.520]   That's right.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.720]   And if you got, let me understand this.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.960]   If you came in as a new employee now and got options now, you got to believe it says
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.480]   the slowest ab.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.840]   I'd take them behind like a startup.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.760]   So there are going to be others like her who said, let's take this challenge.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:55.400]   I think she builds a team of maybe some ex-googlers, some hot shots who say, yeah, and this is
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.440]   what I do if I'm her samir.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.440]   Let's go.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.440]   Let's take this challenge.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.840]   Look, I just took a big challenge, a big leap.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.240]   I believe in this company.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.040]   Will you join me and help build the next generation Yahoo?
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.440]   And she has to define what she thinks that is though.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.680]   First, you know, I want to know what is your vision?
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.680]   Well, she's smart.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.840]   She's not doing that in public.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.840]   Well, right.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.840]   Right.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.840]   Right.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.960]   She said she wants to get rid of the distractions and create a user experience, a clean user
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.040]   experience that delights.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.040]   But what is user experience?
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.040]   That's meaningless.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.040]   The user experience, omg.com.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.040]   Right.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.720]   So it's got to be value.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.800]   She understands delivering value.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.720]   And omg is not value.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.960]   It's content to put an ad on top of it.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:37.760]   And the truth is, content is nowadays is a commodity.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.760]   Yes.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.760]   It's very hard to differentiate yourself.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.960]   In fact, we didn't even know omg was a Yahoo property.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.440]   It says it, but who cares?
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.800]   He's a commodity postdoc.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.880]   I went one day to Indianapolis, lucky me, just a joke in Indianapolis.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.280]   Who's yours?
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:57.320]   There I spoke about speaking to speakers at the National Speakers Association.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.560]   Very meta.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.960]   And I had what I thought was not a terribly controversial argument about trying to make
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:06.320]   things into more of a conversation than I leapt down into the room, which I loved doing,
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.200]   played Oprah and ran around in the conversation.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:14.520]   And some people in the room really objected and said, well, no, no, we're content.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.520]   We create content.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.520]   We create valuable content.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.880]   They sounded exactly like newspaper people to me.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.880]   And I wrote a post about this.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.640]   It really occurs to me that it's a trap.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.760]   And if you think, well, I make content and content has value and that's the end of the
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:33.600]   story, then you cut yourself off from all kinds of new opportunities, A, B, you're in
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:38.880]   a commoditized business where C, you have no end of new competitors.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:43.320]   And I don't think that anybody wants to, there should want to be in the content business.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.800]   But you're not in the content business, Leo.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.280]   You are really in the relationship business.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.280]   You create communities.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.280]   The chat room.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.280]   God bless everyone.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.280]   You're a metal Jeff.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.280]   But not you Leo.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.280]   That's okay.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.280]   I believe it.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.200]   No, you're not in the content business.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.520]   Well, we don't, we are not commoditized content.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.520]   You're right.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.640]   And the way you be not commoditized is be as relationship is unique.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.320]   Now here's my thinking.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:11.040]   There's no way Marissa Meyer takes this job without going home, sitting and thinking really
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.280]   hard.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.200]   And there's no way she takes this job without a plan.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.320]   She has in her mind.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.160]   But she believes will say a plan that will save Yahoo.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.160]   And it would be my guess.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.400]   It's gutsy.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.400]   It's unexpected.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.000]   And she sure as hell not gonna tell me or Cara Swisher.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.240]   I hope that involves her running a sign over with a bulldozer though.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.480]   How awesome would that be?
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.480]   We'll see.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.200]   Before she gives birth, I want her pregnant on the bulldozer.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.200]   That's not that.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.880]   That's what we want.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.760]   Running over a sign.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.760]   That would be awesome.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.960]   She's a little more dignified than that.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:52.280]   Do you think she calls Jerry Yang?
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:56.440]   And says, it's like if you're gonna remake the monsters, don't call the people who used
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.440]   to play him.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.440]   Right.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.600]   Starting over, starting fresh.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   Freshly.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.000]   Not called Jerry Yang.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.160]   I'm sure she has somewhere a piece of paper with the line down the middle.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.360]   It says strengths, weaknesses.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.320]   She's got spreadsheets.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.320]   No doubt.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.320]   Spreadsheets.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   I love it.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.320]   I love it.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   I'm just that.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:18.360]   It's a story you look for these kinds of stories.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.520]   But also, I don't know if this has been clear all along.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.480]   I've been rooting for Yahoo all along.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.480]   This is legendary.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.640]   I remember Jerry and David and I remember acabono.stanford.edu.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.120]   This was the internet started at Yahoo and for me.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.120]   But you know what, Leo?
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.280]   I also remember the snottiest meetings I had in Silicon Valley back in the day was Yahoo.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.440]   Well, see, here's where I went at Vage.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.840]   I never meet with anybody.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.600]   They were just so far above it all.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.720]   And Jerry came in and said, you know, our job is to get people in and out of Yahoo as quickly
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   as possible.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.920]   And that turned out to be a lie pretty damn soon.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.400]   They were competent.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.400]   They were snotty.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.560]   They thought they could push their firehose on everything.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.960]   They thought they were going to, you know, destroy the content business while going backwards
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.960]   into it.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.480]   No, I was never rooting for Yahoo.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.040]   I'm rooting for Merissa Mayer.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.040]   Yes.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.040]   Okay.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.560]   And then that is a Silicon Valley pitfall that many companies go through as arrogance.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.560]   Yes.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.560]   King of the World.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.560]   One of the original one.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.560]   King of the World.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.560]   But I remember Atari.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.640]   I was talking to Nolan Bushnell last week on triangulation.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:27.320]   And I vividly remember that everybody worked at Atari in the late '70s in Silicon Valley,
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.720]   King of the World.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.560]   You know, they're, you know, what did not stink.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:36.520]   They were very cocky and then it happens every time you see it over and over again.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.960]   It's almost like, it's an opera, it's operatic.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.360]   Well, that's why it's got to become, I mean, Yahoo must have been a little attractive.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.400]   I like the underdog.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:49.000]   I like the idea of having to come in someplace where, you know, people have basically given
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.880]   up on and there's a, I should add this to the show notes.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.920]   There's a core question then, which got posted a couple of months ago, but the question was,
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.960]   why would anyone ever work at Yahoo?
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:05.720]   And one of the Yahoo engineers or managers posting this really thoughtful, interesting,
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.920]   like long answer that was basically like when you, you know, just because the blogs and
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.240]   the media and whatever have decided to have written a company off doesn't mean that,
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.880]   you know, that there aren't sort of really interesting challenges and opportunities that,
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.680]   you know, maybe, you know, just because you're not, that your company isn't a media darling
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.240]   doesn't mean that, you know, there aren't good people there.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.760]   There aren't interesting challenges and that, you know, you get, you get opportunities
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.600]   to move up and move into positions.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:34.480]   Maybe that you wouldn't have a chance at, at companies that are, you know, very well established.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.680]   He thinks the geek does protest too much.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.680]   Okay.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:43.760]   I think that, you know, I've heard that and I respect it, but I think that's often, you
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.880]   know, who the hell is left at Yahoo?
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.320]   Not to denigrate anybody who's there, but, but the, oh, I'm going to go in there and
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.480]   do wonderful things without a leader, without a vision.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.080]   I'm not, I don't buy it.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.080]   Okay.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.080]   All right.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:01.040]   People I would call on your legal list, I would call Caterina fake and Stuart Murphy.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.040]   Yes.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.040]   In memo.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.040]   Yes.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.040]   I would call a camera in Marlow.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.040]   Yes.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:09.040]   All, you know, start naming those people, the people who shouldn't have left Yahoo, but
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.680]   had damn good reason to leave Yahoo.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.440]   Had a vision for it who had, who were there for some reason and said, oh, screw it.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.600]   And one of the better.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.600]   That's who I'd call.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   Fair enough.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.840]   I'm, was I wrote that answer and I thought interesting, but now, now that she's, it is
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.720]   the CEO and be interested to see, you know, what she, what she puts out there, if she
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:33.320]   puts out, out there, anything at all, I'll be, I bet that we're going to see some really
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.480]   interesting hires at Yahoo in the next few months.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.880]   She needs to have a question.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:42.480]   Leo, Leo, she comes to you and she says, I'm going to make a brand new world of TV.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.200]   I'm going to change the world of video.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.200]   I'm going to change everything.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.480]   I want to buy Twitter.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.480]   What do you say?
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.680]   If Terry Semmel had said that or Ross Levenson had said that, I'd say, yeah, if Marissa
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.040]   Meyer says something like that, you listen.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.960]   And you have some faith in her ability.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:03.480]   So okay, Gina, she comes to you and she says, I think that really giving people power
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.560]   over Twitter and all this stuff is really wonderful.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.360]   I want to buy a think up.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.600]   What do you, Neil, say?
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:15.560]   Well, I have to talk to a Neil, but let's say that I would be, I would be, I would love
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:20.480]   to, I would certainly consider working for her at some point, for sure.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.040]   Yeah, I would too.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:26.840]   I mean, I, I would, and that's the power of having somebody like that in there.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:31.000]   And the faith that I have, which may be completely misguided that Marissa sat down and made a
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.880]   plan that was exactly what she wants to do.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:38.720]   And now is going to execute and we're going to all watch with great interest.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:46.280]   By the way, $75 million, Marissa, that's my bottom line.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.520]   I was reading about dig.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.120]   Yeah, you should get a hundred.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.760]   I was reading about dig and I'll, we'll talk about this in a bit.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:59.560]   And you know, the dig, dig finally is completely dismantled and the articles and at one point,
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:05.120]   according to one of these articles, I'll see if I can find which one it was, Kevin Rose
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:11.880]   really wanted to sell dig to Rupert Murdoch, who was offering, I think $60 million, Rose
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:16.080]   would have gotten $36 million and the board wouldn't let him.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.800]   How long ago?
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:24.440]   A few years ago, a few years ago, the board wouldn't let him and which, and that happens,
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.440]   right?
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:29.440]   And Kevin, Kevin was apparently very, I don't know this, but in this article, it's
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.960]   said, Kevin was extremely frustrated by that.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.720]   And that's when he started dialing out a dig.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.640]   Yeah, I get that, but I also get not wanting to sell the news.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.920]   That, by the way, another business insider.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.120]   Great things have happened there.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.840]   You know, but he would have been smart, Hattie.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.840]   I mean, that was the peak.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.560]   He would have, it would have been his cash out.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.960]   But, but if you're really an entrepreneur believes in the company, do you sell it in
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.960]   news?
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.720]   Well, I, the reason I credit this story, and I don't know Matt Lindley or some of the
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:46:00.640]   people they quoted, but the reason I credit that is because it was shortly after that,
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.800]   the Kevin just basically started doing other stuff.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.040]   And I could see a founder saying, hey, we can tell, we can sell this.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.720]   I could make 36 million.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.120]   We could sell this to Murdoch.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.800]   This probably is before that is, you know, my space thing.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:21.040]   This was, let's see, 2000, apparently Yahoo.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.560]   Early in Dig's life cycle, a product person at Yahoo pulled Rosa side saying he felt
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.480]   they could sell the Yahoo for $40 million.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.280]   I remember, this is 2006.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.280]   What was that?
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.480]   Oh, God.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:37.440]   The screen saver app very early on.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.440]   Flying toasters.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.320]   No, no, no, no.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.920]   Where we, when your screensaver come up, it gave you news and content and all this great
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:44.920]   stuff.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.120]   Oh, point cast.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.120]   Point cast.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.240]   And they, as I remember, turned down, I think it was 400 million from news work.
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.920]   You got to know.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:56.600]   You got to know, cause, when to hold them, when to hold them.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.520]   Cause you hit the top and that's good time to sell.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:06.560]   Just I'm saying, as a, as a real estate owner in California, you got it.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.720]   Let's take a break and come back.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.360]   We could talk a little bit about Dig at the end of the line for Dig.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.280]   We also should, there's lots to talk about.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:17.480]   And some of it actually having to do with Google in, in just a little bit, including
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:23.000]   a kind of a sad story about the, the guy who really, in many ways created the idea of
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.440]   wearable glasses getting beat up by McDonald's for wearing glasses.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.480]   Anyway, we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.240]   But first, let's talk about stamps.com.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:37.360]   Wouldn't you like a way to print US postage, just print it yourself?
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.920]   Never imagine.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.720]   Never again, go to the post office to buy stamps or the ATM or the grocery store.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.960]   In fact, you don't even have to bring packages in.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   They would just come and take them.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.040]   If you're an eBay seller and Amazon seller, this is heaven, right?
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:53.600]   Do all your fulfillment right from your desk quickly, easily.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.920]   International money order or international mail orders, easy?
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:58.920]   Does it all?
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.360]   This is stamps.com.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.480]   Anything you can do, anything you can do at the post office, you can do from your desk
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:05.480]   with stamps.com.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:09.920]   You can buy and print officially US postage for any letter or package with your computer
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.760]   and your printer, no special anchor postage meter needed.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.680]   It's open 24/7, of course, because it is the internet.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:21.720]   You can get a digital scale and make sure you never spend more than you need to to mail
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.000]   something.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.720]   This is a really great solution.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.520]   You get discounts, you don't get it the post office loves this.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.920]   Post office would rather, we just all did this.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:35.960]   So they encourage it with 21% up to 21% off, express mail up to 15% off priority mail.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:39.080]   Free pickups, you can schedule at any time from your mail carrier.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.520]   Prints from QuickBooks.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.520]   Now here's the deal.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:45.120]   This is stamps.com and you can try this for free with a no risk trial offer.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:54.760]   Click that radio microphone and enter the offer code TWIG, TWIG, and the $80 bonus offer
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.280]   turns into a $110 bonus offer.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.440]   Here's what you get.
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:02.320]   $55 worth of postage coupons you can use over a period of time on stamps.com.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.160]   I think it's a few months.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.320]   You get the digital scale, you pay shipping and handling for that.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:09.640]   That's why I can't technically say it's a free offer because you pay $5 shipping and
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:10.640]   handling.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:14.960]   You get the free postage, you get the digital scale, you get a month trial of stamps.com
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.640]   and I think you're going to really see what a benefit.

[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.160]   The more you do, the less it costs.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:27.880]   Stamps.com and our promo code on this is TWIG.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.320]   Please use that so we get credit.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.320]   What?
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.520]   I'm shushing the cat.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.760]   I thought my mic was off.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.760]   Sorry.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.480]   Leo, I would never say that to you Leo.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.480]   I would never.
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.320]   Oh, Malick wrote a nice piece.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.040]   I thought a very nice piece.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.160]   Eulogizing a dig saying even in failure.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.160]   Yes.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.160]   That's clearly a failure.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.160]   $45 million in venture capital.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:57.040]   They sold off, I think a total of $16 million worth of stuff to the Washington Post.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.400]   LinkedIn bought their IP, the patents oddly enough.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:07.080]   BetaWorks, which is kind of a neat little news operation, bought for half a million dollars
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.200]   bought the dig assets.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:14.680]   I think Oum kind of made a good point where he said, "Hey, it's not whether they returned
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.400]   money to the investors, it's whether they reinvented the news business."
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.720]   Do you agree?
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.720]   Jeff Tarvis.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.920]   Gutenberg failed too.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:22.920]   Good point.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   So did the railroads.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:28.880]   I would speak, but it's exactly the same argument that sometimes visionaries do things
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:33.840]   that may make them rich or may not, but they definitely saw something others didn't see.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.720]   I think there's a big lesson in the difference between dig and Reddit.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:43.360]   Reddit had the courage to hand over more control to its public.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:49.840]   Reddit however to this day doesn't have much of a business model, but it grew while dig,
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:55.000]   pissed off its public with a few moves and couldn't recover from that.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:01.600]   But I think Kevin absolutely changed the way we look at the power of people.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:09.520]   The fact that social is now challenging search as a source of links and great measure comes
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.520]   from Kevin Rose.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.520]   Gina?
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.320]   Yeah, I would agree.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:19.600]   I mean, it's interesting that Reddit really kind of capitalized on digs, you know, failure.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.200]   What did I mean, dig's failure?
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.200]   What was it?
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.440]   Was that one redesign that things went really terribly wrong.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:29.400]   And it was my idea, by the way, I told Kevin to do it.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.680]   Kevin's brilliant product person.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.560]   He really is.
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:39.720]   And it's interesting that it's sort of coincided with him becoming a less engaged with the
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.280]   product.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.280]   But you know, it's funny.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:45.040]   My co-founder, Neil, is he's chatting at me right now.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.040]   And he says, all of Web 2.0 failed, but also had a huge impact.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:52.280]   So you can have a big impact and not necessarily cash out.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.280]   Just like what you said.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:59.760]   Well, he's prone to hyperbole, but we love him anyway.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.760]   That's something.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.760]   All right.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:07.400]   But yeah, no, I think dig was a really great idea.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:11.240]   And I think it had a huge effect on the web in general.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:17.640]   Well, you know, and I have a funny position on this because Kevin's a friend and I've
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.880]   known him since before.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:24.040]   And you know what the good news is he's now at Google Ventures doing what he really does
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:29.520]   well, which is picking winners.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.640]   And I think that that's a good move for him.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:34.040]   I'm kind of sad to see Diggova.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:37.040]   I look forward to seeing him design product, though, again.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.040]   I agree.
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.040]   He does beautiful stuff.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.040]   Less burned out.
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.040]   Yep.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.480]   And I use beta works news.me.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.760]   I think that's a kind of an email every day.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.240]   News.me is great.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:51.760]   And that's what they're going to apparently they're going to fold Digg into News.me.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:57.560]   So News.me was a combination of beta works and New York Times.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.240]   I want to know that.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:03.040]   And so now New York Times owns a piece of...
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.040]   Diggova.
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.600]   And an aggregator.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.120]   How interesting.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:13.920]   I actually like I get this email every day and it's stuff that my Facebook and Twitter
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:19.200]   friends have read or, you know, shared.
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:20.360]   It's the full-blown safety net.
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.120]   You know, it's like, oh, if I haven't looked at Twitter or Facebook and I went on vacation
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.520]   with my partner this weekend, it's like, if I haven't looked at Twitter or Facebook,
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.760]   I know I'm going to get an email with the links I should have seen.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:29.760]   Right.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.760]   And it's only five or something.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:31.760]   I mean, it's pretty quick.
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:32.760]   And then they have it...
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:33.760]   Yeah, it's pretty quick.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.760]   They have an iPhone app, which I actually haven't downloaded.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.880]   I just do the email thing.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:37.880]   So would that be interesting to see?
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.200]   I don't know what they get.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.200]   They don't get the patents.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.200]   They don't get the engineers.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.680]   There's still some audience.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.360]   They get the audience, I guess.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.360]   They get a critical mass.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:48.560]   There's some millions of people on audience.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.520]   Oh, it was what?
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.520]   500K?
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.000]   It's not that much.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.840]   Oh, well, 500K plus equity in this new venture.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:59.440]   Now here's an interesting coenkey-dink.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:03.920]   The guy who was approaching Dig to buy them for $60 million for Rupert Murdoch was Ross
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.920]   Levinson.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:05.920]   It's Levinson.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:06.920]   That's right.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:07.920]   It's a small world.
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:13.160]   It's a very small world.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:15.680]   Former interim CEO at Yahoo.
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:18.160]   So here's a story that just grabbed me.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.920]   I don't really know what really happened.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.480]   It could be more complicated than that.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:28.960]   But we all know Steve Mann, for years at MIT, he was a guy who created this thing of walking
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:32.000]   around with a camera on you, right?
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:41.360]   And he still does, which I didn't realize, wrote on his blog that he was wearing his device.
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:43.160]   Now, he claims, and this is interesting.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:52.440]   He has a doctor's note for this because it is more than just glass-style camera on him.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:56.720]   He's worn a computer vision system for 34 years.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:01.360]   And he says, "It's necessary for my cognitive functions.
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:04.240]   I need it.
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.120]   It's more than just..."
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.360]   So he carried around.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:12.720]   He had carrying around with him documentation, including a letter from his doctor about what
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.160]   all of this was.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:22.000]   He toured Paris, went into a number of museums and places where you're not allowed to wear
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.720]   cameras or glasses.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:26.800]   Never was challenged.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.000]   Never asked for anything.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   It goes into the Paris McDonald's on the Champs-Élysées with his glasses on.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.200]   They say, "What are you doing?"
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:39.560]   And he said, "You know, he showed him the documentation.
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:40.720]   Okay.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.720]   They ordered.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:48.000]   He was there with his kids, sat down, and then all of a sudden he gets roughed up by McDonald's
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   employees.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.440]   The funny thing is that he says, "Because I was wearing these glasses and they damaged
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:56:00.520]   them, the pictures that were taken which would have otherwise not been saved were saved."
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.000]   So he has pictures of the McDonald's employees.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.920]   Now, this is a no pictures McDonald's a couple of years ago.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:10.320]   Somebody got roughed up for taking a picture of the menu.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.520]   They've really got to wise up.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.600]   Not the customers, the companies.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.400]   Here's a picture of one of the McDonald's employees tearing up his doctor's letter.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:20.800]   This is very Parisian.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:24.680]   A speed on your letter.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.080]   Tearing it up.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:31.400]   And then the guy's wearing McDonald's name tag, Steve looks at it and he turns it over.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.800]   So you can't read it.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.960]   All of this captured on the camera.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:39.240]   Steve says, "I don't want money, but they broke the glasses when they tore them off
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:43.880]   my head and I just want them to fix the glasses."
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:47.920]   McDonald's has not responded except to say, "We are investigating."
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.720]   I just wanted to...
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.720]   Geek bullying.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:53.720]   Geek bullying.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:58.840]   Now, a couple of things we don't know the actual, we know Steve's side of the story, who knows.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:04.640]   But if we're all going to be wearing Google Glass in the next few years, something's got
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:05.640]   to happen here.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:08.240]   This is what you're going to look forward to.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:10.200]   Do not come in and say.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:13.440]   France and Germany may be a little dicey for wear and I don't know.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:15.440]   They all become a street view.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:16.480]   Do you think this is a private?
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:20.000]   I mean, that's what people are paying me about and said, "What do you think?"
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.120]   You know, because we don't know enough to know what it is.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.120]   But it would certainly stand a reason.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.360]   What else are you objecting to?
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.360]   And why, what is it?
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.360]   A military installation.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.960]   It's a McDonald's for crying out loud.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.800]   What is it you're worried about people finding out?
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:40.040]   I casino, you know, I've, well, I almost got beat up by a casino, big casino security
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:44.080]   guy because we were walking through the casino with our cameras on the way to an event at
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.720]   CES last year.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:51.560]   And I had a great camera guy Hilton who just played along and he pointed the camera at
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.600]   the ground and we just kept walking.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:57.840]   And they don't, they're, I understand a casino doesn't want you to take any pictures
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:58.840]   in a casino.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:00.440]   I understand that in his private property.
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:02.840]   They have the right to do that.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:06.400]   But they don't have the right to rip these things off your head.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:11.120]   I tried to take a picture at a KFC in China, just because I was interested in Western restaurants
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:15.600]   in Beijing and I was quickly several employees, sort of quickly sit down.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.280]   I, yeah, I said no, no photos.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.600]   Why not?
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:20.600]   I respected that.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:25.080]   I mean, you know, government is all cameras everywhere, of course.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.160]   I've been stopped in Starbucks.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:30.120]   I understand their right to do that.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:34.280]   Is it to protect the privacy of other customers?
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:35.280]   I don't think so.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:41.280]   I think it's more that, that they fear that it's going to be a corporate espionage or,
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:45.040]   um, I don't know.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:49.000]   Get over it because everyone on earth is going to have a camera very soon.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.160]   Well, and, and people like Thomas Hawk, who documents this all the time.
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:58.320]   I mean, it's, even though it's technically legal to shoot pictures in public, gets harassed
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.320]   all the time.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.720]   Uh, by the police.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.120]   So I just don't, I don't know.
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.080]   Oh yeah, gosh.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:10.040]   It's a, it's, in fact, most people who have been photographers, who have been taking pictures
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:13.640]   in public places have stories to tell.
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:14.640]   It's post 9/11.
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:17.560]   People are very paranoid.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:18.560]   And you're right.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.560]   There's cameras everywhere.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:20.560]   The government has plenty of cameras.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.720]   Yeah, China, I just was like, you know what?
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.200]   I don't want to get carted off right now.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:28.000]   I'm going to talk this up to a cultural, uh, and I think the thing to do if you were
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.120]   asked in a private place, the problem is he, these things are like almost welded into
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:33.120]   his head.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:35.040]   They cannot be taken off his head without tools.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.040]   Right.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:40.160]   But what he should have done is grabbed his food and said, okay, I'm sorry and leave,
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.640]   but never, because it is, they're right, but they shouldn't be ripping them off your head
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.120]   for crying out loud.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.160]   Survey says, I don't know about surveys.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:53.280]   This is from search engine land, Danny Sullivan, quoting the annual American customer satisfaction
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.280]   index.
[00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:01.600]   Bing has practically matched Google for customer satisfaction, but just to show that this is
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:05.920]   meaningless ask.com is a close third.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:12.320]   82 points for Google, 81 points for Bing, 80 points for ask.com.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.160]   Who uses ask.com?
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:19.960]   Some of the really old browser and a really old tool bar installed.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.200]   Yahoo got 78 points.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.800]   In fact, I'm going to throw this out.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.800]   This is crazy.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.840]   I have a hot Bing tip later on with show those.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:35.680]   Oh, are you still using duck duck go and Bing?
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:36.680]   I am.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.640]   I'm still using duck to go.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.640]   Interesting.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.640]   I switched to Google sometimes.
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.360]   You know, there are times when DDG doesn't pull, doesn't give me what I, when I'm looking
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:48.780]   for, but yeah, I would say 90% of the time it's just fine.
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:52.440]   Most of my searches are, it's a very programmer friendly search engine.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:57.620]   Most of my searches are for code related, you know, error messages or code documentation,
[01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.620]   and it does very well on that.
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:00.620]   Yeah.
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:03.260]   Anybody still use cool or BLECO?
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.740]   It's cool even alive.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:06.740]   I think it's cool.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:07.740]   I don't know.
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:08.740]   I think it's cool.
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:09.740]   The series engine you can't spell.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.740]   See you.
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:11.740]   I know.
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:14.300]   Yeah, there's cool, cool.
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.100]   That comm is not.
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.020]   That's the greatest piece of Valley hubris ever.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.980]   That's real hubris.
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:23.220]   You don't know how to spell it, but we're going to do it.
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.740]   Not only that, but they were going to take over the world.
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:27.140]   They were going to go, was toast.
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:28.140]   Right.
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:31.140]   The Wikipedia page, current status down.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.140]   Down.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.860]   You go to cool.com, you get nothing.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:39.220]   Not even a so long and thanks for all the fish.
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.620]   Google fiber launches next week.
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:45.780]   They made a big deal of course about the gigabit fiber that they were going to install.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:46.780]   Here is it Kansas City?
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.780]   Kansas City.
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:52.580]   Kansas City, Missouri or Kansas City, Kansas, Missouri, right?
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:57.500]   K C M O.
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.140]   Pretty cool.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:02.100]   This is Google's way of saying, hey, if you had lots of bandwidth, this is what it would
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:03.340]   be like.
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:08.740]   Just last week, Time Warner Cable in Kansas City placed posters around its headquarters,
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:13.500]   asking employees to provide any information they hear about Google fiber.
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:21.780]   Hey, if you are here, Google isn't, if you hear anything, let us know.
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:26.620]   We don't know, but we want to know what's going on.
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.580]   Sad.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:33.980]   So they selected them in March and they're about to Google send out invitations to a
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:41.020]   special event on July 26th in Kansas City, a special announcement about Google fiber
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:42.820]   in the next chapter of the internet.
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.500]   Everybody's just jealous as hell.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.820]   That's all I can say.
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:50.580]   But they say they'll do it in other cities sometime.
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:53.900]   Maybe Yahoo should do the get the fiber business.
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:59.180]   Google plus maker camp targeting tech savvy teens.
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:00.860]   They're doing this with make magazine.
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:01.860]   This is so smart.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:06.060]   A six week online summer camp for 13 to 18 year olds.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:09.020]   They'll try to build 30 projects in 30 days.
[01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:11.220]   Mark Fronfelter will be there.
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.420]   Steven and Fritz of EP bird.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:15.260]   Those are the coconutos guys.
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.700]   Is it in person or is it virtual?
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:21.140]   Yeah, no, it's a women beginning today.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:26.500]   A make camp counselor will post how to instructions for a new project online.
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.140]   Is it a Google plus?
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.540]   Yeah, it's maker camp on Google plus.
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.940]   So it's like their hangouts and.
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:37.340]   Yeah, I couldn't figure out how you could apply for it and go like tomorrow.
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:38.340]   Welcome campers maker.
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:39.340]   This is so cool.

[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:42.140]   Yeah.

[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.940]   OK, now I'm following them.
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:48.980]   You know, with brands, you don't have to circle them.
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:49.980]   You just.
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:50.980]   You just follow them.
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:54.180]   Oh, so they do the hangouts on air and they were, you know, hands is great.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:58.340]   They did the hangouts on air so you can watch maker camp day three with terrariums.
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.460]   Oh, fun.
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:01.460]   So this is great.
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:04.060]   A kid can stay home and not have to go to camp but still do some.
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:07.060]   Bob, will you go on by me three hundred dollars for the equipment so I can make this
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.060]   thing?
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.060]   I need some moss.
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:11.060]   I need some dirt.
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.060]   Mason jar terrariums fun.
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:16.020]   Well, terrariums are also type of biosphere.
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.580]   This is just kind of like a very.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.580]   So awesome.
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:20.580]   So awesome.
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:28.060]   But terrarium when you think terrarium, this is what you don't necessarily think of like,
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:30.700]   you know, science experiments that you without.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.700]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:32.700]   The show is over.
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.220]   I want to watch this and make it terrarium.
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:35.220]   Terrarium.
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.380]   Yeah, that's a boss.
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:43.100]   But the day before they learned how to make what were they making?
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:48.300]   They have this is weird science Wednesday today.
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:49.300]   This is so cool.
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.140]   They're doing animated GIFs.

[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:57.140]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.140]   Yeah.
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:59.140]   That's a useful thing to know on Google plus.
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:00.500]   No, not more of them.
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:03.140]   But it's what is teaching kids is animation, right?
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:04.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:05.820]   That's really cool.
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:07.420]   Anchoring Tuesday.
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:11.740]   And they had frog designs, Jared Ficklin doing the lesson.
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:12.740]   This is neat.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:13.740]   So it's not too late.
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:19.460]   You just you can just join just follow make, M-A-K-E on Google plus.
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:20.620]   You can be a pod.

[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:31.100]   You'll have to provide your own dirt and tent and softball games and make your own lanyards
[01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:33.100]   on your own.
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.100]   I'm envisioning Twitcamp.
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.100]   Good idea.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.100]   Oh.
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.100]   Good idea.
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.100]   All right.
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:43.540]   We're going to take a break and then Jeff and Gina and I will talk about our new toy.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.540]   Mm.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:45.540]   Yeah.
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:47.460]   Even MG Seagler like this.
[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:48.460]   Even MG.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:49.460]   Wow.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:52.300]   We'll talk about in just a second, but first a word from Ford.
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:55.940]   You know, this is what's in this is kind of interesting, this kind of thing by this.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:01.580]   This would work very well in your new Ford because it's got Bluetooth, a 2DP and so forth.
[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:05.340]   You could tie it in with the Ford automobile.
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.180]   See what Ford sees.
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.420]   This was a very interesting challenge.
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:09.420]   Here you are.
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:11.340]   You're making a car which is going to last years, right?
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:14.620]   People are going to own that for, I don't know, my own mine car for 10 years.
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:17.500]   So 10 years from now, what's technology going to even look like?
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:21.060]   So how do you design a car that could keep up to date?
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.260]   And they're thinking about all sorts of stuff.
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:23.660]   I asked them about upgrade ability.
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:27.340]   Said, yeah, we're thinking about upgrade modules, software upgrades.
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:31.540]   But what they realized is if you make the car a platform, you give it.
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:36.940]   All the sensors and tools and stuff and an API, then developers can develop stuff on portable
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:39.020]   devices like tablets or phones.
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:42.780]   And then when you get in the car, you're bringing more smarts that can interface with
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:43.780]   the car.
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:44.780]   Brilliant.
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:51.180]   And that's why if you go to Ford.com/technology, you can take a look at some of the interesting
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:54.420]   things they're doing with Ford with AppLink.
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:59.580]   And they even have a demo app called MyFordMobile.
[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:03.820]   It's a smart phone app for Android, iOS, and for BlackBerry, too.
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:08.420]   If we go to the 2012 Ford Focus, that's the first car it works with right now.
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:09.420]   You can find out more.
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:10.420]   There's a video here.
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:13.900]   They talk about the charging station, the super fast charging they do.
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:16.060]   They talk about the regenerative braking.
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:19.740]   They even have, I love this, they have driver's ed.
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:22.940]   This is not part of the app, but I'm going to say it anyway because it's really cool
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:27.500]   where you learn how to use things like regenerative braking.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:34.500]   You've got a brake coach in the car that helps you maximize the range of your focus.
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:38.140]   Because all of these instrument clusters are soft, they're just screens so they can put
[01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:40.900]   stuff like a brake coach up there.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:44.220]   So anyway, back to the MyFordMobile app.
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:47.180]   It lets you monitor your charge of your focus electric.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:53.340]   It lets you schedule your charging so that you can do it at the most affordable times,
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:55.420]   according to your utility.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:59.980]   It provides you with the location of your vehicle, the location of the nearest charging
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.220]   station, the most efficient route to get there.
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:05.420]   Oh, it's so pretty.
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:09.420]   It even estimates the amount of CO2 emissions and the money you've saved on your driving
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:14.100]   style and helps you coach you to a more efficient driving style.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:17.340]   This is, I think, a proof of concept as much as anything else to show that you can make
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:20.500]   apps that just talk to the car or the car talks back.
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.500]   Very cool stuff.
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.780]   Now, how would you find out about this?
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:28.300]   Or you can go to Ford.com/technology or look for an EV certified Ford dealer near you and
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:34.020]   say, "I want to test drive the Focus Electric, the 2012 Ford Focus Electric, and bring your
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.780]   smart phone."
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:36.780]   Then you can put the app on there.
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:37.780]   The app's free.
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:40.300]   They even have a MyFordMobile website and all sorts of stuff.
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:43.060]   Leaderboards, that kind of stuff.
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:45.820]   Ford.com/technology.
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:52.780]   So MG Seagler, who is, as we all know, really nice guy, good friend and kind of a Mac fanatic
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:56.020]   and loves the iPad beyond old words.
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:09:02.220]   I would include Andy Inako as another guy who's said for a long time, "The iPad is the
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.220]   best.
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:04.220]   There's nothing that can beat it.
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:05.700]   Android's not close."
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:12.460]   Even Andy Inako, I know, is now carrying a Galaxy S3 Android phone and likes it a lot.
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:16.140]   Andy and MG both are singing the praises of this.
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:21.140]   This is the Galaxy Nexus 7, a tablet from Google.
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:24.980]   And you, Gina, got yours at Google I/O.
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:25.980]   Google I/O, yes.
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:28.700]   A little bit of the ones Google I/O have the white back.
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:29.700]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:30.700]   I said the word "Galaxy."
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:31.700]   There's no Galaxy.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:32.700]   That's Samsung.
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:33.700]   Just the Nexus 7.
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:37.820]   I just, the two words are bonded in my mind.
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:38.820]   The Nexus 7.
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:39.820]   This is a awesome device.
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:45.140]   I love you that people who've been in the iOS world for a long time, like MG appreciate
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.140]   it.
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:49.380]   I've kind of been embedded in the Android world for a while and I couldn't tell if I'm just
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:59.020]   relieved because Android hasn't been fantastic up until now or if it truly is great.
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:02.780]   So it's nice to see people like MG who have been very highly critical of Android.
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:03.780]   They like it.
[01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:04.780]   It's a great device.
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:05.780]   I love it.
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:06.780]   I can't keep my hands off this thing.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:07.780]   I haven't touched my iPad.
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:09.940]   I find myself reaching for it all the time.
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:10.940]   It's just a great device.
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:15.020]   And all of my iPad stuff works with it too on my keyboard and stylus.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.020]   I don't know.
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:17.020]   What do you think, Leo?
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.020]   You've had it for a few days now.
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.020]   I completely agree.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:22.660]   Andy Anacos says Google just released a $199 computer.
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:26.140]   That's the first thing you marvel at.
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:29.100]   This is a quad-core Tegra 3 processor.
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.060]   Super fast.
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:38.060]   It's a beautiful, high-def IPS screen with great off-angle viewing.
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.140]   Not quite retina.
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:41.620]   Not quite retina.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.620]   But I think it's over 200 DPI.
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:44.620]   It's good.
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:45.620]   It's good, right?
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:46.620]   Yep.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.780]   Very snappy.
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:50.100]   And this is what MG noted.
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:55.180]   It really establishes that a 7-inch tablet is a good form factor.
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:11:00.900]   It may be superior even to the 4x3 10-inch iPad.
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.620]   I wish it would go landscape.
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:03.620]   It does.
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:05.740]   All you have to do is tap this button.
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.260]   Oh, not on the home screen.
[01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:08.260]   The home screen doesn't.
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:14.380]   But if you're like, let's say we're Google+, this is just getting used to jelly bean.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.860]   You tap what?
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:21.100]   When you slide down the notifications, there's a little rotator there that you can lock or
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:22.500]   unlock.
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.180]   And the default, by the way, is locked.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.340]   And now if I slide it up again, it should.
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:29.180]   I do need remedial help with these things always.
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:36.460]   And by the way, I love the way Google+, when you're in portrait mode, scrolls up.
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:39.580]   And when you're in landscape mode.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:40.580]   And it's beautiful.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.900]   Yeah, that was really nice.
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:42.900]   It's beautiful.
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:43.900]   Jeff, don't feel bad.
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:47.420]   I accidentally locked the orientation just by pulling down the notifications.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:49.500]   And I didn't realize that I had done it.
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:52.700]   And I answered a question on Quora about whether or not this thing could be a GPS.
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:55.620]   And I said, oh, the maps is portrait only, which was completely wrong.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.620]   I just locked it.
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:00.220]   Don't feel bad.
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:03.660]   The text is-- I've been using it all day.
[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:06.140]   The text is a little small for my age of eyes.
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:07.140]   I can't find where to--
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.140]   Yeah, you can change that too.
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:09.140]   I hate to tell you.
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:12.300]   OK, got to make a bigger check.
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.620]   We'll give you a little in-service.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:20.580]   That is part of the insight, though, about a non-Apple.
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:22.020]   It's a little harder to find those.
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.500]   You've got to dig around a little bit.
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:27.380]   I mean, that rotation lock is very obscure.
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:29.940]   It's a tiny little icon.
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:31.860]   And then drop down of the notifications.
[01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:33.020]   That's really where you put it.
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:36.820]   And one of the complaints I had about ice cream sandwich, which--
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:41.140]   and it holds up through jelly bean, is things like that.
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:44.340]   That's how you get to settings on this, is you pull down notifications and there's
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:46.220]   a tiny little settings icon.
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:48.620]   That, to me, is not the best user interface.
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:49.620]   But that's OK.
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:54.540]   I really liked it all day.
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:55.820]   What else about it?
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:59.700]   I think what it motivates me to do, finally, is I have my iPhone still.
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:03.900]   I'm still on Apple, Calendar, and Mail.
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:10.780]   I'm finally going to really make the switch and go full Android Google on all these functions.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:12.300]   I've got the Kindle app on here.
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:15.740]   This is a perfect size for book reading.
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:17.420]   You don't need the bigger size, I think.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.540]   Yeah, you can lay in bed.
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:19.300]   It's light enough.
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:22.620]   You can hold it with one hand and read, which is really nice.
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:24.340]   I'm going to make a Skype call.
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:25.900]   Can I make a Skype call to--
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:30.420]   let me-- what I want to know is whether I can get on the show with it.
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:31.420]   You might be able to.
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:32.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:39.380]   And considering that I'm always in desperate straits and the Tanzania trying to get on.
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:40.380]   You should be able to.
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:42.660]   Now, it doesn't have a back camera.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:45.100]   It does have a front camera.
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.260]   And the front camera works for Hangouts.
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.860]   Skype says, well, we don't know anything about this device.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:52.700]   We think it'll work.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:53.700]   But let me try it.
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:54.700]   I haven't tried it.
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:57.260]   So, OK, let me see if I have line three here.
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:59.140]   I'll put-- go down to my context.
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:00.700]   Don't show this yet.
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:05.460]   Jeff, if you go into settings, accessibility, there is a large text checkbox.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.940]   It's the old guy's setting.
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:10.940]   It's in the old guy's setting.
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:13.380]   All right, so I am now calling Skype.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:16.780]   They make that accessible-- I mean, no offense to accessibility.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.780]   Geez.
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:18.780]   Couldn't--
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:20.900]   Oh, it's a blocked contact.
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:21.900]   I can't call you apparently.
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.020]   Oh, you know, this might be old.
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.220]   You call me.
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.220]   I'm chief twit.
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.220]   Got it.
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:28.220]   Ooh, it's awfully big.
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:32.220]   But all right.
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:33.660]   What is-- oh, I love.
[01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:37.060]   And I should-- this is the biggest new thing that you can only get in Jelly Bean, Google
[01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:38.260]   Now.
[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:42.300]   And that was the thing where I was talking about the creepy factor like Google Now knows
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:45.220]   that you like the Giants because you've been searching for them.
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.820]   So this is a Google Now.
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:52.500]   You can see-- now, I'm going to show you Google Now, but you can-- oh, wait a minute.
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:53.500]   Somebody's calling me.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.500]   Let's see.
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.060]   I'll answer with video.
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:59.500]   Now, will you see-- there's me.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.460]   There's me looking at me.
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:04.100]   Now can you go to line three and show me?
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.100]   Yep.
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.100]   One second.
[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:08.900]   I'll turn down the audio.
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:11.820]   And so we-- this is the video we're getting from you.
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:12.820]   So yeah, you can.
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:13.820]   I went off.
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:15.180]   If I flip it, will it-- oh, yeah, it does.
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:16.180]   That's pretty good.
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:17.180]   That's pretty good.
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:25.660]   They're laughing because I'm making.
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.500]   I'm mugging.
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:31.540]   But the fact that you can use Skype with this means you can use this for phone calls.
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:32.540]   That's huge.
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:34.740]   If you're on one file, right.
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:35.740]   Right.
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:36.740]   No 3G.
[01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:37.940]   That's kind of a negative.
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:39.740]   Yeah, it is.
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:40.740]   It's been nice to me.
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:42.940]   It's hard to be an option, but I think to make it simpler.
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:44.940]   I went ahead and bought the larger version.
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.980]   I bought the 16 gig version.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:47.980]   Why not?
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:53.180]   Now, one of the things I've noted-- people say, well, Apple has 64 gigs.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:56.420]   So much of this is in the cloud that you don't necessarily-- like, for instance, Google
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:58.460]   Music, you're playing from the cloud.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:15:59.460]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:00.460]   And you're on Wi-Fi anyway.
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:05.140]   So the things that normally we would have loaded this up with video, audio, you just
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.140]   play off the internet on one.
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:08.060]   It's up for the airplane.
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:09.860]   Yeah, for the airplane, you're right.
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:10.860]   Right.
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:12.860]   You can download from Play Store.
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:13.860]   You can download.
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.220]   I've got another remedial question for you.
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:17.780]   So yes, I said yes, of course, to Google now.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:21.940]   But I've got this-- I still have my perennial problem of two accounts.
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:26.900]   So my account for this is my basic Gmail account.
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:30.060]   But my Buzz Machine account, I'd like to make that the one for Google now, and I can't
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:32.380]   figure out how to switch it.
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:33.380]   You can add an account.
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.380]   Can you add more than--
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.380]   You added the account in settings.
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:40.820]   Oh, so you want Google now to work with that other--
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:43.620]   That's where I'm going to have my calendar and all that stuff.
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:44.620]   Yeah.
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:48.060]   So this is Google now just for people who want to see.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:50.500]   So let me start over again.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.860]   You have the search box at the top.
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:57.100]   If you tap the microphone, you'll do an audio search.
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:59.980]   But this is recent Google searches from any machine.
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:04.180]   So these researchers I did in my laptop, but it synchronized them over.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:07.180]   Cards show here when you need them.
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:10.660]   So this is my next appointment, triangulation coming up with even up dinner for Raspberry
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:11.660]   Pi.
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.780]   Seven minutes, normal traffic.
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:15.100]   Do you care about traffic to this place?
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:17.100]   Yes, I do.
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:18.100]   This is work.
[01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:19.100]   So I'm going to say work.
[01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.100]   This is the first time it's asked me that.
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:22.620]   So that's good.
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:24.980]   That's my workplace.
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.740]   Here's the current weather report.
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:29.220]   And I know it's going to be 91 degrees on Saturday.
[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:30.220]   That's useful.
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.700]   Here's some sample cards.
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:34.820]   So this isn't really-- I kind of like this.
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:36.380]   I like it too, but I'm not getting enough out of it.
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:39.940]   And when I do try to switch to my apps account, it just goes to a blank search page because
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:40.940]   there's no cards at all.
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:42.940]   I don't know you.
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:48.140]   Oh, so in settings in Google now, you set the in-privacy accounts.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.300]   You did choose the other account.
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.300]   That's interesting.
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:51.300]   Yeah.
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.140]   And it doesn't like me there.
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:55.100]   You can by hand, I guess, put in a team.
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.140]   All right, so I'm going to switch to my other account.
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:58.140]   It says, are you in?
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.140]   Yes, I'm in.
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:02.340]   It tells me I'm in San Diego, what the weather is.
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:05.140]   I just think this could get better and better.
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:06.140]   Yeah.
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.140]   Yeah.
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:11.460]   797, 20 says you have to enable it in your Google Apps settings, Jeff.
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:12.460]   Oh, thank you very much.
[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:14.340]   I have to enable Google now.
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:16.620]   In your apps, apparently.
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:18.380]   I don't know if he's making that up.
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:20.100]   Did it prompt you and say, do you want to turn this on?
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:21.980]   I had to tap, like, yes, I'm in.
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:22.980]   Right.
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:24.860]   In fact, I tap no by accident.
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:28.780]   And then I had to search around to find out how to turn it back on, but it's in the settings.
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:33.260]   And Leo, you saw that from the lock screen, you get into now by kind of just--
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:34.260]   Oh.
[01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:36.820]   --by dragging out the lock.
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:37.820]   And then Google is right there.
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:38.820]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:41.940]   See, I have a pattern on that, so I don't get to see a lot.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:42.940]   Ah, OK.
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:46.740]   I wish they could-- they would allow you that kind of functionality and the pattern.
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:48.660]   Right, right.
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:50.420]   Face recognition is in this.
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:52.860]   Front facing camera enables that.
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:53.860]   That's a gimmick.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:56.060]   I don't recommend it necessarily.
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:57.260]   Just nice, really nice.
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:00.860]   And you can see why the rumors are that Apple's going to make a 7-inch tablet, or in their
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:03.700]   case, 7, almost 8 inches.
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:04.700]   There's this going to be square, though.
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:06.180]   I think this is exactly what you want.
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.780]   You could put this in a pocket, a back pocket, stuff like that.
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:12.660]   What strikes me is that there is no right size.
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:13.660]   That we're dancing around.
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:14.660]   Right.
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.660]   You know, there just is no right size.
[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:16.660]   Right.
[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:21.220]   And that's where I think we've got to get to the next level of displays.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:23.020]   And that's where glass comes in.
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.020]   Right.
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.580]   That's where bendable displays will come in and things like that.
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:30.620]   Because in some ways, this feels cramped to me for certain purposes.
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:33.060]   In other ways, it feels just right to me.
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:41.180]   And the difference between this and a 5-inch, you know, isn't that huge?
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:43.780]   Different strokes, different needs, different folks.
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:46.620]   Flipboard looks great on this.
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:49.500]   This is no longer exclusive to the Galaxy S3.
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:50.860]   It's just really fantastic.
[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:52.980]   Yeah, I couldn't be happier.
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:56.140]   I spent a lot of time in bed with this last night.
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:20:00.020]   Which was a stat I saw, by the way, on Twitter yesterday, I forget who had it, that most,
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:01.860]   I think it was from the Fortune Conference.
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:07.340]   The most, the highest level of tablet activity is 10-15 at night.
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:09.340]   Yeah, that sounds like a right.
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:10.340]   Which I was responded.
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:11.340]   Yeah.
[01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:12.340]   Bored.
[01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:14.740]   Not that I would do that, but...
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.300]   I've got chess games going on.
[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:18.740]   I mean, this is exactly the right size.
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:23.140]   This is the computer you want in your hands when there's dumb TV on, and you just kind
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:26.860]   of your half-thing attention, you want to read, and you know, multitask.
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:28.260]   And it's so light.
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:29.260]   It feels very...
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.780]   There's a lot more casual to me than the iPad.
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:33.700]   The iPad just feels kind of heavier and colder.
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:35.860]   It's got more weight to it.
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:37.660]   This just feels more just like a book.
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:40.420]   And can I just say, again, $200.
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:41.420]   $200.
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:44.420]   That's less than a netbook.
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:46.100]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:49.660]   And a rock-solid Linux-based operating system.
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:50.660]   Yep.
[01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:53.580]   There's a lot to recommend this.
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:56.180]   And hundreds of thousands of apps?
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:57.180]   Yeah.
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:59.660]   Yeah, the apps are there now.
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:00.660]   You really can't...
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:04.140]   The argument that the apps that you want aren't on Android just doesn't hold as much
[01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:05.860]   water anymore.
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:09.780]   It costs less than an iPod classic.
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:14.020]   That's a very good analogy, Chad Johnson.
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:17.220]   The iPod classic is $249.
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:19.140]   Wow.
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.500]   That says a lot.
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.060]   This is amazing.
[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:25.140]   Battery life, I've got 15 hours and 15 minutes on battery.
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:26.140]   60%.
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:27.140]   That can't be right.
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:29.580]   Mine didn't charge last night.
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:30.580]   Much like a...
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:31.780]   I think that that's wrong.
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:33.820]   I think I charged it in between there.
[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:36.140]   But I would say eight or nine hours, for sure.
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:37.940]   Not a problem.
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:40.100]   Screen is what uses most of it.
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:44.180]   Very, very medium battery life for the battery usage for everything else.
[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:45.180]   It's a screen.
[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:46.180]   And Mac Chrome.
[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:47.380]   Chrome on Android is awesome.
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:49.420]   And it's just not as good on iOS.
[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:50.420]   It's got...
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:51.420]   No, this is so cool.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:52.420]   Yeah.
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:54.260]   It's got that magnification.
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:57.900]   When you tap in an area where the links are real close, it magnifies.
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:21:58.900]   And so you can tap...
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:02.100]   So you don't ever tap to the wrong place.
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.460]   That request desktop site is so great.
[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:05.460]   Isn't that great?
[01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:09.060]   When you get redirected to this crappy mobile site, you just say to request desktop site,
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:13.340]   you get exactly what you get in your desktop and the syncing the tabs across computers.
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:18.980]   Now, Android for Chrome for Android, you don't need the Nexus 7.
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:22.780]   You can get it on any version of Android, I think, maybe as far back as Gingerbread.
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:27.340]   But the fact that it's the default browser on Jelly Bean and it's on this beautiful,
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:28.340]   bigger screen.
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:29.860]   Man, I just been loving it.
[01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:30.860]   So great.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:32.020]   Now, I heavily customized mine.
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:34.780]   It took off all the content consumption widgets.
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:37.540]   But when you get it out of the box, it shows magazines.
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:40.380]   It shows TV, it shows movies, it shows books.
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:42.340]   That was a little bit of...
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:43.340]   That reminds me of the...
[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:44.340]   It looked like the fire.
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:45.340]   It looked like the fire.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:48.820]   Yeah, well, it reminded me of the days of getting the crap where you got on computers
[01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:49.900]   all the time.
[01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:50.900]   And there's some...
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:53.740]   Well, this is a Play Store buying device.
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:54.740]   I mean, this is...
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:57.100]   Let's just be clear about what this is.
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:58.580]   They want you to buy stuff from the Play Store.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:05.660]   And let's also be frank, the Play Store's movies and TV selection is not great.
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:07.660]   No, right.
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:08.660]   But they're making...
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:12.980]   This is Google making a bet on the future that you're in me buying this media.
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:16.660]   I mean, I installed the Kindle app and I'm reading my Kindle books.
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:18.300]   And I want it.
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:19.300]   You get a credit...
[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:22.620]   Did you get a credit to the Play Store, the $25 Play Store credit?
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:23.620]   What was that?
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:24.620]   No, that was for you guys.
[01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:26.220]   But I think we did get some free content.
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:28.220]   I'm looking at Transformers Dark Side of the Moon.
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:29.220]   I got a credit to it.
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:30.220]   Did you?
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:31.220]   All right, maybe I did a nice demo.
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:32.220]   Yeah.
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:36.060]   So they want you to set up your account and have the purchasing experience and get some
[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:38.060]   media onto it.
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.700]   I mean, on Google Music, I really wasn't using it before.
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:43.220]   But now that it's on the 7, I am using it.
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:45.980]   Yeah, because all your music, it's amazing.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:49.180]   Logging all your music is available on your thing already.
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.740]   It's all your music.
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:51.740]   Yeah.
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:55.220]   Someone in the chat room pointed out that Chrome is 4.0, Android 4.0, and a Bob.
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:56.220]   Oh, that's right.
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:57.220]   That's too bad.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:58.220]   I see a set up.
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.220]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:01.580]   So this is not the Android experience that most people are having.
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:02.580]   But this is...
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:06.460]   For people who've been curious about Android, I mean, certainly not our listeners, viewers,
[01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:09.900]   but people who would be curious about Android, $200, no contract.
[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:10.900]   This is...
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:12.460]   Yeah, I think we're going to see a lot more developers.
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:14.420]   Take the larger screen more seriously.
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:15.420]   This is no Zoom.
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.780]   This is no tab.
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:20.340]   This is a serious Android tablet.
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:23.380]   And so I think we're going to see a lot more apps in the next few months come out just
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:24.380]   for this thing.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:27.460]   Very exciting.
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:31.620]   I think this is a breakthrough product.
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:35.020]   And I don't think this is the last $200 computer we're going to see.
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:41.220]   And it's thanks to the free and open Linux operating system that this can even exist.
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:42.700]   Yep.
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:43.700]   And Google.
[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:44.700]   Thanks to Google.
[01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:46.180]   Apparently has a magnetic sensor.
[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:51.420]   Is that what this thing is on the lower left-hand side, the four copper dots?
[01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:52.740]   Is that a magnetic sensor?
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:53.740]   Is that a charging?
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:54.740]   I don't think so.
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:56.900]   That looks like a charging thing.
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:57.900]   Not clear what that is.
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:03.060]   You know, I watched the video that showed the magnet and it would go on and off.
[01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:04.460]   I couldn't reproduce it with mine.
[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:05.460]   Were you able to reproduce it?
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:10.220]   Yeah, we were able to do it with a smart cover, ironically, from an Apple iPad.
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:11.460]   Yeah, I tried that.
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:12.460]   It wasn't easy.
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:13.460]   It wasn't easy.
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:15.460]   You got to kind of flop it around.
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:18.420]   And it's the lower left corner of that?
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:19.420]   Supposedly, yeah.
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:20.420]   Like down down here?
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:23.220]   Yeah, we were able to flop it around and we got it to.
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:24.220]   I'm dying.
[01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.260]   I got so addicted to my keyboard for the iPad.
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:29.540]   I'm dying for a nice case for this with the keyboard.
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:31.580]   Yeah, this will work with any Bluetooth.
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:39.100]   There's an HP netbook for $2.99 with a crappy atom processor.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:42.100]   I still don't understand why the Chromebook is so expensive.
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:43.100]   Yeah.
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:44.540]   This is what you want.
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:47.300]   Chrome OS, I have never got Chrome OS.
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:48.780]   I still don't.
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:49.780]   This is what you want.
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:52.620]   I think for my students, there's an opportunity for Chrome OS because I think when you use
[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:56.860]   things like WeVideo, which is an online video editing platform and you use online photo
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:26:02.140]   editing and that kind of stuff, I think our students could get a really inexpensive device
[01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:05.820]   to do media online and it has some power to it.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:06.900]   That's why I mentioned the Chromebook.
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:08.900]   But yeah, I don't know how it is.
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:09.900]   Internet cookies.
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:10.900]   Internet cookies.
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:12.380]   Oh, go ahead, Jeff.
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:13.380]   Sorry.
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:14.380]   I was just finished.
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:16.020]   It's now available in 100 Best Buy.
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:17.660]   So if you want to get your hands on one, you can go.
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:20.060]   You can find the Best Buy and go touch it.
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:21.060]   Go ahead, Jeter.
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:25.980]   Yeah, I was going to say just like Internet cafes and school libraries and just places
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:29.500]   where there should be internet access, student centers and that kind of thing that makes
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.340]   complete sense.
[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:33.700]   But I admit I haven't opened my Chrome box yet.
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:38.580]   And just in case you're curious, this from the Risk Assessment blog on ours, Technica,
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:44.540]   according to a quote, serial hacker, Jelly Bean will make it much harder to exploit because
[01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:48.300]   of security features written in here.
[01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:50.380]   This was a Google engineer who said it would be pretty hard.
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:57.060]   This is a security researcher, John Oberheide, published a analysis.
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:58.700]   I don't think he's a Google guy.
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.060]   OK, I was going to say if Google's saying that.
[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:09.820]   No, he works for Duo Security, exploit mitigations in Android Jelly Bean 4.1, John Oberheide.
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:19.060]   They're doing ASLR, address space randomization, which actually desktop operating systems have
[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:25.580]   been doing for some time, makes it very difficult to write data, write programming programs
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:29.180]   into the data stack and then execute them because it's all moved around.
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:30.380]   That's good.
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:31.460]   Yeah.
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:34.900]   So pretty good, pretty impressive.
[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:42.940]   Position independent executables, address space randomization, linker randomization,
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:49.700]   both hardening, info leak prevention, they're really doing some good stuff.
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:50.740]   And you need to, right?
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:55.700]   You don't want to make this an easily-exploiled platform.
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:28:03.100]   Chrome for iOS owns 1.5% of the iOS browser market.
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:04.100]   Pretty amazing.
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.580]   Yeah, that's pretty good.
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:10.960]   Today the import ban on Motorola Android products takes effect.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:13.320]   So if you wanted to zoom, I'm sorry.
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:16.440]   For all those people clamoring for a zoom.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:20.680]   It's 18 products, including phones, of course.
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:23.320]   Motorola says, "We can't share specific details.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:25.500]   We have employed a range of proactive measures
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.720]   to ensure there's no continuing infringement
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:31.360]   under the ITC's interpretation of this single Microsoft patent."
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:34.480]   So that means the atrix, the backflip, the basically, the charm,
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:38.920]   the click, the defy, the devour, the droid, the flip out,
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:41.360]   the flip side, the spice, and the zoom will all get patches
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.720]   of some kind that will make it legal.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:49.000]   Yet in the UK, you'll see a link to down from there.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.240]   Apple is now ordered to eat Crow in public
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:54.160]   for wearing the Samsung tablet.
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:57.080]   This judge, I like this judge.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.560]   He is really--
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.640]   Is this the same judge who said Samsung is not cool enough
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.280]   to have stolen anything?
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:07.240]   Was that the one?
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:07.920]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.360]   Yeah, it is.
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:13.040]   He says, OK, Apple was ordered by a judge
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:15.920]   to publish a notice on its website in the UK
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:19.280]   and in British newspapers saying,
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:24.480]   "Samson did not copy designs for the iPad."
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:25.880]   Holy cow.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:27.240]   Wow.
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:30.880]   It should be posted on the homepage for six months
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.280]   and published in several newspapers and magazines.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.800]   That's hardcore.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:39.800]   I don't see it up there.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:42.680]   There's going to be a statement that Samsung did not copy them.
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:44.040]   In England only, yeah.
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:46.840]   In England? OK, so Apple.co.uk or whatever.
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.960]   Yeah, well, that's three shots.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:51.800]   Somebody put up-- I thought I put on the rundown,
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:57.520]   but there was a cartoon of Simpsons at the Blackboard.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.280]   Apple did not--
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.080]   Samsung did not steal from Apple.
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:02.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:03.480]   How much does this stop being adored?
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:04.680]   Now, Apple--
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:07.520]   It won't happen tomorrow because Apple is appealing.
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:08.240]   So who knows?
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:09.840]   Something could change.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:10.320]   But I--
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:13.080]   Apple's got a lot of things, but eating pro not one of them.
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:14.880]   That judge was clearly no Apple fan.
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:17.000]   I mean, he's the guy who said--
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.840]   in his ruling, he said, oh, no.
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.200]   Samsung, not only did Samsung not copy you, Apple,
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:23.640]   they are not cool enough to have copied you.
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:25.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:27.560]   That guy-- I don't know what he's smoking, but--
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:28.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:29.560]   Holy cow.
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.200]   Office 2013, we haven't talked about it.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:33.480]   That really is a very interesting shift
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.360]   from Microsoft, totally cloud-based.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:38.200]   In fact, the default when you save a document and word
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:41.840]   on the desktop is to save it to the cloud, not to the desktop.
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:48.080]   SkyDrive is the default for where stuff goes.
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:50.200]   It will have Metro.
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:53.200]   The rumor mill continues, but no word from Microsoft,
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:57.520]   whether there will be Android or iOS versions of Office 13.
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.600]   But everybody thinks that's probably the case.
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.520]   Maybe after the surface ships.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:05.960]   All right, we're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:10.720]   Gina's tip, Jeff's number, and my tool.
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:13.280]   But first, Ting.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.040]   I made the mistake.
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:19.360]   I gave my let, my Ting phone to Jolie Odell,
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:20.720]   and I still don't have it back.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:23.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:26.560]   Be careful who you lend your phones to.
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:27.880]   Ting is really cool.
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:30.440]   This is Elliot Noss and his gang at 2Cast,
[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:33.840]   who have reinvented how domain name registration happens,
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.600]   have done the same now or attempted
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.520]   to do the same with self-service.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:41.000]   Their whole idea is to do a cell company that,
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.320]   has honest pricing?
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:45.560]   Well, no, I'm sorry, that can't possibly work.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:48.040]   The bills for megabytes, minutes, and text messages
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:50.280]   separately, and you only pay for what you use,
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:53.760]   and you never pay a penalty for using more.
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.720]   There are no premiums, no penalties.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:58.760]   You pay for exactly what you use.
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:00.880]   They have all the best 4G Android phones.
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:03.440]   They're on the Sprint network, so if you get Sprint,
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:06.200]   if Sprint works where you are, it'll work great.
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:09.600]   And we're going to give you a deal, $50 off your device
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:15.120]   purchase, if you go to twing, ting.com/twig.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.120]   But browse around before you decide to buy.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:17.960]   Take a look at the plants.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:20.360]   For instance, this is so cool.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:24.360]   You choose how many phones you want from one on up.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.280]   That's why this is great for families or businesses.
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:29.640]   I'm going to have two phones, and I'm
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:31.840]   going to buy a package of minutes, say,
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:34.400]   2,000 minutes, 4,000 text messages,
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.760]   3 gigabytes of data.
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:38.800]   That's a ton of everything.
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.200]   $118 a month for both phones.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.600]   Now, here's the beauty part.
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:46.520]   If I don't use all those minutes, they give me a refund.
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.640]   If I don't use all those messages, they give me a refund.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.720]   If I use more, they just charge me
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:52.560]   pro-rated at the rate that I would have paid
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.160]   if I'd chosen that plan.
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:59.000]   And always included at No Charge, voicemail, picture and video
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.320]   messaging, three-way calling, caller ID.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:04.160]   And I know you want this tethering and hotspotting.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:07.720]   Included, free.
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:09.840]   Businesses and families can have unlimited devices
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.440]   on an account and can manage a track.
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:14.360]   Each device they've got a great web interface,
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:15.560]   it really is fantastic.
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:19.120]   I want you to try ting right now.
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:24.880]   Visit ting.com/twig when you do $50 off your phone purchase.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:27.200]   This is how cell phone companies should be.
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.120]   And if you've been using ting, let me know.
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:32.880]   I'd love to hear from some ting users.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:33.760]   Really fantastic.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.320]   It's so cool.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:40.320]   They have hotspots too, the little dongles, the My Fis.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:42.800]   ting.com/twig, we thank them for their support.
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:46.800]   We thank them more importantly for changing the cell business.
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:51.560]   Maybe this will be a shot across the bow on the big guys.
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:54.440]   OK, Gina Trappani, your tip, I'm
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:55.280]   sure you should search.
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.400]   Yeah, you've got several tips here.
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.240]   Yeah, I've got two tips.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.640]   This one, the first one flew by in Google+
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:01.840]   while we were talking.
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.440]   We talked about this at Google I/O
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:06.360]   that Google was going to enable offline access
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.120]   to your docs in Google Docs.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:10.240]   And apparently that just became available.
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:11.160]   Yay.
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:15.720]   Yeah, you go to your doc, which is drive.google.com.
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.720]   And you click on the more link in the tool belt.
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.680]   The tool belt is what they call the links kind of down the side.
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:24.160]   Go on the more link, click on offline docs.
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:26.080]   You have to actually enable them.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:30.040]   And you only want to enable them on your own computer, not
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:30.800]   a public computer.
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:33.080]   So you click on enable offline docs.
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:37.880]   And then you install a Chrome web app to manage offline docs.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:40.640]   So if you're writing something and you go offline or found a plane,
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:41.960]   you can continue to work on it.
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:43.800]   Now you have to be using Chrome for this to work,
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:45.720]   or can you use other browsers?
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:46.800]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:49.640]   You have to install the Drive Chrome web app.
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:52.080]   Yeah, so it sounds like you need to be using Chrome, right?
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:54.120]   Yeah, it looks like you need to be using Chrome.
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:55.480]   Add to Chrome.
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:57.200]   Well, that's how mail works, too.
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.720]   I mean, I've been using the offline mail for Gmail, both accounts.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:06.200]   And in some ways, the Chrome app is almost better than the web app.
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.200]   Really?
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.080]   Yeah, it's pretty good.
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:12.040]   I'm going to have to try this.
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:14.040]   But that wasn't your original tip.
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:18.080]   My original tip was a Bing tip, because I know so many people
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.560]   who just see the show are using Bing.
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:23.480]   Well, you know, I've really been digging for Square
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:23.980]   lately.
[01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:24.840]   Square Square is so great.
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:27.000]   I'm totally into it.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.520]   The new mobile app is great.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:32.760]   I've been noticing-- I've just been using lists and comments a lot more.
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:36.840]   Anyway, Bing just announced that four square tips are now integrated in there.
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.960]   They're what they call their social sidebar.
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:44.320]   So if you search for a place-- let's see if it works for Twit.
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:47.880]   You search for Twit, and there's a public tip on four square
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:50.320]   about the Twit brick house.
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.520]   You'll see it in the sidebar.
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:52.320]   I'm going to try it out.
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.560]   It's Chad's tip.
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:56.840]   Check out the hot tub in the basement, right?
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:35:59.840]   It should say that.
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:00.600]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.520]   So it's funny.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:04.160]   So I search for Twit, and I see--
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.640]   it tells you friends who might know something about this place.
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:07.360]   Oh.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.920]   Lia LaPort has worked at Twit.
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:09.880]   I have, yes.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:10.960]   Yes, you have.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:11.880]   Yes, I have.
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:12.240]   Not too much.
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:13.520]   Until Marissa Meyer bought it.
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.800]   It's been a suggestion for years.
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:17.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:20.120]   You know, I hadn't looked at this social sidebar in a while.
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.040]   There's a lot of--
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:23.040]   apparently, of a pirate working here, that's good.
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:25.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:25.840]   Arrr.
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:27.840]   Arrr.
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:30.400]   So you can see-- yes, you can see reviews.
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:33.200]   And yeah, Jessica J is left to type about star or star box.
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.160]   I just search for star box.
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:37.880]   So if you're a fan of four square, which I am,
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:41.220]   and you're interested to see kind of that content
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:42.880]   showing up in other places, I would love actually
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:46.440]   to see this in Google search results or Dr. Go search results.
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:48.280]   That's neat.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:49.320]   That's interesting.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.160]   I like four square.
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:54.200]   I hope it-- I do hope it continues on.
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:56.080]   Oh, yeah, there's good people, and they're doing some good things.
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:56.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:58.360]   Yeah, the people, they really care,
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:01.160]   and they've built something I never thought I would ever, ever
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:01.920]   want to protect.
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:02.920]   I know.
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:03.920]   I know.
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:05.440]   Just a really compelling user experience.
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:06.360]   Yeah.
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:08.480]   I think the pivot-- the minor pivot they did
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.120]   to being a useful directory of what's around you
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.800]   has really made a difference.
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:13.200]   Yeah.
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:14.520]   Dennis' vision has always been--
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:15.920]   I interviewed him for public parts,
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.680]   and Dennis' vision has always been that it's
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:19.360]   a serendipity generator.
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:19.880]   Right.
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:21.160]   And you get to the airport.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.760]   Gee, I didn't know that Gina was here,
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:24.960]   and I can go hang around her ass here.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:25.320]   Right.
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:27.680]   Or I didn't-- I've been wanting to try this restaurant.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:29.200]   Oh, thank you for reminding me that it really
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.880]   becomes that kind of helpful friend.
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:31.400]   Yeah.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.520]   I mean, when I see that a friend has left the tip someplace
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:35.280]   that I've checked into, and I've never been to before,
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.120]   I get so excited.
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:39.280]   Like, oh, this is-- you know, I have kind of inside information,
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:43.480]   and someone I know gets this common experience that can
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:45.880]   be disconnected by a long time.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:47.760]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:51.040]   I'll do two, because I'm in the social this week.
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:55.440]   A study says that the click-through rates for ads
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:58.000]   that are in-- this is on inside Facebook--
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.800]   that are in the feed on Facebook.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:05.200]   Beat those on Twitter, because Facebook has more targeting
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:05.720]   data.
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:07.680]   And that, finally, the value of Facebook starts
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:08.240]   to become clear.
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:10.960]   What's also interesting, though, is that the click-through
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:16.600]   on mobile Facebook beats that on web Facebook.
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:19.320]   So just to throw the numbers out, it's 1.14, click-through rate
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:21.360]   for mobile Facebook.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:25.080]   0.588, click-through rate for web Facebook,
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:27.520]   and 0.2664 Twitter.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:28.960]   I believe that.
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.240]   That confirms my own results.
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.920]   Yeah, but I think people have been screaming that,
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.400]   you can't make any money on mobile.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:38.320]   No mobile has no value.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:40.000]   It's not the medium.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.800]   It's the relationship you have.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:45.200]   God, do it.
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:50.400]   Then one other one here is that Buzzfeed just said
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:54.760]   that Facebook's referrers now equal those of Google
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.120]   at 180 million in Google.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:57.840]   Wow.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.840]   Wow.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:00.840]   Huh.
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:01.600]   That's pretty interesting.
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.000]   That's very interesting.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:03.200]   It is.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.880]   It's just Buzzfeed.
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:06.480]   It's a wonderful making-garver piece there,
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.680]   but I found that very interesting.
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:11.200]   It's where we know what's going, but that's
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:15.840]   a statistical verification of social recordation.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:18.120]   No, it's better than search.
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.280]   It's the new search.
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:23.920]   Thank you, Trip70, for a little tip in the chat room
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:28.480]   to take a look at chromeweblab.chroma.com,
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:33.560]   experiment from the Science Museum in London.
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:37.760]   And if you go to Chrome WebLab in Chrome using HTML5,
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:39.800]   it's just playing with it.
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:40.680]   So it's a little something.
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.040]   I'm not going to take the time to play with it,
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:43.720]   but just play with it.
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:47.400]   And you can get-- OK, we're going to make a lab tag.
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.200]   And this is my identity.
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:52.800]   I've now joined other visitors from across the world.
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:53.160]   Great.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:56.320]   Let's not break this.
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.280]   We're in trouble.
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:57.840]   Isn't this cool?
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:59.520]   This is really nicely done.
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:00.960]   So I can launch some experiments,
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:04.960]   play with stuff at the London Science Museum.
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:08.520]   My browser is really slow, so we won't wait around while it
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:08.800]   loads.
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:12.960]   But you can track chromeweblab.com.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:16.280]   We do this show on Wednesdays at 1 PM Pacific, 4 PM Eastern
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:17.320]   Time.
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:19.680]   That's 2100 UTC on Twit.tv.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:20.560]   Please join us live.
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:23.040]   We really like that.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:26.440]   And we'll look my orchestras fired up.
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:29.640]   Yeah, this is a crazy psychedelic trip through.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:30.280]   This is good.
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:30.640]   Yeah.
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:31.000]   I'll see you--
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:31.800]   Music.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:32.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:34.360]   It's really cool.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.080]   Please do watch live, because we like to see you.
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:38.080]   And we get great tips from our audience.
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:40.520]   But if you can't, we make on-demand versions of audio and video
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:42.120]   available always right after the fact.
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.840]   It takes a couple hours to upload it,
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:47.320]   to code it and upload it at twit.tv/twig.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:50.560]   And wherever podcasts are found, stay tuned.
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:53.520]   If you're watching live, I'm very excited.
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:56.520]   Eben Upton from Raspberry Pi joins us in triangulation
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:57.840]   in just a minute.
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.320]   I'm now playing Temple Blocks.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:07.760]   Click on any spot to add a note.
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:10.480]   I'm a big fan of this kind of time waster.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.920]   Oh, speaking of-- can I make one more thing?
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:13.760]   Yes.
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:18.320]   InternetDefenseLeague.org tomorrow is launching the cat signal.
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:18.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.920]   So the cat signal, yes.
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.240]   Now, what is that going to be?
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:25.240]   Am I going to see cat signals on websites?
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:27.320]   I think you're going to see them in the sky.
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:28.840]   In the sky?
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:30.680]   They're going to do a cat signal on a billion.
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:34.040]   If you go to internetdefenseleague.org/launch,
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:36.920]   you'll see, so I just contributed to it.
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:40.440]   And so this is to say, save our internet.
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.240]   And if there is a crisis, then they're
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:48.240]   going to put out the signal in the sky and elsewhere.
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:51.840]   So if you see it put it in the sky, the trouble--
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:53.480]   Trouble.
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:55.640]   To the bat cave.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:56.280]   To the cat cave.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:57.800]   To the cat cave.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.560]   So you put this up on your website.
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:00.760]   So this is kind of like the--
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:01.840]   No, it's different cats here.
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.000]   I'm putting my email address in this right now.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.920]   So you'll get emailed when there's a need.
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:12.040]   And we should do this too on our website.
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:12.520]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:17.000]   We should participate in the internet defense league,
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.160]   the Avengers.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:19.720]   Jeff John--
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:20.560]   There's cats on internet.
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:23.200]   I'm in there.
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:27.920]   So as Chad, they do actually want to raise $19,000
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:30.760]   to build five giant cat signals that
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:32.960]   will light up the sky in cities around the world.
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:36.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:37.760]   Oh my my.
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:38.720]   How much money?
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:40.000]   $19,000.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:40.840]   I'll do it.
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.000]   Let's just do it.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.400]   I'll chip in some, you chip in some.
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.160]   We have found Chad's real soft underbelly.
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:46.640]   Haven't we here?
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:48.000]   So what are we going to switch it, will you?
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.440]   Actually, this is supposed to go up tomorrow.
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:53.360]   New York, San Francisco, Washington, London, and Ular
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:55.600]   Batar in Mongolia.
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.520]   If they raise the money, so everybody don't--
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:58.920]   They're going to go $14,000, $19,000.
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.640]   So folks, come on, come on.
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:04.600]   Show the power of the Twitter army to save the internet.
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:05.120]   No, no.
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:06.600]   It's not to save the internet.
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:07.680]   To put cat signals up.
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:10.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:14.160]   I think it's doing it saving the internet.
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:15.600]   Not in different cats.
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.200]   No, no.
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.200]   Jeff Jarvis--
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:17.560]   I'll have to--
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:19.720]   --active-- actively involved cats.
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:20.720]   Engaged cats.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:22.720]   Engaged cats.
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:24.400]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.440]   That's his blog, his book.
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:29.600]   You must read public parts is all about life in public.
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:34.360]   And it's benefits and drawbacks.
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:37.600]   And Gina, of course, is at smarterware.org.
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:40.200]   And think up app.com.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:42.000]   And thank you both for being here.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:42.880]   We love doing the show.
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.640]   Gina has a new show on 5x5.
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:45.840]   What's it called?
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:47.320]   In beta.
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:49.760]   5x5.tv/inbeta.
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:51.880]   Kevin Purdy, who's been on "Twig" a bunch of times
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:53.480]   and wrote the complete Android guide.
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.640]   He and I co-host.
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:55.480]   It's just audio.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.360]   It's not cool.
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.000]   It's not video, but just audio.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.120]   And it's about web and open source software.
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:01.120]   Yep, it sure is.
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:05.200]   So if you like that when Gina geeks out like that,
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.600]   you got it, man.
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:09.040]   Lots of geeking out.
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:10.240]   Thanks, everybody, for joining us.
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:12.640]   We'll see you next time on "This Week in Google."
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:15.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
