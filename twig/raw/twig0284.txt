[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.080]   Facebook Twitter anything happening up there
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.480]   Sky Kevin Marks is down to earth, but he is in his garden with a lovely sky behind him. Hi Kevin
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.360]   Hi, there not many clouds though. I'm afraid since it's pure blue sky here great to have you look that way
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.880]   Yeah, and if it starts raining just you know, I don't know. Well, you have an umbrella. I think you'll be alright
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.000]   Not much chance that I
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.880]   Love the orange tree behind you though. Also with us from Canada where it's not quite so balmy
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.280]   Mr. Matthew Ingram giga home doctor. No orange trees in my orange trees in your backyard
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.600]   But there's always a place for you if you want to come down here
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.520]   Matthew writes for giga home and both of us have been talking before the show about I think the biggest story today
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.960]   Which has nothing that has little to do with Google actually some ways might have a lot to do with Google which is Microsoft's
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.880]   Windows 10 announcement, but you've been covering live most of the day
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.840]   Just the the shorthand version of this
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.840]   Microsoft has announced that it will be giving away windows 10 when it ships later this year probably the fall to anybody running Windows 7
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.320]   Windows 8 or Windows phone
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:01.280]   And that in effect what they've been talking about for some time one Windows is going to somewhat come true that there will be
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.240]   Universal apps that will run across all platforms. There'll be a form of
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:13.320]   Microsoft calls it what continuum, but it's really like my apples continuity that allows you to run apps across all of the different platforms
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.320]   And the data the same way
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.960]   They also announced and I think this will get a lot of attention a holographic. They call it the hollow lens
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:29.400]   Which I guess is designed to be used by hollow men with apologies to the SLA it they hollow lens is a heads-up display
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.880]   Which offers 3d holographic images, you know in your field of view as you look around is being used apparently now by JPL at NASA
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.880]   Help scientists who are designing up the you know plotting the plans for curiosity the Mars rover
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.000]   Literally walk around mark rocks say hey go get that
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.880]   Here's what you know a pretty amazing uses
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.520]   That's going to get a lot of attention, but I think really the big story is
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.760]   Kind of a revitalized Microsoft under its new CEO CEO Sachin Adela and
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.000]   They did there is a Google angle here because very early on at the very beginning
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.600]   um
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.080]   Microsoft it was Terry I want to say Richardson
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.120]   was he's the
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.000]   Senior vice president for operating systems speaking he said at Microsoft you're not the product and
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I think that's a pretty clear shot at Google Facebook -
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.840]   So they were canceling this crew would nonsense they did cancel the screw I think this is this is really the new screw gled which is
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.400]   Not to go after Google in advertising and was snark, but to go after them with better products
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.960]   What an idea what a concept?
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.320]   they showed off Cortana which of course is directly aimed at Siri and
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.080]   And Google's Google now does many of the same things Google now does and again they emphasized
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.040]   But it's in a trustworthy way your privacy is protected
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.760]   Cortana was very conversational. I know you
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.480]   Matthew you didn't see the video either
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.520]   I know I didn't know I know neither of you saw the stream, but the demo was pretty impressive
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.880]   Very conversational of course, it's always hard with demos
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.760]   Yeah
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.040]   But it seems to me that Microsoft is looking at Google as a serious competitor and doing everything they can
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.480]   to bolster their product line in every way they mentioned a new browser they're gonna
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   Not exactly a read
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.200]   Redesign in a explorer the same engine running the same rendering engine running it
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.040]   But but Sparta Spartan will look very different much cleaner in fact look a lot like Chrome
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.680]   I imagine Microsoft loses some market share to Chrome with new Windows users
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:57.920]   The thing that that sort of bugs me about I mean you're right Microsoft is is you know offering a lot of interesting things and the
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.160]   Free windows is a great way to get sort of people onto the platform. I feel like
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.520]   You know and and you could say this about Google - I suppose you have to it feels like you have to pick
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:20.000]   Someone to get married to you know have to basically be absorbed into a platform and use everything right that that platform has to offer
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.480]   You have to have the mobile device you have to have the desktop software you have to have the and they have to suck in all the
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.720]   Data about your life before these you know things like Cortana can become useful so you really
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.800]   You have to choose who you're gonna sort of get married to because a lot of these things are not gonna work unless
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.640]   They have all your stuff and all your objects and all your devices
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.800]   Yeah, Apple invented this didn't they the whole idea complete ecosystem
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:54.520]   And and Google has done their best with Android and Chromebooks to do the same although they don't really have a desktop operating system
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.000]   They have Chrome which is certainly a wedge into the desktop operating system and it's very clear today that Microsoft
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.320]   Plans do the same thing
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.480]   Satya Nadella said
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:11.360]   We plan to be cross-platform everywhere you our customers are because we're a customer centric company
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.920]   He even said instead of having to use Windows we want you to love to use Windows
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.780]   But he said the the most the best experience will always be within Windows 10
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.840]   He also told developers and this is a really important message. They have been shedding developers the fact that Windows phone
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.760]   Didn't take off. I think you can ascribe to a great degree to the lack of apps the lack of developers for you
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:38.640]   He said we're gonna have a universal platform and you'll be able to write for all the devices and and then the pitch to the consumer is
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.520]   Cortana and these other things work better the more you spend more time you spend with Windows devices everything will work better
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.200]   So you're exactly right. I think all three companies Apple Google and Microsoft are
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.920]   position themselves to be
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.680]   the universe
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.980]   Microsoft and I guess go ahead. I mean the main reason I stopped
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.320]   Being so exclusively Apple was that started to bug me right?
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:09.600]   Sort of the fact that you had to use everything Apple and that certain things just wouldn't work if you didn't use Apple or
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.440]   Plus just the sheer expense of buying all these Apple products because they're not exactly cheap
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.920]   And I wanted something that was more
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:24.800]   You know where I could hack together networks out of different things as opposed to having to have everything Apple
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.280]   And they are actually getting better than they used to be but that was the thing that sort of pushed me away
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.940]   Because it felt like Android was a much more open ecosystem
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.920]   Is it?
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.600]   Good question
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.400]   I mean is it I don't know and certainly when it comes to things like Google now
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:51.520]   You know I use Gmail and I have a Google device and and all that stuff and so everything I use Google Drive and he's Google
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:57.220]   Plus and Google photos and so I am sort of you know, I've bought into their ecosystem
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:03.560]   So is that that different? I don't know your original premise was this is wherever and actually do we add?
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:09.960]   Amazon to this too is an Amazon trying to build that same sort of total ecosystem now that they do hardware
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.400]   And the only thing I could say about Google is they do
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.480]   They do tend to be better at letting you
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.880]   Get access to your data and take it with you that I don't know if they're if that's changed or not
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.880]   But that was a pretty core principle. Absolutely. Yeah, go ahead Kevin. We're a little low. I don't know if it's at us
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:35.440]   I'm not sure. Okay. We hear you now. There you go. Okay. There was a little bit of typing so I was writing fader. Sorry about that. Oh
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.400]   I'm sorry
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.640]   I'll re-point the mic. Um, so what I was what I was saying is that that's the thing is that each of them has has
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.720]   Is having to build the whole set because they've stopped trying to interoperate which is which is kind of sad
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.980]   So everyone's building their own cloud services their own hardware their own operating system
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.520]   their own, you know
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.840]   desktop
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.600]   Applications things like that and it's it's it's all a bit odd
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.240]   Because we've you know, we've had the web as the unifying platform for a while
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.920]   But they've they've all seem to have said oh no, we can't actually work with each other anymore
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:14.280]   Which is which is is odd because it leaves a sort of gap in the middle for for someone like Dropbox to be the cloud that works on all the clouds
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.840]   She's which is kind of strange
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:24.080]   Yeah, and in fact Dropbox is a great example. I mean I just said the other day. I've got a Mac book air
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.680]   I've got I'm running
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:32.360]   Linux mint on my desktop and I've got Windows devices in the house as well and I was trying to share
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.280]   folders on on my network, you know, which I control and
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.000]   It made me want to shoot myself. It's so
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.360]   Even a simple thing like that is so hard and they've made it hard apples actually made it harder than it used to be and so
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:54.280]   Dropbox becomes like a godsend, you know, you literally just put stuff in there and it's everywhere
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:02.280]   It's it's as simple as a sort of cross-platform, you know, networking and following should be or could be you can't really fault them
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.480]   I mean
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:11.960]   The best way to profit is to force people to use your stuff exclusively. Yeah, although I it is encouraging that there's a there a company like Dropbox
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.440]   Can make its way by offering a true cross-platform?
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.000]   solution
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.800]   I mean apples apples argument has always been you know
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:29.240]   It's similar to the one you described that Microsoft is making by doing this we make it better for you the user
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.800]   So your experience is better things work properly. You don't have to worry about, you know
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:42.880]   anything getting damaged or any your data flowing to other people because we control the whole thing from soup to nuts from one end of the other and
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:49.960]   You know, that's why the walled garden is such a great metaphor because it's a beautiful garden flowers are amazing
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:54.760]   and it's really well it's clean and and no one mugs you and you know
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:00.720]   You don't and you can barely even see the walls until you get up close to them and even then you think oh, this is such a great
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.880]   Garden man these flowers are amazing, but you know the minute you want to do something outside the garden
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.440]   It's like ah you can't do that. I have to say though
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.400]   I look at Dropbox and then I look at Microsoft offering unlimited storage on one drive
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.000]   Prices dropping at Google
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.840]   And I wonder what how long my Dropbox's business plan as a storage company alone can can survive in that yeah
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:29.280]   I mean, I wonder how much longer there Kevin you're an advocate for open you're an advocate for you know
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:35.400]   Exactly the opposite of what we're seeing here, right? I mean so that's the thing I suspect that we're
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.960]   You know, we're one end of the pendulum swing and we can have another swing back to the other end and we
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.120]   The web is still there. It's still an infrastructure for all of this
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.440]   It's just that these different companies are sort of approaching it from slightly different angles
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.600]   Google was the one that was approaching it from that angle
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:57.120]   But because as they grew they got more locked out by the others and so they had to build there to some extent
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.280]   They had to move their own operating system as a defensive move and they've built them as open source operating systems
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.200]   Well, they can use them too. So the biggest OS in the world may well be
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.840]   AOSP rather than Google Android
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:14.040]   Sometimes this year that that line looks like it's it's gonna cross explain what the difference is
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:20.360]   So Android is two things Android is an open source project. That's an operating system for phones
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.600]   And it's also a set of cloud services the Google provides
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.360]   So if you have an Android phone that has with Google on it somewhere which
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.880]   Or not suppose this is Nexus. So just as Nexus
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.880]   That's implied that means that they've signed the deal with Google. They get to use Google cloud services
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:43.480]   And there are certain which means that you can run without that you can't run Google's apps that rely on their servers
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.880]   so you can't run Gmail or Google Maps or
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.880]   drive or
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.300]   The app store and so on so a big chunk of Android functionality
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.320]   AOSP is Android open source project
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:02.200]   Which is all the bits that you can freely create and build your own stuff and Google has been moving bits back and forth between the two
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:09.040]   So yeah, one of the reasons you get on a non Nexus phone you end up with two copies of everything is that you have a
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:18.620]   AOSP derived email client and Gmail and you have an AOSP derived browser and Chrome and so on and this is this is
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.020]   If you buy a Samsung phone this gets confusing because you end up with two of everything
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.900]   And it's like because Samsung you know has decided okay, we don't want to be fully dependent on Google
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.860]   We want to make sure you have got some more time. You know, it's interesting
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:34.820]   I just saw a browser benchmark with Sun spider only which I think is a JavaScript benchmark that showed the Samsung
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:40.940]   browser on the note for to be literally twice as fast as the Google browser that
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:47.980]   And so you know something I mean it is possible for Samsung to say well, we're gonna make better apps. It's not just right
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260]   Not just Samsung apps, but better apps
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:56.900]   Because they're plugged into the hardware right right you can use all sorts of things that Google can you know Apple has chosen
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.340]   to make
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:05.300]   It's its solutions barely interoperable. I mean really Apple is Apple. You're not gonna try to use
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.660]   iCloud on any other platform
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:12.780]   Google or would you want to or would you want to know what you want to but that is a change
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:17.380]   You know at the point where Apple weren't the the ones who are in the they couldn't do that
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:23.060]   They had an idea and ideas you could you could work use on Windows and you could use other places because it
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.220]   Influented web tab and there was a standard way of using it
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:30.340]   And it was a web server and it was great and I miss it and
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.900]   Especially as I was paying the money and they delete all my files. That's not very nice nice
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:40.500]   But but no, but they've got the other way and said, okay, we're gonna build something that works for us
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.580]   And you know an apple and apple has a lot of good open sounds work as well. There's a not not yes
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:50.820]   But it the companies tend to do that work at the point where they're not on the you know
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.220]   On the largest end of the market
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:58.300]   So one of the things Apple did to get itself out of its trough was to adopt a
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.460]   free BSD call to the operating system and a bunch of
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:07.620]   understand the stuff of that layer and built a lot of very good networking protocols stuff and things like that like
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:14.740]   MDNS and and you know the stuff that makes up Bonjour is a set of internet protocols that they
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:19.460]   Helped establish and there's a huge amount to establish Wi-Fi people forget that now, but it was Apple who?
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:26.160]   Decided yes, this is really important and we are going to make the base station a quarter the product
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.520]   I said anybody else's base station to ensure that people have lots of base stations
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.220]   And we put it in by the four-hour machines
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:37.680]   So there's a reason to buy a station and boots up the way up and that created the ability for everyone else to follow along and join in
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.380]   So that is Apple is very good at making those choices
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:48.580]   Making the integration good enough people understand why they want it and then ramping the industry forward
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.020]   You know you can say the same thing about USB to something something you speak exactly
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.740]   But I think you're right that they did a lot more of that when they were
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:03.060]   Relatively smaller and not the world's most valuable company and they felt like they had to try harder as soon as you have market share
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.060]   You go screw the other guy
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.340]   Right what is it J dog noon and says in our chatroom?
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.060]   Microsoft has walls. They're just not as high as Apple's wall
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.840]   It's true that but think now Microsoft is in that
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.140]   Kevin also has walls Kevin is in a wall
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.740]   Kevin's literally in a wall garden
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:29.540]   Seven foot high literally
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:37.660]   See beautiful that but the houses aren't very hot here, so we're not actually overlooked which is nice. Um, so
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:45.540]   So Microsoft is now in the situation that Apple was then right in a way. They've flipped flapped
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.980]   Yeah, yeah, and you know and and Google was a few years ago where they are the
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.280]   The outsider trying to get people to come back to their platform that they think is great
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.060]   And so they're gonna have to do things differently and they are that's one of the things that has been refreshing about that
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:17:59.700]   I was
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.820]   Year or so with Microsoft is that they've they've been doing things like oh, yes, of course
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:09.160]   We support running our software on Linux. You're like great what? Oh, yes our cloud will support
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.340]   Linux images as well as Windows images and you're like
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.460]   This is not the Microsoft. I remember and it's encouraging
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.700]   and I'm hoping that we'll see some more of that and
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:23.500]   Obviously they restarted browser development with IE and have been doing good work and standards there as well
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:29.780]   So I'm hoping we'll see more of that and yeah with the other shoe to drop there has been they've been releasing
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.700]   versions of office and so on for
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.540]   Android and iOS
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:43.300]   Even before they release it for Windows phone and Windows desktop the touch first office came out on iPad is now coming out on Android
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.940]   Yeah, still is not available for Windows or Windows phone
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.820]   That's but that's what Nadella was talking about. He says we're going to be cross-platform
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:54.100]   We're going to focus on what the customer wants. That's nice
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:59.180]   But the best experience will be in Windows is that the is that the best we can hope for really in this?
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.860]   modern world is there a chance Kevin of
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.440]   This kind of wonderful idea open
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.300]   the other way around and that
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.300]   Google tried very hard to
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:18.940]   put stuff out on iOS for quite a long time and it and then at the point where Apple started running interference on them and
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:23.720]   Cancelling apps and they got into a huge fight about it called in the FTC at that point. They said well, okay
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.340]   If we've got to spend you know six months getting this into your app store
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.340]   We're not gonna do iOS first anymore
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.380]   And I think they swam back a bit from that again and they've you know with the
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.940]   But that was a market ultimately. Yeah, I know there were court cases, but ultimately that was a market share
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:43.300]   Decision Google did that. I remember this was Andy Rubin was pissed off about this
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.300]   But it was ultimately a market share decision. Yeah, we've got Android
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.820]   But where are all the users there on iPhone and we need users?
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:56.540]   But as soon as you have market share on Android, it's in fact look how Google has treated Windows phone
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:02.740]   Like I mean really they don't exist from Google's point of view. Yeah, and then that's I mean
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.300]   But that's a that's a reasonable decision. You know, that's that's like well
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:10.180]   There is barely any users of Windows phone. Well, I guess that's why my question is is there any hope of true openness?
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.940]   Well, well the interesting thing is going to be how Google is with AOSP and I think they're gonna have to
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.740]   Start support running their stuff on AOSP or they're gonna lose a lot of market share
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:23.540]   Which is a new and to some extent they're already turning a blind eye to that in China
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:28.820]   In the same way that Microsoft used to just a turn a blind eye to Windows being prior to using it
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.860]   It seems to me everybody will be a bully the minute they can be the biggest kid in class
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.220]   Well, and that's always been the case. I mean
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.420]   I can't remember if it was Tim Wu
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:45.380]   Did you see my bodyguard the big kid turn he never mind? Yeah
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:49.660]   But I mean if you're if you're the underdog
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:54.540]   You it's in your interest to be right because you're only as long as you're the underdog
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:21:00.220]   Exactly as soon as you stop and in some cases, you know, Google is very open with all sorts of things
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:04.220]   But it's not open at all when it comes to search in the algorithm because that's its core
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:08.420]   You know it has to build a mode around that and and keep people away from it
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:15.420]   But it'll be open with other things that aren't as relevant the thing that that I'm sort of wondering about is it was one thing
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.780]   When we were talking about hardware so a phone, you know a laptop
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:25.620]   Does your phone work with your laptop does? Can you you know even one drive or those sorts of things?
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.540]   That's one thing
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.300]   But if you're talking about things like Cortana and Siri and Google now
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:37.180]   They're they're basically ingesting all the data about you that they possibly can from every point of view
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:42.140]   Where your phone is what you know? Are you in traffic? Have you turned on voice recognition?
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.980]   Are they reading your email or are they reading your voicemail?
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:50.020]   And that's so once I get access to all of that I think that
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.300]   The idea that it's a silo and we're gonna protect you walked into them
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.220]   Yeah, that's that becomes more of an issue than if it's just a piece of hardware
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.500]   Well, that's an important thing to walk to take away from this which is
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.380]   These companies may currently say oh, we'll keep it private trust us
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:10.220]   But there's there really isn't a financial incentive for them to do that in the long run at some point
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.620]   You can't assume they'll give up
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:18.340]   There is there is in that if they have a huge breach is gonna be very bad for them
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:24.540]   Well, there's a breach and then there's them saying we've changed our privacy policy. I would love to see Google
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:29.100]   I would love to see Google say something like you can take all the data we have
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.540]   From Google now and delete it from our servers
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.100]   Yeah, or you can take it from us
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:39.380]   We'll package it and give it you and you can go to a different service and they'll ingest it wouldn't that be great
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.820]   But there is there any incentive for them to do that there's none
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.260]   Really you can get a lot of the data out with takeout, but what you don't get is the
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.900]   differences right you can't then apply it to Cortana or Siri I
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:57.660]   Can't get all my GPS coordinates from using ways, you know for the last two years. There's no standard for that
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.500]   Anyway, you can get all your if you turned on Google location history. You can get all of that
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.660]   I downloaded and you get is a KML file
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:09.580]   But then yeah, it's like a gig. Yeah, but then what do you do?
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.580]   And it's not like you're you're
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:16.020]   Yeah, so I guess my question is Kevin
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:19.420]   Is there any way to convince these companies who are acting in their best interests?
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.900]   Financially
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:27.860]   Is there anywhere that convinced them that it is in their best interest to keep it open or is it isn't always the case that
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.620]   From an economic point of view once you're big enough create a silo great
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.860]   The challenge is the realising that that isn't true. It's not true
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:42.060]   If you if you do create the silo then you then you create fragility and you're you're storing up
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.140]   like massive massive problems
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:52.980]   And you don't see it until like suddenly the site goes through like yeah, this is the site deaths problem that that you know
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:56.380]   Oh, this is every this is great. They're looking after all my stuff
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.820]   And I have to think about it wait where did it go which is exactly what happened to me with ideas
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.180]   It was like great apples apples a big company
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.460]   I'm paying them a hundred bucks a year to keep my stuff on their servers
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.980]   I'll be fine. I can make links to it from all over the web and do that and then one day
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.100]   They're like oh yeah, no you we're not doing that anymore. You can download it if you're quick
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.060]   and all those links are now dead and
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:20.380]   Home page dot Mac.com doesn't exist anymore and screw you right
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:26.040]   And that actually I think that's just that isn't some little fly-by-night startup that's Apple and
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.540]   Just the other day lack of money just from Mike corporate decision-making
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:39.020]   I think it was a Neil - said his iCloud all of his photos his wedding is his child all those photos gone
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.540]   So I photo upgrade
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.800]   Library not not found horrible
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:51.040]   That's just bad customer service. There's no I mean that's not what we're talking about here a sensible company would not cheese off
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.660]   It's most devoted users by deleting there
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:25:01.060]   This is the long-term argument for open verses closed. You know yeah because you take it with you
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:06.260]   Yeah, you own it the fragility of something is not just is it well designed?
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:13.220]   It's also the corporate structures that own it and contain it and so when if you if you build something that's on the platform
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.220]   Owned by a large company that they can take away
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.740]   then you're building it on sand because they can take it away and
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:24.140]   They've all done this they've all deleted things and right
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:30.460]   Microsoft is actually better at this than but than most of them because they have been a developer for a long time and they tend to keep things
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.460]   Going for longer than you'd expect
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.260]   But it's it's you know Google has
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.780]   These all kinds of things that we've built stuff on Apple has taken things away to
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.620]   I'm sure Amazon
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.180]   At the Amazon at the moment hasn't done it that with
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.140]   AWS at all
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:54.700]   Particle its business is that but there's the potential there they could do that and they have done things like
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.940]   Delete stuff for political reasons
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:04.540]   Like we can make stuff down for example is it conceivable that the open source community could come up with a
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:10.820]   Response to this and create an alternative to this. I think they I think they're trying
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:18.340]   Yeah, this is the open cloud, you know initiatives. I think it's interesting that you use Linux on your desktop for instance Matthew
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:25.500]   Yeah, and one of one of the things one of the reasons I wanted to do that was I wanted to explore as much as possible of
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.700]   a more open
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:32.700]   Community and a sort of more open ecosystem the the problem is it's still so much work
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:36.220]   You know it's just and you so you spend a lot of time
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.900]   You know it's like building your own kit car or something
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:44.380]   It's great that you can you spend all this time maintaining it because no one can figure out how it works
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:51.940]   2015 will be the year of desktop Linux. I'm I'm convinced no, I'm joking. I think that that that ship is sales
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:56.380]   I mean I switched to mint because Ubuntu was becoming such a crapped up piece of garbage
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:01.700]   And it's loaded with all the stuff, you know the drivers we have mobile Linux, you know, and what is Linux right?
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:06.400]   It is actually the biggest I'm just in the world now. Yeah, yeah
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:11.580]   Chrome is grown to underneath isn't it so you know that there is a
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:16.660]   Sizable set of computers out there running desktop Linux is just that what does that mean from the point of view?
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.660]   What I was saying that can the open source community?
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.280]   See the wrist want create a credible alternative this
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:30.380]   Android is not a credible alternative to the problem is that users users in general do not care whether something is open
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.340]   I mean, I know it's incredible alternative to it is fun
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:39.660]   Right, but so the vast majority of users just want something that works, right?
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:45.180]   They don't really care whose ecosystem. They don't care what standard it operates on and so if you can provide a
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:50.580]   Totally siloed ecosystem experience and it works great, which is what Apple has done
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:56.580]   Lots of people are gonna say that's fine. I don't care that it's not open. So then how do you make them care?
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:02.620]   Well, maybe they care when their data gets deleted and the next time go next time
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:09.620]   But there are a lot of people who maybe it's Stockholm syndrome
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:17.500]   But there are a lot of Apple users who have been bitten by Apple's crap cloud services for years who still most still embrace it
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.300]   Use it and say this is I'm loving this
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:27.540]   So again, I raise the question is there any way that I mean
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:32.340]   Maybe we should raise the white flag the idea of a cross platform
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.940]   Nobody owns it, you know, non-proprietary
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:44.940]   Solution and I'm not just talking cloud but just for everything as an alternative to the to the walled gardens offered by Microsoft Apple and Google
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:51.020]   Can can survive is I mean Kevin knows better than anyone the history of sort of open yeah
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:29:01.140]   He's been there. He's bought these open ID and you know open this and open cloud and open and and they're they often get a certain amount of traction
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.140]   But they don't get
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.300]   Sort of mass acceptance. They just don't
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.460]   So forget it we should give up
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:15.140]   They do and they don't I mean the successful ones disappear and you don't and you forget you don't think about them anymore
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:22.920]   We don't think about oh open web, but it's you know, we're running we're running open source browsers on open standards
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.260]   HTML and that's
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.020]   Open source servers as well primarily. Yeah
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.620]   So there's there's a there's a huge, you know
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:35.500]   layer of stuff that's gone there to the point and and the point is the point I was making is that
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:42.700]   the original thing about open source was it's great for programmers because you don't have to write the codes that someone else is already written and
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:48.980]   Then there was this interesting interaction, which was that if you manage to convince your company to open source software
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:50.660]   then
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:54.660]   It was great for you as a programmer because you could leave the company and still work on it and that was like great
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.780]   Well, that's that's a real vise for me as a program
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:03.500]   So programmers like that because they meant they didn't lose their like code libraries and things and then their knowledge base when they move companies
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:07.220]   And that that I can help contribute to the done it's interesting. Yeah
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.940]   But then the thing that then the companies at first were like
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:13.940]   What we're losing all this precious IP and then they realized wait
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:18.460]   You're leaving the company and you're still working on this code that we're running, but we don't pay you anymore. Oh
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:24.020]   That works for us. What a great idea. What a great idea. Let's do more of that
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:30.220]   You know to the point where I know we end up with stuff like heart bleed because everyone's running the same code base
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:34.420]   No one's actually like down the security audit on in 10 years because
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:40.660]   People who have forgotten they were even running already wrote this. So let's just use it
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:46.820]   Right, but you know that's that's usually a good thing when it when it becomes a you know a monoculture risk
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.100]   It's it can be a problem
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:53.580]   But it's generally less of a monoculture risk than everybody running Microsoft's code or everybody running Apple's code or
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:58.700]   Everyone was to me like was coach. So it's a it feels to me like the web was almost an
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.540]   Accident, you know
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.540]   Utopian period
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.540]   Well, no one realized how important it was going
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:13.660]   Isn't that what Tim was you mentioned you mentioned Tim with the author the master's
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:20.340]   That's kind of what he says is that in the nascent period of any of these new technologies and he starts with the long distance system
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.900]   It is free and open and magical
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:28.700]   Because nobody's making any money at it and then as soon as the the big companies come along and they take it over
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.700]   It goes from proprietary to closed
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.460]   It's wings
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:41.860]   Right take over as well the other thing is that he describes is that part where they go and get the government to mandate them and
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:46.380]   The competitors as well. Yeah, and then they become the incumbents
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:52.460]   And that creates the innovation pressure for the new things to occur and I guess that's what I was asking is again
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.700]   Is there space for an innovative?
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:32:00.540]   Maybe it's open source, but maybe it's somewhere else innovative solution that isn't a walled garden that does
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:05.220]   Allow users to take their stuff and move it somewhere else too. I think there always is
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:12.340]   We may be seeing like I think if you what I took away from Tim's book anyway was that the pendulum often
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:18.540]   Swings or shifts when there's a new when something new happens right as a web is a good example
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:24.060]   Right is there something new enough? Is it gonna be you know virtual reality?
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:30.820]   Is it gonna be the cloud or is it gonna be automated assistance like Siri and so on that will that will kind of someone will
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:35.380]   Come along at the same time as people are starting to feel locked into these
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:40.180]   Silos and the two will find each other the need or the desire to be
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:47.420]   To have your stuff somewhere else or to be outside this wall garden will meet someone who has an offering that's powerful enough
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:53.780]   We're talking about Google the cloud everything to do with up there the sky
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:57.380]   Matthew Ingram of giga home Kevin Marks of Kevin Marks and
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.940]   And you know that Jeff Jarvis is in here. He is in Davos
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.340]   Enjoying a lovely dinner right about now
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:11.220]   And he'll be back next week, but hey, we've got two great people to take his place this week
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:17.060]   Somebody where do we find this great hyperland video? Oh, I thought through that in so lovely
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:22.380]   So I wanted to make the point they were at one of my crossovers thing was
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.660]   They said look and nastra is using our VR stuff to explore Mars
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:33.540]   And that my hyperland is a documentary made by colleagues of mine at a BBC in 1989 and brought first broadcast in 1990
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:37.620]   It's my Douglas Adams and here's the guy from NASA doing this
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:41.500]   So Douglas Adams of the hitchhiker's guy and you may recognize dr. Who?
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.700]   Yes, Baker who was 81 yesterday
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:49.860]   It peers in this much more sprightly looking as it's the fourth doctor who so this is from what what year?
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.440]   89 Wow, this is NASA using virtual reality
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.060]   really kind of medium resolution
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:03.780]   And there's one for each eye we look at those for very wide angle. I've warned these I remember going to see graph
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.620]   Remember fighting the dragon at SIG graph with that helmet on
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:14.260]   180 degrees field of view these optics give us about 120 degree with a true stereo
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:19.180]   She's always been eight pounds. I tried one and it says three days like look
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:23.620]   Yeah, I played a sort of eight-bit video game and just about threw up
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:27.900]   But this was jaren Lanier. This is the the early days of VR
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:32.300]   Yep, and w industries remember that
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:36.860]   The terror act all not yeah, that's not the dragon the terror act all yeah
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.780]   Yeah, so the founder of that's a friend of mine. He's he's over here now
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:43.620]   So I saw him over Christmas and he says oh, we're still doing interesting things in this space
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.620]   Keep it keep your eyes open for
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:50.900]   VR and AR so I said I suspect he's he's done been doing a lot of work on the optics of it
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:56.660]   Yeah, and one of the challenges is not doing this not having these big opaque screens that are across your face
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:02.820]   We're doing the thing that Microsoft showed off today where you've got some glass in front of your face that is about as a
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.820]   Pakers sunglasses. I'm wearing
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:11.860]   But is able to inject light in from my direction so you can get a realistic overlay on the outside world
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.100]   I always thought that was the best way to do it
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:19.300]   But there's a bunch of really hard things to do with that because if you do the the classic
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:26.580]   Headset thing like the NASA guys wearing there are like oculus what you're doing is you're putting screens there and using lenses to put them at infinity
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:35.060]   And then your eyes have to relax and look at infinity right because there and then you so you're creating a tension between your
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:41.460]   Your eyes sense of where it should be looking because it assumes that it should be focusing closer for things
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.060]   When it's converging and so on so your eye ends up with getting muscular strains
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.100]   It's trying to resolve those things you and you often end up with a headache from that
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:56.980]   So the voculus rift makes you nauseous because of its poor frame rate this thing the frame rate on this is terrific
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:02.340]   Oh, this this stuff was yeah, it was very slow. Yeah, but the but the other thing was that
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:08.100]   What they're able to do now with optics is they're able to by having
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.220]   multiple lenses and multiple light sources
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:18.180]   from actually produce light that is focused at different distances so they can make it so it is so it's it's like the
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:24.820]   What's that camera call that takes the photograph that's always in focus? Yeah, it's that same technology of light pipes and having lots of different
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:30.500]   Next distances you can you there's starting to be able to construct glasses that can actually give you
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.940]   Um an overlay that isn't going to give you parallax errors
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:38.340]   Um because of that problem. So that's the thing. I think I'm not sure how much of that Microsoft had in what they showed
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.980]   I think they had some of it and and it's some very subtle and deep optics stuff going on there
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.780]   Here's the force. Here's the oh no, no, that's not dumb baker
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.380]   I thought I saw it there is that
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:53.140]   The fourth doctor who
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:59.060]   Maker in this was the um, it's like a narrator. What's the Cortana? No, he's he's he's your intelligence system
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:03.140]   1990s Robert table developed a pioneering
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.900]   I reckon if this is up on vimeo just search for hyperland. It's worth watching
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:13.620]   It's because it gets huge amounts it part of it is a history lesson of how hypertext happened and we they interviewed Ted nelson
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.100]   um, van der bar bush to show a bunch of stuff
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:22.740]   Um, but a chunk of it then comes into speculation and what might happen and it's fascinating because the web isn't in it
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.180]   It's all these things that aren't quite the web they didn't find him burn his lee
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.460]   But it is it's like just before the web happened with all but
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:34.020]   All the parallel all the parallel universes that are around that and it ends with a lot of VR
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:38.580]   Speculation, which is you know, only now suddenly come to reality as the stuff catches up
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.460]   So if you if you've got an hour, I would recommend
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:46.340]   I remember seeing it way back. This this is what's so interesting about
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:51.700]   Uh, technology is the kind of the discontinuity of inventions you can predict things like VR
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.780]   But you can nope not tell when it will happen
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.220]   And and you can say well hyperlinking might make a lot of sense
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:02.900]   But you can't see exactly how it will emerge this well movie was made exactly as Tim burners lee starts
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.380]   To create the first world wide web
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:12.980]   And I remember writing I was writing about business and the stock market for for the newspaper here and and I was writing about the
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.460]   The big cable companies
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.580]   Trying to build their own internets
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:25.940]   So they they saw the whole thing, you know, people buying tv shows and people downloading movies and people listening to music
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.260]   But they each wanted to build their own
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:33.540]   System and so like like the the one in france where you'd have to have a specific terminal
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.420]   And it would be run by your cable company. So the exact opposite of sort of the open
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:42.980]   Internet, but they were building them they were spending billions of dollars to build these things
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.580]   and luckily, you know, the web came along and
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:52.900]   And it got traction before those things did or we'd be right where we are now except it would be
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.580]   You know, comp you serve instead of google cloud
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:02.820]   There are many many universes all happening at the same time and we're just yes picking one to
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.900]   the end of the day
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:10.500]   Matthew engram from giga ohm kevin marks more to come with this week in google i showed today brought to you by my mattress
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.380]   Hey, yeah
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:18.660]   Well, you get a great mattress. You got you got to tell the people you got to tell the world my mattress casper

[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:30.100]   For a fraction of the cost because they don't bother with showrooms. They ship you the mattress
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:34.980]   I was talking to somebody the other day. So, you know, I actually we had a king mattress in our new apartment
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:39.300]   We couldn't get it in that door because there's two big so we had to get two twins with a casper
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:44.580]   This is a queen size mattress in a box of size. But I don't know. That's like a little one of those little dorm room refrigerators
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.980]   You open it up you take it out it goes
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:53.540]   And it's amazing. It is the best most comfortable mattress you've ever had by marrying two technologies latex and memory foam
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:58.900]   You get a mattress with just the right sink and bounce it's firm, but soft. I don't know how they do it
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.060]   It's kind of magic plus you could buy it online easily now. You might say well wait a minute
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:08.500]   How can I lie on it first? They actually had a booth at ces, but you don't have to go to ces
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.500]   mattresses
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:14.500]   Five minutes on a mattress and a showroom is not going to tell you whether that mattress is going to be good for a long time

[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:18.660]   I sleep on a casper. I love my casper. In fact, I liked it so much. I got it for my son who's uh, you know, he's in a dorm room
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:23.700]   And uh, well, he actually ran a house, but it's you know, it was like upstairs and uh
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:28.500]   He needed a mattress. I said, well, wait a minute. I'll just I'll just have casper send you one. He loves it
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.900]   I noticed you were wearing the fancy pajamas. Yes
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.300]   Those are
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:39.940]   Not the sponge sponge bomb. No, no that sponge Bob. Are you saw me in the sponge Bob jammies? Yeah
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.420]   Next time I'll use those
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.220]   Those are my thirst and hell of the third jammies
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:49.620]   Actually got those
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:56.260]   And it's worth telling the story about I got those I did a commercial many many years ago for Clark's shoes
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:02.260]   Uh a tv commercial in which I had to hang from a bar
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:07.220]   and drop into a bed they were showing how comfortable Clark's shoes were
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:11.380]   And they shot it with a soup. It was still being shoot. They're still shooting in video
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.540]   That's how long ago it was super slow mo camera
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:18.740]   So and then the bed would collapse under me and they had all this smoke and dust would come up
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:24.820]   And I did about 20 takes but they got me special jammies. That's them still have the jammies. Yeah
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.380]   Someday I'll find that Clark's shoe had
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.100]   Thanks to youtube probably exists
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:37.060]   Uh moving okay, so we'll talk more about microsoft. I think there's a lot more to say it was a very very significant
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:41.460]   I think announcement uh today from microsoft, but of course it's very easy with these
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.900]   To get kind of sucked into the reality distortion field. So
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:49.620]   Paul and mary joe will join us uh just a little later on this afternoon. They're in the briefings right now
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:53.140]   We'll have more to tell us about microsoft's plans
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.220]   For the future
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:43:03.060]   President obama gave his uh state of the union last night and uh there was a lot of concern about what he would say about hacking
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.820]   uh
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.820]   they had telegraphed that uh
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:14.260]   That uh they were going to uh strengthen the hacking laws using the the reko act and racketeering laws to make it really
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:16.260]   problematic for hackers
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.860]   Um, he he actually did talk about cyber security
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:25.940]   Uh in the state of the union if we don't act he said we'll leave our nation and economy vulnerable if we do
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:30.580]   We can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities. Blah blah blah
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.380]   new cyber security legislation
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.140]   uh, which uh
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.700]   At this point I think after the sony attack
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.380]   Might be easy to push through and maybe that's why
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:48.340]   Uh the white house and the fbi were so anxious to pin it on north korea
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:53.060]   Makes it a lot easier for them to get this legislation through no foreign nation
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:59.780]   No hacker should be able to shut down our networks steal our trade secrets or invade the privacy of american families
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:03.780]   And this is when you know this is bs, especially our kids
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:05.860]   Right
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:11.540]   As soon as they mention the kids you know consider the children hacking takes such a toll on our children
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.500]   That's when you know
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.500]   That they're trying to pull the wool over your eyes
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.620]   um
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.580]   So
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:24.500]   They don't they do want to raise the punishment for hacking they do want to bring uh racketeering
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:30.660]   Into this which means that you could for instance have all of your personal effects confiscated by law enforcement
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:36.580]   Even without being charged of a crime simply because you say we're in a hacking chat room
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.700]   um
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:45.700]   I think nobody's going to oppose the idea of protecting american soil against the you know evil hackers, but
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:50.260]   This will be interesting to see what the response is to this you any thoughts
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:55.460]   No, no
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.460]   Just me sitting here
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.700]   Consider the children
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:05.540]   I think kevin's talking kevin's talking, but not it nothing's coming out of his mouth because yes a plane went over again. Sorry
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.860]   um
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:14.980]   So this is more of a that they want they want to opposing things which is the problem. This is the problem of all security. This is like cameron
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.700]   Exactly cameron. So cameron
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.940]   um
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:22.500]   To slam explain both the barman camera and electioneering now
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:27.460]   Um, a barber can't really get much past. So he's he's able to go back to campaigning
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.460]   Which is really good at throwing out ideas and saying well
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.700]   He's these great things to do, but these guys will stop you doing it
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.140]   um
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.140]   And so he's able he's able to go back to
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:40.260]   proposing things that are slightly less practical, but he is still pushing some of these you know security state agenda things
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.660]   camera
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.660]   May
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:48.660]   I get this yeah, oh, hang on
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:53.220]   Let me get a bit go ahead do camera. Do you've got a bridge accent? You should do camera
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:56.660]   So cameron is your prime minister not mine
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.220]   so to speak
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:00.180]   um
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.380]   He's um
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:05.220]   He's campaigning to his base and so he is the conservatives campaign on law and order
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:10.260]   And so he they are saying we should not that these terrorists have any ways of communicating that no we cannot intercept
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:14.420]   Even though he is a mean brief i think you understand this properly and knows knows what's going on
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:18.180]   But he doesn't doesn't matter too much if he can be can write there at the sound bite
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.900]   Um, I don't even think he believes half the stuff he said
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.660]   um, I
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:26.100]   I'm not sure that's true. I think he he believes some of that stuff, but he knows that
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.260]   but also he's saying stuff that will play well to the
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.980]   conservative base which is law and order and
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.980]   Terrible foreigners and things you know, there's there's a sort of senate tropes that come out there
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:39.860]   And where where is the bombers doing the opposite and doing the things that play to his base that what did wind up his opposition
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:45.060]   So there's there's a there's a bit of politicking in it, but there is some underlying you know problems here that are
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.580]   um
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:50.180]   actually very hard which is how do you decide between the
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:51.220]   um
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:56.100]   the interests of the people who want to keep stuff private and the interests of law and order and trying to see what
[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.580]   you have and the answer is you have due process
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:03.540]   Um, you know, you have the the the notion of the fruit with the poison tree
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:10.100]   You have the fourth amendment. You have the bill of rights in the uk. There's a whole you know, the european gopf human rights do all this
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.380]   um
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.100]   and
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:18.980]   This upsets that the professional spies because they're you know, they believe that they are above the law because historically they have been
[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:22.180]   um, and so there is this tension where you get
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.620]   strange things being you know defended by
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:30.660]   Groups because they're being briefed by the spy saying we have to do these terrible things to keep us are safe
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.260]   um
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.140]   and
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:38.180]   You know, we have to intercept communications and you know, they're they're they can point to you know, um
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:42.580]   Turing and the imitation game and saying look if you hadn't correct the codes we wouldn't have won the war
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.860]   um
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.140]   But that in some ways and that's that's that's that's broadly true
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:51.780]   But in some ways that's also like the sort of scary mainstream propaganda
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:56.180]   For torture that we've had in us media for the last 10 years 15 years
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:48:00.660]   um as we have programs like 24 and um
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:07.300]   Well too many to mention where um at some point there is a that they use the plot device of this person know something
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.980]   We have to torture them until he tells us that dark 30. Yeah, yeah
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:16.180]   Um, but you know, it's it's like alias, you know that did it. It's not it's not like some
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:20.500]   It's not just the the dark ones. It is like this is a mainstream trope in
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:26.740]   um in police investigations stuff as well. So there is this there is this problem that
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:34.580]   Um, it is very easy to write these good and evil narratives and say if they're the bad guys then anything we do is justified
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:41.860]   Um, and that is that is what what draws this in and it worries me when the the politicians are dancing along that line as well
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:45.940]   But particularly it worries me for the encryption stuff because in those cases
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:51.620]   It's less clear cut than the torture stuff torture is is fairly obviously appalling and that you're you're
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:59.860]   They to some extent they understand they're defending something completely appalling and therefore they are they have to assume the lack of humanity and the other
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:04.580]   Um to do this. So the you know the american sniper debate at the moment is is literally about
[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.380]   um clean eastward making a film that presents
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:13.700]   Um all Arab people as subhuman and therefore you can this guy is justified in in shooting them on side
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.300]   And that that's pretty much the the message of the film and it's you know
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:22.820]   It's a very well made film and lots of people like it like it and that is not that different a message from
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:25.460]   um mainstream
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:29.940]   You know war film police film, whatever that you have the good guys who
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:35.300]   Um who are somehow impervious to bullets, but they can they can kill people with one shot
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:39.380]   Um and that's and you know you don't think about that because they're the bad guys
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:41.700]   It's it is it is a you know
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:48.740]   uh a video game worldview that um plays out as a as immediate trope as well and that is that is a more
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:55.460]   Worrying one that the encryption one is harder to explain to people because it doesn't map to their experience as much
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.020]   People do understand that they want their own stuff to be secure
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:04.260]   But they do want the police to be able to keep an eye on the terrorists and that is it's going to be very hard to explain this
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.180]   particularly as
[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:10.980]   As we get to the point where they're saying you have to provide a way for us to read these messages and the companies say
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.140]   We've designed it so that we don't have any way to read these messages
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:16.020]   That was the whole point of that software update. That's why what's happened
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.820]   I message can no longer read the contents because we were sick of
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.900]   Having to get into you long
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.340]   Um and it's and it's doing the exact thing that we were talking about in the first stripe
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:30.340]   Which is damaging the customer's ability to have faith in that the company is looking at for the stuff
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.740]   but I gotta admit if I'm uh
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.620]   If I'm in the nsa and I all of a sudden
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:39.940]   You know the terrorists are using what's apt to communicate and I can't see it
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.580]   That's of concern, right?
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:47.140]   I can understand why they'd be worried about that. Uh admittedly, uh,
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:53.860]   I'm sure the people at the nsa understand the implications of what camera and called for but admittedly it doesn't seem an unreasonable thing to say
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:55.860]   We should be able to see into what's app
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:51:00.500]   Uh, and if there's and you said if there's due process, so maybe I have to get a search warrant
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.020]   and uh
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:08.260]   And you know go to the fiza court and say I uh, we think that there are two people having a conversation planning an attack
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:13.140]   They're using what's app. I want to be able to see what they're doing. What's app maintains
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:19.860]   a uh a special uh key in escrow something like skipjack where uh, uh
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:25.380]   Given due process given a warrant they can hand that key over to government which can then read those
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:29.700]   Transactions is that unreasonable part of the problem is that the
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:36.100]   Five as a court and and those all those deliberations are completely secret and they
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:41.380]   Apparently routinely rubbers, but they have to be secret or the terrorists will know what we're doing
[00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:45.220]   I'm by the way, but if you haven't figured this out playing devil's advocate here. Go ahead
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:51.220]   I think there's a there there is a pretty good argument for against, um, sort of mass
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:59.220]   collection of of data and surveillance that that is not targeted at anyone in particular because
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:04.100]   There's some evidence at least to show that that that is almost completely useless
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:08.820]   Great article in the new yorker this week, uh, along this line called the whole haystack by mathias
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:12.340]   Schwartz in which he makes a very strong case that in fact
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:18.820]   There is no value to mass collection of data that you cannot yet use that data in any way that will help you
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:24.900]   And what he uses is an example the fact that we have already known almost every major terrorist attack in the last 15 years
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:29.380]   Has been committed by people we already know about and are already watching
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.820]   And in fact paris is a good example of those who were known
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:38.660]   Uh, those people were known to police known to the authorities and yet still it couldn't be prevented
[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:44.180]   Um, the size of the the data is not the lack of data. Isn't that the problem? No, exactly
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:47.060]   It's filtering it and understanding it and we just don't have
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:53.300]   Tools and I think what the nsa is hoping is that they can just accumulate this data and then eventually
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:56.500]   They'll figure out how to actually go through it and find the bad guys
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:01.860]   But at least to this point there is no evidence that that has occurred right you'll hear a quote often
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:04.580]   uh from uh
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:08.340]   Congress or perhaps law enforcement saying 54
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:11.700]   Cases, uh, there have been 54 cases
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:18.820]   Uh, at least 50 threats that have been averted because of this mass collection of data president obama said that at a press conference
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:24.420]   He says lives have been saved, but in this article, uh, matias goes through those 54
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:32.660]   Cases and he quotes patrick lehi senator from vermont who says that numbers plainly wrong these weren't all plots and they weren't all thwarted
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:37.940]   Uh according to a deputy, um, uh, uh, uh
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:41.620]   CIA director, um, allexander
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:44.180]   Only there's really only one example
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:49.380]   Of a case where bulk phone records stopped terrorist activity one
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:52.900]   so, um, and that was uh
[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:57.540]   What also there's the the fact that most of these stopped terrorist plots, um
[00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:00.260]   In the last few years have actually been organized by the fbi
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:04.020]   Um, there was not the nsa not the nsa
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.700]   But no, but there was an intercept article about this which basically they said yes
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:12.660]   They've stopped all these terrorist plots except that these terrorist plots involved an fbi informant
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:18.900]   Finding some loner and and offering him a quarter of a million dollars to go and blow something up
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.860]   And then arresting him before he blew anything up and saying look we stopped a plot
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:25.700]   It was like I think you actually started a plot and then stopped it as well
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:32.580]   Uh, this is what happens when you get credit for stopping plots
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:36.020]   It's like we haven't had enough plots we better find some more plots and stop them
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:40.580]   And I just don't see how even if there were a dozen cases
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.780]   Which there are not so let's say there's five
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:47.700]   Even if there were does that justify the kind of routine
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:51.700]   you know surveillance and breach of of billions
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:56.260]   Human rights that we're talking about on the scale that's that's unprecedented
[00:54:56.260 --> 00:55:01.940]   General Alexander is the head of the nsa or former head of the nsa by the way, not not the sei
[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:06.500]   Um, he he called it and this is the the name of the article the whole haystack
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:10.580]   Which is basically all electronic conversations going on
[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:16.340]   Uh, route around not just in the united states everywhere at all times forever
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:24.420]   Every time I think about the nsa's bulk collection. I think of I think of that scene in in indiana jones when they take the
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:29.940]   The warehouse. Yeah, yeah, and they put it in a box and they hide it in a way in a government
[00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.740]   whatever that's where the data is
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:36.260]   Uh
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:39.780]   legislating for unicorns. I don't know what this is about. I've got to read this here real quickly
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:42.660]   Uh, oh, this is the idea of
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:49.940]   This is good. Should we play this video? This was you must have put this in your kevin marks
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:54.260]   This is from uh from parlament
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:56:02.500]   This would cause huge problems for anyone who relies on secure online transactions for their banking for online shopping or anything else
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.820]   jeopardizing britains reputation
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:08.740]   Safe place to do business. Let me let me get out of this genuinely what the home safety wants to do
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:13.940]   And does she really want to join the small group of countries such as iran bellerus malder and kazak star
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:18.100]   Trying to ban encryption. Wait, let's get that. That's that those are the big four by the way
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:19.940]   Let's go. Let's go
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:23.700]   Let's let's go once more and listen to those which countries are doing this spanning encryption
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:29.860]   Say mold over. I think he did
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:32.740]   Bellerus malder and kazak star
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:35.860]   Boulder malder. I don't even know what that is
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:41.140]   I have to say to my honorable friend that we are determined that as far as possible
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:48.180]   There should be no safe spaces for terrorists to communicate. I think would have I love farland
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:49.380]   should be
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:50.180]   a
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:55.140]   principle of view and it was a principle that the prime minister reiterated in prime ministers questions today
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:57:02.420]   I would have hoped that that would have been a principle that actually could have been held by everybody across all parties in this house of commons
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:08.260]   Certainly as far as i'm concerned as far as the conservative party is concerned our manifesto will
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:15.140]   Make it clear that we will introduce legislation needed to restore our declining communications data capability that fella by the way
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:22.100]   Julian cupards to make a member of parliament from I don't know where and security intelligence agencies
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:26.100]   Okay
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:37.540]   And that woman is tressa may she's the home secretary the woman who in in fact would according to david kameron
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:39.620]   Be signing the warrants that would allow them to crack
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:44.900]   Into encryption so I mean the problem is when she says there will be no safe place
[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:53.620]   When she says there will be no safe place for for terrorists to communicate that means there will be no safe place for anyone
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:55.620]   mean to communicate
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:58.980]   Because how do you differentiate right go ahead and come after it's over
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:02.820]   Right now that that came from the from the post
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:08.820]   That described this is legislating for unicorns. This is what you can say there will be no safe place for terrorists
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.820]   But it doesn't you can actually write legislation
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:13.460]   Does this
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:18.260]   You can say we will create introduce legislation that that make sure we have plenty of unicorns in the uk
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:22.580]   But it doesn't you can actually make it happen and that's that that's effectively what they're promising
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:29.460]   They and so they're being a little cynical about this because they've come up with this nice nice formula of
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:34.100]   There could be those safe space for terrorists, but if you actually want that to be true
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:40.340]   you need to um do that through a lot of that through physical surveillance as well as through interception and
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:42.900]   just to say that we can take just
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:46.100]   To say they can do it purely through interception is nonsense
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:49.220]   Um, but what you have to do then is follow that up with
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:54.740]   You know look details surveillance and and you know planting cameras on people and those kinds of things
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:58.100]   Which is also in obviously intrusive and requires warrants and things like that
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:00.420]   and part of the the sort of
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:02.420]   um
[00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:24.500]   Reason the nsa and gc
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:29.700]   Um, I haven't it hasn't introduced initially proposal. I hadn't hadn't seen mom
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:33.540]   Well, of course sispa's back whether sispa has a chance of passing is unknown
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:37.540]   But that's the the bill that has failed congress several times that proposes
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:42.580]   Sharing of data from the nsa with companies like google and microsoft
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:46.340]   So that google and microsoft could get right in there and help them fight terrorism
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:51.220]   Um, that has been turned down several times due to lack of privacy protection
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:54.180]   And there's a British equivalent has been called the snoopers charter
[00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.900]   Much better name
[00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.420]   That's not the official name because that's what that's what it's been successfully labeled
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:04.180]   If the last five times they tried to induce in department over two different governments
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.660]   So I did sound like that obama was endorsing it
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:10.820]   He endorsed enabling better communication between the government and companies about cyber threats
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:16.180]   That sounds like sispa he had he had said before I will veto this if it passes never did pass
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.660]   but perhaps he's changed his turn
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.660]   the
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:24.100]   The cyber threats that there's a bit of a dance around that one because the cyber threat staff
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:31.780]   The better communication community communities and governance about cyber threats was a separate program where they were was talking about data breaches and
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:36.020]   Information pooling about that that was that was where that stuff came from
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:42.100]   Um, so they may be blurring lines there deliberately to make that to make that use that form from it
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:48.260]   But you know what so I we do a few meetings and things about that and the idea there was there is this problem that
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.100]   um
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:52.100]   companies have information about
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:56.420]   Data breaches and advanced persistent threats and those kinds of of things
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:59.940]   And it would be useful to share those other companies, but they don't want to share them in competitors
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:02.660]   Can the government be the broker for legal information back and forth?
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:10.420]   Which actually ignores how security really works, which is there is a network that shares that which is all the security ops guys at your company
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:14.100]   Who know all the security ops guys the other companies and when some of this stuff shows up
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:18.660]   They call their mates and say look out for this one. I think it's just fascinating that a bomb
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:26.820]   It won't it won't actually work and that's that's you know, the way the internet has been secured reasonably well so far has been through those kinds of
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.980]   um back channels and
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.820]   you know security communities and
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:31.860]   risks and
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.060]   Comp risks and all those the security community that we know and love
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:36.180]   um
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:42.420]   And it's very hard to reconstruct that in in legislative form and the government people know that too. They are you know
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:45.940]   They employ people who are in in that group of people as well
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:51.780]   So there's a set of people who understand that and there's a set of people who are trying to build a you know management structure on top of it that
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.940]   that makes it um
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:02:00.180]   That historically has been very hard to actually do successfully if you if you start trying to tell your security people how to share things with people
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.580]   That you're gonna have a bad day
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:07.540]   Um because you will lose you will lose the better security engineers if you told them they can't talk with people outside the company
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:10.980]   This what's really amazing is this reminds me of uh
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:13.140]   1984 is what do they call it?
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:16.580]   True speak where you know truth is lies war is peace
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:22.500]   Obama says uh in order to protect our the privacy of american families
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.220]   We have to snoop
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:29.060]   Yeah, and it's just it's like this no though. That's the opposite
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:31.300]   Uh, it's like nobody's listening
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:34.340]   But we've always been at war with Eurasia
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:37.220]   exactly
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:42.980]   In order to protect no foreign nation no hackers should be able to shut down our networks steal our trade tickets or
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.420]   invade the privacy of american families
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:48.980]   We're gonna do that. That's our job
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.500]   Right
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.380]   If anybody's gonna invade anybody's provide privacy, it's gonna be us
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:56.100]   right
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:03:03.460]   And also and also the the the the other thing is the shadow there about american persons and non american persons
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:09.540]   Because all the all the um legislative stuff says oh we must protect because of the fourth amendment
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:15.940]   We can't snoop on american persons right and which isn't you know has a slightly generous definition includes me despite my lack of citizenship
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:21.220]   Because I live here and so on um well they but they interpreted that to say
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:25.620]   If we can assume that more than half this conversation is not american persons
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:28.100]   We are allowed to snoop on it. Oh, and then we'll collect the whole thing anyway
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:31.780]   So that was how that was how they danced their way through that for the nsa
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:37.300]   And they're also allowed to use a sort of best gas as to whether someone is a foreign citizen
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:40.340]   So if you say something if you mentioned sotty, raby, I
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:43.300]   Boom your foreign citizen. You must be a foreign citizen
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:47.620]   Well, i'm sitting here with two foreign citizens this entire show is being recorded by the nsa
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:52.420]   For future reference because clearly i'm communicating with ferners
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:04:00.900]   Luckily the nsa is collecting the non us part and the canadian and british governments are collecting the non us part so
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:06.980]   It's like no work that they have any information sharing agreement. So is that true? So the us
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.100]   um
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:12.660]   Can connect information on non us citizens and the britains can connect information on non-british citizens
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:16.260]   I think they just connect on british citizens do because they don't have a fourth amendment there
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:19.060]   Um, but they have an information sharing agreement
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:22.660]   So they can share the information that they have on each other citizens with each other
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:26.820]   Um and join the dots up. So that's the that's how they circumvent that particular
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:31.860]   It reminds me of a great novel and the later shan connery movie called the anderson tapes shan connery
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:35.140]   Creates a plan to rob every
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:41.300]   Apartment in a large wealthy apartment building and it and as soon as the robbery happens
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:48.020]   All the law enforcement agencies that have been tapping every phone immediately races all records of this thing being planned
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:51.300]   They don't want to know we were listening, but we don't want anything to do with it
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:59.620]   Um, I should point out that there's an even more uh, sinister nexus that between hollywood and content creators who would also like to use
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:05.540]   These laws to protect copyright and there's been no attempt by the federal government to separate the yet interests
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:12.100]   Fighting terrorism with the interests of fighting copyright when they talk about hackers. That's just as much people stealing
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:18.340]   HBO go passwords. Yeah, and yes, and we've seen that from sopa and pepa and even before
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.500]   Copyright maximalists and sort of you know content
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:30.820]   Massive content empires are more than happy to to cozy up to whatever it takes to get sort of strong
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:38.180]   Legislation passed and if they want to kind of foam and fear about about terrorists and so on because that's what it takes
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:40.180]   They're more than happy to do that
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:45.700]   They want to add racketeering any act which is indictable on any of the following provisions, etc, etc
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:47.700]   um
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:53.060]   Means that you know if if you share your hbo password with somebody else you can get 10 years
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.700]   And they could take your house
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:06:04.020]   Uh, and and it merely relies at this point. We're merely relying on the goodwill on the kindness of the court system to keep that from happening
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:08.580]   And if you preach the terms of use of a website, you know, that's effectively hack
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:11.380]   um
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:16.980]   Such a person's interest in a property realer personal that was used or intended to be used to commit or facilitate the commission of such a violation
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:20.420]   Any property realer personal constituted or derived from any gross proceeds?
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:25.460]   All this goes to law enforcement in fact even without an indictment if you're a co-conspirator
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:29.140]   Unbelievable
[01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:32.820]   Unbelievable and so this is this is this is the these are the proposals
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:35.460]   Uh, the white house has put forward
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:42.020]   To protect us and our privacy against them ferners and while we're at it. Let's just shut down all the bit torrents too
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:47.540]   And it's going to be the same as as you know before it was if you had
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:52.900]   Tools that would allow you to break encryption on a cd or dvd
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.180]   That was a crime. Yep
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:57.380]   If you have encryption tools that will allow you to protect your computer
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:02.900]   From snooping by the government that will be a crime. I think that still is a crime that's section 1201
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:08.260]   Um, um, cori doctor. I just announced that he he's going back to the eff to try and get that repealed
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:10.420]   That was good for him today. She saw that good man
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:13.220]   So that that's encouraging because he
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:17.540]   He was the eff's international ambassador for goodwill or whatever
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:23.700]   He did wonderful that basically he would go to all these um drm meetings and
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:27.860]   Understand what was going on and write it down and publish it
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:33.140]   This was this was um and also like gather all these like drafts and things that
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:35.620]   Um that they were trying not to publish and publish them
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:41.060]   Um and that so that was a big part of like trying stopping this stuff being much worse than it is
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:46.100]   Cori doctor on the eff aimed to eradicate drm in our lifetime
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:51.140]   That's a good goal. We pledge before this decade is out
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:08:00.020]   To eradicate drm in fact they even use a rocket ship apollo 1201 they clearly understand the uh reference
[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:05.780]   A mission to eradicate drm in our lifetime. Well good good on you cori we cori is
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:08.580]   so well spoken so smart
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.140]   um and uh
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:14.660]   I I agree with him absolutely 100
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:18.740]   Although I have to admire you know, I have to point out that larry lessek who for a long time
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.140]   This was his his uh his call
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:29.060]   Realized that then nothing was ever going to happen unless we fixed how we finance elections and has focused everything that he can uh all his efforts
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:35.220]   Now on uh on campaign finance reform even creating a pack. This is brilliant
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:41.380]   We've talked about this before a pack a political action campaign to raise money to lobby
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:45.060]   Members of congress to eliminate lobbying and packs
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:50.260]   You got it, you know, it's the only way to do it. It's good good for larry. I'm gonna feel like larry
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:52.100]   maybe
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:59.940]   Fighting that one sort of dragon was was almost too easy and so we decided to take on an even second one a little bit harder to kill
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:03.940]   It's not enough just to get rid of
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:05.940]   DRM let's
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.020]   Let's get rid of corruption
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:11.620]   entirely because but he does make a point, you know as long as the hollywood is
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:16.820]   Spending money on these members of congress. You're not going to get anybody to do anything
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:20.340]   And it's great if you can add the children and terrorism
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:22.980]   everybody wins
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:27.700]   All right, we're going to call this episode legislating for unicorns. I think let's take a break
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:31.220]   We come back more. We also have a mini change log some new stuff from uh
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:36.580]   Not much not much a nice scoured a short change. I have a change log, but we'll okay good
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:38.660]   I'll save that for my uh my tool of the week
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:42.180]   uh, we're talking right now, uh about
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:48.500]   Google the cloud and the google verse with kevin marks kevin marks calm on the twitter
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:52.660]   He's at kevin marks always a wonderful voice a passionate voice
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:10:00.580]   Uh for open standards and matthew ingram who covers all of this stuff so beautifully on giga ohm

[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:40.500]   Google wants to become well, we know they want to become an isp
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:43.220]   They've gotten a little more serious about
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:46.340]   Google fiber and more communities and now
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:53.060]   Google wants to become a wireless carrier exclusive story from the information fact
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:56.820]   Let me log in because I I pay for the information so I can
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:59.860]   I can read the whole thing instead of the little extra
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:02.340]   Yeah, exactly
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:08.420]   It's worth paying for if you uh, not not already doing that is she let's Jessica less than her team would do a great job
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:14.980]   I asked her said aren't people going to do just what i'm about to do which is subscribe and then read the article out loud
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:17.540]   She says all right
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.100]   People will subscribe because they want to get access to it
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:21.940]   um
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:27.860]   So, uh, and by the way, they mira friday who works with the information has such great context at google
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:29.300]   he's often
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:35.220]   uh breaking scoops google plans to shake up the us wireless market he writes by selling voice plans
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:38.740]   To consumers directly from google through t mobile and sprint
[01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:41.380]   So I guess to become an mvno
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:43.060]   Yep. Yeah
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:48.100]   It's the latest example of how google tries to prod incumbents to change their business business to benefit google
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:50.100]   That's what they do with google fiber
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:55.300]   Show you that it's possible to have a gigabit isp and make money on it
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:59.060]   Google's expected to reach deals to buy wholesale access to
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:03.380]   The carriers mobile voice and data networks. It's codenamed nova
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:05.780]   nich foggs
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:08.500]   is leading in a long time google executive and
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:11.620]   Amir says at launch this year seems likely
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:17.700]   It makes sense in a lot of ways. I mean, I'm I'm kind of surprised they haven't tried it before now
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:22.180]   Disney is an mvno. I mean virgin. I mean there's so many mvno's
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:27.620]   It's an easy thing to do we one of our advertisers ting is a spring nvno. It's an easy thing to do
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.460]   Well, I think
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:33.300]   There's a timing issue here because they couldn't at the point when they were trying to launch android across all carriers
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.500]   They couldn't do this
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:38.900]   Um now where the carriers aren't going to drop android they can do this yep good point
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:43.220]   It's interesting that sprinting mobile are
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:45.140]   Are these carriers already right?
[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:48.260]   Explain to me why sprinting t mobile are willing to have
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:52.340]   These third parties lease wholesale data and sell below their
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:54.660]   retail prices
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:56.660]   offer better plans
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:59.300]   I think both of them are struggling. I guess they need to huh?
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.620]   But it feels like yeah
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:04.420]   So there's there's a you know, there's a fixed cost and a variable cost
[01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:07.780]   So the fixed cost is maintaining the network and growing it and they want to keep doing that
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:12.180]   And then there's a variable cost which is running all the stores and signing people up and recruiting them and so on
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:15.380]   And so if they can offload some of that variable cost stuff to somebody else
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:19.140]   They're happy to do that because they help some of the fixed costs that that's basically how the indiano stuff works
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:20.500]   Um
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:23.860]   The the other thing is that the reason it's those two is that they're the gsm ones
[01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:28.900]   Um, so they're the ones that you're actually straightforward to interoperate with as opposed to
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:33.780]   Verizon, which is weird as anything an AT&T which is which is not quite as weird
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:37.220]   But still slightly odd, right whereas gsm is like the global standard
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:40.660]   You know the reason you can pull sims out of phones and put difference in have them work
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:47.060]   Um broadly is that they use they use gsm and yeah, there are different bands and you have to have different radio frequencies
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:52.820]   And there's it's actually slightly more complicated. I know sprints not though sprints is CDMA carry so they would have one gsm and one CDMA carry
[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:55.620]   Oh, so it's been I think it was okay. I don't know
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:57.860]   That's what's interesting about this is it's both
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:59.620]   Okay
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:03.060]   And I think that's probably why it is both because I think they want to be able to say
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:06.820]   Whatever kind of phone you have you can bring it over. That makes sense. Yeah
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:14.020]   The risk I mean as amir mentioned sprint and T-Mobile their networks are not as robust. They don't have as good coverage
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:17.700]   Uh, yeah, they're the also ran. That's why they're willing to do it
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:20.100]   Exactly
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:25.140]   Uh, the reason that google has held back on this amir rights is because they didn't want to upset wireless carriers
[01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:30.580]   They needed them to carry Android phones now. It's not such a big deal because what's what I just said that
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:33.300]   You just said that sorry
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:37.860]   And the other but okay, then I'll add you just say this the other reason is uh anti trust
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:42.740]   Uh, I think if google would were to come along and say why don't we just buy t-mobile? They could do that
[01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:47.140]   But the likelihood of government approval. I don't know might be might be an unknown
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:52.580]   Um, so this is a great way to do it and they can and as you point out cleverly
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:58.340]   In advance of my insight that now they don't have to worry about pissing off the other guy
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:00.660]   You just said it so eloquently I didn't understand you
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:06.340]   They didn't want to piss off the other guys
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:10.420]   Um
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:12.900]   I you know, I think I'd be tempted
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:17.060]   It wouldn't even have to be less expensive if I thought google was going to deal with me more fairly and have better
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:20.500]   Customer service but google's not exactly known for customer service. Are they?
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:26.180]   Right, but well, it's a trade-off, right? So I had a problem with I used t-mobile because
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:29.860]   Um, I think they were actually services their deals are pretty good. No services good
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:32.900]   But I had a problem last week where my phone stopped working on wednesday
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.380]   Just I was getting on getting on the train to san francisco
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:38.980]   And so when I got to san francisco on wi-fi I was like
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:43.380]   Um tweeting them saying oh, wait my phone stopped working. What's up with this?
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:45.940]   They're like, oh, try to turn it off and I guess like yes
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:47.940]   Yeah, well else
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:49.940]   I'm also trying to bring it back in again
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:53.700]   You know, it is not a physical floor. It's a network floor
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:57.700]   Um, and then then you know after doing that with customer service code. I said, okay. Yeah, you're right
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:01.140]   I'm gonna have to have transfer it to engineering. They'll get back to you within 72 hours
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:04.180]   I was like
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:05.700]   And you know, I
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:08.020]   I wasn't actually going to san francisco for the rest of the week
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:09.860]   So I let it sit for 72 hours
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:13.140]   But you know that got me to san jade and the saturday was like they still haven't fixed this
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:16.340]   And they hadn't responded to me any further for up with updates
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:19.700]   So I went to the shop and said okay, give me a new sim now, please
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:24.180]   And they and that straight forward they gave me a sim and then it worked so clearly it was
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:28.660]   Not necessarily the sim but the networks knowledge of the sim right but it's like
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:33.700]   You should have told me to go to the shop. You have retail shops for this exact purpose
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:36.580]   Why did you tell me to wait 72 hours for engineering to look at it?
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:41.780]   So it's one of those like yeah, but the thing is google doesn't have retail shops
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:44.660]   So if that happened to me with google they would have to mail me one
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:50.500]   Erica jean or a chat room says she has google fiber and the service is excellent on google fiber
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:54.020]   So google has figured out in a consumer facing business
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:59.380]   At least how to do it right presumably that would apply to a and an mvonah
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:05.780]   And I wonder whether you know, would google would they be prepared to help sprint and t mobile?
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:12.340]   With their networks. I mean if they google has lots of people who understand networks lots of people who they've got tons of fiber
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:16.900]   You know, maybe they can actually help improve those services. Mm-hmm intriguing
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:20.660]   And then by them
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:24.420]   Well, I think that's gotta be the ultimate goals how can you buy it?
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:28.660]   The head of dr telecom was flying a kite about selling t-mobile at night this week. Oh, wasn't he?
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:33.380]   Yeah, so it's awesome. They've been trying to sell that for ages. Remember soft bank was gonna or was that sprint?
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:38.660]   Yeah, wasn't soft bank gonna buy them and then they were their sprint t-mobile merger. Mm-hmm
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:45.140]   But historically the u.s. Government has not looked too kindly on these things. They don't care for Comcast time Warner merge. That's fine
[01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:48.660]   Apparently, you tell kolobius are not as effective
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:53.060]   But but google buying t-mobile would be less of an issue
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:56.980]   Because it wouldn't reduce the same business. Yeah, they're not in the same business
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:20:01.700]   I mean it would it would create vertical integration, which is not a kind of problem, but it's that's that's
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:05.140]   They're less worried about these days. I think I'd be all for it
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:09.380]   Sprint not so much not so crazy about sprint
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:13.860]   I'm I haven't tried sprint. I've been on
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:18.820]   The other three and uh, do you know D-mobile general been really good? They I like t-mobile
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:23.300]   They don't bill you for stuff that you don't want they don't force you to buy a plan that has at end the point
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:25.300]   You can bring any gadget that you like
[01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:27.060]   No
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:32.500]   They they don't get overage charges for the data. You can actually get actual unlimited data though. They do throw you a little bit
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:36.500]   I'd say the ones don't don't they have a global roaming
[01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:42.020]   Play-em-ery do it's not very fast, but it works. It's limited to a hundred and three kilobits
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:47.860]   Um, which is good enough for you know normal like textual stuff. Um, but
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:52.660]   You're supposed to again you're supposed to upgrade it. So it's also in the UK, which was
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:58.980]   And I just quite a while ago like middle of last year. Um, I thought okay, let's try this upgrade path
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:04.900]   So I click the upgrade link and it doesn't work doesn't result properly. Yeah, no way to know who I am or connect to it properly
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:06.180]   so
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:06.980]   You know
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:12.420]   I think they to something said they realized that these billing systems are actually gigantic creaking bits of crap
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:14.740]   And so if they simplify them
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:18.420]   Then the customers are happier because they don't have to interact with the crappy billing systems
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:20.820]   And they don't have to employ people to be on the phone with them
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:22.900]   It probably works out better for them to do flat rates
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:27.940]   You don't be interested google already does something kind of cool with the android device manager
[01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:34.740]   You'd use that on all about android right Jason where well we we actually use it when I was hosting twig
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:37.780]   Well, you did it on twig. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that happened on twig. Yeah, I saw it
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:41.300]   I mean it's very cool. So android device managers only available on nexus phones right now
[01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:45.700]   Presumably if google did do an mvo and oh they would be offering
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:49.220]   You think they would sell it just through the play store or would they have
[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:56.500]   brick and mortar storefronts, how would they do it? I don't know but the device manager what's cool is it's kind of like the fire phone
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:00.340]   Uh, where you can you can get help a live person, right?
[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:04.100]   Yep, you just hit a button and it asks you a couple of questions and then
[01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:10.260]   Connects you like within a minute do that on at and t it was pretty seamless very impressive actually you can do it on at and t
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:13.060]   But I mean never mind but there's no one there
[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:19.140]   Well, i'm on at and t and it still works you have to have a nexus phone. It's just it's on the internet. Yeah
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:24.900]   Um, that's kind of internet on phones now. They have the internet on phones. It's an amazing
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:29.300]   Amazing thing that's tiny, but it's there the little internet
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:33.300]   Apparently sous google makes itself driving cars in livonia
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:39.460]   Is that near maldova and kazak style? I don't know what is that a place or is it a city or
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:43.700]   I believe it's michigan, right? It's it's near it's near detroit. Yeah
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:46.900]   Uh, so I think that's kind of cool
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:50.900]   Well, that means they're gonna actually be able to test them in snow now. So that's really good. Oh
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:53.540]   They didn't work in snow. Did they
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:56.520]   Autonomous vehicles don't work except
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.380]   Only in california
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:02.020]   um
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:09.300]   The goal is to have driverless cars on the market within five years says chris ermsen director of self-driving cars
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.260]   For google. This is an article from the detroit free press
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:17.860]   Apparently if you if you live in detroit, you don't have to be explained where livonia is it sounds like free donia the
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:24.100]   Yeah fictional country where the marx brothers lived but apparently s near detroit or elbonia
[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:26.260]   uh
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:28.500]   That's where all the programmers work in uh, dilbert
[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:35.460]   Uh within five years. Are you ready? That's uh 2020. I'm ready. I'm ready
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:42.900]   I'm but did you get really would you get in one of these and uh and just there's no there's no steering wheel?
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:46.260]   Yeah, you're just getting the car and you say
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:49.780]   Take me home. You say okay google. Oh no
[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:56.020]   Well, we we've we've all seen that uh silicon valley episode with it
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:59.860]   I just realized it could be the problem you're listening to twig and leo starts
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:02.420]   Okay google take me to levonia
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:06.260]   Take me home is levonia
[01:24:06.260 --> 01:24:13.300]   Uh right now, uh, it's legal driverless cars are legal in nevada, florida washington dc california and michigan
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:17.700]   I think though i may be wrong but i remember i remember it was for research purposes
[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:19.780]   Not just you know, you could take it out on the road
[01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:23.700]   You can't just you can't just get in your a ton of his vehicle and drive around
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:29.460]   I think google's gonna have to come up with uh like the the one they have now is cute and everything
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:32.100]   But i think they're gonna have to come up with something a little more
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:37.940]   Jetson style or you know tesla style right for a bunch of people to bother getting in
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:41.540]   jesanna mott's jesanna star it looks a little yeah, but i mean
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:47.060]   So somebody i think was mega mccardle said it's not so much a driver's car as a driverless golf cart
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:51.140]   And i asked ermsen about that
[01:24:51.140 --> 01:25:12.420]   He's 20 k
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:17.620]   Right so i suspect that they're hedging their bets because you can drive golf carts all over the place
[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:26.180]   And you can drive them on roads in in in all those jurisdictions, but they have different constraints on them from um, you know cars and trucks and so
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:30.180]   I think these are also urban primarily urban vehicles, right? They're really yeah, definitely
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:33.460]   Yeah, so they need to be small for parking and from getting around
[01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:37.940]   Yeah, they're these have i think these have a smaller range than the ones that we're using before right
[01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:41.140]   Because it with that you know the other half of that
[01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:43.380]   Thing is tesla, isn't it?
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:48.980]   So tesla is building the electric cars that people actually want because they're very nice cars
[01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:53.620]   And they're talking about driverless teslas and projection that into the heat as well
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:57.060]   And the thing is this isn't going to be like a sudden thing is this is you know
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:26:02.900]   The people who bought tesla roasters don't want driverless cars. They they want to be had a full control and doing all to 16
[01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:05.940]   Sit three seconds away with the hell it is but um
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:08.020]   But i'll tell you the
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:11.060]   The uber is gonna buy some driverless car
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:12.820]   Uber should
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:14.900]   So the first place you're gonna see them is stuff like that
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:20.100]   I think cabs delivery vehicles and then eventually they'll start becoming you know more consumer
[01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:25.620]   That's kind of key too because the autonomous vehicles that google showed us all had steering wheel
[01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:27.460]   They were regular they're retrofitted regular cars
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:33.220]   They had steering wheels and brakes and accelerators these new little pod-like ones. They don't have a steering wheel
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:36.740]   Well, that was the point that was the the in order for them to be able to drive them on the road
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:40.180]   They had to have someone sitting behind the wheel and have a wheel and have a big red
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:45.540]   Case just in case um so that this iteration is we're building them without that
[01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:49.380]   But we're building little cuddly golf carts that that won't hurt anyone if they hit them
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:51.860]   Well, what about the person inside?
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:58.420]   I just think there's psychologically this notion that I am at the mercy of this of this computer
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:03.620]   Whatever it wants to do it's gonna do even if it's drive off a cliff and there's nothing I can do to stop it
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:10.020]   I still like what you and i and jeff were talking about the question about whether the google smart car ai
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:13.220]   Would make a decision to drive you off a cliff
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:16.660]   If the only alternative was you're gonna smash into a bus
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:19.220]   We had some visitors yesterday
[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:24.180]   From switzerland and that their two sons were studying in the united states. I said what are you studying?
[01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:27.220]   They said philosophy. Oh boy, and I said no. No, wait a minute
[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:32.980]   That is the that is the new thing to study because we're we're in a world now where ethicists
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:39.860]   Uh people who are you know deciding what artificial intelligence can and cannot do it is a realm of philosophy
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:46.580]   For as an ethicist that's a perfect thing to study right now. There's gonna be a huge there's gonna be a huge demand
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:49.620]   For people to solve things like this like well, okay
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:58.420]   You're writing the software the car is is could avoid collision in two ways one by steering into a bus full of school children
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:00.740]   two by driving the
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:02.740]   The the person in the car off a cliff
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:05.300]   occupant the occupant
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:12.340]   So, I mean the ethical moral right thing to do would of course be to drive off the cliff save the children's lives
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:16.900]   But but that they're prevented by the third law of robotics. I'm the occupant
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:21.540]   What do you do what do you do? Well, you know, there's
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:24.260]   the
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:27.060]   These these like throw the fat guy under the train things
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:32.980]   Tend to be done by philosophers who don't actually understand physics a fat guy would not stop a train
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:35.540]   A little google car would not stop a school bus
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:37.540]   No
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:42.980]   That's why they make them so small you're gonna die in the occupied dies no matter if you search for car hit school bus on
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:46.180]   On google photos you'll see what a car looks like
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:50.580]   There's a reason school buses don't have seat belts and are way five tons
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:54.580]   Right. It's because that if they hit anything that things suffers a giant battering ram
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:58.100]   uh
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:03.140]   The cost could be an issue the lidar that these things use is $70,000
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:09.700]   Yeah, but that's you know, you can scale that that's because it's you don't make many at the moment right
[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:15.860]   Down all that is you know, it's it's it's mccat optics and sensors and okay
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:20.020]   There's a mechanical thing that makes you rotate that's actually what this guy said. He says not made of unobtain him
[01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:22.980]   Right
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:30.180]   The piece one of the only accidents that a google test car has had was when a driver manually moving one rear ended up rias
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:33.780]   I think that's really the truth and the answer that ethical question is
[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:42.020]   Uh, it's pretty clear. This will these will save lives in net because uh, you know if it's usually yeah, 6 000 people die each year while texting
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:49.060]   But that was the point I was trying to make with the tesla's is that and we were already seeing this with cars is that this isn't a
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:56.500]   uh, once for all change to drive those cars is an incremental change cars do more the deaths from cars are down a lot
[01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:58.820]   Because the cars have more and more stuff built in now
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:05.780]   They have they have lane following they have um overtaking radar warnings. They have you know a whole set of um, you know
[01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:09.700]   ABS systems and things that that can detect what's going on and there's more and more
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:15.780]   Computation going into the cars to make them safer and the driverless thing is just you know an extrapolation point on that curve
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:20.260]   Where at some point like okay keep following the lane sort of that and uh, okay
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:25.860]   Maybe i'll take over you know and also parking parking is the one that you could you can just press a button the cars will do that now
[01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:31.060]   So there's there's a there's a whole set of cars that have pieces of this where they've solved a small part of the problem space
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:36.340]   And the question is can you solve the entire problem space and at the moment it's hard and it requires
[01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:41.780]   um, basically google to scan the entire road in 3d 3 times and decide which bits of
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:44.340]   Um permanent which bits of temporary
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:48.580]   Um, but that that may change over time as there is they they get better at this
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:53.220]   But the thing is of all the things to try and solve is not that you know, it's not that higher bar
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:58.260]   There's so many people are really bad drivers and and crash cars into things
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:03.700]   So many times that it shouldn't be that hard for them to do a bit better to do better
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:10.100]   But I think there's going to be I'll bet you in cultural terms there will be a huge upswing and people driving
[01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:14.820]   giant gas guzzling you know, yeah chargers and for the hummer
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:20.820]   G to's and stuff. Yeah, because they want to maintain control over the vehicle. I don't I own my destiny
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:26.900]   So they'll pay people to remove all the automatic, you know driving things so that they can drive wherever they want
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:32.900]   Yeah, I actually have been in the self parking forward and you would think that that might be a little creepy
[01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:38.100]   It's not it's actually kind of it's really cool the wheel spins and it does the whole thing and it does it perfectly and
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:45.060]   Admittedly, that's not the same as driving down the road, but uh, I think we can get used to this idea that the car drives itself
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:47.060]   We might even like it
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:52.500]   Google is now more trusted source of news than the websites it aggregates
[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:56.420]   That doesn't trust me at all
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:32:03.460]   This is something your the delegates at the world economic form and davos, uh, we'll see this is from the 2015 trust
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:05.620]   barometer
[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:10.100]   Search engines are now more trusted than news sources traditional media on this graph
[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:15.700]   The blue red is online search engines and the the line has crossed and by the way
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:22.260]   Online search engines don't just beat traditional media. They bit beat whatever hybrid media is social media and owned media
[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:24.260]   I don't know what these other things are
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:29.780]   I I actually had a friend who used to be in the newspaper business say that he he didn't understand
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:36.020]   These results he said how can the aggregator of something be more trusted than the thing that produced the content and that makes
[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:39.780]   It makes perfect sense to me because if you go to a single news outlet
[01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:43.780]   You get their news and their version of the news you go to an aggregator
[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:49.140]   Sure, you get news from all over and presumably it's you get a broader sample. It's it's more
[01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:55.460]   Objective I think it depends how you ask it because if you ask do you trust the media then you'll get a note
[01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:59.700]   Then you get a note I trust google more but if do you do you trust you know
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:05.380]   This particular media out of the europeic fan-off whether it's with fox or msnbc or whatever it is
[01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:09.140]   Um, then you'll get a different answer because people sure people will still do like
[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:12.020]   people buy the the media
[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:16.100]   Or subscribe to the media that reinforces their worldview and they will like those
[01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:22.180]   Right and actually emily bell and I had this conversation about when trust came up before
[01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:24.820]   Um, she said, you know some of the best
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:32.420]   Newspapers probably wouldn't score high on the trust ranking because lots of people hate them because they are continually
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:37.940]   Coming up with investigative stories about how they keep going my eyes for your are corrupt and whatnot
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:41.700]   So of course people would say they don't trust them and yet they're clearly
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:46.260]   Better than some of the other ones that you know people fans of fox news would say oh yeah
[01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:50.420]   I totally trust fox news because it tells them what they want to hear but that's a good point
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:55.060]   If you if you use an aggregator you're gonna see them. I think see them all I think we all use aggregators now
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:58.980]   I use aggregator. I don't go stir. I don't go to the new york timesite to read new york times articles
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:04.580]   And in fact, that's whether it's twitter or facebook or flip or flip prismatic
[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:10.820]   All these tools the the default I think for lots of people is I want to see
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:13.540]   Information from more sources
[01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:18.100]   So the idea for newspapers at least that your app is going to be so good
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:24.260]   That people will just download that and then they'll just pay for the stuff that comes from your news organization
[01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:28.980]   Is just it's farcical like people just aren't going to choose that. I don't think or not enough of them
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:32.500]   Well, what they're doing is they're saying, okay, we've got to
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:37.060]   Yeah, they're starting to realize this and it's starting to say we need to build loyalty and we'll give you things and
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:42.180]   Make you feel special about being part of our club, which is I think that's certainly something Jeff's been promoting to them
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:44.260]   Sure, it's kind of what we do here
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:49.620]   I mean, we're not the only source of tech news by any means and most actually in a way we're an aggregator, aren't we?
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:54.820]   Yeah, we aggregate news from a variety of sources and it's the commentators that we add
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:35:00.260]   And actually New York Times has had a fair bit of success with with its app
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:07.380]   New York nYt now in which they have content from other places that is selected by their editors
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:12.100]   That's a form of aggregation something they used to despise. That's where value is added
[01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:15.860]   That's I would presume the add value we had which is
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:18.580]   analysis commentary
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:21.860]   And in fact newspapers were the original aggregators. Let's face it
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:27.220]   I mean, right. Yes stuff from news wires and all sorts of places and packaged it up for you and gave it to you
[01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:35.460]   Uh quick google change log some new things from google actually, uh, there's only a couple first google chrome
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:39.780]   version four zero is out chrome 40
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:45.620]   Uh, i'm on the beta. So my beta is 40 point 0.2214.85
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:52.340]   Hand off now available in os 10 that's kind of neat material design as well
[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:54.820]   um
[01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:57.220]   The new google chrome is here the new google chrome is here
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:00.820]   And as far as change logs go
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:05.220]   Uh a change could be a negative change the death of google glass
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:09.300]   Google glass sales are halted. That's it. It's over
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:11.460]   um
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:13.460]   But google says
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:16.180]   We're still committing to launching a consumer product
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:21.700]   But we're not going to make the glass explorer edition anymore. That's good because it cost 1500 dollars
[01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:24.580]   Was launched two years ago
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:27.220]   the almost two entire years
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:34.820]   The glass team will move out of the google x division. That's their rnd blue sky division and will have its own department
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:38.020]   We're reporting to tony fidel
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:42.660]   chief executive, uh, who was part of the acquisition of next
[01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:49.540]   So that's kind of interesting and i guess this what this says is google's making a devices division
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:57.460]   It's interesting that they're sort of de-emphasizing glass and microsoft is coming out with this. Yeah very sort of glass like
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:00.340]   Yeah, I think that they're clearly betting hugely on yeah
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:06.660]   Well, I suspect this isn't a coincidence. I suspect google got some rumor of that and we're like, okay, let's let's get this out of the way
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:12.420]   Well microsoft does that because obviously the you know google glass is a very imperfect ar in that it's
[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:16.420]   It's not doing the complex problem of overlaying things directly on the world
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:18.260]   It's just giving you a little screen in the corner
[01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:21.060]   Um, and that's that's a sub feature of the the broks of does
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:25.220]   But what it will actually do is say that thing over there and draw a red ring around it and let you go and get it
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:29.380]   um, and that's a much harder problem and you know that google is working on that too
[01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:31.220]   um and they're
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:35.620]   The reason they're earwearing this hardware is they're probably going to be releasing something like that, but um
[01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:40.260]   They're possibly being cagier about it. Then the microsoft is being with this
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:43.540]   Well, there's the magically bright. Isn't that the thing there?
[01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:47.700]   The sort of oculus style. Yes. They bought magically. Yes
[01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:52.100]   It makes sense that google would separate all of these into device a device division
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:57.940]   Magic leaf is more like the stuff that microsoft showed because the microsoft staff was built by the people did connect
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:04.580]   And a lot of that is about the 3d sensing and getting that stuff right and magic leap is that piece of it not the 3d rendering side of it
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:06.580]   Okay
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:07.940]   magic leap
[01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:09.940]   It was a $2 billion
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:12.420]   Startup that was basically in stealth
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:15.060]   um
[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:18.180]   Raised a lot of money and it turned out they were building
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:24.740]   Kind of augmented reality glasses, right? How how close are these to what microsoft showed off?
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:27.620]   I mean, I see the finger commands and
[01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:30.900]   It's very similar. Yeah
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:33.460]   Given the video I showed from
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:36.020]   25 years ago is you know, this
[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:40.980]   These aren't that novel ideas. In fact, the patents on a lot of this stuff have actually expired
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:44.740]   Right. All right, even this showing a data glove there that nasa guy was wearing in the
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:46.980]   Right
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:50.260]   That was coming out of it right no wires. It's
[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:53.780]   The difference is that the this stuff is that the
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:57.780]   The connect thing and the magic leap thing are both doing
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:02.340]   Lidar type things of saying okay, your hand is there your hand is there your hand is there
[01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:05.380]   Um, I can model where your hand is and understand what you're doing with it
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:08.740]   And therefore use that as a gesture without you having to actually distract yourself in
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:16.100]   Do you think I mean it looks so weird like so they're showing somebody typing on a virtual keyboard
[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:21.460]   And and and so really it just I mean you're standing there going like this
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:26.180]   Hmm. Do you think people will accept that notion and we'll just get kind of used to that
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:29.620]   People accept a lot of weird things
[01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:33.780]   Accepting type you on glass which everyone said they wouldn't say but there's a physical thing you type it on
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:36.260]   Yeah, but doesn't have any resistance
[01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:39.140]   I'm thinking about people looking at you thinking you're such a dork
[01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:44.420]   You would probably do it on a table surface or something. Yeah, and do it in private. I think
[01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:49.300]   Is this better? I guess it's better because it's programmable and
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:53.460]   What's such a finger thing go up? What's that?
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:40:02.180]   Someone wearing a keyboard. I've got productivity in my middle finger and i'm not afraid to use it. I know that looks painful
[01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:08.500]   That doesn't actually look what I guess you stick your hand out and then you can use your other hand
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:12.660]   It's on your hands for the click. Yeah, yeah
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:14.100]   Okay
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:19.780]   To remember which part of your finger has the no you don't because you see shows you shows you're seeing it
[01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:22.900]   It's going to overlays. Yes. I don't know
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:26.580]   I'm glad i'm getting old. I probably won't have to worry about this
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:33.460]   You'll be grumpy like me because you can't hear the other mouse
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:36.260]   Is yet there's no mouse
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:41.060]   Damn kids, but it is exactly and this reminds me so much of so many, you know
[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:44.100]   fantasy videos we've seen
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:48.900]   Apple had the knowledge navigator thing. I mean this is all kind of in that Microsoft
[01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:51.300]   Been talking about this for a while actually
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:56.500]   You already have a room opened would you like to close existing room and auto map contents of room?
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:00.820]   Would you like to auto map contents of room in existing room or would you like to cancel?
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:02.980]   Clippy
[01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:05.300]   I wouldn't like to take a nap, please
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:12.100]   You look to delete all the contents of every room you've ever created accident
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:19.060]   In in these living room this man has pulled up the pod interface what the applications calls a mini workstation
[01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:22.340]   For the user that ensconces their entire view
[01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:25.540]   Sounds lovely. Yeah, I
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:28.260]   Yes, this is magic leap
[01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:31.300]   So, uh, did you say google bought them?
[01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:34.420]   They did wow
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:36.580]   Yep
[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:39.140]   Even though nobody really knows what they're doing
[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:44.180]   Here's the hula hoop interface. That's what they call this thing. That's all around you the hula hoop interface
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:46.980]   But it's available even on the couch
[01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:53.460]   Well, you wonder why you bother being on the couch if you can just lie down in bed
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:57.780]   I don't want it. Yeah, that's exactly right. And I don't want to have to hold my arm out either
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:04.340]   Then it's wallie right you're floating on a levitating couch that I wanted I just want to think it and it happens
[01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:06.340]   I don't have to move around
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:10.340]   I think the the first thing I thought of when I saw the hollow lens
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:15.940]   Was a project that I think MIT was working on years ago because I think they were using
[01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:23.140]   Quake or doom or something like that as a as a model and they were trying to get VR or AR
[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:25.860]   goggles that would allow you to play
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:26.900]   Quake
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:33.220]   Except in the real world so you'd be able to run around and see monsters right basically hallucinate
[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:37.860]   And then shoot them with a sort of virtual weapon. I would pay money for that
[01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:43.940]   You'd get sick. So very quickly I can promise you how about socialization. It says oh, don't worry
[01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:48.340]   You'll never do yoga at home alone again when virtual people can appear beside
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:58.340]   You know, I we were we were reviewing yesterday the samsung VR glasses that are based on oculus rift and use a galaxy note four and one of the
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:04.660]   Toys in there you can watch a movie you can watch it just like on the screen, but they also you can be in a movie theater
[01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:12.740]   Uh, you know, there's chairs you can look around behind you. There's the projectionist. It sounds so cheesy, but it's strangely
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:21.140]   It's comforting. It's yes because there's also light effects like they they they kind of thought about the fact that we're watching a movie
[01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:23.940]   It reflects the screen reflects on the seats beside you
[01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:28.900]   So the action on the screen actually illuminates and darkens everything that surrounds you and it's it's very
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:31.060]   very normal
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:33.060]   Stray talking or
[01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:37.940]   Cell phone ringing in the corner. Now here's something I can get behind you're sitting on your riding nor
[01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:41.860]   You got acres to go before you sleep. You're riding more you're boring
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:44.020]   Erm, or
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:48.740]   Magic leap allows you to butch your virtual gophers instead you can you could turn it into a game
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:52.660]   As you're mowing in a gopher says and you can mow it
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.300]   I
[01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:59.700]   Wow, I'd like to have been at the meeting where they brainstormed this crap
[01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:05.700]   A chopping veggies not without a bonus multiplier you want so everything will be gamified everything
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:08.180]   You're playing chopped the cum cucumber
[01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:14.500]   Uh, this is really I don't know. I'm not I'm not against this
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:17.700]   I'm not against this
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:20.580]   No
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:23.060]   Have you seen black mirror? Sorry? I don't know what is it. What is it?
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:28.260]   It's a british tv show which is kind of like the twilight zone, but a modern world
[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:32.580]   And they just released it on Netflix in the in the u.s
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:36.020]   So it originally came out in 2011 in the u.k
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:39.300]   And then they did a second series last year, I think and they just did a christmas special this year
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:42.660]   um, but it's a series of um
[01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:49.540]   standalone episodes that are little science fiction stories and they all involve technology in some way
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:52.020]   so the um
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:57.780]   So the second one is the completely gamified world and everyone is
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:45:03.140]   Um going round earning earning credits for things that they didn't have to spend on media and other things and so on
[01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:09.140]   So that's the model of the second one the third one is you have a little AR thing in your head
[01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:16.260]   Um, which it records everything you've ever seen and done and lets you throw it up on tv so other people to see and the
[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:21.300]   how that affects people's relationships and so on so it's a series of um different
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:22.340]   um
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:28.820]   It's it's worth seeing it's it's dark as hell. It's like it has the same like darkness that the original twilight zone has
[01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:30.100]   um
[01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:34.260]   But it also has um and it's it's the presumption is is is
[01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:41.540]   You know projected forward technologies of the kind of things that's being built. I love this and these are not they're all standalone episodes
[01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:46.020]   You don't have to watch in sequence. Yes. You have to watch in sequence. The only one I heard about it. You do have to watch in sequence
[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:52.260]   No, you don't okay. The only one I heard about was hackers threatening the prime minister and yes
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:54.500]   That's the first thing in that sex with a pig or something
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:58.740]   That's the first episode and that's that that tends to be very um
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:03.140]   uh dividing episode people either like that or hate it or
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:07.220]   and it puts a lot it has put up a lot of people off the series which I'm and
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:11.940]   You know the premise is is farcical, but the point is that it's it's
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:17.060]   It's fast that's well acted which is this and played very straight which is very British vision
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:19.940]   um and the actors in it are brilliant, you know, it's um
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.620]   um
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:26.580]   Rory keneer who won like the best actor award last year is john ham in it
[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:29.140]   John ham is in the christmas special. Uh
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:31.700]   mr. Madman
[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:35.860]   I must have said the first one the description put me off so I have not watched but those
[01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:38.100]   The description you you gave
[01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:41.380]   Fascinating if the description puts you off then don't then don't watch that one
[01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:47.540]   I mean necessarily because it may put you off the whole series. Um, it's because the the point of it is it's about
[01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:53.780]   Um, there's actually if you listen to on the media this week bro, gladstone interviews, um charlie broker who created and he explains the
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:56.660]   invention of that idea which came from the 19th and the
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:58.660]   2010 election
[01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:04.660]   Where gordon brown went out and sought to a voter and then got in the car with his microphone so on and so I remember that
[01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:08.900]   In front of that bigoted woman. Yeah, um and then he had to go back and apologize to her
[01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:15.460]   And brooker was surprised that the prime minister of the country was so driven by the media that he was forced to do
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:18.900]   These need more to do and he says, okay, how do I extend that into fast?
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:23.540]   And the came up with this concept for that. Yeah, so if you if you know that context
[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:25.380]   Um
[01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:32.820]   It makes a bit more sense, but it but it is very much a you know that one is is in that sort of uncomfortable dario pho territory
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:35.220]   the others are more
[01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:41.620]   And it's that that one's not directly about technology really that one's that one's about
[01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:45.300]   Media and and people you know, I mean it is because
[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:50.580]   It sort of shows the sort of the twitter mob encouraging him to do it effectively
[01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:55.860]   There's that that thing that goes on that that's that's the sort of sense that it's about technology, but the the
[01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:57.460]   um
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:03.220]   The second and third ones are actually very strong dramas and then they they keep that going for the for the second series as well
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:05.220]   There's there's they are
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:09.700]   Know what the word is they are
[01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:15.860]   Exaggerated in the same way that twilets zones are there there in that what if we took this thing and push it too far, right?
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:19.540]   Um, but they're also acted and directed well enough that
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:24.180]   Um that they can sustain quite a lot of it. So I definitely worth watching that
[01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:28.500]   That's my Netflix in the u.s black mirror Netflix in the u.s black mirror. I think they
[01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:31.940]   I'm not sure they've got the christmas special yet. You may have to um
[01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:36.660]   I went to uh, I went to channel four's site and this looks like it's blocked. I couldn't get any video to uh
[01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:39.060]   play so
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:41.620]   Uh, but you can't see it at least the first season on then that flicks
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:44.980]   Miss piggy and a politico together at last
[01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:47.940]   Wow
[01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:53.780]   And oh is there one more thing in the google change long? I forgot. Let me look. Um, there's those that I think three of these are the same
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:56.740]   um, so they did a new um
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:48:59.540]   Google knowledge graph thing yes
[01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:00.820]   um
[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:04.660]   And there's there's pluses minus this so they're they're trying to get you to
[01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:11.060]   um to give you more use for information so um, so they're giving you stuff like um
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:18.340]   marking up upcoming events and letting you book tickets from it and provides that directly in search results and
[01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:22.980]   Send them outside. So they're doing a big push on events, which is good
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:27.140]   but the way they're doing it technically is a bit weird in that
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:33.780]   Instead of instead of marking up the html they're saying inject this giant blob of Jason into the top of your thing
[01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:40.580]   Um, the only goal could read and we'll read that and do this thing. So they're basically it reminds me of um
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:45.620]   And this is the thing this is that bar on the right the knowledge graph on the right, right? So
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:50.420]   So I just search for Beyonce and my god. I mean you get songs you get her
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:53.300]   social media profile you get recent posts
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:57.380]   And if she were on tour, which apparently she's not you could even buy concert tickets
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:01.540]   Yeah, I'm sure you actually on tour at the moment, but yeah, who's on tour?
[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:06.100]   Uh mid-year is on tour, but you may not be big enough mid-year. Wow
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:10.020]   He played San Francisco last weekend and I
[01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:14.500]   I know that he's on tour
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:18.740]   I was like should I go to this ice? Okay. I'm sure I want to go to San Francisco that much
[01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:21.140]   A grateful dad or can i get his
[01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:26.020]   Oh, yeah, the grateful does reuniting. Yeah, even though one of them's dead coming events. So he's playing
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:29.140]   Halifax, Canada new heaven, Connecticut
[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:36.500]   And some of some also controversial is this appearance of the social media profiles as well for whoever you search for
[01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:40.900]   So even if it's a brand so if I search for it not pixer but pixr
[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:46.580]   This is danny cell of his example on the search engine land not pixr but pixr
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:49.460]   I will get their facebook youtube and twitter
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:55.940]   Profiles, but I think that's what people want. I mean, this isn't I don't have a problem with this. It's uh, it's it's
[01:50:56.420 --> 01:51:01.860]   Someone have a problem making search more useful. I don't know do people. I thought I thought you said somebody had a problem with it
[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:08.420]   Uh, let's see if I can find some tickets. Oh, you can also get maps
[01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:11.540]   um
[01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:17.940]   If you search for starbucks you'll get not only a map of starbucks, but they're social profiles
[01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:21.540]   Same thing with google
[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:30.340]   So and now and this is important if you are a brand who will has uh, uh, added some markup for this
[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:35.540]   So so you want to on your if you're a brand you want to on your pages
[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:39.540]   Make sure you use the markup so that you will get these social profiles embedded
[01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:44.340]   Structured markup markup, um
[01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:49.940]   And so this is this is my markup is one of my hobbies says I know
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:53.220]   Um, the way they're doing this is really odd
[01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:55.380]   Um
[01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:58.420]   So, you know, I'm able to get too much in the weeds here
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:04.100]   But the normal way you do markup is you do html so you have human facing visible stuff in your html
[01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:08.340]   And then you have invisible stuff that's not for the humans
[01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:13.780]   Um as attributes on that so author equals would be an example, right?
[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:16.100]   Right, right the author
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:21.220]   Author or something real author so and google's deprecated is the last but they used to you put it on your page
[01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:23.460]   rel author equals leo loport and then
[01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:28.500]   If people searched for my name, it would show a nice. I mean there was it would display it more nicely
[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:32.020]   I'd love to know why they deprecated. Yeah, it's well. It's weird, isn't it?
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:37.220]   Because it used to be you'd have your picture next to your blog. I mean, you know, that's hey, that's leo's there's this picture
[01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:40.820]   I think we all like that and they they decided didn't help
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:45.140]   Um people click through the things that wanted them to click through right so now they're not using html. This is
[01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:47.700]   This is uh
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:54.340]   Jason and it's javascript. Is that what it is? What is it? Well, it's not quite javascript even I mean this is the weird they're using Jason ld which is
[01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:56.820]   um
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:52:59.860]   Jason link data. It's a Jason variant that has some
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:03.620]   Um
[01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:08.340]   Right pre-pros to directives in it that says this is things that start with that is a special kind of thing that says
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:13.620]   How to interpret this and translate it so for instance if you're an organization you would have at type
[01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:20.500]   colon organization and then and then it would know okay. This is not a human right so this is this is the schema.org staff
[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:23.780]   But the way they're doing it um so schema always has its own problems
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:31.380]   Um, which I can go into it length if you want but broadly it just it defines inheritance graph rather than a set of properties
[01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:35.620]   Which means that everything is a is a member of a thing of a member of a thing of a member of a thing
[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:39.860]   So you have a place which has a subclass of something which has a subclass of something
[01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:42.260]   um and so on so it has that sort of
[01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:49.220]   Data architect overkill thing going on which is that you know so if you if you look up volcanoes on um schema.org
[01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:51.540]   They have fax numbers because they inherited that from places
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:55.620]   Um, so it's one of those like this kind of almost makes sense doesn't quiet
[01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:59.220]   Um, so it's a little over over done and it's also not
[01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:03.700]   Defined by a very open process. It was it was basically written up by fiat by google
[01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:07.700]   And then they have a main list where you can send us suggestions, but it's very unclear how you had stuff to it
[01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:10.180]   If the big search engine says this is what we want they're gonna
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:15.220]   Yeah, and you don't have to use at jsonld you can also it looks like use micro data
[01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:20.740]   Yeah, but but the the way thing about the jsonld is they're putting um jason into the page
[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:24.660]   Um, but they're not assigning it to anything. Right, so they're putting a script type here
[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:30.820]   But they're just putting a struct in there that isn't actually assigned to a variable. So the page can't access this. Oh wow
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:36.420]   It's just declares a bunch of stuff that hasn't got a variable name
[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:41.300]   Um, so it's completely fair parsley. Only google only google can access this
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:44.020]   Oh, you know the page would have to pause it
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:47.380]   You know if you could the page would have to you have to have some more script that would say
[01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:54.420]   Look for some script to say look for a script with type application or do you first jason and then get the contents and then pause it and it's like
[01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:58.420]   Well, surely you could embed this in a larger script. Couldn't you?
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:04.260]   Um, no because it's got different type it has to be its own it has to be application ld plus jason
[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:08.500]   Yeah, so it's it's this very weird thing of like um, and this is
[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:13.140]   There's a long philosophical debate about this, but this comes down to um
[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:15.860]   The
[01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:20.820]   Is the stuff that you're adding to this design to make sense to the people who are looking at the page?
[01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:23.620]   Or is it just for the the the search engines?
[01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:24.820]   Right, um
[01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:29.780]   And the the drawback of doing stuff just for the search engines is that you can say different things to the search engine
[01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:31.780]   Then you can to the page. Oh, that's a big deal
[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:37.140]   Which is a bit tricky and you know, they're assuming that they can they might enough to penalize people who do bad things with this
[01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:41.540]   Right, but what that tends to mean is the search engine is decided whether you're a trusted source or not
[01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:45.540]   So if you look at twitter cards are like this, this is not quite the same syntax, but it's similar
[01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:50.660]   You you dump a bunch of craft in the all in your head with meta tags that says i'm a twitter card
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:53.460]   And this is my URL and this is my i'm this kind and so on
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:57.780]   And then twitter can process it and give you if you paste someone paste that link into a tweet
[01:55:57.780 --> 01:55:59.540]   They'll get a better preview
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:02.580]   Except that because that's letting you inject stuff into twitter
[01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:04.500]   They will only let you do that if they've approved you
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:09.540]   So it becomes a way for them to exercise control over the rest of the web
[01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:16.900]   And to some extent this is that same trend showing up in google historically google has been will make sense of the whole web and
[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:21.060]   present the results as best we can and crawl things and
[01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:26.420]   Apply heuristics and AI and certain this and this is more of the we will tell you how to mark up your page
[01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:30.340]   And then decide whether you're worthy to be included in the knowledge graph or not
[01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:36.500]   The ticket the ticketing links are done exactly the same way so and it's not that google is creating
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:43.700]   uh links and then giving you a place to buy but the in fact the artist here's an example with Ariana grand the artist
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:52.900]   Would use special mark up to show a card that includes on sale date availability and the link goes to your preferred
[01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:57.940]   Ticket sale ticket site, but the point is that the artist will already have that on the page
[01:56:57.940 --> 01:57:02.260]   So what they're saying is okay. We gave out now you don't have to go to the page
[01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:04.420]   Right
[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:08.820]   The search is off the artist the artist is happy with that. Yeah, but the point is they're they're saying
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:10.500]   um
[01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:12.500]   We're not going to try and make sense of your page
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:15.060]   In order for you to appear in this you have to add this special magic mark up
[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:18.580]   That will then make it appear in google right and if you want to appear in facebook
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:21.380]   You have to have this different special magic mark up that will make you appear in facebook
[01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:25.620]   I mean when you appear in twitter, we got another third set there's even a comedy event markup
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:30.180]   Oh, this is scheme. You would not believe scheme at all. Um, yes
[01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:35.220]   So comedy is a different category than music apparently wow
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:39.540]   Yeah, what is this they've got this subclass mentality right there so they're trying to
[01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:45.300]   They define an abstract base class and then they define subclasses of the things that they actually see in the real world
[01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:48.100]   um, and it's it's a bit of a it's a bit weird
[01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:50.420]   um
[01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:52.020]   so
[01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:55.460]   I can see what they're trying to do, but it reminds me of google base
[01:57:55.460 --> 01:58:00.340]   Which you may remember from a decade ago, which was a similar idea which was like, okay
[01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:04.740]   Pising the web is hard. How about you just upload your stuff to google and we'll use that to
[01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:10.020]   um reference, um to create better better data here. Um, so they've
[01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:15.380]   And they cancelled that a few years afterwards because they realized the inhule ball to do that were the spammers
[01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:19.380]   And then they had this like giant database full of things that that didn't matter that much
[01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:26.500]   now they've the where this works is is where they're in these kinds of examples where they're giving these um
[01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:29.860]   They're clear incentive is like if you want to sell tickets
[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:35.540]   Well, we'll make it you'll make you able to sell tickets from the front page of google before they even click through and that that's people will
[01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:37.540]   dash to do that
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:40.580]   Um, so that's uh, that's probably a benefit to both parties
[01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:42.020]   um
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:43.780]   but the the where it's
[01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:49.540]   What it's doing is putting slightly more control over the presentation of the of the web to google
[01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:55.140]   In the same way that we we were discussing at the top of the show where we haven't having this problem with the different silos doing different things
[01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:56.100]   Right
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:58.420]   And I think that actually plays into some of people's
[01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:04.020]   Criticisms about where google is going with search is and not just competitors
[01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:08.420]   But even users where they're trying to to pull more stuff into
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:14.100]   Their box from wherever to give you the stuff you want which is good
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:15.860]   but
[01:59:15.860 --> 01:59:19.460]   You know, they choose what information goes in there and they choose
[01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:23.860]   Who it comes from and those choices sometimes benefit google
[01:59:23.860 --> 01:59:28.420]   Sometimes they benefit someone else and they it sort of moves beyond
[01:59:28.420 --> 01:59:30.660]   the kind of purely
[01:59:30.660 --> 01:59:33.460]   You know objective search that people thought they were getting
[01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:38.900]   And there's always the risk as there was with the author tag of it being deprecated and you've spent all this after doing this
[01:59:38.900 --> 01:59:44.020]   Suddenly google says yeah, we're not going to show that anymore and says it has no place on your own page
[01:59:44.420 --> 01:59:47.860]   It's completely lost now. Right. That's the that's the thing so you know the
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:54.660]   The micro formats which is the way of doing that that I favor and I help found so I have I'm biased here
[01:59:54.660 --> 01:59:56.980]   Micro formats works on the basis that
[01:59:56.980 --> 01:59:59.300]   um what you want to do is
[01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:01.860]   Annotate the web page with the smallest possible change
[02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:05.220]   Um to give the computers a hint how to pass the content that's already there
[02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:10.820]   So relall for as an example of that relall for says this particular, you know, there's a way of marking up a page to say
[02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:15.380]   That it has um an address book entry in it. We call it h card
[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:19.460]   Um, you can mark that up to say this is the person. This is their URL is their photo
[02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:22.180]   Yeah address whatever else you want to do
[02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:24.020]   um
[02:00:24.020 --> 02:00:26.020]   But how do you know which one switch?
[02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:30.260]   Well, if you put rel author on the link then you're saying this was there's the author of the page
[02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:32.180]   Your point to that other page is the author of this page
[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:34.580]   Um, and that's that that's a hint
[02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:38.820]   That is should be obvious from the layout of the page to the human but isn't obvious to the computer
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:44.180]   So when you when you have an article on the web, it'll it'll have you have the title and the byline somewhere on it
[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:45.780]   And the by that might be the top might be the bottom
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:48.500]   But it's usually clear what what's meant by that. It'll say buy whatever
[02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:51.860]   Um by putting their role off you can say this is the author of the page
[02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:55.220]   Give a hint to the computer and they could pause it and display the the author in that way
[02:00:55.220 --> 02:00:57.460]   And where that becomes useful, um
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:01:00.420]   If you go to um
[02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:04.820]   Concrete example if you go to kevinmarks.com my site and scroll down to the bottom
[02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:07.140]   There's a bunch of comments there
[02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:09.140]   That have been created
[02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:15.300]   Um by pausing other people's sites that have an h card in them and so when they when they present the comment
[02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:17.700]   Um, it'll show their face next to the comment
[02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:21.380]   And that's that that's that's the the indy web way of doing this
[02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:24.340]   Um, so which we we're trying to mark this stuff in a way that
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:28.980]   Um, isn't just defined by one company, but it's defined by common practice
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:35.540]   So instead of something like gravitas using a third party service. It's just in their page markup. So if it's yeah
[02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:40.500]   Because you know this we look to the you know, the most one of those common things on the web is little little people and
[02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:44.820]   You know, it'll icon icon plus name, you know face plus name plus link
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:50.260]   Um, and so the minimal way you do that is you just put um
[02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:57.380]   Uh class equals h dash card on the um element that contains that and if it finds a photo
[02:01:57.380 --> 02:02:00.100]   It's the photo it finds some changes the name edge. It finds
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:02.740]   Um the url. It's the link
[02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:05.060]   Um, so you can do that by adding one value
[02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:08.980]   But if you want to add more detailed ones, we want to if you there are six photos in there
[02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:13.220]   You want to say which one is which you can put explicit classes on the elements that represent those
[02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:19.060]   So the point so there's there's two those two facts is one is it's not designed to be here's a data structure that you have to populate
[02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:21.380]   Probably get into the system. It's like
[02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:24.740]   Here's something you're already doing here's some extra hints to make it easier to pause
[02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:31.140]   But the the second thing is that the information in it is the information that's already being presented to the people looking at the site
[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:37.780]   So you're not going to forget to update it. So the other problem with this hidden metadata stuff is that when you go to
[02:02:37.780 --> 02:02:41.300]   Um change the site you will change all the stuff that people can see
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:45.540]   You might forget about um and um
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:51.380]   Or you may be updated by another process and you can't tell it's wrong until some research you on google and sees a picture of
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:55.860]   The other customer of the service that's doing it because your your id's got crossed or something
[02:02:55.860 --> 02:02:57.940]   So it you're better off
[02:02:57.940 --> 02:03:01.140]   There's a basic principle called dry which is don't repeat yourself
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:04.740]   Which is if there's information about something that is being presented
[02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:08.100]   Present it once rather than twice because you present it twice
[02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:13.220]   You don't know which one's correct and the problem we're getting now with with this kind of markup is that
[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:19.540]   If you want things to be presented correctly by google and facebook and twitter you got a
[02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:21.940]   3% of the production mark up in there
[02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:29.140]   The title in three times put a link to the photo in and you they have different rules about what what size photos they accept
[02:03:29.140 --> 02:03:34.100]   So you often have to make a different photo as well. I like it if your photo isn't big enough facebook won't show it
[02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:36.100]   um
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:40.580]   If and if it's if it's the wrong shape for twitter it'll crop the middle out and make it look weird
[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:42.820]   so there's
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:47.380]   Then rel authors a great example like google went to a lot of publications including ours
[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:50.900]   And said you should implement this thing and here's how to do it
[02:03:50.900 --> 02:03:55.460]   And you you have to do it because if you tag the author and connect it to their posts
[02:03:55.460 --> 02:04:01.540]   They'll show up higher in google and there'll be a little picture of the author and everything and it will help your rankings blah blah blah
[02:04:01.540 --> 02:04:05.380]   You know because everyone wants to help their rankings and no one knows
[02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:10.500]   What helps and what doesn't so if google specifically says this will help then you better do it
[02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:14.900]   So then lots of people did it and then google was like well
[02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:18.580]   This isn't achieving what we wanted to which is to get more people to click or whatever
[02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:20.900]   So now we won't support it anymore
[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:24.020]   Well, that's the google change log
[02:04:24.020 --> 02:04:30.100]   That was good. That was good. I'm glad we got into that. Uh, although I think micro formats is uh
[02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:32.980]   A dim dark area of the web
[02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:38.340]   We're trying to make it. I wish you would I wish you all the best. I think it's it's obviously brilliant
[02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:39.940]   I mean
[02:04:39.940 --> 02:04:41.700]   Is google does google not
[02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:46.340]   Acknowledging I mean when I search for micro formats the first thing I find is a google page about micro formats
[02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:49.380]   Google does index micro formats. Yes, but it it indexes
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:54.180]   Um, they haven't updated we've made some changes to micro formats mark up as we learned stuff
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:58.100]   And they did and they haven't caught up with that yet. So they're indexing micro formats one
[02:04:58.100 --> 02:05:02.020]   Micro formats two has less arbitrary declarations in it
[02:05:02.020 --> 02:05:08.900]   Um, so it's easier to write parses for but google haven't updated there. So is there a christmas cena was doing at google and
[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:14.100]   See tran. Oh christmas. Chris was somewhere else christmas inside g plus trying to make it sensible
[02:05:14.100 --> 02:05:20.660]   And uh, and I know christobona's they're promoting a open source, but I don't know they need somebody they need an advocate
[02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:23.140]   Well, was that what you were doing at google that was what you were doing?
[02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:26.420]   I was doing some of that stuff. Yeah, you're advocating micro formats
[02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:29.060]   I was doing some micro formats. I was doing open social a lot
[02:05:29.060 --> 02:05:31.940]   Right, I did get micro formats into blogger. That was one thing I did
[02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:36.500]   Nice and I did encourage the search people to index it the time and then they've had done war with them
[02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:40.020]   How google kind of works is there needs to be somebody in there who's it was advocating
[02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:42.980]   It's like any company, you know
[02:05:42.980 --> 02:05:48.820]   It's a mixture they will find stuff from the outside and use that as a um a thing to look at as well
[02:05:48.820 --> 02:05:53.620]   Um, but if if there isn't someone making a case for it, it's it's unlike to get done
[02:05:53.620 --> 02:05:57.380]   Oh, and the other thing they say they will do is look at the
[02:05:57.380 --> 02:06:02.580]   You know, is this stuff widespread so um wordpress
[02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:08.660]   WordPress's default templates have micro formats mark up which make it easier to make sense of WordPress when you're pausing it
[02:06:08.660 --> 02:06:14.660]   Um, so they there is a large chunk of the web that has this on that that means that that's a useful thing to do
[02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:16.740]   So google still passes microfinance from that
[02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:18.900]   um
[02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:20.100]   The you know
[02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:23.540]   But there's also there's now a large part of the web that has facebook mark up on
[02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:27.140]   Because facebook has encouraged people to put the stuff into the show up in facebook
[02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:31.780]   So the the prisoners don't know for google is do they index the facebook mark up as well and thereby
[02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:39.700]   cement the facebook mark up as a way of doing it or do they invent their own thing it's so difficult when you're the big search engine to know what to do
[02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:45.140]   And you know, I suspect they'll do both they'll try to make sense of it and they'll challenging them
[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:49.620]   But and yeah, it's an almost the high problem and the point of this
[02:06:49.620 --> 02:06:51.140]   the
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:52.900]   Part of my performance was
[02:06:52.900 --> 02:06:55.780]   Ask come out with ways of doing this that didn't evolve a separate file
[02:06:55.780 --> 02:07:00.500]   That was the original motivation, but this other thing was I was writing a search engine when we first started doing this
[02:07:00.500 --> 02:07:06.020]   So I was doing technorati and it was making my life easier if we do literally this thing of well
[02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:10.980]   If you put this mark up in then your facebook show up in technorati was was one of our use cases for that
[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:13.380]   And that was you know
[02:07:13.380 --> 02:07:15.140]   Very like the well author thing that you were talking about
[02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:20.500]   And the point of that was trying to do it in a way that was the the smallest possible change of what people are already doing
[02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:22.980]   um, so that um
[02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:27.540]   The thing that we found is the more complex do you put in this that that's likely people get it right
[02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:29.940]   and the better chance you've got of
[02:07:30.180 --> 02:07:33.380]   presenting their search result with some weird strange noise in it because
[02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:36.260]   They accidentally put the wrong thing in the wrong place
[02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:44.420]   Elon Musk is going uh going to compete with google, but not on the on the ground. He wants to build an internet
[02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:47.220]   in space
[02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:48.980]   What a character?
[02:07:48.980 --> 02:07:51.700]   He's iron man. He's iron man. He's stark
[02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:58.180]   Uh, Elon Musk uh space x event in seattle a few days ago says it he's gonna spend 10 billion dollars
[02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:04.420]   Of course, of other people's love other people's money because he doesn't ever spend his own money
[02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:06.980]   uh building a space internet
[02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:11.780]   Um
[02:08:11.780 --> 02:08:15.300]   The hyperloop by the way is not his either. He's just he's saying we should do this
[02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:17.620]   so um
[02:08:17.620 --> 02:08:23.220]   Hundreds of satellites the idea is and by the way bill gates tried this a lot of people tried it hundreds of satellites would orbit around
[02:08:23.220 --> 02:08:25.540]   750 miles above the earth
[02:08:25.540 --> 02:08:28.180]   That's actually closer than geosynchronous orbit
[02:08:28.740 --> 02:08:34.740]   Which uh is uh up to 22 000 miles above earth the lower satellites mean less latency of course
[02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:37.460]   um
[02:08:37.460 --> 02:08:40.580]   It would give you fiber optic speeds. He says
[02:08:40.580 --> 02:08:42.900]   um
[02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:44.740]   Well
[02:08:44.740 --> 02:08:46.980]   Depends on what kind of fiber humptych i guess
[02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:48.420]   Well, so
[02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:50.340]   There was uh, no, I haven't seen a director
[02:08:50.340 --> 02:08:54.900]   Announcement with masks. I'd like to hear him what he actually said, but um mind
[02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:59.140]   I think i'm red giga. I'm usually reliable about about getting this kind of thing right
[02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:06.500]   And his point was that the speed of light in air is high and the speed of light and fiber by a factor of um two thirds
[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:08.980]   um, so
[02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:11.780]   Well, well, I'm one and a half which can be which way i'd be looking at it
[02:09:11.780 --> 02:09:17.140]   So we even though they're you know 1,200 miles up. They should be able to get pretty good latency out of this
[02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:19.700]   compared to fiber
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:22.580]   And this lead of light in in copper is
[02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:27.780]   Even slower is factor of three there is so it's half the speed again. So it should
[02:09:27.780 --> 02:09:30.820]   In principle through the air should be faster
[02:09:30.820 --> 02:09:33.620]   And that's true as long as there aren't too many hobs
[02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:39.460]   I mean I suspect it's only actually true if you're getting to a server that's far enough away
[02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:42.180]   So it'll um
[02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:46.900]   You know it would probably make sense that they have like ground stations near data centers or something, but um
[02:09:46.900 --> 02:09:52.500]   So this is kind of like project loon. It's the same idea. But instead of balloons you satellites
[02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:54.580]   They're a little higher, but not much
[02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:57.780]   My quad was interesting. It's like 12 miles. What 12 miles, right?
[02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:00.100]   If you read that story
[02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:07.540]   It down lower it says there's another competing effort right from a guy named greg wiler right called one web
[02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:11.620]   They actually know each other. Yeah, they're working on two competing
[02:10:11.620 --> 02:10:14.180]   Multi-billion dollar
[02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:20.580]   Saves some money projects. Yeah, it just makes no sense to me. That dr. Why is that the acronym?
[02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:26.420]   Don't repeat yourself. Oh, no, that's this is different. You actually want redundant satellite. It works
[02:10:26.420 --> 02:10:28.500]   So we won't run redundant, you know
[02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:31.140]   Choices greg wiler was a
[02:10:31.140 --> 02:10:33.300]   satellite chief at google
[02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:37.220]   Virgin and qualcom are involved in this so they've got some some big money
[02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:42.660]   But he is is elan must proposing doing it all by himself. I doubt it. No, it would be in consortium
[02:10:42.660 --> 02:10:44.900]   But the but the point is that you know whoever's doing this
[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:50.020]   Um, they have to launch a lot of satellites and that's good for him because he's trying to make launch his headlights. Right
[02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:57.220]   Well in Richard Branson said that he doesn't have that elan must doesn't have the rights to the spectrum that he'll need. Oh boy
[02:10:57.220 --> 02:11:02.900]   The greg does if one web does interesting
[02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:05.540]   Ah, okay interesting
[02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:10.260]   It that well spectrum rises tricky when you try and do global satellites. Yeah, that was part of the problem with um
[02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:15.060]   Part the problem with the reading the other problem with the reading was that it was conceived way too early and it was thinking about voice
[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:16.980]   Yeah, but yeah
[02:11:16.980 --> 02:11:20.660]   And the and the the reading exists by the way and then went bankrupt technology wasn't there though
[02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:25.700]   It was only I think it was 60 some satellites. Um, we're talking hundreds of satellites in this one
[02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:29.860]   Well, and every time I think of satellites. I think of serious and and
[02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:33.860]   Yeah, yeah, you know, they both spent billions and billions of dollars
[02:11:33.860 --> 02:11:39.940]   Blue their brains out building two competing networks. Um, that was a really bad idea. Right
[02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:46.820]   Well, you know, I feel like though the the notion that of ubiquitous global internet
[02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:53.220]   Is certainly an idea whose time has come and there's if there's a way to implement it. It would be great to do that
[02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:59.460]   I think it'll happen. I just don't see why we would want two companies spending billions to do it. Right
[02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:02.100]   Well, it's been me competition is good, but
[02:12:02.100 --> 02:12:04.980]   um
[02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:09.540]   We know we've got one gps system. I mean there's there's a secondary one that's not quite there yet
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:16.260]   Um, but that's that we have one gps system because it was built by the US government for its purposes and then realized that it's civil in applications
[02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:18.580]   um
[02:12:18.580 --> 02:12:25.700]   I think there's you know, there is potentially value in more than one competing satellite network in the same way there's value in more than one competing
[02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:27.300]   ISP
[02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:32.660]   Um, the the question is you know, do then then it becomes a business decision whether they can roam into each other or not
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:35.300]   Unless the technology is radically different, but the other thing
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:37.780]   I think that there's a difference in thinking about
[02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:43.060]   What is this something that you put a satellite dish on your house for or is this something that talks to your phone?
[02:12:43.060 --> 02:12:45.460]   And those are that those are actually very different use cases.
[02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:47.940]   Iridium was designed for a phone
[02:12:47.940 --> 02:12:50.980]   um, there to be very mobile and therefore
[02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:53.620]   You had to have this thing that looked like a
[02:12:53.620 --> 02:13:00.260]   90 cell phone. Yeah, huge. Yeah to have it to be able to pick up the signal and not fry your head
[02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:06.100]   Um, whereas if you're doing something that's designed to have a dish on your house like a satellite tv dish
[02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:10.740]   That's a different proposition and that that's more viable because you can get a lot more signal through that
[02:13:10.740 --> 02:13:14.580]   Let's do that and then we'll use mesh to get it mobile and we'll be done
[02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:19.460]   And then you and I can go home and and use our hula hoop keyboards
[02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:22.020]   Well way back in
[02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:24.020]   I spent with it 96
[02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:29.380]   Astra who runs the satellite um networks for sky over europe
[02:13:29.380 --> 02:13:34.980]   Um, they added data capacity to their satellites and I was doing the new media stuff in the UK at the time
[02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:36.980]   So we got to go and talk to them about
[02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:42.180]   Um, well, I think we were helping to build a presentation and then and then talking about what are possible applications for this
[02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:44.820]   and at the time the applications were really crap because
[02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:49.700]   um, they didn't have much bandwidth left after they used most of it for television and and
[02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:52.260]   um coms that they were already doing
[02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:57.540]   So they had this weird ability that you could basically multi cast a packet to the whole of europe
[02:13:57.540 --> 02:14:04.740]   Um simultaneously and in fact, that's what they had to do because they had all these satellites that were pointing down and these dishes that were receiving all the signal
[02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:08.020]   Then they had to like demultiplex that and decide who got which packet
[02:14:08.020 --> 02:14:10.580]   um, so
[02:14:10.580 --> 02:14:16.740]   It doesn't it didn't make much sense for actual, you know sending ordinary internet traffic over that because you're
[02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:19.540]   You're massively wastefully sending packets to the whole of europe
[02:14:19.540 --> 02:14:21.860]   But it would have been really good
[02:14:21.860 --> 02:14:25.140]   But it would have but except that that's exactly what they're doing with the satellites anyway
[02:14:25.140 --> 02:14:27.140]   Oh, that's right. They've got a tv channel for that
[02:14:27.140 --> 02:14:29.940]   Um, but it will be great for you know, like um
[02:14:31.060 --> 02:14:35.540]   A cdn where you actually do want to sit to send the same image to everyone where you want to
[02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:39.060]   Use that today for their windows 10 announcement
[02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:45.140]   Right or they could use it for um, you know, if you got a software patch you want everyone to have or those kinds of things
[02:14:45.140 --> 02:14:47.860]   It would make sense, but it would be very hard to actually
[02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:51.460]   Set the infrastructure up for that. We spent a long time trying to think about
[02:14:51.460 --> 02:14:56.980]   What could you do what if you could send a data packet to everyone in europe who has attached to this thing at the same time
[02:14:56.980 --> 02:14:59.300]   And couldn't come up with any good ones
[02:14:59.300 --> 02:15:00.820]   It's actually quite hard
[02:15:01.620 --> 02:15:06.660]   I'm sure you should have asked the if you just gch q i'm sure they would could have come up with something
[02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:08.980]   Something you could do with that. We're gonna take a break when we come back
[02:15:08.980 --> 02:15:11.380]   Our uh our tips of the week
[02:15:11.380 --> 02:15:14.660]   Matthew ingrum from giga ohm kevin marx leo report
[02:15:14.660 --> 02:15:18.820]   Our show today brought to you by legal zoom you you may say i need a lawyer
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:21.780]   Because i want to make a will i want to form a corporation
[02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:24.180]   I want to get my trade marks
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:28.740]   I want to get my life organized, but you know you don't need a law firm you need legal zooming
[02:15:28.740 --> 02:15:32.660]   Not a law firm they provide self help services at your specific direction

[02:15:38.900 --> 02:15:40.980]   They make it affordable
[02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:43.940]   Getting your life organized can mean taking control of your financial affairs too
[02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:49.700]   So starting that business where you know we were talking on monday had a great triangulation with one of the three founders of apple
[02:15:49.700 --> 02:15:53.620]   lesser known there was jobs in wasniac and then there was this guy named ron wane
[02:15:53.620 --> 02:15:56.900]   And when apple first started they formed as a company
[02:15:57.540 --> 02:16:03.860]   And ron said i had to get out because i was liable because it wasn't an llc or s corporate secret wasn't a corporation
[02:16:03.860 --> 02:16:10.820]   So because they didn't have the sense to create a limited liability company in the earliest days of apple
[02:16:10.820 --> 02:16:14.820]   They lost one of their three founders and ron lost a fairly large fortune as a result
[02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:20.500]   Make that llc make that it's easy. It's affordable. You can do it. That's how i did it 10 years ago
[02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:26.740]   And it uh, i'll tell you it was great advice i got from kam and rosy says when you start twit make it an llc
[02:16:27.700 --> 02:16:28.740]   Any

[02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:30.420]   I cannot recommend them more highly been great
[02:17:30.420 --> 02:17:35.540]   This is the time in the show where uh, we like to give you some tips or tricks or tools
[02:17:35.540 --> 02:17:38.420]   I don't know if kevin you got something you but you the last time you were here
[02:17:38.420 --> 02:17:42.500]   I maybe a few times before that you showed us a game that I couldn't stop playing so
[02:17:42.500 --> 02:17:45.220]   be kind
[02:17:46.820 --> 02:17:48.820]   Up you're muted unmute
[02:17:48.820 --> 02:17:57.140]   What was the game was like was it threes or no? It was it was 2048 2048 that's right. All right. Do you remember that?
[02:17:57.140 --> 02:17:59.380]   Oh god, don't do that again
[02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:01.700]   Okay, I wasn't gonna show you that um
[02:18:01.700 --> 02:18:04.260]   Have you seen link bubble? No
[02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:09.780]   Okay, so I may have to change some settings on this to see this but it's an android browser
[02:18:09.780 --> 02:18:15.140]   Um and the the fun thing about it is that you know the bubble heads in facebook
[02:18:15.940 --> 02:18:20.820]   Um that it shows for the um Chad. Yeah, it does that for the browser what?
[02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:25.220]   So why would I want to do that? So I have a little oh look at that. So you get a little uh
[02:18:25.220 --> 02:18:28.420]   Like a little pop up for the page you want
[02:18:28.420 --> 02:18:33.060]   So if you're browsing twitter or facebook or the web or whatever and there's a bunch of links
[02:18:33.060 --> 02:18:35.140]   You click that and then it'll bubble appears on the side
[02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:38.980]   And then you're gonna read them you click that and then you get a little set of bubbles and you can go back to them
[02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:40.260]   Oh
[02:18:40.260 --> 02:18:42.260]   Need a look at that
[02:18:43.220 --> 02:18:49.140]   It's kind of cool. Um and then you can take the bubble and throw it and you can either throw it to um
[02:18:49.140 --> 02:18:52.180]   To share or throw it to insta paper
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:57.140]   I want to get this because that would be useful because we do this all the time going through stories for other shows
[02:18:57.140 --> 02:19:02.740]   So it's one of these it's it's it's a it's basically the embedded browser view
[02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:05.300]   So it's it behaves mostly the same as chrome
[02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:10.740]   Um except that it has this little UI change to the browser that makes it quite quite fun and useful
[02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:15.860]   Um, so I recommend that I think it's it's it's free if you only want one bubble at a time
[02:19:15.860 --> 02:19:17.460]   Is a pro version
[02:19:17.460 --> 02:19:21.060]   There's a pro version which is three bucks or something that that that might be five bucks
[02:19:21.060 --> 02:19:26.820]   That that lets you have access to multiple bubbles and I I've I tried it out. I thought this is really useful
[02:19:26.820 --> 02:19:30.100]   um particularly for that use case of um
[02:19:30.100 --> 02:19:33.780]   It's quite hard to do the read later thing reliably
[02:19:33.780 --> 02:19:36.100]   Right inside another app
[02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:40.420]   Um because this is android it can hook into the url thing and and give you them at the side
[02:19:40.420 --> 02:19:42.580]   And then you've got the secondary thing that you can throw them
[02:19:42.580 --> 02:19:46.420]   Out to the to the read later thing if you want to so it gives you a wait and tree
[02:19:46.420 --> 02:19:52.340]   Are the links as you as you click on them? I've already downloaded it installed it. I should also add on that
[02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:57.780]   Uh chris lacy's the developer. He also um released for another dollar an app called tap path
[02:19:57.780 --> 02:20:04.020]   Basically what it allows you to do is you can program either one tap two taps or three taps on a link
[02:20:04.420 --> 02:20:08.980]   To do different things so one tap would go to your browser two taps would go to the link bubble
[02:20:08.980 --> 02:20:11.780]   Three taps would go to share or something like that
[02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:14.260]   Uh, so they they play really well together
[02:20:14.260 --> 02:20:21.540]   This is probably already featured on android app arena that chris lacy on all about android and it's featured on it
[02:20:21.540 --> 02:20:25.140]   There you go. This is why you watch all that android your way ahead of the game
[02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:28.180]   Great. Yeah, of course is not only my producer just in hell
[02:20:28.180 --> 02:20:33.060]   But he's also the host of all about android and android app arena tap path browser helper
[02:20:33.620 --> 02:20:40.180]   Right chris lacy which works in conjunction with link bubble and other apps, but it's really well with link bubble
[02:20:40.180 --> 02:20:42.180]   I've just bought both
[02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:48.100]   This is getting to be a pricey show here. How about you matthew engra anything you'd like to give us a plug for
[02:20:48.100 --> 02:20:55.780]   Yeah, actually that you probably all heard of or use or have talked about this before but that reminded me of
[02:20:55.780 --> 02:21:01.300]   Uh one of the tools I really like on my nexus and that's uh and made share
[02:21:01.380 --> 02:21:04.340]   It's called so it's a it replaces the share menu
[02:21:04.340 --> 02:21:07.300]   um on an android device and you can
[02:21:07.300 --> 02:21:10.100]   Create your own sort of custom share menu
[02:21:10.100 --> 02:21:15.460]   uh reorder the things in your share menu and then you can what I do a lot is I
[02:21:15.460 --> 02:21:17.700]   I'm looking at a web page
[02:21:17.700 --> 02:21:21.700]   And it's something I want to save dance the paper. I want to share it on twitter
[02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:24.900]   I want to share it on google plus. I want to post it to facebook
[02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:26.420]   I want to post it to tumblr
[02:21:26.420 --> 02:21:30.260]   You can you can do all of those things by just clicking checkboxes
[02:21:30.340 --> 02:21:33.540]   So take this item post it to twitter post it to google
[02:21:33.540 --> 02:21:36.900]   Save it to my insta paper and put it on my flip board magazine
[02:21:36.900 --> 02:21:42.100]   Um, it's it's a massive massive timesaver sounds fabulous and it's free
[02:21:42.100 --> 02:21:46.420]   And it's like handmade without the h and made
[02:21:46.420 --> 02:21:48.740]   Share
[02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:52.900]   I've been dying for something like this. I wonder if it'll work. You know, it's really annoying the sam-san
[02:21:52.900 --> 02:21:58.100]   Share menu of course puts all the sam-sung stuff on top and you can't see that if that would work with that
[02:21:58.100 --> 02:22:01.780]   I would make it a lot more uh, I would take one of the many pain points away from the
[02:22:01.780 --> 02:22:04.420]   Note 4 but now that I'm using in excess who cares
[02:22:04.420 --> 02:22:07.700]   the hack for that
[02:22:07.700 --> 02:22:13.540]   My tip actually is something new. What's app is messenger service you we mentioned it earlier because
[02:22:13.540 --> 02:22:17.140]   Like a couple of other messenger services. They've added encrypted
[02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:22.180]   Transactions, which is fantastic. You can use it as a messenger a lot of people worldwide use it
[02:22:22.180 --> 02:22:27.140]   who are trying to avoid spending money on uh costly sms plans
[02:22:27.860 --> 02:22:33.940]   Uh, but one of the drawbacks of what's app was available, you know on every platform including iPhone android blackberry
[02:22:33.940 --> 02:22:36.020]   Nokia systems
[02:22:36.020 --> 02:22:37.940]   60 phones and windows phones
[02:22:37.940 --> 02:22:40.820]   But you couldn't use it in in your browser until
[02:22:40.820 --> 02:22:46.820]   Now and they've actually done this very cleverly they've created a what's app client that will work with chrome
[02:22:46.820 --> 02:22:48.900]   So if you go to web.what's app.com
[02:22:48.900 --> 02:22:54.020]   Uh, and i've set it up. It looks just like what's app. I actually don't have a chat going on
[02:22:54.020 --> 02:23:00.100]   But you would see it you link it with a qr code. So you'll have to have the newest what's app version. I just uh
[02:23:00.100 --> 02:23:06.020]   Installed what's app? Uh, i've had it on android. It worked fine with the latest version which was pushed out today
[02:23:06.020 --> 02:23:12.020]   And I was just checking on my windows from my lumi of 1520 and there's a it works with that too
[02:23:12.020 --> 02:23:13.620]   um
[02:23:13.620 --> 02:23:17.380]   In fact the only thing it doesn't work with is and that is iphone
[02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:22.820]   iOS and the and what's app says because of restrictions apple places on the iOS platform
[02:23:22.820 --> 02:23:28.500]   But yeah, I just I just set it up too. It was super easy scan super code. Um, yeah super easy
[02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:33.540]   Just it was clever way to do it. I thought because you're very much tied to
[02:23:33.540 --> 02:23:38.420]   Uh, your phone number and what's app? What's app uses your phone number to identify you?
[02:23:38.420 --> 02:23:43.540]   And so this was like just a clever way of kind of saying to the to the chrome browser
[02:23:43.540 --> 02:23:45.940]   It's not an extension as far as I can i'm sure how they're doing this
[02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:49.780]   It's just a web page, but it's a good way to tell the web page. This is the phone number
[02:23:49.780 --> 02:23:53.300]   I'm going to use this with I have what's happened all my phones, which means I have it on many phone numbers
[02:23:53.300 --> 02:23:55.940]   I actually had a friend tell me the other day
[02:23:55.940 --> 02:24:01.300]   He said he was texting with someone and I said why don't you use what's app and he said
[02:24:01.300 --> 02:24:06.660]   Because I can't whatever he was using had a web client. He said I can't use it on my desktop
[02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:09.380]   I prefer that's one of those i use hangouts for my uh, text
[02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:14.580]   Or push bullet you could use or there are lots of what might eat text lots of ways to do that
[02:24:14.580 --> 02:24:16.420]   But now what's app will do it as well?
[02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:20.180]   Now it doesn't see I don't I asked my kids and their friends. They don't use what's app
[02:24:20.180 --> 02:24:21.380]   Nobody in the states
[02:24:21.380 --> 02:24:26.260]   I think really has picked up on what's app but the but but I started installing it because it's secure
[02:24:26.260 --> 02:24:31.140]   And I think that that's really great that they built encryption into it strong encryption into it
[02:24:31.140 --> 02:24:33.620]   uh, I think they're using the the
[02:24:33.620 --> 02:24:38.260]   What's the technology the red phone guys created they're using that so
[02:24:38.260 --> 02:24:42.900]   um, it's it's it's open source, uh, publicly crypto
[02:24:43.540 --> 02:24:48.660]   Which we actually have our whole family. I've got some free daughters who all have phones
[02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:55.300]   Some of them are iphones some of them are android. I'm android my wife's iphones who we all use what's app
[02:24:55.300 --> 02:24:57.860]   Or a group chat. Yeah
[02:24:57.860 --> 02:24:59.300]   Yeah
[02:24:59.300 --> 02:25:01.300]   So that's pretty cool
[02:25:01.300 --> 02:25:06.420]   Uh, actually, I don't know if that's what what's app is using now. I don't know what technology they're using
[02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:08.980]   But I'm pretty sure it was open source public key crypto
[02:25:08.980 --> 02:25:13.060]   Of course once it's in the u.s app app you don't know what it is. So
[02:25:13.940 --> 02:25:15.940]   I don't know what if it's
[02:25:15.940 --> 02:25:19.140]   Close source is always a little tricky with encryption
[02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:23.700]   Open whisper systems is what they're using. That's what they're using. Oh whisper systems
[02:25:23.700 --> 02:25:28.020]   Uh, matthew great to have you as always matthew ingram
[02:25:28.020 --> 02:25:32.260]   He scribes thanks for having me giga ohm.com
[02:25:32.260 --> 02:25:37.460]   Uh, we really appreciate the time you give us and we hope to have you back soon
[02:25:39.860 --> 02:25:46.020]   Also kevin marks in his garden with his birds kevin marks.com. Are you up to anything you want to
[02:25:46.020 --> 02:25:48.980]   Yeah
[02:25:48.980 --> 02:25:51.300]   Um, well
[02:25:51.300 --> 02:25:57.300]   Um, the india website the microphone is stuff is interesting. So it's the it's the 10th anniversary of taking already tags. Um, wow
[02:25:57.300 --> 02:25:59.860]   That's like wow, but that's a long time ago
[02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:03.860]   And that was that was one of the first examples of this where we got the people to mark up
[02:26:03.860 --> 02:26:05.620]   Um, the web
[02:26:05.620 --> 02:26:10.340]   Work market they broke post with tags in them so that we could um parse them and present them back to them
[02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:15.540]   And that that syntax is still quite widely used. It's used by blogging platforms already to link to the tag pages
[02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:21.060]   Um, though the hashtag has become a even shorter shorthand for that people, you know, just grip for
[02:26:21.060 --> 02:26:25.060]   Um, hash tag in the hash and the tag inside the post
[02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:31.860]   Um, but one thing that we've we've added recently in the india web staff is how to mark up a tag of a person
[02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:34.180]   um
[02:26:34.180 --> 02:26:39.300]   Because you this is a thing that you can do in twitter where you act reply to somebody or where you
[02:26:39.300 --> 02:26:45.060]   Um, in facebook where you can mention somebody it'll it'll do a link to them and google plastic
[02:26:45.060 --> 02:26:47.460]   If you plus them it'll do the great link to them in the page
[02:26:47.460 --> 02:26:50.820]   Um, but there wasn't a distributed way of doing this that reliably
[02:26:50.820 --> 02:26:52.180]   um
[02:26:52.180 --> 02:26:53.060]   Um
[02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:58.820]   So what we did was we just used the h-card thing we talked about i'll give you a link to this i'll just stick it in the chat
[02:26:58.820 --> 02:27:01.540]   Find the chat window
[02:27:01.540 --> 02:27:04.020]   Um
[02:27:04.580 --> 02:27:07.700]   What it does is it does the h-card thing we were talking about earlier
[02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:13.540]   Um, where we were using it for the to show the author of post but if I want to mention somebody else in a post
[02:27:13.540 --> 02:27:20.100]   Um, then I can do the same thing of linking to them. I put h-card on it to say that this is a person
[02:27:20.100 --> 02:27:27.060]   And then I can if I put classic was p-category on it. I'm saying this is a person tag. I'm intending. This is a tag of that person
[02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:30.100]   um, and I did that on the um
[02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:37.060]   I did that on my last set of um home-rewed site club notes. So they're all marks up in that way, which means that um
[02:27:37.060 --> 02:27:42.100]   Um, when the when people get mentions from that they can know that I was tagging them in as a person
[02:27:42.100 --> 02:27:47.380]   So at the point when I post it it will send mentions it can send mentions to the people I've um
[02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:50.980]   Marked up in the post and they can know that I've been talking about them
[02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:55.620]   Of course, there's always with kevin. I have no idea what he just said, but
[02:27:55.620 --> 02:27:57.300]   If you
[02:27:57.300 --> 02:28:00.900]   I'll i'll i'll take another pass through it. No, you're just too smart for me kevin
[02:28:00.900 --> 02:28:05.540]   Don't even bother it's indywebcamp.com/person-tag
[02:28:05.540 --> 02:28:11.540]   And uh, it's like it's like I'm mentioning or plucking someone on google plucking, but it's open
[02:28:11.540 --> 02:28:16.820]   Not restricted but it's a combination of this is it's the nice thing is a combination of a set of building blocks we already had
[02:28:16.820 --> 02:28:19.700]   So we already had the building block for marking up a person
[02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:26.660]   Um, we already had the building block called web mention for mention for saying i've i've sent that i've already linked to this page
[02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:28.980]   Here's the page i've linked to you from
[02:28:29.140 --> 02:28:32.660]   um, so the combination the two means that if someone
[02:28:32.660 --> 02:28:34.660]   um
[02:28:34.660 --> 02:28:37.300]   Links to me on the web and puts this in
[02:28:37.300 --> 02:28:43.300]   Um, and then can send a web mention to me then I want to they've linked to me and I can that's really great
[02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:45.620]   Does ever but will this work everywhere? I mean
[02:28:45.620 --> 02:28:52.500]   Um, there's it'll work. It'll well you need to if you need to be listening so you can they need to be sending the mentions
[02:28:52.500 --> 02:28:57.060]   You need to be listening to them. So if they're using um, indyweb staff, um, then
[02:28:57.860 --> 02:29:04.660]   So I could do this in my, uh, in my leoville.net, uh, you know, yeah, no, no, we'll send the web mentions
[02:29:04.660 --> 02:29:10.500]   Um, the difference is you have to handle the web mentions on your home page as well as on post pages
[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:14.740]   I'm not sure. No one does that yet, but i've got a script on my personal site that
[02:29:14.740 --> 02:29:19.300]   Um, uses another third party service web mention web mention dot horego app.com
[02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:20.980]   um
[02:29:20.980 --> 02:29:24.260]   That listens for the web mentions for for my site and then
[02:29:24.740 --> 02:29:27.620]   Um, I can then embed some javascript that embeds them at the bottom
[02:29:27.620 --> 02:29:33.140]   So if you go to the kevin mark.com you see the little comments and and notes and things that people have sent me in those web mentions
[02:29:33.140 --> 02:29:35.620]   um, and the
[02:29:35.620 --> 02:29:38.740]   Yeah, that's the web mention hero crap.com is there to there so
[02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:43.460]   There's the point about this is there's a lot of these little bits and pieces we've been building
[02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:47.540]   Um, and they each they have to make sense to the sounds of own thing
[02:29:47.540 --> 02:29:50.980]   So I've got to mark up the page to say I'm mentioning this person and that's great on its own
[02:29:50.980 --> 02:29:55.860]   It's like I just made that page more sensible, but it's only useful if someone is going there and looking
[02:29:55.860 --> 02:30:00.100]   Um, and so the web mention is a way of saying I've mentioned this page
[02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:06.420]   Um, here you are going you know going to have a look and then the problem is well, how do how do I set up something that listens for that?
[02:30:06.420 --> 02:30:12.340]   Well, this web mentioned at hero crap.com is a tool that will listen that you can set up to listen to them for you
[02:30:12.340 --> 02:30:15.380]   Um, and then it will it will feed them out
[02:30:15.380 --> 02:30:19.700]   You know, you could let you get them back later so you don't actually have to have code running yourself to do it
[02:30:20.100 --> 02:30:23.540]   So it's a series of these pieces where we build a little piece and another little piece and we go
[02:30:23.540 --> 02:30:26.580]   Oh, if we combine those two pieces then we can then I can
[02:30:26.580 --> 02:30:32.180]   Um, mention people on the web and I don't have to be using twitter or facebook to mention them inside their world
[02:30:32.180 --> 02:30:36.660]   I'm having Matthew Ingram and Kevin mark. So it makes me feel like barbie
[02:30:36.660 --> 02:30:39.780]   Math is hard
[02:30:39.780 --> 02:30:42.740]   My head's gonna explode
[02:30:42.740 --> 02:30:44.740]   All right
[02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:47.540]   I guess i'll have to read this and figure it out and and
[02:30:48.660 --> 02:30:53.780]   Something I don't know what i'm gonna do with it. I like the idea. Let's put it that way
[02:30:53.780 --> 02:30:58.740]   Yeah, you guys are great and uh, and we really love having you on so thank you for being here both of you
[02:30:58.740 --> 02:31:00.980]   We do this week in google

[02:31:07.460 --> 02:31:13.060]   We should we're getting close to the one month. Uh, I think we can call jena japanese. I believe I already
[02:31:13.060 --> 02:31:15.140]   She said she'd be on every month
[02:31:15.140 --> 02:31:17.620]   I have to find the schedule page, but I believe I already have a book
[02:31:17.620 --> 02:31:24.740]   I'm up. I'm gonna get February 11th market on your calendar. 11. 11. Yep times up on her sabbatical
[02:31:24.740 --> 02:31:30.740]   Maybe she can just laid web mentions to me just when she thought she was out
[02:31:30.740 --> 02:31:37.140]   If you can't watch live on demand versions available always with all her shows at twit.tv
[02:31:37.140 --> 02:31:41.380]   That's our website in this case twit.tv/twig
