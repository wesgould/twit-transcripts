[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.840]   We'll discuss Matt Cutt's signals to SEO's Google Glass
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.840]   best practices, a little bit of a fight coming up on that.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.840]   And is Yahoo really the number one page on the web?
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.280]   We'll find out why next on Twig.

[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.640]   Google.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.280]   The show that talks about the latest in the Google
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.400]   verse in the cloud and Facebook and Twitter and all that jazz.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.920]   And Gina Trapani is here from her offices at ThinkUp,
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.160]   the launch under her belt, ready to face the brave new world
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160]   of business.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.120]   Hi, Gina.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.920]   Of actual users and customers who are demanding to know what
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.040]   we're giving them for their money.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.640]   Yes.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.640]   Hello.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.240]   They got the credit card charges this week.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.440]   So yes.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.520]   Now they want to know.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.960]   That was the real test.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.960]   Good to be here, as always.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.720]   Great to have you.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.760]   Also with us from Davos, Switzerland.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.080]   And with a little bit of a wonky connection,
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.400]   but we love him so much, we're just
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.880]   going to put up with a Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.640]   Hi, Jeff.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160]   I'm in a world seven seconds behind.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.080]   So where are you?
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.360]   Are you in some special Davos World Economic Forum
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.600]   mission control?
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.960]   I'm in the media center.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.080]   Oh, it looks like.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.840]   Filled with desks of empty now because they're all
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.680]   the parties.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.760]   Is Bono there?
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.440]   He's here this year.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.400]   I'm supposed to see him for dinner tomorrow night,
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.200]   not an on team dinner, but a large dinner.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.760]   Have fun.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.480]   Wow.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.240]   It's exciting.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.880]   Hey, that other voice, Danny Sullivan's here
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.680]   from Search Engine Land and Marketing Engine Land.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.920]   And always one of the most astute observers of the Google
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.640]   version is always great to have you on, Danny.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.440]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.080]   I'm just looking at my think up, Gina.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.280]   To Kalmiki followed me.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.360]   Do geekery geek business and tech sound like good descriptions?
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.440]   Oh, yes.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.600]   Oh, oh my.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.720]   This week's key stats.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.920]   This is nice.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.200]   So as time's gone by, this has gotten deeper and deeper
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   and more and more interesting.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.640]   Yes, that's the point.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.280]   That is the point.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.840]   Actually, I saw that three years ago you signed the lease.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.160]   I signed the lease for the brick house.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.960]   That's really cool.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.880]   It's hard to believe.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.720]   That was really cool to watch.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.440]   Yeah, we did it on the air.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.280]   With my special pen.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.040]   That's kind of neat.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.480]   That's cool.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.320]   That's kind of neat.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.080]   It's also is, by the way, the anniversary, the 30th anniversary
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.640]   of the 1984 commercial, a Super Bowl in 1984.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.160]   Really?
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.880]   Apples.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.840]   1984 commercial was aired on this day for the first time.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.200]   And the last time in most areas, I
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.440]   think they aired it in some other places
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.200]   just so they could win a Clio Award.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.040]   The ad that announced the Macintosh to the world.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.600]   All you have to do is Google 1984 ad.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.400]   And you'll find plenty of copies of it.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.320]   Should I play it, Chad?
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.120]   You think we just--
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.800]   here we are.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.800]   And you know, oh, I have to skip the ad.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.400]   There's an ad on the ad.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.880]   That seems a little much.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.480]   Ad recursion.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.000]   Sepption.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.000]   Everybody's seen this so many times.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   We were talking about Star Wars before the show began.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:03.400]   And it's of that kind of cultural phenomena.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.480]   You know, it's funny.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.360]   The soundtrack sounds exactly like a new iPad ad soundtrack
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.560]   with Robin Williams reading Walt Whivren Poetry.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.040]   What's amazing is that they managed to capture 30 years ago
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.040]   what it looks like inside an Apple store today.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.880]   There's going to be a big event Saturday at the Flint Center
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.480]   where the Macintosh was unveiled on January 24, 1984.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.800]   January 25, '92, 2014.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.240]   And a lot of the original Apple team will be there.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.840]   It's going to be a big event at the Flint Center at Cubertino.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.400]   And they're selling tickets online, Mac30.com.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.200]   So there you go.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.440]   Bit of a little bit of history.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.760]   Tell us about Davos.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.520]   What are you doing there?
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.600]   What is the world economic forum, Jeff?
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.400]   I was just trying to switch headsets
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.040]   to see if I could get rid of the--
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.560]   the World Economic Forum is 1,500 makers from all fields,
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.760]   business, government, NGOs, journalism, who come together
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.240]   every year.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.440]   And stuff happens here.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.520]   It really does.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.760]   So tomorrow I get--
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.960]   today I got to go to a session listening
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.960]   to Japanese Prime Minister Abe.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.680]   I wish we were fascinating and exciting.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.840]   If I cared more about Japan versus China,
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.800]   I might have been fascinated.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.920]   But it was a hot room when I was sleepy.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.240]   Tomorrow we get to see the president of Iran and Mexico.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.800]   The next day, the president of Brazil,
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.800]   our little media group.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.280]   So it's fun.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.320]   What is the idea?
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.840]   I get to see it.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.840]   I get to see it.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.280]   People don't see it the year around and talk to people.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.840]   So I'm going to session this morning on Big Brother
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.120]   with Senator Leahy 10 feet away from me.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.920]   We'll talk about that.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.960]   So it's kind of ridiculous.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.960]   It's kind of a hoot.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.080]   But if they ask you to come, you don't say no.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.720]   Who does this and why?
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.200]   Who does come to Davos and why?
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.480]   No, who is the World Economic Forum?
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.720]   I mean, is this a government that throws this event?
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.160]   Who's--
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.320]   No, it's a guy named Klaus Schwab, Professor Klaus Schwab,
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.800]   who's German and now Swiss.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.040]   And he put together this organization 30 some years ago.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.480]   And it's really quite phenomenal
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.880]   because he brings together all these world leaders.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.960]   Companies pay upwards of $500,000 a year
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.920]   for the privilege to come plus plenty of other fees.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.560]   They can make a fortune on this stuff,
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.040]   but it's not for profit.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.720]   And it does bring together world leaders
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.680]   and major things have happened here.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.720]   And so it's some pretty amazing things.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.920]   It's neat.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.640]   Yeah, it is.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.200]   It is.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.880]   It's also 1%ish.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.920]   But so is most of the world.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.120]   There was a study out this week that
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:46.400]   said that there are 83 people whose wealth equals half the world.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.800]   I think a few of them may be here.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.160]   That is depressing, isn't it?
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.280]   That does say inequality statistics.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.000]   So Matt Cutz, a couple of days ago,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.760]   blogged at mattcuts.com.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.800]   OK, I'm calling it.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.400]   If you're using guest blogging as a way to gain links in 2014,
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.200]   you should probably stop because over time,
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.520]   it's more and more of a spammy practice.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.080]   And if you're doing a lot of guest blogging,
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.320]   you're hanging out with really bad company.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.000]   Danny, he kind of backed down a little bit, saying,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.160]   that doesn't mean don't do it.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.600]   He-- his original post said it was
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   like the decline and fall of guest blogging.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.040]   And that was the headline.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.080]   And when you read the article, he said, look,
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.400]   if you're doing guest blogs to try to build links and all
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.480]   this sort of stuff, you should stop it and just really spam me.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.960]   It's not really a helpful thing.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.920]   And that's sort of his warning shot that if Google were
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.000]   to take a close look at somebody's website
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.840]   and think that you're just running a lot of blog posts that
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.880]   have no real purpose other than to try to help somebody else
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.000]   rank better, then you might be deemed as spamming.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.360]   But what happened was you had a lot of people
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.600]   who have guest contributors and guest blog posts that
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.600]   are written not because they're trying to help someone rank
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.840]   better in Google or that the person trying to rank better
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.280]   than Google, but they're contributors.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.720]   It's an established practice.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.000]   Om Malek does it on giga Om.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.840]   Forms does it.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.200]   It's an established practice.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.840]   Not everybody who posts on a blog works for that blog.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.560]   And so the issue really was that in this case,
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.200]   Matt is probably too close to it when he thinks of guest posts
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.440]   and guest blogging in his mind.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.560]   And I think of people in the SEO space,
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.040]   you tend to think that crummy guest blogging stuff,
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.760]   where you get these requests from people like, hi, comma.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.840]   I've been visiting your site that I love.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.360]   I would like to give you content.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.440]   Here is my content.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.280]   All I ask is for three, do follow links back
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.800]   and all that sort of stuff.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.720]   So he had to walk it back and say, look, I'm not saying,
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.920]   don't do guest blog posts.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.280]   I'm saying don't do guest blog posts for SEO purposes,
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.760]   where you think that because you can just
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.200]   get this post running in a bunch of different places
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.960]   and you manage to get a nice link in there that says best
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.080]   used cars somewhere hidden in the text or whatever,
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.960]   that's going to rank you well, that that's one of the things
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.440]   that they're going to be going after.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.960]   But it did.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.280]   The most notable example I thought was Charles Strauss,
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.200]   who's like, there's award winning science fiction
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.720]   authors out on Hacker News going.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.520]   But I have Hollywood directors and everybody
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.800]   about to do guest blog posts.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.400]   And now I'm kind of worried, how's Google
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.160]   going to automatically figure this stuff out?
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.160]   So it caused some panic.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.640]   And importantly, there is no automatic method
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.240]   on how this works anyway.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.120]   It's really kind of like how Google deals with advertorials.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.920]   It can't look at a web page and think,
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.560]   that's an advertorial where someone
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.080]   has paid to have an article placed
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.160]   and they have a link in it.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.600]   Therefore, that violates our guidelines.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.040]   We're going to knock it down.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.160]   What happens is they go into a website
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.440]   because something suspicious has been raised.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.240]   It's almost like going through customs or whatever.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.640]   And they're like, right, you come over here,
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.840]   we're going to flip through your bag now and see what you got.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.560]   And then they go through and they say, right,
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.440]   well, I'm seeing all these sorts of things.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.040]   That's not kosher with us.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.560]   Now you're getting a penalty.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.520]   So really, if you've been doing blog posts
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.280]   because you have guests and you think
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.080]   that it's really good content, there's nothing for you
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.280]   to panic about.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.280]   But if you've been running blog posts
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.240]   because people out of the blue have been coming to you
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.720]   saying, hey, I've got some great content.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.840]   Why don't you run it for me?
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.000]   This'll be a great thing for both of us.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.840]   And we'll rank better on search engines.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.760]   Yeah, don't do that.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.120]   Yeah, we get that email all the time.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.560]   I'm sure you do too at search engines.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.440]   I get that lot.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.400]   Yeah, I get that all the time.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.680]   And I'm not even really actively blogging anymore.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.120]   I'm not too clear.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.760]   It strikes me that it's a little bit like porn.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.600]   The famous comment by Justice--
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.920]   I can't remember his name.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.080]   I don't know what porn is, but I know when I see it.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.400]   Of course, we all know spammy blog posts.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.560]   But I don't know how-- it might be difficult to algorithmically.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.880]   Well, but Leo, that's what Matt's saying
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.000]   is that at some point, he's going
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.400]   to have to trust quality bloggers that are really
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.760]   put in there for a good reason.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.160]   And it's more of a human thing.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.160]   He's saying that the bloggers--
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:01.680]   It's got to be human.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.800]   --he's like, a computer can't do it.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.680]   If you do it all the time, if you have nothing to guess blogs,
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.320]   this goes back to this idea that I've
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.360]   mentioned a lot of times.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.680]   And it came up today, Zero Doubles, actually,
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.120]   is that I still think that Google has to have appeal
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.320]   practices.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.000]   And I also think that a jury appears.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.280]   If there were a jury of bloggers who helped Google and said,
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.000]   yeah, that's spam, that's OK.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.280]   Listen to us, Google.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.840]   It takes the heat off Google for having the power of God.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.600]   Well, but isn't this exactly what Google doesn't want to do?
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.400]   If they could, they'd do everything algorithmically,
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.200]   because the last thing they want to be--
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.800]   first of all, the first reaction to this is, wow,
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.760]   Google wields a lot of power.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.080]   And that power could be wielded unfairly
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.800]   and perhaps is wielded from time to time.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:55.200]   Just ask Expedia, which has, I think, a 6% drop in his stock
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.960]   because it was penalized by Google yesterday.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.640]   25% of their search visibility has
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.400]   disappeared, according to very Schwartz writing
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.040]   in your search engine land.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.920]   So yeah, Google does have a lot of power.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.200]   Google is vulnerable for antitrust here.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.600]   And they've got to be capable.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.200]   And they've got to come up with better procedures.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.440]   And they've got to come up with more transparency about this.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.920]   It was brought up today here at Davos.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.200]   The head of Bain brought up the rap genius case
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.320]   and made it very clear that rap genius messed up
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.120]   and knew they messed up, came back.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.760]   But it's this idea that Google has the power of God
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.960]   in these instances.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.200]   Did Expedia break any rules?
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.920]   I mean, this is a severe penalty.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.040]   Well, we don't know for certain.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:39.960]   We don't know for certain.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.680]   We know that Expedia in December had been spotted
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.720]   and outed by a post that was saying, look,
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.800]   they look like they have all these unnatural links
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.680]   in their weird places, like the footers of WordPress blogs
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.120]   and stuff like that.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.200]   And then nothing happened, and then they took this hit.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.840]   Expedia is saying nothing on the record.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.280]   Google is saying nothing on the record.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.920]   But it has all the look and feel like, yeah, Google
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.360]   saw something that Expedia was doing
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.840]   and decided to hit them with it.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.920]   I mean, when Google rarely actually
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.200]   goes through and confirms if they penalize somebody.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.160]   So when you want to know if someone's in Google jail,
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:10.880]   you search for them.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.120]   And if you can't find them in ways that you'd expect to them,
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.040]   then you kind of have a pretty good idea that they were.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:21.480]   But in terms of the antitrust thing, it's hard.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.800]   First of all, Google has first amendment protections
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.560]   in the United States to do whatever the heck it wants,
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.920]   pretty much with the search results.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.280]   That's already been tested.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.280]   I mean, it's been attempted years ago.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.560]   So if the New York Times decides that it does not
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.240]   want to run an article about some company that it thinks
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.640]   has been doing bad PR to drum up stuff, nobody says, well,
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.560]   you're so powerful, New York Times, and it is powerful,
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.160]   we're going to control your whatever.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.560]   And also, Rap Genius doesn't compete with Google, right?
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.280]   So it sucks if you're Rap Genius that you can't go there.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.760]   But it's hard to make a case that Google, on an antitrust
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.640]   purpose, decided, and we kept the Rap Genius down.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.680]   But the whole reason that Google is in antitrust issues
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.920]   right now in Europe actually came out
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.040]   of the exact same thing, where there was a shopping search
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.840]   engine that Google felt like was doing some spammy stuff,
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.000]   penalized them because it felt like it was protecting its search
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.800]   quality.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.520]   And then the shopping search engine, this was found and decided
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.120]   that no, this was Google trying to prevent competition.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.800]   Is it in the same business?
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.240]   Right.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.440]   Just as they are with ITA in the same business as Expedia.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.120]   Sure.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.840]   And in fact, Expedia, I think, is part of the same group that
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.760]   kind of glommed on to this whole big antitrust thing.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.440]   And Google's got to be stopped or whatever.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.000]   Now, the interesting thing, though, is Google's already
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.720]   cleared of all that stuff in the US.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.800]   The FTC has said, no, you're fine.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.400]   We're still stating to see what happens in the EU.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.880]   But it is a weird case where somebody--
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:52.800]   it's a weird fight back against spam to then seize the antitrust
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.320]   aspect.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.800]   There's relatively few companies that can use that to say
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.280]   Google went out to me because they're trying to be
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.440]   monopoly.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.680]   Most companies that are hit are either hit because there's a
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.640]   good reason that they should be hit.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.600]   Or they get hit and they just are upset because they don't
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.960]   think Google's being fair.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.120]   But they don't tend to think-- and Google's not being fair
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.560]   from an antitrust perspective.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.680]   But this is how Google muddies the waters with their
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:20.120]   acquisitions because it's tough if you want to be a search
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.880]   engine and you're in the same business as somebody that
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.760]   you're posting links to.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.800]   It seems like they have--
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:33.080]   antitrust maybe not, but conflict of interest for sure.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.560]   Yes.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.000]   The more that Google is doing stuff--
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.560]   I did this thing about a year ago.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.800]   I talked about how Google changed from a search engine
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.200]   to destination.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.840]   The more Google has its own destination content or its
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.160]   own stake and where it can send you to, the more that it
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.480]   gets susceptible to these accusations that always
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.240]   trying to be abusive or whatever.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.120]   And it's tough because there are some cases where you're
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.480]   looking at these types of things and you're like, well,
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.760]   this is cruddy.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.480]   But my perspective is the bigger issue isn't, well, Google's
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.760]   welding all this power or whatever.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.840]   The bigger issue is that most of these things happen
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.880]   because Google is desperately, desperately trying to protect
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.040]   the sanctity of the link as a way that they count vote to
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.000]   figure out what pages should rank better.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.560]   And I always go back to trying to liken it as if Google is
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.160]   stuck on this fossil fuel--
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.600]   the links are like this fossil fuel that are really
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.040]   heavily polluted at this point, that people buy them,
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.440]   sell them, barter them, trade them.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.560]   They don't give them when they should.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.480]   They do give them for reasons that they shouldn't do
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.320]   or whatever.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.680]   And Google keeps coming up with all these reasons why you
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.960]   should be able to use a link in this case, but not that.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.600]   Like, well, press release links.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.000]   We're not going to count anymore.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.080]   Well, guest blog posts, we won't count.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.640]   Well, we will count them.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.480]   But only if it's like a real guest post thing or--
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.240]   no, you don't want to have your links being an infographic
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.200]   because now those infographics, we don't know
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.200]   everybody's about you for that.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.280]   And it's like a laundry-lifter thing to the degree that
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.720]   it's like, I don't really know what's left that they're
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.240]   supposed to count.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.200]   And I think you're right.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.200]   Yes.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:03.720]   Yes.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.680]   Anyways, everything you just said, you're right.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.600]   Everything you can just said, but here's one yes but.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.960]   Yes but is that Google is trying to be transparent and let
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.920]   people know without giving the algorithm off, let people
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.720]   know what works and what doesn't.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.360]   And I think we've got to give some points for that.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.200]   I know I get to be Mr. Pro Google here.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.640]   But I think that that's a factor in where Matt cuts as an
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.520]   open part of Google is trying to explain to people the rationale
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.800]   behind what he does to make that algorithm.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.520]   And that's not maybe confusing.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.400]   His job is, the world is.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.080]   But is that really an awful thing?
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.080]   Gina?
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.080]   [SIGHS]
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.080]   [SIGHS]
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   I love Danny's--
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.960]   I love Danny's rant, by the way.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.280]   And actually, Danny, what I want to hear from you is what you
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.080]   think.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.960]   If links from web pages aren't a good indicator of quality
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.040]   anymore, right?
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.800]   So what's the new page rank?
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.160]   Is social the new page rank?
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.000]   Are we basically going full circle back to Yahoo and Yahoo
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.040]   used to have editors compile search results to good websites?
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.880]   Like, if Leo Google+ is a link and he's legit, does that mean
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.120]   that that link should get high page rank?
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.800]   Like, what else can Google do?
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.440]   I think social should be a much bigger part of the equation
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.280]   than it is now.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.960]   And again, about two years ago now, I think I did an article
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.240]   when it was like, when everyone gets the vote,
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.880]   social shares at the news signal or something like that.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.000]   And what I was trying to explain was when Google started,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.080]   the idea of links is votes.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.680]   And that's the democracy of the web.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.600]   And another metaphor I use that--
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.760]   it's like saying, well, if links are votes
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.560]   and that's democracy of the web, then that's democracy
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.440]   in the United States when you had to be like 35 and white
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.400]   and a landowner and a man in order to vote.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.640]   That's right, democracy, only a small number of people voted.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.520]   And if you think how many times you
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.440]   have liked a page or content or business or whatever,
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.120]   you've been really happy about something,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.200]   had a great experience that you have then turned around
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.600]   and said, you know, I'm going to write a blog post
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.360]   about this company that I had a great experience with.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.000]   I'm going to make sure I link to them
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.480]   because I want to make sure Google understands
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.520]   that they're valuable.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.720]   I'm going to make sure that the anchor text of that link
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.960]   is very descriptive so that hopefully they'll rank well
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.960]   for custom surfboards because that's really good.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.800]   And I'm going to make sure I do it on a platform
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.160]   that doesn't automatically somehow put a no-follow in there.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.080]   People don't do that.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.040]   But when people are happy with a business
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.400]   or they want to recommend something,
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.240]   they actually like it on Facebook.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.360]   Are they tweeted on Twitter?
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.840]   Are they go to Google+,?
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.160]   So to me, social signals are far more democratic
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.960]   than the link signal.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.200]   And when I'm bringing this up--
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.480]   That's true.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.760]   But when I bring this up with Google and with Bing as well,
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.760]   the response comes back is, we don't find them that useful.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.400]   We don't feel like they're that valuable.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.320]   They could be game.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.760]   And there's like a litany of excuses they haven't
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.120]   to why they can't use social.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.240]   And I come back to--
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.800]   But I come back to thinking, well,
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.120]   I'm sorry that you're finding that social doesn't seem
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.280]   to work because you've spent all of maybe two years
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.560]   kind of poking at it.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.600]   That's like saying solar doesn't work very well.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.680]   Because we put all this energy into building a gasoline engine
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.880]   and we don't want to leave that aside as well.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.760]   Yeah, social is not going to be perfect at all.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.400]   There's going to be issues with it.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.680]   But I just find it hard to believe
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.120]   that links are somehow so much more better.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.680]   And today, I'll leave off with this.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.520]   Matt Cutts just did a post today where he's being asked
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.280]   about it's a video.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.520]   Does Google use Twitter and Facebook to rank things?
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.160]   And he's going through and he's at pain saying,
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.080]   no, we don't use Twitter data, social data, Facebook data.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.320]   Those are just ordinary pages.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.560]   We don't count up the followers and all this sort of stuff.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.360]   And if you really understand some of the back history,
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.440]   one of the things you're hearing in there that Google,
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.960]   especially as a problem with, is he will make mention
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.120]   about how they were blocked.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.120]   He doesn't name it, but he's talking about Twitter
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.720]   from getting Twitter data.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.600]   And one of the issues that I think Google has
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.200]   is that back when they had a deal with Twitter,
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.840]   they built a lot of their infrastructure
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.840]   around Twitter's data to an unprecedented degree.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.760]   They deal fell apart and then Google
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.960]   had to stop having things like real-time search.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.480]   And I think they looked at that and they said, never again.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.720]   Never again will be so dependent on a third party for data
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.760]   that we use in our search results, which is why they don't
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.360]   want to use it.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.200]   And that's why you also have, by the way, Google+, the--
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.880]   OK, but there's another thing going on here,
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.640]   which is that things like Upworthy,
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.600]   which they have good motive behind them,
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.000]   are cynical acts to get you to click on things.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.440]   Buzzfeed.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.360]   The chart feed said recently, they found out
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.040]   that people share before they read,
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.440]   that the notion that you shared something, you linked to it,
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.760]   is not necessarily a signal at all.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.440]   I just like the picture in the headline,
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.160]   and I'm going to share that on my Facebook.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.840]   And I'm not even before everybody else.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.320]   I was watching the--
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.320]   And then Upworthy comes in and cynically says,
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.680]   she turned the page and it changed her life.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.000]   And you don't believe how it will change yours.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.120]   And I hate this stuff.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.560]   How it tells me what I'm going to think.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.000]   How good the motive is.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.200]   So what they're doing there is they're manipulating,
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.240]   instead of the algorithm, they're manipulating us
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.080]   to manipulate the algorithm.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.440]   And so once again, I've got to be a little sympathetic
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:10.520]   to Cutsville for saying, how do you cut through that?
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.320]   I agree with you.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:11.840]   That's true.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.200]   That's why you don't just rely on one signal so heavily.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.760]   But it's like saying, I could do that qualification
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.320]   with links and more.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.640]   And then there's this whole extreme number of things
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.800]   they do to try to still get value out of the link signal.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.160]   It's like they're digging up the tar sands of links now.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.960]   And they're extracting whatever left
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.960]   that they can get out of it after they filter it
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.000]   through all this stuff.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.880]   And so no, the social signal is impure.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.160]   But you also can take that and align it with other things.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.240]   So you can take a social signal.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.760]   And you can also then go through and look at things like,
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.880]   we have other data that tells us how much time people spend
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.440]   on a website.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.400]   And this video is actually on YouTube.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.240]   Maybe we can tell along that's played.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.400]   Or maybe we can tell the kind of clicks that are happening.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.760]   Or there may be data that they have in aggregate
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.040]   that they associate with it.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.040]   And that's what the algorithm is all about.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.800]   You take all these signals together
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.840]   and try to help them check and balance each other
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.000]   to figure out what works and what doesn't work.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.080]   It's just that the link signal has become much more
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.400]   degraded over time.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.600]   That's why you get post from that.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.440]   I agree.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.960]   I agree.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.200]   Yeah, that's definitely true.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.840]   I mean, when you think about it, Google Analytics
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.240]   is on sites across the web.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.720]   So Google has all that data.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.360]   Google has the knowledge graph.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.200]   So we know that Mark Hamill is 62 years old.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.760]   But in Google knows that, right?
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.160]   So they can look at a web page that says he's 40
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.800]   and know that that's incorrect.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.000]   Google can know a lot about the quality of a website
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.120]   based on lots of different signals beyond just links.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.120]   And yet SEO is this thing, is this game that's still
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.720]   going up being played on a game.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.160]   But content publishers work the SEO angle.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.080]   It's their job because so many publishers or content creators
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.360]   depend upon Google traffic to make their money, right?
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.640]   Because to drive eyeballs to their dads, right?
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.320]   And I mean, yeah, I think to what you said earlier, Jeff,
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.840]   I do give Google credit for having Matt
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.440]   cuts in front of a video camera explaining
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.360]   how they view certain things.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.680]   Of course, Matt is very close to the guest blogging situation.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.320]   Of course, people shouldn't stop guest blogging.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.240]   If there's a blog that has an audience
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.800]   that you want to reach, of course you would do it.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.720]   Forget the SEO, right?
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.600]   That's why he had the dial it back and say,
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.320]   I mean, for SEO purposes.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.600]   But that's just a natural that you'd want to do that.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.040]   So I do get an incredible sharing how they view
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.400]   these kind of practices.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.240]   But I think that Danny's absolutely right,
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.840]   that the page rank is--
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.240]   the link value should be small and relevant
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.760]   and mixed in with a bunch of other signals, social,
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.880]   other data, knowledge graph data, et cetera.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:02.360]   Do you think Larry Page has an emotional tie to page rank?
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.000]   Because it's his name you mean?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.920]   Well, everything is--
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.480]   because the impression that--
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.680]   I don't get the impression Larry Page is paying much attention
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.600]   to search these days.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.680]   It's not the most social business at Google, is it?
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.000]   He seemed to be off of it.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.520]   And Page Rank, by the way, it itself
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.760]   is one aspect of it.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:23.840]   In particular, we will count links and give each link a score.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.880]   And they're far more sophisticated to that sort of stuff.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.960]   So I don't think he'd be like, oh, I
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.080]   need to have Page Rank 4.0 out there.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.960]   I'm not going to let it go with it, whatever.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.520]   But I do get depressed more and more each day,
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.600]   because as Google is buying and companies that
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.160]   put thermostats here, and I'm going
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.240]   to get smart contact lenses and all this stuff,
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.480]   I keep joking.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.480]   And all that's paid by Mesothelioma and payday loan ads.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.920]   Because the underpinnings to all these great things
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.000]   that Google is doing, the bulk of their income
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.040]   still comes from search and still comes from those search
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.840]   ads that are out there, a lot of which are not
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.520]   from very savory type of things.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.840]   And sometimes I feel like Google just kind of
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.680]   wants to pretend like, well, all that stuff.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.600]   It's like, I've nothing to do with us.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.200]   We're Google Glass, and we're great, and we're wonderful.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.320]   And for someone who has to deal with the search space day
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.200]   to day, it is a tough job.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.240]   I would not want to run a search engine.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.800]   And yet you see terrible results.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.760]   You see things that don't make sense.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.800]   I watched last week, I wrote a story
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.200]   that we had thousands of hotel listings
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.080]   got hijacked in Google Local.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.120]   And Google's response to that was, where were of it?
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.120]   What do you mean they got hijacked?
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.520]   They got people like Hilton and Sheraton.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.080]   They have Google Local Plus listings, verified listings,
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.800]   which means that those listings you had to have used
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.120]   a PIN number that was sent to your address
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.960]   at the location of a number.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.400]   So these were all verified listings.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.800]   A lot of them were verified.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.600]   And what happened was the official URLs for those things
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.560]   that would have led you to the Hilton or the Sheraton
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.800]   or the Holiday Inn or whatever got changed
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.200]   to some third party web booking site.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.760]   Thousands of listings.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.000]   How did that happen?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Yeah, how did that happen?
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.600]   It would be a good thing to know, wouldn't it?
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.840]   And I would think that Google would like to explain it
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.480]   so that we would not have it happen again.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.480]   But Google's response initially was nothing at all.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.360]   Then they came back after the article ran and said,
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.440]   we're aware of it and we're correcting it.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.640]   We don't know how it happened.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.400]   But what I do know is, if you had thousands of Google Plus
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.280]   accounts that got hijacked and got treated that way,
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.520]   it would have been a user privacy nightmare.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.280]   And Google wouldn't have been able to crawl back
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.600]   into their no-comment type of reaction.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.960]   We don't need to have to deal with it or whatever.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.440]   And the security for those businesses is just as important.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.120]   But when it gets into these unsavory things,
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.920]   more and more, if Google just is like, well, we don't--
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.600]   we won't say anything, but pretend it goes away.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.480]   And that's the kind of transparency to me
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.360]   that counts, that when something goes wrong,
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.520]   you actually step up and explain it clearly
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.840]   so it doesn't happen again.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.920]   It's only going to get worse because the waters are more
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.560]   and more muddied.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.960]   You probably saw the article in ours
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.640]   Technica this week.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.360]   We talked about it on Windows Weekly
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.200]   about Machinima paying $3 per 1,000 impressions
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.440]   to its YouTube video producers to include positive content
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.720]   about Xbox One.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.160]   Money that apparently was given to the Machinima
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.400]   from Microsoft, although the question about
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.080]   is whether Microsoft knew anything about it
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.720]   and they say they did not.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.160]   Machinima specifically told these YouTube video makers
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.480]   that it had to be positive content about Xbox One.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.520]   They couldn't say anything negative about Machinima.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.320]   And they couldn't say it was a sponsored mention.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.400]   Which is of course a violation of FTC guidelines.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.880]   Which I would get really upset about if it weren't
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.320]   for the fact that every time I watch Modern Family,
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.560]   apparently everybody just uses Windows Phone.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.760]   It's going to be under the dome.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.960]   It's everywhere.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.240]   You cannot get away from it anymore.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.040]   It is everywhere.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.880]   And at this point, I have had it with,
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.080]   let's get worried about it when it happens online
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.360]   where the FTC have to give you guidelines and say,
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.880]   oh, that was a sponsored tweet.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.400]   You better mention it's a sponsored tweet.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.960]   And yet I can watch a half an hour show
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.960]   with so much product placement in it.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.680]   And the idea disclosure was at the very end of the credits,
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.440]   which had been shoved up into little things
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.040]   so they can do promos and everything else.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.320]   There's a little thing telling me that promotional.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.000]   You know what Modern Family is going to Australia this week.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.320]   I love Modern Family by the way.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.800]   But they're going to Australia on some big thing or whatever.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.200]   They're not going to Australia because, hey,
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.120]   we just thought it was a good idea for everybody to go off
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.600]   Australia.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.600]   - The Australian tour, tourism board is freaking down there.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.440]   - They probably do a marketing, you know.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.640]   - Daddy, you are on a red spectacular night.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.640]   - I know.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   - It's wild.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.640]   - It's wild.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.560]   - It's wild and like a marching doll.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.560]   - Can we talk about Gina's Think Up?
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.560]   - I love it.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.560]   - Awesome.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.560]   - All right, let's do that in a second.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.560]   We're going to take a break and talk about something nice.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.560]   - I love it too.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.440]   - Just Think Up and we're going to talk about the change log
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.600]   and a lot more you're watching this week in Google
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.840]   with Gina Trippani, Danny Sullivan from Search Engine Land.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.720]   He's always been, you know, you've always been the guy
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.440]   who was keeping Google honest.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.560]   And I'm just thrilled that you're here as always.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.480]   And of course from Davos, Switzerland and the World Economic
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.520]   Forum, Maher, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.720]   Maher, I like that word.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.280]   Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:23.600]   If you do publications, if you do PowerPoint presentations,
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.040]   if you're doing advertising, if you're doing any project
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:29.520]   that you need royalty free images for, you've got to check out
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.920]   Shutterstock.com.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.440]   It is our royalty free clip art.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.640]   I don't want to use the word clip art.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.480]   So much more than clip art.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.600]   It's our royalty free photo site of choice.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.560]   We have the 25 image a day subscription.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.520]   Find it very useful.
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:48.440]   Partly because the amount of stuff on Shutterstock
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.840]   is so incredibly huge.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:54.160]   32, almost 33 million royalty free stock images,
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.560]   illustrations, vectors and videos.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.160]   But then, you know, that would be nothing
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.800]   if you didn't have a good search tool
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.040]   and they have probably one of the best.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.880]   You can not only search for objects for nouns like bulldozer,
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.800]   but you can modify it with adjectives.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.400]   You can put--
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.600]   I wonder if we can find--
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.760]   I wonder if there's a lonely bulldozer in picture
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.840]   anywhere in here.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.760]   Yes, there's a lonely bulldozer.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.280]   Aww.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.280]   Aww.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.040]   Here's a lonely bulldozer looking out at the Vista.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.560]   That's-- I mean, that is a great search engine.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.920]   So when I say 32 million images, people might go,
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.320]   well, how are you going to find what you want?
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.480]   You can, absolutely.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.400]   Not only that, they add 20,000 plus images every single day.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.960]   So every time you visit, you're going to find something new.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.440]   The images are, for the most part,
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.800]   from professional photographers and artists.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.760]   Of course, they're all curated individually
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.080]   for content and quality.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.520]   They're just fabulous.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.360]   Just fabulous.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.520]   I want you to visit Shutterstock.com.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.000]   Try the search engine.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.560]   Sign up for a free account.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.840]   That's a good idea, because then you
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.160]   can create a light box where you can save images
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.760]   to your light box access.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.960]   And many times, share them with other team members.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.920]   It's a great way to get inspiration.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.760]   They have a wonderful iPad app, a Webby Award-winning iPad app,
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.120]   which lets you search on the go and find inspiration on the go
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.280]   as well.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.760]   Shutterstock.com.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.480]   Truly international, as is Twit.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.600]   If you go to Shutterstock.com and you buy something,
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.920]   they have multilingual customer support.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.240]   In more than a dozen countries, full-time customer
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.800]   support throughout the week.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.000]   They speak your language.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.720]   No credit card needed to set up an account.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.360]   But if you do decide you want to buy and invite you
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:43.840]   to use our offer code TWIG114, TWIG114,
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.120]   and you'll get 25% off any package.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.520]   Shutterstock.com.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:55.040]   Try it for free, but TWIG114, if you want to save 25%, off.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.120]   Do-- don't forget to-- when you go there,
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.760]   there's a-- you're normally on the photos page,
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.000]   but then there's the footage page, which
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.080]   has a whole bunch of stuff, clips and stuff, things
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.480]   you can save-- save for free.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.200]   So that would be useful right there for a PowerPoint,
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:13.400]   a battery filling up in my dreams that fast.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.800]   Shutterstock.com.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.560]   Now play the drums, blow the horns.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.960]   It's time for the changelog.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.960]   The Google changelog.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.840]   What do you think this is a morning show?
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.680]   Here she is, Gina Trapani with the latest from Google.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.840]   I've been waiting for this.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.920]   We have talked about this.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.600]   We talked about this coming up, but now it's finally happening.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:44.880]   We're seeing Google now integrated into Chrome on the desktop.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.200]   All right, before you get too excited,
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.040]   these are the Chrome Canary builds.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.280]   These are the really, really early builds.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.960]   And it's for Windows and Macs, Canary Build, 34.0,
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:58.200]   0.1788 Google and their crazy version numbers.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.880]   So you have to install a Chrome Canary build.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.360]   And then you got to go into Chrome, flags,
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.600]   and enable Google Now.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.600]   Change it to enable, restart, sign in, stand on your head.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.720]   And then when it's all done, you'll
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.760]   see a little card that says Google Now and your desktop,
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.800]   stay connected to what you need to know across all devices.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.200]   This is basically the Google Now that you get on your Android
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:25.280]   phone, but you see weather, scores, traffic, and reminder cards.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.360]   Where's your show map, though?
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.480]   I mean, how does it show up?
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:31.760]   It shows up-- it looks like a browser notification window,
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.240]   basically.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.640]   OK, so it's in the menu bar on a Mac, anyway.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.840]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.360]   OK.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.000]   Exactly.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:37.200]   Oh.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.440]   Exactly.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:43.360]   So I want this upgraded to the stable build ASAP.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:43.920]   Because I love it.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.960]   You don't use Canary?
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.520]   I just installed it today because I want them to try this out.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.360]   I don't use Canary.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.360]   I usually am beta.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:51.880]   So I don't know.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.720]   Maybe I'm just not cutting edge a lot.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.920]   I did Canary for a while.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.240]   I didn't see any more problems with it or anything like that.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.560]   I'm using beta right now.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.320]   But I got to think it's almost here if it's in Canary.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.840]   Yeah, it's a good sign.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.280]   I use Push Bullet, which is this extension
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.480]   that pushes notifications from your Android phone
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.160]   to your desktop.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.560]   So I often do see Google Now cards.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.680]   But it's that's kind of a hacky round about way to do it.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.080]   I love this is built in.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.840]   And the warnings around Canary can break at any time.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.800]   And even when you enable Google Now,
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.200]   it's in the experiment section.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.400]   And there's this giant disclaimer across the top that says,
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.040]   hey, any of these could break at any time.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.640]   Your privacy could be compromised.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.000]   We take no responsibility.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.160]   I mean, yeah, they really kind of just
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.000]   claim the whole thing.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.360]   So I think I'm going to stick with beta.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.160]   But this actually did get me to the stalking area
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.800]   because I wanted to check it out.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.400]   Google Alerts, google.com/alerts,
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.000]   which I haven't looked at in a long time.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.040]   But I did.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.120]   I went back to it today because I wanted
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.760]   to put in an alert for a think up.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.640]   Got a redesign.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.040]   So it looks like Google's paying a little more attention
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.920]   to one of these lesser known but super useful features.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.680]   The Google Alerts email is basically-- you put in a keyword,
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.200]   you say, send me email with new news stories
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.000]   with this keyword in them.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.040]   And the email got a redesign.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:13.240]   It brings it closer to Google's latest look and feel.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.160]   There's the card, style layout.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.400]   You'll see Google search results, or Google Now,
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.640]   and Google's mobile apps.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.440]   And the new alerts will tell you what kind of alert
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.840]   you're getting hourly or daily or weekly.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.440]   And they have larger headlines, social sharing buttons,
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.720]   including Twitter and Facebook.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.960]   So you haven't checked out Google Google Alerts in a while.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.480]   If there's a story or a keyword you want to keep on top of,
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.480]   even with your own name or your company's name,
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.880]   I'll admit that I have total ego searches set up there.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.280]   Check it out.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.320]   And finally, Google's research division
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.080]   put together a really neat visualization of music
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.840]   that's been uploaded to Google Play music.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.960]   So if you go to research.google.com/bigpicture/music,
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.720]   you'll see the Google Play music timeline.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.840]   And it shows kind of--
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.560]   I'm actually not sure what it shows,
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.280]   but it's sure pretty and quite--
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.600]   Popularity of genres over time, I guess, right?
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.160]   I love that.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.640]   Well, I think genres over time, yes.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.960]   Yes, if you mouse over the different genres,
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.000]   you can see the most popular albums.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.800]   So this is based on play music data or rather songs
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.640]   that play music users have uploaded to play music
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.280]   based on release day and genre.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.360]   And it's just a beautiful visualization
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.880]   and a really neat sort of discovery mechanism
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:36.080]   really for music lovers over time from the 1950s.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.160]   Yeah, through 2010.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.800]   I love graphs.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.040]   Yeah, I do too.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.400]   Even if I'm like, I don't know what this means,
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.480]   I still want to click on it.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.400]   I don't know what it means, but I like it.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.400]   Exactly.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.040]   [LAUGHS]
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.760]   Yep, and that's all I got.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.080]   There's your change log.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.320]   Thank you, Gina.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:55.840]   Sure.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.880]   You know what I mostly got out of this is push bullet.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.440]   So--
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.160]   No, push bullet's great.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.640]   So that's cool.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.960]   Have I not talked about push bullet?
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.000]   Oh, I love-- oh, man, I love push bullet.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:08.480]   I think I--
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.840]   I talked about it all about Android, right?
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.800]   Yeah, all about Android.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:11.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.120]   So you put an app on your phone,
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.880]   and then you have to have a Chrome extension on Chrome.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.680]   Yep.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.800]   And then any notifications that go to your phone
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.120]   show up on your desktop.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   That's so cool.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.760]   So if you get a text, Google Now card, and, you know,
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.160]   Google-- now for a while, it'd be crazy because I use Hangouts.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.000]   And so when someone chatted me on Hangouts,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.040]   I would get the notification on Hangouts on my desktop,
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.600]   and then I would get the push bullet notification.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.160]   But you can--
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.720]   So you can disable by app.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.600]   So you can say, hey, don't mirror my notifications here.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.080]   But it's a really nice-- it's really nice when the phone's
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:45.920]   ringing.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.240]   You can see who's calling right on the desktop,
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.960]   or any app fires an notification.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.120]   You can see it without having to pick up your phone.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.720]   Push bullet, push two.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.680]   So I put it on my-- this is neat.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.000]   And I can push stuff to the phone, too.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.920]   You can push stuff to the phone.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.320]   You can push stuff to your friends.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.400]   It's really-- it's a really cool, cool, independent app.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:05.960]   Love it.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.520]   And it's free.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:07.920]   Yep.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:08.360]   Wow.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.360]   Thank you, Gina.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.280]   Very nice.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:11.840]   Push bullet.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.000]   I just installed it.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:14.360]   Nice.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.360]   And listen carefully to every inch of this change log.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.120]   There's all sorts of stuff in there.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:20.600]   You never know.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.240]   It's a Easter egg.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.200]   I like to throw one there.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.840]   By the way, I was just-- I was looking at Google now
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.360]   to see, because somebody said, oh, I only get sports.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.400]   But I get lots of good stuff.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.200]   I get birthdays on my Google now.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.560]   I get my calendar updates, my stocks, and--
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.720]   oh, look, in Petaluma, it's 72 degrees right now.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:35.760]   That's mean of me.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.840]   That's just mean.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:37.720]   That is wrong.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.160]   Just mean.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.160]   Did you get 14 inches and 18 degrees in New York?
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.880]   Did you get 14 inches last night?
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.080]   That's what I heard.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:46.640]   Yep.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.080]   Yep.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.400]   It took me four hours to get from JFK to Manhattan
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.240]   yesterday.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.640]   Yeah, it was one of those days.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.960]   Were you walking?
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.800]   No, slower.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.440]   I was on a bus.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.440]   Wow.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.440]   Did you fly in the Uber?
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:00.920]   No Uber.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:03.280]   Even Uber couldn't save me yesterday.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.880]   Wow.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.720]   Yes.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.880]   What's it like in Davos?
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.080]   I'm sure it's cold and snowy.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.080]   But do you expect that?
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:09.600]   Actually, no.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.040]   No.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.080]   Today was-- last I knew, was 50 degrees.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.640]   OK.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.520]   We're all screwed up.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.560]   And Danny, you're in San Diego, where are you?
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.600]   I'm in Orange County, New Perpitch.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.120]   Orange County.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.120]   It's beautiful and warm.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.120]   I don't know what my temperature is.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:23.680]   And probably not.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.680]   Actually, you're a bit warmer.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.760]   I think in Petaluma in New York,
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.760]   because we've got some coastal fog.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.360]   I can't believe it's 72 degrees.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.440]   That's crazy.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.600]   I've been feeling a little bad.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.200]   But--
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:31.800]   She's--
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.440]   And the weekend-- yeah, it's just--
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.640]   Geez.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.360]   Not super bad.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.840]   This weather report brought to you by Google now.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.600]   I dread looking at now on the morning, actually.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.960]   When I have to decide whether or not I
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.960]   put thermal underwear on, OK?
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.560]   You chose it, young lady.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:48.120]   You wanted--
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:48.720]   I know.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.800]   Although I was just interviewing--
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.480]   I can't remember.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.560]   Maybe it was Larry Dan's for triangulation.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.800]   But there's a general consensus that Brooklyn
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.200]   is a hotbed of innovation right now.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:00.880]   Oh, it is.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.520]   Is the time you place to be.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.840]   Yeah, I think it is.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.600]   That's why I'm here.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.320]   Yeah, he was-- that's what he was saying.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:08.840]   He also--
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.720]   How often do you come in to Manhattan, Gina?
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.480]   Oh, I'm in the office every day now.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.200]   Also, it's all you are, OK?
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.640]   Do you get based out in Manhattan now?
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.480]   Well, my-- I think up's office is in Manhattan,
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.800]   but I'm living in Brooklyn.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.960]   I'm actually still waiting to close on my new place.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.440]   So I've been kind of air-boe-bake crashing in my mom's house.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.160]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.080]   Long story.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:28.960]   I will not regally with the cars.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.520]   It's harder to get alone than ever
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.880]   thanks to those bankers down there on Wall Street.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:34.480]   Yeah, blame the bank.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.160]   You have to practically give them blood type stuff.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.000]   Oh, tell me about it.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.480]   Tell me about it.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.240]   I blame the bankers and the lawyers.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.520]   Raisy now.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.320]   Yeah, we're close, though.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.680]   We're close.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:49.160]   Speaking of crazy, a man and his wife in Columbus, Ohio
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:53.600]   subjected to hour-long interrogation by the FBI
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.120]   because employees at the AMC movie theater
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.440]   saw him wearing Google Glass.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.000]   And I didn't believe this story at first,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.840]   but it's been confirmed since.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.680]   It's just ridiculous.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.840]   This poor guy.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.200]   This poor guy.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.480]   So he's been in this theater before.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.560]   This is Columbus, Ohio.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.440]   He's been in this theater before.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.880]   He's an hour into watching the movie with his--
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.080]   I think with his wife or his partner.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.360]   He's got glass on.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.120]   These guys come and grab him and grab glass off of his face
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.400]   and take him into an interrogation room.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.000]   I'm laughing.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:27.920]   It's not funny.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.880]   But I just can't imagine getting like--
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.280]   He blogs.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.520]   He blogs on the gadget here.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.520]   It was quite embarrassing.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.600]   Outside of the theater, there were five to 10 cops and mall
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.840]   cops.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.280]   It was like major bust.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.320]   First of all, of course, because it's glass,
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.720]   he could have been recording the movie, right?
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:46.520]   Yes.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.240]   He could have been.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.600]   So he could have been recording it on his phone.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.360]   Right.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.200]   But people do that.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.200]   And you will get--
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.040]   No, you're not fine.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:54.640]   But I just--
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.200]   He's going to buy that world's worst video.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.120]   That's what's so absurd about this.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:57.760]   Oh, but they do.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.200]   I mean, they do.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.640]   I mean, there's camcorders people are getting up and down.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.440]   And that's not as terrible, but people do it
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.480]   and people sell it.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:09.680]   But is this really a commensurate response?
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.680]   Somebody who's--
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.680]   Horrors.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.680]   Horrors.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.520]   Taping a movie, even if he was taping the movie.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.440]   It takes five to 10 police officers
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.400]   to take this man down search.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.840]   Yeah, this theater had trouble with bootleg
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.640]   with people recording movies in the past.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.960]   So I guess when they were interrogating him,
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.840]   they were saying, hey man, just give up your ball.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.800]   Like who you working for?
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.320]   Just give up the guy up the chain and we'll let you go.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:38.600]   And he was saying, hey, just plug in my glass to a computer
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.240]   and you'll see like there's pictures of my wife
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.400]   and my dog on there.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.720]   I didn't record the movie.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.200]   And it was an hour or like quite a bit of time passed
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.760]   before they actually looked at glass
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.400]   and tried to see whether or not-- ascertain whether or not
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.040]   he was actually recording.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.400]   He says, he writes, I insisted they connect to the glass
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.800]   and see that there was nothing on it.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.240]   I also insisted they look at my phone and clear things out.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.040]   But they wanted to talk first.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.240]   They wanted to know who I am, where I live, where I work,
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.040]   how much I'm making, how many computers I have at home,
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.600]   why I'm recording the movie, who I'm
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.760]   going to give the recording to, why don't I just
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.480]   give the guy up up the chain because they're not
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.520]   interested in me over and over.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.720]   There is something really wrong when federal law
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.880]   enforcement officials are doing the bidding of the Motion Picture
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.800]   Association of America like this.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.760]   When there's real crimes going on, this is ridiculous.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.720]   You know, if you're going to question them, what was--
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.280]   I think there's so much I found disturbing about it.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.120]   Like, are you going to be ripped out of your seat?
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:33.920]   OK.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.360]   But you're going to be questioned without being
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.600]   written your rights, but you're not actually under arrest,
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.560]   but you're clearly being detained.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.160]   Technically, he should have been able to walk out
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.120]   at any time he wanted to.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:45.640]   They said that.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.640]   They said you're not under arrest,
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.200]   but if you choose not to cooperate, bad things may happen.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:50.480]   Right.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.320]   And at that point, you can say, well, then bring on the bad things
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.800]   because I'm leaving unless you want to arrest me or whatever.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.320]   But so they're all these things.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.240]   But what was disturbing to me was that there's
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.880]   no technical expertise.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.680]   If you're going to go after somebody,
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.080]   and these people, some of them, when
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:08.280]   they seem to have some knowledge of the bootlaking
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.240]   house, what are going on or whatever,
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.560]   and you see that someone has these Google glass,
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.840]   you think you would at least Google a little bit
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.280]   of information about them.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.280]   Or at least--
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:18.760]   Or at least.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.120]   And in short order, you'd understand things like,
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:24.640]   well, you're going to get maybe 45 minutes of the movie
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.800]   recorded.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.720]   Or if he is telling you, well, you
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.880]   can take a look at the want or whatever with it from there,
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.000]   then do it.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.160]   Right.
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:36.480]   He said they released him five minutes after they checked.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.720]   Once they went through my phone, and five minutes later,
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.480]   they concluded I had nothing wrong and offered him four passes
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.480]   to another movie at the theater.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.520]   There is a lesson to be learned here, though.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.440]   Don't wear your glass into a movie theater.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.560]   No, there's a lesson to be learned not for that guy,
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.280]   but for stupid movie theater owners and for stupid cops.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.120]   No, I disagree because I think that if you did the same thing,
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.400]   if you held up your phone and did this,
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:05.800]   or if you had a even camcorder, they would go in and arrest you,
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.120]   and they would be within their rights.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.920]   That's against the law.
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.800]   He had prescription lunges attached to his glass.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.120]   Those are his glasses.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.200]   Ah.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.300]   OK.
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:18.880]   And he wears glasses.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.160]   You know, it's funny, Leo.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.520]   I don't get that it's--
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:27.040]   and even the recording device, it's like--
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.240]   The battery left five minutes.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.280]   Because it's a recording device, it is also your phone.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.520]   If I'm wearing my smart watch to the thing,
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.480]   I don't get arrested because it has a recording device.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.880]   No, but you would if you held it, pointed at it.
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.000]   And the problem with glass is it--
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.600]   I'm going to keep-- if I hold my watch
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.000]   or you get shot at the video.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.960]   But I go to look at it, now my King's up or whatever.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.120]   I could be having glass on because I
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.600]   want to sit in a movie theater for whatever reason.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.840]   I want to get a notification on email.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.520]   I want to get a text message showing up
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.080]   so that I know if I'm having a problem with my babysitter
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.600]   or whatever, just because it has a recording device
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.440]   doesn't mean that it's recording.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.560]   But I think this is the fundamental problem with glass
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.640]   is that it does have a recording device that is pointed at you
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.840]   and you don't always know if it's recording.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.480]   It's the same societal problem of going
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.800]   into a bathroom with glass.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.080]   And people, if you want to have glass take off,
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:16.080]   you better be very sensitive to this.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:16.920]   Right?
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.360]   Leo, I felt the same way that you
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.360]   did before last night's episode of All That Android, which
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.640]   I'm going to plug right now.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.600]   Because we had a guest on Cecilia Boddy, who was the woman
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:29.840]   who was pulled up, was stopped and given a speeding ticket
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.560]   on the road in the San Diego area.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.840]   But she had glass on while she was driving.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:39.040]   And the cop also tried to find her for wearing glass.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:39.920]   And you know, to me--
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:40.360]   She had to fight it in court.
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:41.280]   And one, by the way.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.360]   She had to fight it in court.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.400]   And she won, right?
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.160]   Because they couldn't prove that she was watching
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.720]   a video on glass, right?
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.320]   Which is what the law prohibits, is
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.040]   that you're looking at the second screen.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.320]   And you know, my attitude was like,
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.280]   why would you wear glass while driving?
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.040]   Or why would you wear glass to the movie theater?
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:57.360]   That's just dumb.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.200]   And you know, especially driving, right?
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.800]   Because when you open the package,
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.200]   the first thing that says is like, hey, this is not
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.080]   lawful to wear while you drive.
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.440]   I mean, Google basically says, don't wear it while you're
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:07.960]   driving.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.200]   But Cecilia, you explain like--
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.640]   first of all, she's a CTO of a company that develops glass
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:15.200]   where she wears glass all day long.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.960]   She wakes up in the morning, puts them on,
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.600]   and she's a very dedicated explorer.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.800]   They're just her glasses.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.000]   She doesn't think about it anymore.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.440]   She puts them on, and wears them.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.400]   And it sounds like this is the situation with this guy
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.840]   on the movie theater.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.640]   And it didn't occur to her to take them on.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:31.560]   She was driving, and she wasn't watching
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.040]   Netflix on her glass or whatever.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.320]   She was just driving.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.920]   And particularly with driving, it's like navigation
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:40.320]   is a totally legitimate use case for wearing glass while
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:40.760]   driving.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.200]   So I mean, look, I think that the Explorer program--
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.160]   and I said this on the show last night--
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.640]   the Explorer program is very much the sort of like canary
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.640]   in the coal mine thing.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.640]   I mean, I think that Google is figuring out,
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.600]   like, where does glass-- where does glass create
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.680]   these issues or these problems?
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:00.160]   And I think that movie theater officials and cops
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.680]   on the highway are figuring out what is glass?
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.520]   When they're on, does that mean that they're recording or not?
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.200]   I mean, I think it's just a misunderstanding of the technology.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.840]   But unfortunately, you have people like Cecilia
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:14.280]   and this guy in Ohio who have to be the ones to deal
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.720]   with these sort of legal--
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.720]   Yeah, I think there's some onus--
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.120]   there's some onus, though, on glass owners
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:23.240]   to be aware of the sensitive nature of this.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.840]   And while I don't care if he's in a movie theater,
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.320]   I do think that glass owners need to put the glass up
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.240]   in their head when they're in a men's room.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.560]   I mean, I feel like it's kind of a little tone
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.960]   deaf on the part of glass owners to say,
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.760]   hey, man, these are my prescription glasses.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.240]   What's your problem?
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:42.400]   You're wearing a recording device in your head.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.600]   So you'd be aware of that.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.320]   And some people are going to take Umbridge.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.760]   Some of them will be federal law officials.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.800]   So it might behoove you just to avoid the problem.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.240]   Like, if that's his only pair of glasses?
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.200]   Well, he explained quite a bit, actually,
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.920]   that some other things I was reading on how he has a spare pair,
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.800]   but he's actually been using them as his ordinary pair of glasses.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.200]   Well, he needs to kind of wise up.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.880]   Yeah, but you know, he'd also said
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.680]   that he's been to the theater before.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.720]   And if he can--
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.120]   So he got away with it before.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.120]   That doesn't mean it's not--
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.800]   I was like headed away with anything.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:12.440]   Leo, hold on.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:12.960]   Hold on.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.440]   Hold on.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.360]   Yes, it is.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.200]   Wearing a recording device in your head
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.120]   carries a higher responsibility than not wearing
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.480]   a recording device in your head.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.920]   Will you not agree to that?
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:21.840]   I want to repeat this.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:24.040]   We're recording a device that has like five minutes of battery.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.280]   No, I don't care.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.160]   You're wearing a recording device in your head.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.000]   Leo, I would agree with you in general.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.320]   For example, if I go into a restroom
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.160]   and I am actually wearing glass, I will put them on top of my head
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:35.720]   when I walk in.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:36.160]   Oh, God.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.000]   OK.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.520]   No, but I'm going to slide them up.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.160]   It's no big deal.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.880]   It's just living in the world, Jeff.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.720]   You got people.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.480]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.280]   Let's go to that.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.360]   At the point, at the point, they said I had to worry I'm going to go.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.240]   And then they're going to go.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:50.840]   But it's like--
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:51.920]   Yeah, if you really think--
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:55.520]   It's like a polite consideration to do for anybody who
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.760]   is somebody like me three down.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.560]   Let me write back.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.560]   Let me write back.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:03.600]   If you really think that every man on earth
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.920]   wants to shoot other men's junk, the only thing stopping them
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.560]   is they don't have a camera on their head.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.520]   No, that's not what we're saying.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.520]   No, no, no.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.200]   You have to be where it's society sensitive.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:18.160]   If you go around with a tape recorder like this,
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.160]   people are going to take Umbridge and write your song.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.880]   You're not very glasses that have technology on it.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.520]   Jesus, is this week in Ludditism?
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.720]   What happened?
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.400]   I'm just saying that, yeah, I can see Leo's point
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.240]   that you might want to think about a bit more
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.320]   when you're using technology to be more than that.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.320]   Just be sensitive.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.160]   It might be a bit freaked about.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.800]   No, I'm asking you to give credit to people
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.960]   that they're not going to suddenly be bad because they
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.840]   have technology attached to their head.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.480]   I understand that I'm not saying that they are.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.400]   I'm not even saying this.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.280]   I'm not saying this guy did anything wrong.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.040]   I'm saying if you don't have to act,
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.960]   he you're saying he should act as if people should assume
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:53.680]   that he does.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.880]   He should be sensitive to the fact that people act as if he
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.360]   is virtuous until he does something wrong.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.600]   You know, I make it a guilty before he prove it.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.160]   I'm saying, for example, like if I'm like,
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:08.120]   if I'm wearing glass on occasions and I'm sitting
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.280]   at a table with someone or I'm talking with somebody
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.160]   or interacting with somebody, I may move it to the top
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.960]   of my head just so they don't think I'm going to be
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.400]   suddenly being distracted.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.360]   It's the same way that if I'm talking to somebody
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.160]   and I look at my phone while I'm talking to them,
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.680]   that can be interpreted as rude.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.240]   Jeff, are there--
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.200]   Let me ask you this, Jeff.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.640]   Are there no places you can envision
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.600]   where it would be inappropriate to wear glass?
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:33.920]   That's the issue of wearing it.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:35.480]   I don't think it's a matter of inappropriateness.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.400]   No, I don't think it could be--
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.480]   So there's nowhere you could imagine somebody wearing glass
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.000]   where it would be appropriate to put them away
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.240]   or to take it off.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.240]   That just--
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.080]   I think it's appropriate.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:44.920]   I think it's appropriate--
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:45.920]   In every circumstance.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.840]   I think it's appropriate to say to someone,
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:48.680]   are you recording?
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.880]   It's appropriate to say, I'm not recording.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:51.480]   That's fine.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.680]   So if I'm going into a locker room--
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:53.240]   But what you're saying that--
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:54.280]   If I'm going to a locker room where
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.600]   there are children changing and I'm wearing glass,
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.680]   I should say, hey, I have a right to wear this.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:00.680]   I'm not saying this about right.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:02.400]   I'm saying that you are presuming
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.200]   that because someone is using their technology--
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:04.760]   No, I'm not.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:05.720]   --or the use of it is bad.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:06.760]   Yeah, you are.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.560]   And that's an issue because the knee jerk
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.120]   of the techno panic crowd is that any use
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.800]   of the techno-- if it could be done bad,
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.200]   it will be done bad by everyone.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.720]   And none of us should use it.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.880]   And I'm objecting to that logic.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:22.720]   Jeff, if I carry an axe around and I--
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.280]   Oh, I've no intent to chop anybody.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.320]   This is for wood.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.920]   If I carry a gun around, I have no intent to shoot anybody.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.800]   I use this to shoot deer.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.320]   Leo, what are you doing?
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.240]   Are there not things that are just--
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.840]   I mean, maybe legal, but societally.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.320]   It might be nice if people showed some consideration
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.880]   for other people.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.280]   Leo, an eight far away from you, the people
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.960]   driving around with gun racks in the back of their pickups.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.200]   And if you went up to them and said,
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.440]   I object to you doing that, you shouldn't do that.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:52.560]   I want to dash cam on that scene.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.880]   No, but I can assure you if they came in here carrying
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.360]   the weapons.
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.560]   In fact, you go to Texas, every bar has a sign that says,
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.920]   please don't bring your gun in here.
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:02.440]   Is that wrong?
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.960]   Are they in some way--
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:07.320]   Glass is not a gun.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.520]   I'm just saying there are behaviors.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:11.240]   There are things you can have, whether you
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.120]   intend to do anything wrong or not,
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:15.320]   that would just be polite to take them off.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.600]   It's the same discussion.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.520]   No, the guy's glasses.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.560]   When I get glasses, when I get the new glasses,
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.000]   and I get prescription lenses on them,
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.760]   I'm not carrying around an expert glasses
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.960]   and changing them all the time.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.160]   That's my glasses.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.160]   Well, I think that--
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.200]   We might have the same issue.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:31.000]   This is going to be an issue going forward.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.120]   And it could be very--
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.400]   When we had the same issue, it was the same argument
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.440]   when cameras went on to cell phones.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.400]   And it was, oh my god, we can't allow them
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:40.440]   anywhere there are gyms.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.160]   How many stories have you seen of sickos
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.560]   taking pictures of gyms?
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:45.480]   We didn't see it.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.720]   Because we're not sicko as a society.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.120]   Yeah, but I have to say, if I go in a locker room--
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.240]   What a problem.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.640]   I don't go in a locker room like this.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.400]   Hey, everybody.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.440]   No, but if somebody--
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:58.000]   But if you're wearing it on your head, it's OK.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.400]   OK, Leo, if they've got their phone out,
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.240]   they're texting you like this.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.320]   And the camera could be pointed at your junk,
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:03.240]   but they're doing this.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.440]   Well, I think that's rude.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.640]   I don't think you should do that.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.640]   Are they the extraordinarily rude?
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.000]   When I was at CES, I was in a restroom.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.920]   And like I said, if I had had glass,
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.920]   when I walk in, I probably would have moved at the top of my head,
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:17.680]   just not because I'm worried that some guy is standing next
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:18.920]   to me thinks I'm taking a picture of him,
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.080]   but just because the entire bathroom area
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:24.080]   tends to have some degree of privacy expected into it.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.960]   So I'm like, for whatever reason, I'll put it there.
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:30.280]   But as I was in this restroom, the urinals in this restroom
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:31.280]   started to get too graphic.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.320]   But last week we talked about a lot of potential--
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.840]   This particular hotel thought it was funny that above all
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:38.840]   the urinals was pictures of women making funny faces
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:39.840]   and pointing down at you.
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.840]   Looking at your junk, yeah.
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:43.120]   That's in Vegas.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.840]   Yeah, I've seen that.
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:45.840]   How did you--
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.840]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.080]   But I wanted to share that with my regular phone.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:54.800]   But before I did that, I was really careful to make sure--
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.880]   Nobody's in there.
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:57.240]   If somebody's standing at the urinal,
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.880]   you do not take that picture.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.080]   I'm not saying you would take a picture then.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.400]   And I'm not saying that just because I have a camera with you
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.040]   or else we can't tell with glass.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.920]   Let me just say it's somebody to do--
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:07.920]   Yes, you can.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.800]   I can tell you're taking a picture?
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.720]   OK, glass.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.560]   No, but you don't have to do OK, glass.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:14.760]   You can wink.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.440]   No, no, no.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.760]   You can't--
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.440]   You can go like this and wink.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.200]   You can--
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.040]   I think you're playing in a technopatic.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.960]   And so there was no justification for the treatment
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.440]   of this guy in this theater for wearing his glasses that
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.320]   happened to have a camera attached that he was not using.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.920]   No, the right thing for the theater to do was to say,
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:33.880]   I'm sorry, you can't wear your glass into the theater.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.640]   No, the right thing to do is to say, remember, sir,
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.040]   please don't use that camera.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.520]   Oh, yeah, that'll work.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:46.120]   Once again, what faith you haven't mankind?
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.880]   I mean, the reality is if he had actually
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.880]   been recording the movie with glass,
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.320]   it would have been at the worst recording
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:53.600]   if he had been had a giant camcorder on his shoulder.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.680]   Yeah, he would.
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:58.160]   That doesn't stop people from doing it and selling it.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:02.520]   Yeah, but then he also would have had 45 minutes of the movie.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.040]   OK.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:07.920]   I mean, it's just-- it can't do two hours of video.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.360]   So that's like saying, well, you know,
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.360]   I have this camera phone and I'm holding it like this,
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.880]   but you don't have to worry because it only can record,
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.720]   you know, 720p.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.920]   I mean, I don't think that that's really--
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.440]   Yeah, but I think part of the issue--
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:25.960]   again, this is a precursor of what's going to come.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:28.280]   I think we are going to have glasses that
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:31.200]   have recording devices because they make a lot of sense.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.640]   So the issue is not going to go away,
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:36.440]   and it's going to become even more complicated because, yeah,
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:39.440]   if you are having glasses where everything can fit
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.080]   into an ordinary frame, those would be your main glasses.
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:44.480]   The reason I don't wear glass to an eye
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.920]   going to the movie theater, by the way,
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.720]   is because, well, aside from the fact I don't need them,
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:51.040]   I like to wear my regular glasses that let me see you
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.440]   at distance, right?
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:56.280]   So I'm not going to double stack them or whatever.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.560]   I don't need them for most things.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.200]   But, you know, if I had a pair of glasses,
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.600]   or especially around here, sunglasses,
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.760]   I'm desperate for a pair of sunglasses.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:08.880]   I use glass here in Newport as my sunglasses.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.840]   You know, if I'm going out on the paddleboard or something
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.720]   like that, the sunglasses are great.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.880]   I can take pictures of stuff, and I don't really give it
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.000]   a second thought because, you know, there's a great use case.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.960]   And so when they become just this ordinary device
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.480]   that you're wearing, it's going to be everywhere.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:23.560]   And so then, you know, I don't know what you're going to do.
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:26.840]   At that point, do you stop everybody who walks into theater?
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.600]   Because--
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:31.880]   This is a rerun of 1890 and the COVID time.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.400]   You're not allowed to carry a camcorder into a theater, either.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.360]   I mean, I don't think that that's so--
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.000]   that's a unreasonable restriction.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.520]   Admittedly, they overreacted in what they did was wrong.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:41.080]   But--
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:43.320]   But I think-- so to go both ways and think to what--
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.720]   I think to what Jeff is saying, when you eventually
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:48.440]   get to everybody has these recording devices,
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.880]   you get to the point where people start
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.720]   to relax about them and freak out.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:52.720]   Yes.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.400]   And always think--
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:54.760]   Yes, and always think of normal norms.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:57.480]   You'll probably become pretty clear that a movie recorded
[00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:01.280]   from someone's head is not going to be as great, you know,
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.560]   even as things improve.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.120]   But I think--
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:07.720]   Do you think that we have a legal right to wear glass?
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.200]   Yes.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.200]   Oh, gee.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.840]   Oh, legal right to wear glass.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.480]   I have a legal right to carry around a pencil and paper.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:19.920]   When Glenn Greenwald's husband was prevented from writing down
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.520]   the name of the agents interrogating him, at the border of the UK,
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.800]   I was offended by that, that you couldn't record
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.440]   something by having me.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.360]   What if I go in a theater with a go approach step
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.240]   trapped to my chest?
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.080]   Well, no, I mean--
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:33.840]   It looked like a door.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.800]   --a restaurant that says, like, shirts and shoes, please.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.600]   You know, you can't-- I mean, that's a different thing.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.320]   I mean, I think if a bar said--
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.680]   No, it--
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.680]   And now you have the go-pro to see the movie.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.360]   And that's where the private business has the-- so do you
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.480]   have a legal right to go into a private business wearing glass?
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:49.880]   No.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:50.720]   Probably not.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.160]   The theater has every right to say,
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.720]   you may not wear glass in this theater.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.480]   Unless you can prove some.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.600]   Maybe there's like an American--
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.360]   The handicap.
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:58.040]   Right.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.960]   ADA says I can wear glass in this theater.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:00.880]   Yeah, actually, I had the right to do it.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.280]   But in most cases, no.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.200]   A private business probably could prevent you to do it.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:05.720]   I know the account.
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.680]   You have the right to be detained because you're wearing
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.920]   something by law or without being arrested.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.160]   Well, no, but that's recent law that says you cannot record
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:14.640]   a movie.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.760]   And that is a law.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.680]   I mean, I think they overreacted,
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.000]   but they have the right to do that.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.840]   They did not act illegally.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.320]   Otherwise, there would be a lawsuit going on right now.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.120]   They did not act illegally.
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.560]   I'm about to ask my Devor Act moment and ask,
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.160]   did nothing happen this week?
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:32.840]   We're moving on.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.200]   LegalZoom.com.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.200]   It's not a law firm, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.200]   It is a sponsor.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:37.840]   And I love them.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.200]   Personalized, affordable, legal protection.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.760]   If you're starting a business, do not
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.760]   start a business without making it a corporation,
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.960]   whether it's an LLC or chapter, S or chapter C.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:48.760]   And you know what?
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.440]   You might have said, I can't afford to do that.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.280]   At least you can $99 plus the state filing fee for an LLC.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.840]   And I can tell you, these things work.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.520]   We did it in 2005.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:03.520]   Same exact operating agreement, papers and everything.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.760]   Ever since, nine years later.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.680]   LegalZoom also will do trademarks.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.080]   Hey, you got to have a trademark.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.440]   If you've got a blog or if you're OMG Chad,
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.960]   you've got something that is yours,
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.680]   you don't want somebody copying it, just trademark it.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.720]   It's easy.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.800]   LegalZoom is a step-by-step questionnaire.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:18.840]   You will through it.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.640]   You pay the reasonable fee and boom, you're done.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.800]   Now, if you feel I need to talk to a lawyer and buy,
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.360]   I'll give you an example.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:29.000]   I was trying to decide what state I should incorporate in.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.840]   Delaware, California, that's when you
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:32.080]   might want to talk to somebody who
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.600]   has some expertise in the matter.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.440]   But you don't have to pay the inflated hourly rates
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:37.160]   of an attorney.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.280]   You can go to LegalZoom.com.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.680]   They have pre-negotiated rates.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.360]   With attorneys practicing in your state,

[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.920]   before you hire the attorney.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.480]   And the prices are absolutely right.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:54.320]   From $23.99 a month for the business legal plan a month.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:58.840]   I can't talk to my attorney for five minutes for $23.99.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.040]   $11.99 a month for personal legal plans.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.000]   They also have personal services like Last Will
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.680]   and Testament.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.440]   Here's one you absolutely should do.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.360]   If you don't have a health care power of attorney,
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:15.320]   make one right now at LegalZoom.com or a living will.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.600]   If you can't make decisions on your own,
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.560]   this is really because you're ill.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.200]   Very important.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.520]   Very important.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.840]   So go to LegalZoom.com.

[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.880]   can't connect you with a third party attorney
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.520]   and provide you with self-help services,
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.640]   from wills to business formation, trademarks, power of attorney.

[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.080]   LegalZoom.com.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.760]   When you just think of it, we'll buy you a cup of coffee
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.000]   if you mention us.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.800]   LegalZoom.com.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:19.040]   Jeff Jarvis at Davos in Switzerland, Gina Trepani in New York
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.040]   at ThinkUp headquarters, Danny Sullivan, search engine
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.920]   land in Newport Beach.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.680]   Actually, I thought this was kind of interesting.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.600]   It's a Google moonshot.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:31.800]   They want to make a contact lens for diabetes patients
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.520]   that would diagnose glucose in your tears.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.080]   So you--
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:36.600]   So cool.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.400]   Isn't that neat?
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.320]   It is really cool.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.920]   But here too, you're too immediately
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.560]   heard, oil privacy.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.480]   Google will know about your diabetes.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.440]   Well, that's true.
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:49.120]   I've been heard diabetics say, if they can invent this,
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:49.960]   it make me healthier.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.400]   God bless.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.040]   I don't think any diabetic minds--
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:57.920]   if you go to a drug store and you buy a pinprick kit,
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.840]   then you're on CVS's list.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.480]   I mean--
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.920]   I heard a great story today at Davos.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.800]   Mark Benioff was on stage at an event.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:09.120]   And he uses Fitbit religiously.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:12.000]   In fact, here at Davos, they're giving us all ups.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:12.600]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.160]   In a health challenge.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.000]   But Benioff has a Fitbit.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.720]   And he's tied into a community of people.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:22.760]   And he said he got email one day, not long ago, from Michael
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:26.080]   Dell, saying, Mark, are you OK?
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.960]   Benioff said, well, what do you mean?
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.560]   And Dell came back and said, you haven't been exercising
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.760]   for three days.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.800]   And he's just kind of a great story.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.160]   But then Benioff said it made him realize--
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.480]   He's a little creepy.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.400]   It's in his close group of friends, he trusts, right?
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.960]   He wouldn't let Leo Elle in.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.080]   He leads--
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:49.880]   Michael Dell in.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:50.880]   And he knows him.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.920]   But he also said, I'm the CEO of a public company.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:57.360]   And maybe somebody's going to know something about my health.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.560]   He said, something I realized, I'm
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.880]   going to think about this.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.600]   I've got to be careful.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.880]   Interesting.
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.200]   Yeah, it really was.
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.080]   So like, that's right.
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.440]   His business--
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.320]   Yeah, so the hell of his company
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.000]   tied to his own health in a way, because he was broadcasting
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.200]   that or broadcasting.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.880]   He's publishing it to at least a small number of people
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.520]   or a number of people.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.560]   I saw Dell later on the floor.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.720]   And I said, you and Benioff should
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.720]   compete to become the most executive executive.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:30.320]   And he said, I'll let Marko have that.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.840]   Mark also talked about his connected Wi-Fi toothbrush
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.080]   and how he loved that.
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:36.680]   What does it do?
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.720]   What does the toothbrush do?
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.320]   Or his idea.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:40.840]   His idea.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.920]   I mean, this is a part of--
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:42.360]   I don't know.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.080]   Or maybe he said, yeah, I couldn't tell the difference.
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:45.320]   But he really wants it.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.600]   Because he wants it to track him.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.320]   And he wants it to go directly to his dentist,
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.000]   his dentist who'd give him tips.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   And he wants there to be a button on it that says, help.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.280]   And it will connect through his phone to the manufacturer.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.760]   And he can get help.
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.720]   Does it do all that now?
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.880]   I don't think so yet.
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.440]   You know, somebody--
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.480]   I don't think it does anything.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.280]   I think it's made up.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:08.280]   I don't think there is a Wi-Fi toothbrush.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.480]   I mean, it's just a matter of time.
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.280]   You should have to check out trackahall
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.400]   and you were brushing, though.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.000]   Yeah, that's what you really wanted to do.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   Tell them about it.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.640]   There was one.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.640]   It was going to be connected.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.000]   Oh, it's not here yet.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.200]   Well, here's a story about a ZD net sales force
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.840]   as Benioff says your toothbrush will be a marketing tool.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:27.680]   Oh, that's bad.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.720]   See, Mark, shut up.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.720]   Because that's just going to make people-- that's exactly
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.600]   what's causing people to worry about this stuff.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.200]   You need toothpaste.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.200]   You need mouthwash.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.200]   Your breath's melting.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.200]   Probably this is a spiel.
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.200]   He's been doing disgusting.
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.200]   Yeah, see, I think what you really want to be careful about
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.200]   is promoting these as a way to get you better advertising.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.600]   I think we've established people who don't care
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:52.000]   about better advertising.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   What about a toothbrush that can detect your glucose levels
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.600]   through your saliva as well as tell you what a thought you've--
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.200]   Yeah, yeah, there you go.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.200]   Well, I have to say, if they could find glucose levels in tears,
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.600]   they probably could do blood alcohol level and other things.
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.400]   Here it is, by the way, the Wi-Fi toothbrush.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.400]   Beambrush.com.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.600]   Thank you, Chattram.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.600]   Beamtoothedbrush.com.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.600]   Get prizes for brushing your teeth.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.600]   Get prizes for brushing your teeth.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.200]   This is the thing about a quantified self that just--
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.000]   Jeeta, you have a daughter.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   You're going to be trying to convince her to brush her teeth
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   pretty soon.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   Well, this is the thing.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.800]   It's like you have these apps treating you like your mom,
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.800]   like giving you rewards for doing your chores.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.800]   Wait a minute.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.800]   Look at this brush, doesn't that look like an electric toothbrush?
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.800]   It's not.
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.800]   It's a manual toothbrush.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.800]   All of the size and the charging is dedicated just
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.800]   so they can talk to your phone.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:47.800]   So Wi-Fi.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.800]   That's so stupid.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:52.800]   Install the free B-map and connect your brush with a user profile.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.800]   So I don't want to start another hour of discussion
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.800]   because I'm tired, but--
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.800]   Oh, what?
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.800]   The CEO of Palantir.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.800]   Palantir is the big data secret, big data company.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.800]   It's kind of coming out.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.800]   He was a DLD where I was last week.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.800]   And he was in Davos.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.800]   He was talking to you today.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:12.800]   And he uses an example of a fascinating data thing
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:20.800]   that payments to doctors and pharmacies are incredibly
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:25.800]   indicative of addiction and overdose.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.800]   And he said, imagine-- so he said, it's not at all implausible
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.800]   in the state of New Hampshire where there's a huge problem
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.800]   with heroin right now.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.800]   And the governor did an entire state of the state speech
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:37.800]   about this.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.800]   It's Tom Cruise.
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.800]   You could predict that someone is going to overdose
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.800]   with a good probability of being right.
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:46.800]   Pre-crew.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:47.800]   Do you intervene?
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.800]   Do you intervene?
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.800]   Well, how do you know?
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:57.800]   Because the orders on your basis to your doctor
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.800]   and the pharmacy are highly indicative in ways
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:00.800]   that I don't know.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.800]   But everybody in the room would say, yes, this is true.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.800]   It's the data's there.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:06.800]   Wow.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.800]   Does who intervene?
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.800]   The health officials in law enforcement.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.800]   Or health officials.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:12.800]   I would say not police.
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.800]   I mean, there's no question if you knew that, you know,
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:16.800]   in fact, this happens all the time.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.800]   You had some indication that a child was being abused
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.800]   at home that you would intervene.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.800]   Yes.
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.800]   But that's defending an innocent person.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.800]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.800]   Well, let's say it's no police.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.800]   Let's say that you had an N percent, 85 percent.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.800]   You're picking up the number.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.800]   But a high percentage of odds that someone was going to overdose.
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.800]   They had these signs, these signals,
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.800]   that said they were going to overdose.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.800]   And if you don't intervene.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:44.800]   I think you can't.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.800]   I don't think you can intervene.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:52.800]   You don't think that someone's doctor is beholden to, I mean,
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:53.800]   given those indications?
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.800]   I mean, what's the difference between.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:56.800]   Yeah, the doctor should say something.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.800]   Turns out the intervention is a doctor.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.800]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.800]   What is it?
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.800]   Cross various.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.800]   And the doctor should say so the doctor shouldn't go to the person's
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.800]   house.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:05.800]   Oh, there's there's HIPAA stuff.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:07.800]   I was talking to a doctor at night at a session.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.800]   I was at night.
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:09.800]   This is the one who's in Davos.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.800]   And she said that, you know, years ago, if she were in a hospital,
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.800]   when she saw someone, she could pick up the chart and read it.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.800]   Now that's, that's all electronic.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:17.800]   It's no, no, no.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.800]   And two people in her hospital were fired because they looked at data
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.800]   for Boston bombing victims.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:23.800]   Well, that's right.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:24.800]   That's appropriate.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.800]   Because that was, that was pure prurient.
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.800]   That wasn't for health purposes.
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:30.800]   That was in that case.
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.800]   But with the same principle applies, the one of the doctors says,
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:35.800]   you know, this person is looking a little yellow to me.
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:36.800]   We're just going to walk by.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:37.800]   I don't know.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:38.800]   Maybe I should take a look at them.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:39.800]   You don't have the right authority.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:43.800]   You can't even just look because it's presumed to be evil and tense.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.800]   What a world.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:49.800]   But I didn't want to get into an hour discussion.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.800]   Watch out for your Chrome extensions.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:59.800]   It turns out that there is a quick market in a good market in Chrome
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:00.800]   extensions.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.800]   Spammers come along by a small Chrome extension, you know, has a few
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.800]   hundred thousand users.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.800]   Give them a few bucks.
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:08.800]   Take it over.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.800]   And then there's no mechanism in Chrome to vet updates to that
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.800]   application.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.800]   Google's removed to add, defeat, and tweet this page after one was
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:22.800]   sold, the other was paid to show adware by a simple update.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.800]   And this seems to be a real flaw in the way Chrome extensions are
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.800]   handled.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.800]   Google vets the Chrome extension to get it on the marketplace.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.800]   But after that, anything goes.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.800]   So there's a bit.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.800]   Yeah, it should check updates.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.800]   It should check updates.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.800]   And you know how Google found out about this?
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:40.800]   The Wall Street Journal.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.800]   Oh, no.
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:45.800]   Is that true?
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.800]   Oh, no.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.800]   No, no, no.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.800]   Well, presumably what happened is that people who had installed
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.800]   this extension went, what the hell?
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.800]   I'm seeing ads and complain in some way that the Journal posted a
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.800]   random article about it.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.800]   Google noted the article and said, oh, we better do something.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.800]   Well, the other problem with extensions and I'm going to talk
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.800]   about this generally because I haven't done a whole lot of
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:10.800]   extension development I've dabbled is that permissions for
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.800]   extensions are very broad.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.800]   Almost every Chrome extension that you install asks you for
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.800]   permission to see all your rear browsing activities on every
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:21.800]   tab.
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:23.800]   I don't know if you've noticed this when you install.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.800]   It freaks me out every time.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.800]   But most extensions can't work without those permissions because
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.800]   they do certain things on certain pages.
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.800]   And so they have to be able to.
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.800]   So you're sort of trusting them to only do what they need to do
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:37.800]   on the pages that they apply to.
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:41.800]   But those overly broad permissions allow for this kind of thing
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.800]   to happen for someone to buy the extension or take it over with
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:45.800]   malware or whatever.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:46.800]   So I think there's two issues.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:51.800]   There's the permissions model, which I think Google could do
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:52.800]   better with.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.800]   I'll add Android's permission model, which also could use a
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.800]   little improvement but is definitely better than what they
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:57.800]   have for Chrome.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.800]   But also the update vetting process.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:03.800]   I mean, all they have to do is parse that code, that source
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:08.800]   code on every update and check for URLs and run it against
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:13.800]   their malware database, their Ad or malware database and flag it.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:19.800]   So the way it happened, I meet our Grow AgroWall, who created
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:22.800]   Ad Defeedly, described on his website how he had sold the
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.800]   extension to an unknown buyer for a small sum.
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:28.800]   He said the new owner added code that injected invasive
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:29.800]   advertising on users.
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.800]   Meanwhile, ours Technica reported the other extension,
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.800]   which was a very popular product.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.800]   And we now have a $1,000 extension.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.800]   We have a $1,000 extension.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.800]   We have a $1,000 extension.

[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.800]   That's okay.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.800]   I would take the money and run.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.800]   I installed the Nest stuff, by the way.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:02.800]   I didn't have it.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.800]   I ordered the thermostat, which I thought was a waste.
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:06.800]   I thought it was a waste.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.800]   For me, I don't get it, right?
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.800]   I'm in Southern California.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.800]   You never leave the house.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.800]   We're right on the coast.
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.800]   It's not hot and it's not cold.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.800]   It's like 10 times a year.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.800]   I turn on to maybe get a little bit more heat.
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:29.800]   It's kind of cool that I thought I was going to be constantly trying to adjust stuff.
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:32.800]   I could see why people would want it.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:33.800]   It was pretty smart.
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:38.800]   It was cool to flip the fan on when I was wait just to feed the kids out.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:43.800]   The smoke detector, though, I'm like, "Wow, that's an expensive smoke detector."
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:48.800]   When you get the instructions, we really recommend smoke detectors to be placed inside and outside.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:53.800]   It's like $2,000 in wiring up my house with smart smoke detectors.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.800]   That may be why I didn't really get much out of the Nest because I live in California.
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:59.800]   Maybe it makes more sense if you live in the frigid tundra.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:01.800]   Oh, rub it again.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.800]   We have rubbed it again.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.800]   It was turning on the heat at random times.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:10.800]   It was too smart for it to sound good.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:15.800]   Frankly, Jeff, if I'm on the way home and I have to get home in the house is cold and I have to turn on the heat,
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:18.800]   it's not the end of the world.
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.800]   You see what, here's what I want.
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:20.800]   But you're in California.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:21.800]   That's true.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:22.800]   Yes.
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:23.800]   It's 18 degrees here.
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:29.800]   On the other hand, if you're in New England or New York, you don't let the house get down to 52 degrees.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.800]   You're always out.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.800]   I'll give you another example.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.800]   We have the heated floor in the bathroom.
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:36.800]   It's cold where we live.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:44.800]   I want my alarm to be tied to the floor so the floor goes on 15 minutes before the alarm goes off.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.800]   This is such a first world problem.
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:48.800]   I don't know.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.800]   That's yes.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.800]   You could wear slippers, Jeff.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:59.800]   I say that as a guy who has a toilet seat that heats up.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:00.800]   I understand.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:05.800]   Those are awesome when I've had them in the hotel.
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.800]   No, I am not immune to the pleasures.
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.800]   I'm going to do the Davos backlash tonight.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.800]   I'm going to load the water so you're treating me.
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:15.800]   No, no, I'm with you.
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.800]   I'm saying I have a toilet seat that washes my butt.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.800]   However, it's hard to justify a $250 smoke alarm.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.800]   Oh, I've got to agree with that.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.800]   I'm saying I saw a four connection that shouldn't cost anything.
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.800]   Yeah, I mean eventually all this stuff.
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.800]   And maybe it'll just be kind of, it's just the way it is.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:32.800]   Everything's talking to everything else.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:38.800]   And it's all, I just see all sorts of difficulty in having, you know, I mean, this is a lot.
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:39.800]   We're a little ways off.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.800]   It's $129 for the smoke detector.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.800]   Okay, so it's only four times more expensive than a first alert.
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.800]   No, I think a first alert runs $12.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:51.800]   They're cheap.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:52.800]   Oh, you get.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:54.800]   Well, that's not the wired one.
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:55.800]   It was 45.
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:56.800]   The wired ones are more expensive.
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:57.800]   You're right.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.800]   And the CO2 one, I think a 75 or 80.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:00.800]   Right.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:01.800]   All right.
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:02.800]   So it's not so far off.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:03.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:05.800]   I can't remember what it was.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:06.800]   I wanted to talk.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:08.800]   Oh, here's one thing you said last night that I loved.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:16.800]   They auditioned huge numbers of people to be the voice of the Nestle arm.
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.800]   Because the Nestle arm will say, um, I'll do it.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:20.800]   I'll stop to you, right?
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.800]   I'll do it.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:22.800]   Get out of the house.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.800]   It's writing down.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:31.800]   And he also said that they picked a woman's voice because children of a certain age, you
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:33.800]   know, listen to mother's voices.
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:34.800]   Yes.
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:35.800]   They do that for pilots.
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:40.800]   So the heads up, the heads up voice when you're, you're blacking out in a plane is always a
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.800]   female.
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:45.800]   Because pilots listen to female voices, but that's well, that's been known for years.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.800]   I didn't know that.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.800]   Pull up.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:48.800]   Pull up.
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:49.800]   Pull up.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.800]   It's always a female voice.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.800]   I hated a lot of testing that.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.800]   You can hear it sometimes when you're on the plane.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:56.800]   It's very depressing.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:58.800]   Pull up.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:25:59.800]   Pull up.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.800]   No.
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:04.800]   I just confess my first world problem that I sit in first business class to hear it.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:10.800]   I just need a nest light switch that when the kids leave the room goes, Hey, turn off the
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:11.800]   light.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:12.800]   Hey, I'm not made of money.
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.800]   I would call it dad switch.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:16.800]   I'm not made of money.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:17.800]   Turn off the lights.
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.800]   Although we have to have one room redone and then they put in these automatic switches
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.800]   that are apparently not very expensive.
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.800]   And I was like, but you've just made me redundant.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.800]   By the way, man, the chairman's giving me a hard time.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:34.800]   Not just men listen to female voices, women listen to female voices too.
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.800]   It works for both genders.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.800]   Humans listen to female voices.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.800]   Oh, yes.
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:40.800]   But I can add something to this.
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:46.280]   I remember reading an article about BMW or somebody in Germany discovering that they couldn't
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:49.800]   use a woman's voice for the auto navigation in the car.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:50.800]   That was a big one.
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:51.800]   That was a big one.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:55.800]   Men because they did not like a woman telling them what to do.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:56.800]   Oh my gosh.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.800]   I remember that.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:58.800]   Oh my gosh.
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.800]   In that case, they had to go with voice.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:07.000]   And in particular with a man using a copilot style intonation because they reacted better
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.800]   and more like the copilot with them.
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.800]   Oh, wow.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:12.800]   Interesting.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:13.800]   It's OK.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.800]   The copilot is telling us to turn.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.800]   But if my wife is telling me to turn, I am not going to turn.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:22.800]   I mean, I've heard that children, particularly babies, just bond to hire.
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.800]   I mean, that's why this is why babies love Elmo, right?
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.800]   Because the voice is just so high.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.800]   Right.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.800]   No, that way.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:30.800]   Right.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.800]   So you can get wood now in your Moto X. They got four kinds and it's cheap.
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:38.720]   It's 25 bucks to add a wooden back.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.880]   They started with a bamboo.
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:44.400]   But as of yesterday, Ebony, I don't like Elgin just ordered his Ebony.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.560]   Teak and walnut.
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:47.560]   God, that's gorgeous.
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.360]   So are you doing it, Leo?
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.200]   I already have a Moto X, but I actually am thinking of buying a new Moto X just so I can
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:54.200]   have walnut.
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:57.200]   Isn't that look so you can't do just the back.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.200]   Right.
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:27:59.840]   No, no, you have to buy a whole new Moto X.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:05.920]   But look at the price, by the way, when I bought the Moto X, it wasn't 75 bucks.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.480]   They've really dropped the price.
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:10.640]   That's of course with subsidy, but still they've really dropped the price.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.880]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:16.240]   You're rightly, even with the wood, it's cheaper than the retail that you pay.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.520]   Absolutely it is.
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:18.520]   Yeah, right.
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:19.520]   Interesting.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.720]   Si.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:23.680]   No off contract.
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:26.120]   It's now $3.99.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.240]   It's almost half what I was paid when I paid.
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:30.480]   Trading your old phone and get a credit.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.600]   I wonder if they take a Moto X as the old phone.
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:37.000]   I really, I really love walnut.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000]   It's so beautiful.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.160]   The only reason I wouldn't do that is I have to, I just have a strong suspicion there must
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:46.280]   be a next generation coming any minute now.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:48.120]   Any minute now.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.280]   Yeah, with the price drops.
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.280]   Yep.
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:52.280]   Yep.
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:54.480]   Let us take a break when we come back.
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.200]   Tips, tools, numbers.
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.880]   Danny, if you want to throw in a pick of the week, we'd love it.
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:28:59.880]   Oh, okay.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:03.760]   You're watching this week in Google with Danny Sullivan, a search engine land.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.720]   Although I probably have to jump off.
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:06.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:07.720]   Oh, God.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.720]   We kept you long.
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:09.720]   You want to leave?
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:10.720]   You can.
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:11.720]   Danny Sullivan, thank you.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.720]   I picked of the week real quick is think up.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:13.720]   It's awesome.
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:14.720]   It is awesome.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:15.720]   Thank you.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:18.360]   I look forward to Twitter buying it because that's what they should just do.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.800]   Danny, thank you for keeping us, letting us keep you a little longer.
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:22.800]   I appreciate it.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.200]   It's got a little pride done by three.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.560]   You're like, no, I really got to go now.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:26.760]   Oh, I had no idea.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.160]   I wasn't paying attention.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.520]   Thank you, Danny Sullivan marketing, watch and search engine land.
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.160]   Take care.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.160]   Take care.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.160]   Thanks, Danny.
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.160]   Bye bye, Danny.
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.160]   Great guy.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.160]   Love.
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.160]   Don't we love Danny Sullivan?
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:41.160]   We do it.
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:42.160]   Yeah, you just did me a song.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:47.280]   He's a good runner, but you know, he's been kind of this the conscience of the search
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:50.280]   industry, particularly Google for ages.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.280]   So, what did you need?
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:58.400]   Our show today brought to you by 99designs.com.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.400]   This is a great place to go.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.920]   In fact, I was just looking at our t-shirt designs.
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:01.920]   We're going to actually hoodie designs.
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:03.440]   We're going to do a hoodie.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:04.440]   And I was rating it.
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:05.440]   It was so great.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:09.640]   So, what we did is we went and we created a contest on 99 designs.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:13.360]   There are currently 2,280 open contests.
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:18.200]   And we said we want a design for our hoodies.
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:20.000]   And we got, I can't remember.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.680]   I looked at three pages of designs.
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:26.560]   I went and picked my top five and then we're going to have a little vote off and so forth.
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:27.560]   It's so much fun.
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:30.800]   So many, thank you, everybody who submitted designs.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:35.280]   You know, I think this is a really great way to bring people who need design help together

[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:31.840]   If you go to 99designs.com/twig, you'll get a $99 power pack of services absolutely free.
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:34.760]   Power pack gives you more designer time and attention.
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:38.000]   They'll bold, highlight and feature your design project.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.560]   In the 99designs marketplace, you will get, as a result, more than twice as many designs.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:46.880]   99designs.com/twig.
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:52.960]   And we'll show you our T-shirt design soon, I think, because I picked them last night.
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:54.360]   Not T-shirt, what I say.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:55.360]   Hello, hoodie.
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:56.360]   Hoodie.
[01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:57.360]   Hoodie.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.360]   That's exciting.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.840]   Wow, where was that?
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:02.480]   Sorry, that was me.
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:04.000]   There's sirens going by.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   I'm trying to mute.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000]   I forgot Manhattan.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000]   I forgot to do it like that.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000]   Yes, Constance Sirens.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.760]   It kind of makes you feel like it's vital.
[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:16.120]   You're living somewhere with people, you're living and dying even as we speak.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:19.160]   It feels like you're running over the many steps outside the office.
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:21.160]   Mostly dying.
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:22.160]   Mostly.
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:28.760]   All right, let's start you off here with the tip of the week, Gina.
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:32.360]   Google Drive added a cool new feature, which I really like.
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:37.400]   It's an activity stream to the upper right hand side of your drive.
[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:38.400]   So I really like this.
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.680]   I spent a lot of time on Google Drive.
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:43.200]   My business partner and I do a lot of our business documents and drive.
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:47.200]   And so they've added a little it's a little icon.
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:49.400]   I don't know what I stands for.
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:50.960]   Info, I'm not sure.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:55.040]   The top right corner, and this is just rolling up, rolling out now for the past week.
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.720]   So I saw it in my Google Apps account, but not my vanilla Gmail account.
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:03.000]   So you might have to wait for it to see this, but you click on it and it's an activity
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.040]   stream of updates to your Google Drive documents.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:10.160]   So what document and who updated it last?
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:13.080]   Really, really handy if you share documents, particularly if you share documents with other
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:18.040]   people a lot, kind of to see what's going on and what's happening.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.960]   So new Google Drive activity stream.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:22.560]   I figure the eye is info, yeah.
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:24.360]   Yeah, it's got to be info, right?
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.600]   That's the universal logo.
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.600]   Universal.
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.320]   Yeah, that was a circle, yeah.
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:31.960]   Jeff's got quite the number of the week this week.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:36.000]   Yeah, it's, well, my first number is actually 12.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.320]   It's midnight here, so I went to find the last number I could.
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:42.880]   So I want to, I want to preface this by saying it's utter BS.
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:43.880]   I don't believe it.
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:44.880]   But what the heck?
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:45.880]   It's just like BuzzFeed.
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:48.040]   I'm going to give it to you anyway.
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:53.240]   Some Princeton researchers say that Facebook will lose 80% of its users by 2017.
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:55.160]   Well, how do they say that?
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:34:01.280]   Well, they compare Facebook in terms of Google searches to a virus.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:04.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.440]   Now how you could justify this, I do not know.
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:09.080]   But they say that it's growing at the rate of the virus.
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:11.520]   Thus, it will die at the rate of a virus.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.480]   It's BS, but it's a number.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.280]   And it's midnight, so I wanted a number.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.000]   I think it's a good number, and I don't think it's BS.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.400]   I think they're exactly right.
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.480]   And I think they even got it.
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.960]   I think it's going to happen sooner than that.
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:24.680]   It's like bubonic plague.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:26.480]   Facebook will eventually die out.
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:29.640]   I love it.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:32.120]   No, I just, I feel like I think you call it.
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:34.440]   I think Facebook's dead right as of right now.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:37.040]   I'm feeling the case of Zuckitis.
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.800]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:43.080]   I find myself really not using it as much as I did.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:46.640]   There's a lot of upworthy crap.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.880]   Yeah, they definitely changed the news algorithm.
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:51.960]   I just, I feel, I don't, and I don't think I'm alone.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:56.720]   I think even people who use it, and the people who use it use it, because that's how, like
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:59.320]   Lisa, that's how you stay in touch with family and friends.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.920]   But they don't like it.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:03.640]   Right, they do it because that's where the people are.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:07.320]   How long can something survive that people use but don't like?
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:08.320]   Mm hmm.
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:13.240]   All it takes is somebody to come along to a better job, and it's over.
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:16.320]   Although there is that there's the network effect I understand, but it just is the network
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.320]   effect.
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:18.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.440]   I mean, someone could make a social network that's way better than Facebook, but the people
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:21.440]   aren't there.
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:23.440]   But we've seen how fast the people can move.
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:25.180]   No, it's true.
[01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:29.280]   And I don't think people under 25 use Facebook at all, do they?
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:30.280]   No.
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:33.160]   You chat, you use it?
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:35.800]   I think people under 25 do all have accounts.
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:39.800]   Actually, my daughter does is how she stays in touch with people because, okay, so she
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:41.400]   graduated from high school a couple of years ago.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:43.400]   So it's a diaspora.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:47.760]   Everybody she knows went somewhere and that's, and it's a really good way to stay in touch
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:48.760]   with everyone nowadays.
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.600]   This is a tool.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:51.600]   Yeah.
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:57.320]   It's a utility to make, you know, parties happen and to share your photos.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:04.160]   It's not a, it's not what it used to be, which was a place to go and kill 30 hours while
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.680]   you looked at everyone's pages and streams.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:14.880]   So speaking of ViRi, we did this last year, we do it every year, the Google Flu Trends
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.360]   charts up Google.org/flutrins.
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:21.040]   This is a bad one this year, H1N1, it's everywhere.
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.040]   Look at the heat map.
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:24.000]   You see that red?
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.520]   That's where the redder it is, the more flu activity.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.840]   And there's only a few places.
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:36.800]   Like if you wanted to avoid the flu go to North Dakota, Utah, Arizona, no, no, not New
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:46.880]   Mexico, Indiana or Maine, the rest of us were toast.
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:49.160]   Google does this with the help from the CDC.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:55.560]   It's actually really an interesting thing they do every year, Google Flu Trends.
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:37:00.520]   And you could just see each year the activity spikes, but you see this is a bad one.
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:06.160]   See how that peak is higher than anything in the last 10 years.
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:07.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.560]   That's not good.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.560]   Yeah.
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:10.560]   Yeah.
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:12.120]   So bad one this year.
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:15.640]   Yeah, I've become a Purell maniac now that I work in an office with other people.
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:16.640]   Yeah.
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.800]   That's the thing you don't want to do.
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:23.400]   Never go around other people ever.
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:25.280]   I got my shot last Thursday.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:28.600]   So they say it takes two weeks for it to get to full strength.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:31.200]   So I have a little countdown on my desk.
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:34.160]   Okay, only four more days or whatever.
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:36.160]   It was a quarantine.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:37.440]   I can't don't talk to anybody.
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.560]   Anyway, that's always fun.
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:43.080]   It's google.org/flu trends.
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:46.000]   If you want to follow the flu.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000]   Nice.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.440]   And then there was another, and this I don't take credit for this.
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:53.600]   This came from Alex Lindsey.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:55.680]   Google Maps Engine now has, is this new or not?
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:56.680]   Has a nice interface.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:58.560]   MapsEngine.google.com.
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:03.720]   If you have data, there's a free and there's a paid version that you can use that data
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:10.760]   to import comma separated values, CSV's and other formats and you can import the data.
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.800]   He showed me, he was needed a survey.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.080]   You can use Google Apps to do a survey, right?
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:17.400]   I don't know if it's a spreadsheet.
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:21.880]   And then it automatically imported the data into the map and was able to really do some
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:23.840]   neat stuff.
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:24.840]   Have you seen this before?
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:27.960]   He wasn't sure when did this start and I didn't know either.
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:31.600]   It's mapsengine.google.com.
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:34.920]   They've always had an API, but it's always been a little challenging.
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:38.600]   They've had a couple of things like this, but I don't think I've seen this specifically.
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.960]   Yeah, I think it's neat.
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:43.600]   Makes me want to play with it.
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.480]   See what we can do.
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:48.080]   Gina, Trippani, you've got the data.
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:50.440]   You've got it all at thinkup.com.
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:51.440]   Is it too?
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:53.440]   Now, when are you going to let people sign up?
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:56.640]   Next couple of weeks, we're working on that right now.
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:00.360]   We're just kind of looking at our crowd funding backers data and seeing...
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.360]   How's it going?
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.360]   As a service?
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.360]   What's up?
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.360]   Service survive?
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.360]   Servers are doing great.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.560]   Everything's choggling along.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:07.760]   Response has been pretty good.
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:09.080]   We're fixing bugs left and right.
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:13.080]   We're working on opening up signups and we're just looking to see what are the insights
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:17.560]   that are useful, what are people sharing, what aren't, that kind of thing.
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:23.120]   So can I control what insights I get or is it just whatever you've got?
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:26.560]   It's whatever we have right now, but we would like to add more controls to say, "Hey, don't
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:31.040]   show me something like this again or show me more of this," that kind of thing.
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.760]   By the way, one of the great ones.
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:37.240]   Leo Laport mentioned thinkup once last week.
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:38.240]   I like that.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:43.000]   Yeah, it probably shouldn't surface one that where you just mentioned once.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000]   I'll mention it more.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.600]   I'll talk about it more.
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:46.760]   I'm loving it.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:48.240]   I'm really loving it.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.480]   All the stats and stuff like that.
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:50.480]   It's really fun.
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:51.480]   Thank you.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:55.040]   It's early days, but we just really want to get something out that was working to our
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:59.800]   backers and give them kind of first dibs to kind of hear feedback and then we'll open
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:01.560]   up to the public.
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:04.800]   But hopefully that's going to happen in the next couple of weeks, February.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:05.800]   That's not mine, by the way.
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:06.800]   That's Chads.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:12.040]   Gee Chads tweets contain the word, "I mean my mine or myself 11 times."
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:13.040]   In the last three.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.600]   Yeah, that one always gets a reaction.
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:20.640]   That's the butt enough about me stat.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:25.160]   By the way, my number one tweet of the week, according to your graph here, was, "It should
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:30.160]   be clear to everyone by now that Twit Live is, I think it's on, is it online soap opera
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:31.160]   or something like that.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:32.160]   Reality show.
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:33.160]   I think reality show.
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:34.360]   32 retweets and 77 favorites."
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.680]   That's kind of fun to know that stuff.
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:37.680]   It's pretty handy.
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:40.680]   All right.
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:44.480]   Well, soon it'll be open to the public, but right now you can go to Jeff Jarvis.thinkup.com.
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:46.480]   It's public, right?
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:47.920]   People can see my stats.
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:49.920]   Leo Leport.
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:50.920]   .thinkup.com.
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:51.920]   Chad, what's yours?
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:52.920]   OMG.
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:53.920]   Chad.
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:54.920]   Correct.
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:55.920]   .thinkup.com.
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:56.920]   Gina Trippani, I think.
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:57.920]   .thinkup.com.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:58.920]   Now I just mentioned thinkup.com like 18 times.
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:40:59.920]   I should get it.
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:00.920]   I know you did.
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:01.920]   You did.
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:02.920]   I know.
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:03.920]   We should do it.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:04.920]   But they're doing social media, see?
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:10.920]   It is also a blogger, although I bet she's not doing a lot of blogging right now at smartawear.org.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:16.920]   And is a new resident of Brooklyn just in time for the worst winter storm in years.
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:19.240]   A host of all about Android on Tuesday nights.
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:21.840]   Oh, how could I forget?
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.000]   Every Tuesday, catch her.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000]   5 p.m.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000]   So the 8 p.m.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000]   Eastern.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000]   I do need to work on my lighting here.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000]   I will work on it.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000]   It's getting dark.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000]   It won't be as dark.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000]   The problem is the sun goes down during the course of the show.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.240]   So I start out bright and then I get gets kind of dark in here.
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:36.240]   So I'll work on that.
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:40.800]   Jeff Jarvis still hates Verizon at buzzmachine.com.
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:41.800]   He's up late.
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:43.000]   Thank you for staying up late for us.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000]   Jeff, we really appreciate it.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000]   A pleasure.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000]   And enjoy your time.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.840]   I can't wait to hear more stories from Davos next week.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:49.840]   You will.
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:53.440]   I'll see Eric Schmidt at the side of the fire on Thursday.
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:55.960]   Are you going to, will you blog a little bit about what's going on there?
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:56.960]   I have it.
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:57.960]   Yeah.
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:00.400]   If there's something that don't happen, so there's not nothing seems bloggable yet.
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:03.240]   I used to blog, blog, blog, blog, blog, but not now.
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:05.840]   And when do you come back to the polar vortex?
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:06.840]   Sunday.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:09.040]   Oh, you're going to be there a while.
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.040]   All right.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:11.040]   Have a great time.
