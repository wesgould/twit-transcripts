[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.120]   2010, what should Google do?

[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.560]   It's time for Twig.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.280]   This week in Google, in our guests, as always,
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.000]   the esteemed, the talented, the wonderful Jeff Jarvis
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.320]   from buzzmachine.com, journalist, and commentator
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.880]   on journalist extraordinaire, a professor of journalism
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.120]   at the CUNY, C-U-N-Y journalism school,
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.120]   and the author of what would--
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.720]   pardon me, what would Google do, right?
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.200]   What would they do?
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.880]   What would they do?
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.120]   Also with this, of course, Gina Trapani
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.480]   from sunny San Diego.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.800]   She's the author of the Complete Guide to Google Wave
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.760]   at completewaveguide.com.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.120]   Smarterware.org is her website, and one of the founders
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.960]   of Life Hacker.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.680]   She's a regular there as well.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.320]   And today, because this is our first episode of 2010--
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.200]   and by the way, we are going to call it 2010.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.480]   We're going to try to adhere to that, to save syllables.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.840]   I'm in on that campaign.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.600]   No 2010 here.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.720]   I think we could talk a little bit about the future,
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.200]   mostly because there's really not much news,
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.960]   because everybody at Google was home with family and friends
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.400]   this week.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.680]   We can talk a little bit about what should Google do.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.200]   So if you're watching our live stream, which we do every
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.040]   Saturday, about 215 Pacific 515 Eastern on live.twit.tv,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.560]   just use the hashtag #PoundTwig with your ideas
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.640]   of what should Google do.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.280]   And I know Gina also tweeted this earlier, so you have quite
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.280]   a few responses.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.960]   To what is this year and this decade?
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.280]   What is it going to bring Google?
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.520]   But before we do that, there is one news story.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.820]   January 5th, it seems absolutely clear now that the
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.920]   Nexus 1 will emerge from Google.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.640]   They're having a big event, an Android event, right?
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.360]   Press events, right?
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.000]   So that's got to be--
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.520]   it's the same day that everybody predicted.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.240]   It's got to be this new HTC handset.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.040]   We're seeing a lot of pictures of it now.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.600]   And there's even benchmarks on YouTube.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.040]   You could play a benchmark that's kind of stunning a
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.400]   graphics speed, beautiful screen.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.680]   So Gina, you were smart.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.360]   You held out.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.800]   And you were celebrating your intelligence right now.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.520]   Yeah, I'm patting myself on the back for not giving into
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.960]   the droid.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.120]   I don't know about that yet.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.400]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.360]   I've seen the videos look really great.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.040]   Gizmodo has a fantastic video of Nexus 1.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.360]   I don't know.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.560]   It still remains to be seen what the prices are going to be
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.600]   and the plans.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.760]   I mean, there are lots of rumors that you're just seeing.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.680]   How much?
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.960]   $5.99 with no plan.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.120]   I think $1.99 with a two-year plan.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.640]   From--
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.640]   From--
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.680]   --very similar to what you have for the iPhone,
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.160]   except that you can use it in Europe.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.120]   From T-Mobile?
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.200]   It'll be a T-Mobile.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.000]   It'll be T-Mobile, but you can use it in Europe, too.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.080]   It's unlocked.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.280]   But yeah, why they didn't add in the frequency to be able to
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.880]   swap in my iPhone SIM from AT&T is beyond me.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.240]   It strikes me that they're still treading a little
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.600]   cautiously, that they don't want to piss too many people off
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.760]   at once.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.760]   So with the unlocked phone, you couldn't pop out your AT&T SIM
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.960]   from your iPhone and put it in.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.680]   Oh, and this is the frequencies you get it on edge on AT&T.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.240]   It doesn't work on AT&T's 3G network.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.280]   I see.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.160]   So you would get edge.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.240]   So it would work with edge.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.400]   You would work with edge.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.720]   And I am going to Europe next month.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.360]   So I hope to get it, and I'll take it with me, and I can
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.960]   use it there.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.760]   Oh, it's so frustrating.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.280]   I guess T-Mobile's OK.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.880]   I mean, I'm using my N900 on T-Mobile right now.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.200]   And it's OK.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.000]   But it's just not--
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.120]   don't we all want Verizon?
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.600]   I guess that's why the Droid is still maybe a good choice.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.040]   Gina, I forgot what a GSM phone.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.560]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.920]   You're right.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.920]   I had to give the N900 to my daughter when she went to
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.080]   France for two weeks.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.240]   So she would have a unlocked GSM phone.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.000]   So I don't even have the N900 right now.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.640]   But no, that's a good point.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.600]   So Gina, from what you saw in the videos, maybe you're not
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.320]   the best person answers because you don't have a Droid.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.920]   But does it look different than cupcake?
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.680]   Are you clear or whatever?
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.480]   2.0?
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.760]   I mean, it looks a little bit different.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.600]   It looks like they added a little, some kind of smooth
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.320]   transitions.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.120]   First of all, it's super fast.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.320]   And the video that I saw--
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.760]   That's the big story.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.480]   Yeah, I mean, that's the big thing.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.160]   And because it's so fast, because I think it has the CPU
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.960]   to handle it, it does nice sort of things kind of fly in.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.640]   And you can touch your wallpaper.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.040]   If your wallpaper is in the video that I saw, the wallpaper
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.520]   was sort of like, looked like water.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.840]   And if you touched it, the--
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.840]   That was cool.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.320]   --it was cool.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.160]   Which is really cool.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.960]   Yeah, it was very responsive to your touch.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.600]   It felt like this living thing.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.640]   And the menus were flu, everything flu.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.320]   Playing video, taking video, playing it back, all much faster.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.600]   I mean, I'm still using the G1.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.280]   And to me, it just looked like--
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.960]   I mean, it just looked like absolute lightning.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.480]   I'll look compared to the Droid.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.280]   I guess Motor said that it is faster than the Droid.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.780]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.400]   That seems to be the consensus.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.900]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.800]   So are you going to do it, Gina?
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.160]   Bull the trigger.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.640]   No doubt.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.080]   Yeah, I'm doing it.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.240]   She can't wait to do it.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.640]   Happy New Year to Gina.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.840]   She's--
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.600]   So there was that rumor that you had to get an invitation.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.080]   But I haven't heard that again.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.400]   That seems like an odd thing to do.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.400]   I don't think they're going to--
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.360]   Yeah, I haven't heard that either.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.720]   So now, because Motor was saying like 580--
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.840]   I guess the prices are very close to what Jeff said.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.920]   It seems like the prices are--
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.600]   there's rumors, but it's not for sure.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.560]   But it sounds like the T-Mobile deal
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.520]   is going to be like $80 a month.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.880]   Yeah, T-Mobile was very smart.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.320]   Getting ready for this, they created this--
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.720]   a couple of new, I think very innovative account plans
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.200]   that are kind of bring your own phone
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.160]   and unlimited call everybody all the data you can eat
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.680]   and like that.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.920]   I think there's a 79 and a 99.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.640]   And I thought these were very--
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.240]   they're the first US cell company
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.880]   to do what companies in Europe have been doing for years,
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.280]   which is to say, bring your own phone.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.240]   So how does this work?
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.720]   You purchase the phone through Google
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.600]   and then you walk into a T-Mobile store and say, hey--
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   Do we know?
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.320]   Yeah, it doesn't sound like.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.800]   But it does sound like you buy the phone through Google.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   How would that make sense?
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.280]   I don't imagine you could buy a T-Mobile too.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.400]   It sounds like it's so tightly connected to T-Mobile,
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.840]   why I don't know.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.240]   Yeah, why you should be able to walk into a T-Mobile.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.960]   Well, no Tuesday.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.360]   Well, no soon.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.080]   Leo, did you get an invite?
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.360]   Are you going to go?
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.360]   An invite to the event?
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.800]   No.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   Did you?
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.320]   No.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.800]   Oh, Jeff, did you?
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.320]   No.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.120]   Well, we just host the only one and only premier show
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.320]   about Google in the entire Googleverse.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.840]   But OK.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.880]   No, I'm sure it's an oversight.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.080]   I'm getting ready for--
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.440]   Matt, no, let's see if you're watching.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.240]   What do we do wrong?
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.680]   Yeah, Matt, Matt, Matt.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.640]   What did we do?
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.400]   I'm going to-- we're going to be getting-- I couldn't go anyway.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.320]   We're getting ready for CES the next day we're leaving.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.760]   But I think what we're going to end up doing--
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.080]   first of all, there is an Android event Friday night
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.120]   at CES in Vegas.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.520]   So we're going to cover that live.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.080]   And I think what we'll probably be doing
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.640]   is kind of do some sort of coverage by proxy on Tuesday.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.000]   What time is the event?
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.840]   Thought it was an all day thing.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.440]   All day.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.440]   All day?
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.120]   I feel like it's just starting.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.360]   I saw the invitation somewhere.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.080]   I think we may have linked it.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:09.880]   OK.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.920]   All day, huh?
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.920]   Yeah, let me see if--
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.200]   The thing that I've been reading to everybody
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.760]   is that it's now going to be a shrug,
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.880]   unless everybody's been wrong, but what they were saying.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.000]   They have to do something now.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.760]   OK, it's 9.30 to 1.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.720]   Well, it launches at noon.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.960]   That's a long time.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.560]   9.30.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.800]   Oh, that's why they didn't invite us because of lunch.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.680]   The presentation is basically from 10 to 11.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.680]   And then there's a Q&A, 11 to 11.30.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.760]   Demonstrations, 11.30 to 1.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.760]   Oh, OK.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.960]   And with lunch.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.800]   I think you probably, if you go, you get a free Nexus one.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.240]   Get a free phone, you think?
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.800]   Sure.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.920]   Why not?
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.280]   They're Google.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.880]   They got a lot of money.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.800]   For the press, though?
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.840]   You're pressed.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.040]   Well, who better to give it to?
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.520]   The developers.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.840]   OK, you're both, Gina.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.200]   You win.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.120]   Hands down.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.160]   She should get a free one.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.160]   What I mean, so they gave out the G1 at Google I/O,
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.760]   which is primarily a developer event.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.320]   It'd be interesting to see if they give them out the press.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.560]   And Gajun have a story this week that said that T-Mobile,
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.840]   and its internal documents that I guess somebody saw on the net
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.120]   or whatever, say that Google is scheduled to launch
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.200]   a new Android device in early January.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.360]   OK, that makes sense.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.640]   T-Mobile says in this document that Google and HTC
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.600]   will be directly responsible for support on the handset
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.360]   bypassing T-Mobile for everything other than wireless service.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.520]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.880]   And again, we don't--
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.640]   this is-- we're all reading T-leaves on this.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.440]   But this is something on a T-Mobile news website, TMO News
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.760]   website, that I think is intended for internal use only.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.240]   It says, I'm looking at this.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.040]   Google, with support from T-Mobile.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.320]   Is scheduled to launch a new Android device in early January.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.760]   The Google Android phone will be sold solely by Google
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.280]   via the web.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.280]   And this could be, again, a fake.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.760]   Looks pretty good, though.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.240]   Support for this device, including troubleshooting exchanges,
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.040]   will be managed by Google and HTC T-Mobile will offer service
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.560]   support, including billing, coverage, features, and rate
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.240]   plans.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.360]   See, if this were Apple, they'd take down the entire Google
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.680]   site at 9 o'clock on Tuesday.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.600]   Google is closed.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.840]   Come back later.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.440]   That's good.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.240]   I like that.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.280]   We're counting spoons.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.760]   Come back.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.120]   I like that.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.960]   No, they won't do that.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.000]   So we're going to--
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.040]   I think that's the one and only story of the week, unless you--
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.240]   Or you're going to buy one Leo.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.800]   Oh, yeah, I have to.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.000]   I like my droid.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.880]   And I think that the Verizon network is a really compelling
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.600]   selling point, to be honest, because it's such a fast network.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.920]   But I do like an unlocked phone.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.880]   I love GSM, and I love the idea of putting that sim chip in.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.280]   But so at the end of the day, though, what's the big deal?
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.720]   Basically, it's like getting a droid except that you can use it
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.280]   in your room.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.080]   I think the big deal, at least for us,
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.000]   is that it's a Google platform, a solely Google platform.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.440]   So when you buy something from Verizon, they strip out stuff.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.160]   They limit it.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.920]   And I think the droid doesn't feel too limited,
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.640]   but there's no tethering in it, for instance.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.280]   If you get a phone that Google designs, supports, and does,
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.280]   then presumably you get the full Google experience.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.000]   So for me, the chief interest is, what is that?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.320]   Yeah, right.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.080]   What is the full Google experience?
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.360]   What happens when Google designs a handset, essentially?
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.000]   Or has a hand in designing a handset?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.160]   Although people have said that they had a hand in designing
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.800]   the G1.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.320]   So--
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:46.840]   Well, they did.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.680]   I mean, obviously, this is a successor to the G1G2.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.400]   This is from the same manufacturer.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.040]   It looks like a really nice screen.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.160]   And here's the other question.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.920]   If does this start to break up the hegemony
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.320]   of the telecos in deals?
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.440]   Is this the first of other, bring your own phone?
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.480]   I hope so.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.560]   To come, I want that to be the case, too.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.280]   I'm just not sure I figured out how this gets us there.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.000]   Well, I think the--
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.680]   I kind of read those tea leaves when
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.200]   T-Mobile announced that they would
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.640]   do a bring your own phone plan.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.240]   Because that, to me, that was saying, well,
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.720]   there are going to be phones that we could--
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.440]   and if you think about it, I mean, T-Mobile
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.800]   is a weak fourth in the cell phone business in the US.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.640]   They need something.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.920]   So what better thing to say?
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.800]   Well, we'll be the geek phone.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.280]   We'll be the GSM phone of choice.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.320]   We'll be the one who supports those unlocked phones.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.960]   So you can get the Nokia N900, which
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.600]   is not supported by any other carrier in the US.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.920]   We don't even directly support it,
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.320]   but you could buy it if you really cared
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.880]   and you could put our chip in it.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.720]   And we'll offer a plan.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.240]   Forget it.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.920]   If they'd made it AT&T compatible,
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.680]   then you could bring your phone to either.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.720]   And they would have broken up the--
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.760]   AT&T doesn't have it, bring your own phone plan.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:56.600]   Well, I think they would have that.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.760]   Well, no, but I could take my SIM out of my iPhone
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.280]   and put it in there.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.240]   But you wouldn't get a limited experience.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:03.800]   Really?
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.960]   I think so.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.440]   I think so.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.960]   I mean, I-- well, so maybe that's the difference.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.280]   I don't know.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.560]   Anyway, from a purely academic point of view,
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.680]   it'll be interesting to see what this Google phone means.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.160]   But we might find that out five minutes into owning it
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.480]   and then go, oh, back to the droid.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.480]   I don't know.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.120]   BFD.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.760]   It's supposed to be a lot thinner than the iPhone or not a lot,
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.160]   but noticeably thinner than the iPhone, which I think is great.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.040]   It's very expensive.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.720]   I don't know.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.440]   How many-- OK, you were talking before we started,
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.040]   and you were saying-- I think Jeff that somebody was saying,
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.320]   we don't use Google like normal people use Google.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.480]   One of Gina's responders.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.080]   Gina, OK.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:50.040]   I think it's very unusual to see people buy an unsubsidized
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.520]   smartphone for $500 or $600.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.400]   That can't be a common thing.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.120]   That's crazy.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.080]   But I think the subsidy is going to come from elsewhere.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.520]   The subsidy will eventually come from advertising
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.680]   and not from phone fees.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.320]   Well, that's true.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.880]   This could be the less than free phone.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.280]   That's where this gets to go.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.040]   I think it's something--
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.560]   But it is.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.480]   --that speaks to the net book.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.520]   The thing I wonder is if Google in the Chrome OS
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.480]   model, which is where they'll go in general,
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.480]   is saying everything's a web app, everything's a web app,
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.680]   then does this also kill app stores?
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.320]   Why buy an app?
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.480]   I'm a believer in apps.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.200]   I don't know why.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.200]   I think that the presentation, the notion
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.080]   of having a standalone app is just something people like,
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.760]   and they didn't like it on the iPhone,
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.800]   and that's why Apple had to do it.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.120]   They didn't like the web app thing.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.320]   That's why Apple had to do an app store.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.440]   And if you're Apple, this is your secret sauce.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.280]   But don't you see Apple sort of swinging back into web apps
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.800]   with pastry kit and with--
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.760]   That's where they'd like to be, but I don't think customers
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.200]   want that.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.400]   I think that's what Apple wants.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.600]   And me-- well, what about developers, Gina?
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.360]   Wouldn't you prefer to be doing a standalone app
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.040]   that you can charge money for so there's this deliverable thing?
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.960]   It's not a web page.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.640]   It's a deliverable thing that you install.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.280]   Isn't that more desirable to a developer?
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.920]   Well, the money is certainly desirable.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.920]   Well, that's what I mean.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.520]   Developing once and having it work across all smartphones
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.880]   with modern web browsers, like a web app,
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.360]   that's pretty desirable too.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.200]   I mean, of course--
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.480]   Of course, we had that with Java.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.400]   Well, right.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.160]   Look how that works.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.520]   That didn't work out so good.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.720]   It didn't work out so well.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.680]   I mean, yeah, certainly the market is making money
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.040]   from your app is a big draw.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.720]   And you can still do things with an app
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.800]   that you can't do with a web app.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.560]   But I'm interested to see what happens when mobile web
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.280]   browsers with HTML5 and offline capabilities.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.200]   When you can create an app which has a very close to a native
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.320]   app experience, how many of those--
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.040]   maybe it's just the free apps turned into web apps.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.960]   I don't know.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.520]   I think there's going to be a hybrid model where there's
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.920]   a little bit of both.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.320]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.640]   But I just still wonder when you get to the point where you
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.800]   have a Chrome OS machine that basically looks like a bloated
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.680]   phone and operates only with web apps.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.520]   Or-- because I haven't heard any noise about there being
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.560]   kind of an app score or ability to run separate apps on Chrome OS,
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.680]   right?
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.440]   Right.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.200]   So what makes a phone pretty soon, that much different
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.880]   from a tablet or whatever Apple's going to come out with
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.960]   or anything else?
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.720]   To me, the line is going to blur and disappear.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.840]   The URL, supposedly starting at 9 AM.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.960]   I don't know if that's Pacific or Eastern.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.960]   On Tuesday will be Google.com/phone.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.240]   It's a 404 if you go there right now.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.200]   Although, according to Gizmodo, there's
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.320]   at a JavaScript countdown hidden in the HTML of the page.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.520]   No way, really?
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.520]   What?
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.120]   Google.com/phone.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.840]   Well, it's a 404 now.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.720]   But google.com/support/phone.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.840]   Let me see if I view source if I can see the HTML countdown.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.440]   That would be pretty funny if they left that in the source.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.120]   I don't know.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.040]   OK, google.com/support/phone.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.640]   That seems like there's an awful lot in here for a--
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.120]   For a not available message.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:25.600]   JavaScript, Urchin's in there.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.000]   The Urchin tracker goes to the same page.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.840]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.720]   That's interesting.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.120]   We'll see.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.240]   Yeah, I don't.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.400]   We'll see.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.560]   It's exciting.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.600]   I'm excited.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.200]   That's going to be the big story of the beginning of the week.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.120]   And then, of course, at the beginning of the month,
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:44.680]   I should say.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.680]   And then at the end of the month, the Apple tablet,
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.000]   which may make all of this moot.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.800]   Who knows?
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.720]   Is there any chance you're going to buy the Nexus 1
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.000]   and then regret it because the Apple tablet sucks you?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.360]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.920]   Gasky me or just in general?
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.040]   In my case, yeah, I regret every purchase.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:05.880]   Do you really?
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.040]   I bought the drawer.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.440]   Does your mind make you regret it?
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.280]   No, no, no.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.800]   It doesn't have to go through her.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.680]   It goes through my CFO.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.640]   She makes me regret it.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.560]   She says, why did you buy this month?
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.760]   No, I have to buy it.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.480]   I have to buy it.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.400]   But at the same time, there's always the next thing.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.160]   No matter what, it's always just the way it is.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.440]   There's nothing you can do about it.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.120]   That's life.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.920]   So we're going to talk about-- in fact, Gina,
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.080]   you got some great tweets.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.760]   What should Google do?
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.600]   Not what could or would, but what
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:41.440]   should Google do in 2010 and beyond?
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.360]   What would you do if you had all that money and all that power?
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.160]   A lot of people are doing predictions.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.560]   And I'm very curious what our audience predicts
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.520]   and what you guys predict.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.000]   And we'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.920]   I can make one prediction.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.560]   And I know this is going to come through.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.080]   Come Thursday, I'm going to be driving down to a CES.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.360]   Actually, I'm flying.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.440]   But we're going to drive down.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.200]   We've got a Lincoln MKT with a Ford Sync install.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.720]   And we're going to drive down with all of our gear.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.920]   And we're going to start our live coverage of CES, which
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.600]   will include, by the way, the Android Party, which is on Friday.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.400]   It's going to be a blast.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.520]   The Consumer Electronics Show.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.000]   Lots to see.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.400]   Lots to do.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.240]   And we want to thank the folks at Sync
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.720]   who've made this possible by sponsoring our trip down there.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.880]   In fact, they're getting us the CEO of Ford to talk to
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.960]   and the guy, the designer, behind Sync.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.000]   Because I understand there's some big announcements for Sync.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.640]   Sync is, of course, the hands-free Bluetooth, calling, music,
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.280]   and podcast search, turn-by-turn navigation system that
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.760]   comes in new Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.760]   It is amazing.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.400]   You can find out more about going to syncmyride.com.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.200]   That's the site for owners of Sync.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.000]   So I go there, and I download updates to my software.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.360]   I download my vehicle, health reports, things like that.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.080]   It's all there.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.160]   Syncmyride.com.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.640]   But you can go and just take a tour.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.080]   There's lots of video up there.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:02.880]   We are going to be there.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.360]   Paul Thorett from Windows Weekly Dicty Bartolo
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.920]   from the Daily Gizwiz.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.880]   Ryan Schraut from this weekend computer hardware,
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.360]   Scott Wilkinson from Home Theater Geeks.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.160]   And many others, including Ryan Block from GDGT.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:15.880]   Will Harris.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.040]   Dr. Keke and I will be doing coverage of the parties
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.800]   on Wednesday night and Thursday night,
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.760]   and all day Friday, Saturday and Sunday at live.twit.tv.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.160]   So if you can't make it to Vegas for the Consumer Electronics
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.520]   Show, come to twit.tv for all the coverage.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.560]   If you have podcasts, you can download or launch live
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.800]   at live.twit.tv.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.360]   And if you're in the area, come by and say, hey,
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.040]   I'd like to see that at Lincoln and the sink in there.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.120]   And I'll give you a little tour.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.000]   Or you could just go to your local Ford, Lincoln,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.560]   and Mercury dealer and say, I'd like to test drive the Sync.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.000]   Syncmyride.com.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.240]   Thanks so much to Sync and all of our sponsors.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.640]   We cannot wait to bring you CES live.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.240]   Brought to you by Sync.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.040]   Syncmyride.com.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.320]   So before we get to the thoughts from our listeners,
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.360]   do you, Jeff, do you have some thoughts about what
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.160]   should Google do in 2010?
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:10.560]   No, not really.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.600]   Are they on the right track?
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.560]   Are they doing exactly what they should be doing?
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.120]   Yeah, I think that it's more about prednosticating
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:16.920]   what they're thinking.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.040]   It's like trying to see behind the man
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.680]   behind the curtain in Oz.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.000]   And I think we're going to see a lot more mobile data,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.160]   a lot more efforts to get a tremendous amount of data
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.480]   about local, and that that's going to be a huge thing this year.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.360]   And I think we're going to be surprised about what
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.000]   comes out there.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.720]   I think we'll find one size, bits all search disappearing more.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.560]   And with it, some measure of the dark art of SEO.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.120]   And I think that's probably a good thing.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:48.360]   It starts to make search a little more valuable again.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.600]   It ruins the business models along the way.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:56.040]   And finally, I think we'll see an emphasis on web apps.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.560]   Given the Chrome OS and ways that they will try to support
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:07.120]   that, one of the predictions that I saw on where was it.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.440]   The Google operating system blog was that they will likely
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.360]   come up with a more framework for creation of web apps
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.000]   to make them better.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.360]   I think that all makes some sense.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.120]   Do you think search is even that important to Google
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:18.760]   going forward?
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.800]   Or I guess they're not transitioned away from it.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.400]   But ultimately, search seems to be less and less important
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.680]   to them.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.280]   Well, you wouldn't exactly drop it.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.760]   No.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.280]   No.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.160]   It is the majority of the business by far.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.480]   It's 21% of their revenue is advertising a lot.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.400]   That's based on search.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.240]   Not all of it.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:35.800]   No.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.160]   But I think strategically, they know they've
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.640]   got to go beyond search.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.560]   They have to maintain preeminence and search.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.000]   They should be really stupid to let Bing come in and take over
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.240]   too much turf.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.680]   They've got to keep developing that.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.320]   But no, I agree.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.000]   Strategically, they're going to go more toward--
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.880]   there I say it, once for the start of the year,
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.800]   the hyperpersonal news stream.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.600]   They'll go to things that are more live, more customized
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.560]   for you, more trying to make sense of the world
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.480]   that you live in.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.440]   I'd go even farther than news stream,
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.040]   the hyperpersonal info.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.400]   I mean, the hyperpersonal stream, I mean,
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.560]   the more Google knows about you, the more everything it does
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.360]   is tailored around you.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.760]   And not just stream, but locale.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.680]   Yes, that's right.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.120]   Look at the stuff we talked about last week.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.400]   The whole idea that you look around yourself and Google
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.720]   knows everything about where you're standing
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.680]   and in the context of you and what you're doing.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.960]   Yes.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.600]   Absolutely.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.560]   Gina, what are your thoughts?
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.560]   Well, I hope in 2010 that Google delivers on a lot of the promises
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:42.720]   that I put out there in '09, and promises in terms of the things
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.640]   that they rolled out.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.200]   Wave Android and Chrome OS and Chrome, really,
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:53.240]   are early beta products that-- well, Android's not beta,
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.000]   officially.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.280]   But I want to see these apps really grow up and become
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.920]   what Google set out to make them to begin with.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.960]   I think the other thing-- this is my wish list,
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.400]   and this is totally from a product point of view.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.320]   I think the other thing that I want to see Google do,
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.880]   and this hooks on what we talked about last week, which
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.720]   was there, treat us on the meaning of open.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.160]   It really occurred to me at that point
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.800]   that Google is running on--
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.960]   I mean, their business is based on user trust.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.160]   We have to trust Google in order to give them more data.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.840]   And I want Google to earn my trust.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.400]   So I want them to be even more open.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.680]   They need to earn my trust.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.160]   And I want them to be more open and more transparent.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.480]   And I hope that that treat us on the meaning of open
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.040]   wasn't just this statement about how great Google is.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.440]   I hope that it's a call to action for the company in general,
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.000]   to be more transparent and to explain more about what they know
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.360]   about me and how they're using it and how it benefits me
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.400]   and what the actual risks are.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.200]   I finally got to control over it.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.720]   Yeah, and give us more control over it.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.120]   I finally got a chance to see that CNBC special,
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.200]   the inside the mind of Google and this week.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.400]   And it was interesting.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.800]   They talked a lot about being open and transparency
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.400]   and all that.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.120]   But when CNBC asked the executives,
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.240]   how many times had Google been subpoenaed
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.080]   and have to have handed over user information,
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.040]   user specific information to law enforcement
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.720]   because they were compelled to legally,
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.360]   they declined to comment about that.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.240]   So I mean, maybe this is asking too much,
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.440]   but I want to know what those numbers are.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.800]   I want to know relative service to Google's whole entire user
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.040]   base, what cases did they have to give up information
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.720]   to law enforcement because they were subpoenaed?
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.120]   And what happened?
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.160]   So yeah, I want them to earn my trust.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.240]   I want them to be even more open about how this all works
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.600]   and what benefit the risks of my privacy
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.240]   for the convenience of the service.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.680]   And I want them to work to earn users trust more.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.600]   I would say--
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.160]   Right, Gina.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.640]   Yes, I agree with you 100%.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.800]   And I'd actually take it the next step farther
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.400]   that Google is going to have an unusual challenge in 2010.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.720]   You know, they have already started
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.440]   this crazy acquisition spree.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.880]   And they have a lot of cash in hand.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.240]   And I think that they're feeling pretty cocky right now,
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.160]   probably rightly so.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.880]   They have a lot of things to celebrate the success of.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.880]   And the real risk of all of that is Google
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.200]   could really make a big misstep in 2010, 2010.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.120]   I think it really should use this.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.320]   I would love to see Google use this year to do exactly what
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.800]   you just talked about, which is to kind of focus its business.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.320]   In the 10 years gone by, it bought so many businesses
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.120]   that it didn't use, didn't take advantage of,
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.920]   let fall like dodgeball or let waste away like Jai Koo.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.120]   I would like to see it be a little more judicious
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.840]   in its acquisition, maybe kind of absorb what it's done
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.600]   and make it somewhat more integrated.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.640]   Google doesn't feel integrated in any respect.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.560]   And I think that hurts it.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.680]   And I think as part of earning back trust,
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:47.280]   I think I'd like to see Google spend this year actively
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.040]   pursuing initiatives, not just to earn back trust,
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.720]   but to open the kimono a little bit to let us know.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.880]   Just as you said, what they're doing, what are they up to,
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:01.000]   what are their plans, if they're not evil, let us prove it.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.520]   This is the time to prove it.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.280]   And the temptation for Google this year
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.960]   is going to be to do the exact opposite, which
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.960]   is to start buying spree, acquiring stuff,
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.520]   growing in all different areas.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.800]   And the real risk is that the public is going to see
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.880]   Google as extending tentacles out into so many areas
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.400]   that they're going to start to literally feel like we've got it.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.240]   There's a problem that Google--
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.480]   As we talked about last week, it has enough
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.480]   would-be enemies in media that they're
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.360]   going to jump on that and start to set that as a tone.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.880]   And I think Google has to get aggressive in PR move.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.280]   But the way to get aggressive in PR move
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.400]   is to exactly what Gina said, which
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:46.160]   is to prove how good they are and show their stuff.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.960]   And we'll see if they can do that.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.520]   But you raised something else, Leo.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.960]   In terms of the integration of Google,
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.000]   I think what you hit upon is a problem they have
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   within the company.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.360]   It's a corporate culture, too, though, isn't it?
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.440]   I mean, don't they encourage that governance by committee,
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.720]   which, of course, lends itself to that kind of crazy fraction.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.440]   Fractionalization.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:13.040]   I wonder if they even have the corporate culture to do that.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.360]   Do you sacrifice speed, though, when
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.000]   you integrate all the different groups in the company?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.960]   I understand that Google is sort of like Microsoft,
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.120]   and they try to create small companies
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.880]   within a big company so that those small groups are more
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.400]   nimble and compete with one another.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.080]   So I assume that this is Google's kind of same structure.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.160]   And what you get with that right is speed.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.080]   Groups can roll out new products faster
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.400]   than if it had to worry about integrating with everyone else
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.560]   or getting everyone else's approval.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.520]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.600]   I have no idea what it's like to run or organize a structure
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.600]   or something Google-sized.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.560]   And now that I have eight employees,
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.240]   I realize how hard it is.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.320]   It's just crazy.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.000]   I don't know how you do it with 100,000.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.040]   But that's actually a question for Jeff,
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.680]   who has really studied this.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.040]   Clearly, Google has decided on a kind of unusual corporate
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.520]   governance structure with that very goal
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.720]   to avoid the pitfalls that maybe Microsoft fell into.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:09.000]   But this governance by committee has its disadvantages.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.760]   And I don't know.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.120]   Should Google think about other metaphors?
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.640]   What is Google-- are they trying not to be Microsoft?
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.760]   Well, yeah.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.280]   But the problem is it's not just by committee.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.280]   It's by committee of two.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.440]   It's Larry and Sergey still.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.800]   That at certain levels, what I hear
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.080]   is that if they don't like it, it doesn't happen.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.560]   And so the committees are there to prepare it.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.720]   It is rather a motally company still.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.720]   Having worked for task force companies and local companies,
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.360]   the advantage of mobile companies
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.520]   is that you get decisions.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.280]   They're disadvantages.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.120]   Sometimes you get some crazy decisions.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.320]   And you get decisions that are based on kind of--
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.640]   as much as they argue that they're all based on data at Google,
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.440]   they're still based on taste and will.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:50.960]   Right.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.080]   A number of people have quit Google publicly.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.120]   That was the designer and another one
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.640]   who wrote and written these public letters.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.960]   And one seems-- one complaint was just
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.200]   that it's too hard to get anything done.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.960]   And I don't think it's Larry and Sergey necessarily.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.280]   It's this whole thing of--
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.840]   you have this management level.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.040]   It's a committee.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.200]   I mean, that's the sense I got.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.360]   It was very difficult.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:11.720]   You know what?
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.280]   I think you need to-- it's a very tough thing to do.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.120]   You need to do both.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.640]   Foster the O-Tur, which I think they try to do with the 20%
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.400]   and so forth.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.840]   But at the same time, create an integrated product that
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.320]   doesn't scare people and also doesn't leave things behind.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.000]   I mean, there's so much stuff that Google's
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.320]   acquired that they've never integrated.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.720]   Maybe those are opposite needs.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.720]   I don't know.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.280]   They do seem like they've lost for the O-Tur.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.040]   There's every signal this year that they're
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.200]   going to buy more if they were close to getting four square.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.440]   There's a lot of things out there to buy.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.800]   Which leads to another question.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.600]   What do you think they'll buy?
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.360]   Let's go through-- Kevin Kelleher in GigaOM
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.360]   has a Google to-do list for 2010.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.440]   Maybe we can go through these and see what you think.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.120]   One is make me click on "Splay ads."
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.680]   Well, this is from a business perspective, right?
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.800]   What Google needs to do in order to make a lot of money,
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.160]   right?
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.240]   This is the list.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:08.840]   I disagree.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.120]   I say throw out display ads.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:10.880]   We know they don't work.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.200]   It's not an effective strategy.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:16.040]   There's got to be a better way than display ads.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.360]   Number two, forget hardware.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.560]   This is the exact opposite of what Google's doing with the Nexus
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:19.800]   1.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.840]   Focus on Android market.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.560]   I do agree that Android market really needs some fixing.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.720]   If your app store is not competitive with Apple's app store,
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.120]   you do have a problem.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.160]   I know we're going towards web apps and so forth,
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.160]   but you've got to have an app store that's
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.880]   easy to use, that's got compelling applications in it,
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:43.080]   that the apps aren't buggy and crashy.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:43.680]   You've got to do so.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.200]   Once again, doesn't that go back to your integration point,
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.480]   that if that's the way Android operates,
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.040]   it's the way that Chrome OS should operate?
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:51.540]   Right.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:52.480]   But that's not what I hear.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.600]   Right.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.840]   They're not going that way.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.040]   No, so that doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:01.400]   Finally, he says, make enterprises pay.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.480]   Ask Eric Schmidt what second-act Google has planned
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.720]   to supplement search, and he's likely to mention Google Apps.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.080]   He calls the enterprise market the next billion dollar
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.760]   opportunity with apps leading the way.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.000]   How important is enterprise to Google?
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.560]   It's the only other revenue stream they can see.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.520]   They're 98% advertising, and Schmidt loves that.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.080]   But the board says, damn it, diversify.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.840]   Find some diversification.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.400]   And enterprise is the one thing that they've talked about,
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.800]   because even mobile is going to be an advertising-based thing.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.080]   Web apps are never going to be a huge revenue stream.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.920]   So the only thing that's there is enterprise.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.120]   Is that the kind of business Google can really be in?
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.040]   They're pumping it.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:44.800]   They're advertising it.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.320]   Are they really ready for the enterprise?
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.240]   I don't know.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.920]   Thank God, not an enterprise guy anymore.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.880]   Yeah, I know.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.360]   It's never attracted me.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.320]   I don't need anywhere to stand it.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.120]   I mean, it does-- I'm not either.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.680]   So I should preface this by saying that.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.960]   But I think we're at a point where you start a company
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.760]   or you even have a smaller, medium-sized company.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.120]   You just don't want to pay the IT guy to set up the exchange
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.160]   server anymore.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.520]   I mean, you just want to tackle--
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.400]   it's been your money in different places.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.360]   So I do think enterprise is probably a revenue stream for them.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:18.720]   But I was thinking, all Google needs is one bad like data
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.040]   breach or security problem or information leak.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.880]   Kind of what happened with AOL.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.160]   I mean, AOL released that search data on purpose.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.760]   But it's not like Google hasn't had minor embarrassing
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.040]   leaks of internal documents and stuff.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:36.800]   So all Google needs is one event where user data is improperly
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   revealed.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.960]   And I think that it's just the trust house of cards just
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.600]   kind of all falls down because the media will jump all over that.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.200]   And I just kind of feel like something
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.600]   is going to happen like that eventually.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.080]   I mean, doesn't it happen to every--
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.080]   It seems inevitable.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.720]   Has it ever happened to Salesforce or to Amazon Web Services?
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.560]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.080]   I don't think so.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.040]   That is a good question.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.480]   That is a good question.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.160]   You can bet that they've got a lot of people working--
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.200]   they're butt off to make sure it doesn't happen.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.640]   Oh, I'm sure the most brilliant minds in the business
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.480]   are worrying about Google security.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.840]   No doubt.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.880]   But they're also the biggest target on the internet.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:13.880]   Exactly.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.800]   The biggest hackers out there.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:20.400]   I just bought a scale that tweets my weight, which is stupid.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.560]   But anyway, I did that.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:26.120]   And among other things, it uploads to Google Health,
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.720]   if you want it to.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.880]   And I thought, oh, I've never used Google Health,
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.120]   so I took a look at it.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:35.800]   And I thought, well, this is kind of interesting.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.040]   But I wonder what kind of adoption it's achieved.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.040]   Because here, this is ultimate trust.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:42.680]   People are probably--
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.400]   Well, the problem with Google Health
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.760]   is that it's not about us adopting it.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.320]   It's about the health industry adopting it.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.800]   Yeah, so it's one thing for me to put everything in there.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.280]   All right.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.640]   And I have very little-- well, one thing I notice,
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:55.520]   I would love to download my health data.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.560]   But the very limited choices of who
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.320]   will let you download health data into Google Health.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:00.800]   So you're right.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.720]   So I want to look at this enterprise thing.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.120]   Is what I've been arguing they should be doing in the news
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.360]   business is rather than trying to make friends with big old
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.440]   newspapers, they should create the very open framework that
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.120]   enables anybody to do news.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.400]   And I think that enterprise can, in essence, be that.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.080]   It's the very open framework that lets anybody do business.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.120]   And if they thought like that, it's a Microsoft killer.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.640]   It's a revenue stream because it's
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.800]   got to have professional support.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.200]   I think there's an opportunity there.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.240]   But the funny thing about Google is on the one hand,
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.120]   people say, oh, it's a one trick pony.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.040]   Oh, it is a search.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.360]   Of course, it's really two tricks.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.520]   It's search and advertising.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.000]   And on the other hand, you could say, well,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.920]   that would be just distracting as hell.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.520]   And that's trying to stretch out too far.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.400]   I don't know, strategically what I do.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.000]   But I think that there is a way that Google is big enough now.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.240]   It has enough services in there.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.680]   But the problem is they're all messy.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.120]   They don't feel professional.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.160]   Microsoft is a very odd view of professional.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.920]   It means confuse the hell out of yourself
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.560]   and scratch your head a lot trying to figure out what bill
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.720]   means.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.760]   But Google has another flavor of that.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.880]   And I think if you compare it to something like Salesforce,
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.760]   that really knows how to serve a business
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.920]   and what a business needs.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.160]   And they're in the guts and brain of a business to do that.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.720]   So I don't know if that's in Google's GNA to do that or not.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.360]   So we're agreed.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.440]   That's one area that Google will expand in 2010
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.880]   is enterprise.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.040]   That does seem like a good place for Google to go.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:32.760]   What else-- OK, let's talk about Google acquisitions.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.960]   What other acquisitions-- it seems like Google's
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.040]   done a lot of location-based applications.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.320]   And it hasn't really done anything well with location.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.960]   I'm sure the one of the reasons they bought Jiku
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.920]   was because that was an early player in locations-based
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.480]   applications.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:48.240]   And they got the two principles there,
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.800]   Yuri and Petri, to come in as engineers.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.880]   And I would expect them to be working on location.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.800]   But if Google Latitude is the best Google can do with location,
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.640]   that's a little disappointing.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.400]   And they could have had a four-square.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.800]   They just pissed off the founders of four-square.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.400]   Is that what happened?
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.400]   So they came close and they--
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.400]   Well, no, in the sense that the people created four-square
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:07.840]   created--
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.760]   Oh, dodgeball.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.280]   That's right.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:09.320]   Dodgeball.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.160]   They chased him away.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.320]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.000]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.600]   They had dodgeball and they didn't do anything with it.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.000]   And yet it's very clear with Google goggles.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.520]   And in general, the location is huge for Google.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.480]   Well, what has been a really successful acquisition
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.520]   by Google?
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.480]   That's the hard--
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.480]   AOL-- Grand Central.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:30.960]   --killed companies.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.480]   Yahoo!
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.640]   Killed companies.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.560]   They've all done it.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:39.240]   We watched things like the founder of Feedburner
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.600]   is now at Twitter as CEO.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.440]   A lot of people have left.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.640]   Is it possible to be acquired by Google and be happy?
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.000]   Maybe not, huh?
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.400]   Blogger was a successful acquisition,
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.760]   but Ev went on and left.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.000]   Most of the team left, I think.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.760]   Was Google Analytics an acquisition?
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.680]   Yeah, that was an--
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.040]   Wasn't that from Adaptive Path?
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.280]   Was that--
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.160]   I don't know how much of that team survived.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:05.560]   I don't know.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:10.440]   Or maybe that's the greatest management challenge
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:10.920]   they have.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.440]   Maybe that is.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.320]   They cannot do it all themselves.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.960]   They've proven they can't do it all themselves
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:18.520]   in certain areas, like social, like the location apps.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.480]   But acquiring, though it looks easier, maybe in fact,
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.400]   be more challenging.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.760]   Even what would arguably be their most high profile
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.560]   acquisition, YouTube, hasn't been a success in the sense
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.880]   that they've monetized it yet.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.800]   They're on the verge.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.280]   I think this year will finally see that from back to back.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.240]   They're on the verge.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.640]   Is it going to be Jeff that they get the networks
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.240]   to start using it?
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.280]   That's where it's going to--
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.560]   The interesting battle that's on just this week,
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.000]   we have Fox was threatening to pull its stations from Time
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.040]   Warner and other cable operators,
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.000]   demanding $1 a month per--
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:53.320]   Right.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.720]   --subscribe.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.520]   And to me, that's News Corp just trying
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.960]   to eke out the last pops of milk from dying
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.600]   bestie the cow here.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.000]   Because what it's really going to do,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.240]   I think, is it's going to increase the cost of cable.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.440]   Those fees will get shared.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.960]   They will then get passed on to users.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.920]   Users will scream.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.680]   The FCC will come in and finally demand Olicart TV.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.440]   And that will kill all kinds of cable channels that
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.360]   are subsidized by bundles now.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.520]   Long-winded way to get back to the point here.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.640]   I think that Hulu and YouTube then become even better
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.480]   positioned to be the future of television.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.000]   And News Corp knows it too since they co-founded Hulu.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Right.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.960]   But I think that they want to use Hulu rather than YouTube.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.280]   I think they want to do-- who loses the model?
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.200]   Yes, it is.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.520]   But YouTube has too much audience to ignore.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.520]   It's got the audience.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.240]   It's what you said before we got on the air, quote-unquote,
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.000]   air here, that you were talking to somebody--
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.640]   and as Eve Gruppin-- that you're getting new viewers on now
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.800]   that we have video up.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.160]   Putting Twig on YouTube, I think, has actually increased
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.000]   the audience considerably.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.800]   That's the key there.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.920]   So that's the beauty of what YouTube did,
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.920]   was it got the huge audience.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.560]   That's what has to be reckoned with now.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.120]   And it'll figure out the models to go around.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.040]   And so I think-- but to your point
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.760]   about integration or acquisition of YouTube,
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.480]   it's not integrated at all.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.400]   It is a separate company.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.400]   Right.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.240]   I'm looking at the list.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.320]   This is actually a great list on Wikipedia,
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.560]   thanks to the chat room for pointing me
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.120]   to the list of acquisitions by Google.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.480]   First acquisition, Dejan News, which
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.400]   became Google groups, right?
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.960]   Then Blogger in 2003, Dejan News was 2001.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:33.200]   Outride, Nectonic Software, Applied Semantics, CalTix,
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.560]   Sprinks, Genius Labs, Ignite Logic.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.600]   Baidu, that was the Chinese search engine.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.360]   Picasa, that was a good acquisition.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.200]   They've done well with that.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.800]   My goodness, that was a good acquisition.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.160]   I don't know if they're making money on it,
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.720]   but it's given them really a very credible entry
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.320]   in the photo sharing space.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.800]   Zip-dash, where to keyhole.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:54.760]   There's a good acquisition.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.160]   That gives them all the best of Google Earth.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.760]   Urchin for the web analytics.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:03.160]   Dodgeball, requirements, current communications group,
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.520]   Android, was an acquisition.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.020]   What?
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:07.640]   It was?
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.560]   Yeah, really?
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.360]   I had-- it's my memory that Android wasn't very far along
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.360]   when they acquired it.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.600]   Wow, I forgot that.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:15.800]   We never knew it.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.480]   Nope.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.720]   A lot of companies, nobody ever heard of.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:24.280]   D-Mark, Measure Map, Upstartle, Last Software, Orion,
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.720]   2WebNevin, YouTube was a 2006, JotSpot.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.160]   Oops.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.360]   Ah.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.640]   Oops.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:34.200]   That one didn't go so well.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.120]   It's going through double click.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.520]   Now that double click went well.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.360]   Double click support.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.520]   That's a very important part of the puzzle.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:46.200]   Feedburner, $100 million for Feedburner.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.040]   Grand Central, $45 million.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.880]   I love Google Voice, but it's still not public.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.640]   Postini, that basically helped fuel Gmail, $625.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.920]   You guys get behind the scene ones
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.120]   where they got--
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:00.520]   Team--
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.120]   Infrastructure.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:01.600]   --infrastructure.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.680]   Recapture, AdMob, we don't know yet
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.800]   if that's going to be very valuable.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.600]   They bought that last month or two months ago.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.200]   Gizmo, they bought a couple of months ago.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.240]   You know, if you look at these, there
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.800]   is a little method to the madness.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.520]   They bought a lot of infrastructure for search.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:21.960]   Then they kind of started doing some interesting things
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:27.240]   around ad sales and advertising.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:31.080]   But of late, the 2009 acquisitions
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.000]   on to that was video compression.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.920]   Recapture, I don't know why they bought that, AdMob,
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.720]   that makes sense.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:41.880]   They were-- AdMob was doing very well in the iPhone ad space.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.360]   Gizmo, I guess maybe they--
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.240]   I don't know why they would buy a gizmo.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.400]   Tarascent, which is more online advertising,
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.760]   and AppJet, which is Etherpad.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.080]   Those were their acquisitions in 2009.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.520]   None of those, could you say, really made much of a difference
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.400]   yet?
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.480]   And they were-- they were light on that position in 2009.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.800]   They're going to get heavy again in pretty time.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.400]   2008 was even lighter.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.200]   They only bought two things in 2008.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.000]   Wow.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.880]   Two things I never heard of, omnisio, which is online video.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.600]   That went to YouTube, though, I guess more infrastructure.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.920]   And TNC, Tatter and Company, which--
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.480]   Weblog software.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.080]   I don't even know.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.240]   What's textcube.com?
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.680]   I don't know.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.040]   That's what they say it turned into.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.520]   Text-- oh, it's Chinese or Korean.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:31.720]   It's Korean, yeah, yeah.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:35.600]   Korean connection through content creation.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.040]   So boy, 2008 was even weaker.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.760]   So this is the year that they go crazy, I guess, with buying stuff.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.360]   And I think there's such a huge risk with Google
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.080]   trying to absorb a lot of more stuff.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.160]   I sure like to see them retrench maybe a little bit
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.760]   and try to make sense of what they've got.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.560]   You think there's any chance they're
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.720]   going to try to buy Twitter or Facebook or something big?
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.720]   They don't have anything like that, do they?
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.280]   I mean, they have-- or could?
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.600]   That went well.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.400]   That was internally developed.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.640]   Well, it's huge in what is it?
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:09.760]   Brazil, it's huge somewhere.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.360]   Brazil, I think it was-- you also think of India,
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.920]   but now I think it's gotten beaten India by others.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.880]   It's funny.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.360]   It just shows you-- from the long time,
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.320]   they used to say the first mover advantage.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.120]   And I always thought that was a little suspect.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.160]   And I think if you look at social media,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.840]   Friendster or Cut, both of which predated Facebook--
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.960]   Facebook-- right time, right place,
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.280]   and somehow did something magic.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.760]   It wasn't the first mover by any means.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.480]   And you see that time and time again, actually.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.920]   I just joined a V contact today, the Russian one.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.600]   Ooh.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:39.000]   You have a--
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   Voori Milner.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.640]   You expect-- I bet Yuri Milner, who's the guy who
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.320]   invested in Facebook, who got the huge--
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.280]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.520]   He's also a big investor in V contacta.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.520]   And they have an English version of sorts,
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.800]   but I can't make any friends there
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.200]   because I don't even understand the alphabet.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.720]   Boy, if you think about it though,
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.120]   somebody said this in the chatroom, it's true.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.760]   Google might be the only company that could figure out
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.560]   how to monetize Twitter and Facebook.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.840]   They might actually have something intelligent to do.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.440]   All right, we've got a lot of tweets.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.600]   I know, Gina, you've got a ton of tweets from listeners
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.400]   who have ideas.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.520]   Before we do that, I just want to show you one thing.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:14.400]   If you go to google.com on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.440]   and still, if you go today, and without entering anything
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.240]   at all, just press, I'm feeling lucky.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:23.400]   Google will do a crappy little JavaScript fireworks
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.480]   display just for you.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.680]   It's very 1999.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.480]   I did it.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:33.600]   So 1999, I'm surprised they don't have snowflakes falling.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.000]   In fact, it's not even well done.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.160]   It overlaps.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.000]   It's like, this is so crappy.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:38.520]   Come on.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.720]   I don't know if we're an HTML5.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.400]   Oh, maybe for all I know it is, but it doesn't--
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.760]   you'd think they could do something a little more interesting.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:49.680]   I did test it, though.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.720]   It goes forever, just in case you're curious.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.160]   It never stops.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:54.680]   Just--
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:55.800]   How about that happen?
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.040]   Just keeps on going.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:02.000]   All right, Gina, you got a-- you tweeted earlier asking people,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.320]   what should Google do in 2010?
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.200]   I have some, too.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.400]   I tweeted as well.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.680]   And we've got quite a few responses.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.800]   Let's go through a few of them.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.360]   Sure.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.040]   Sure.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.120]   I think my favorite of all the responses I got was from that
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:14.480]   Luke.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.000]   He said, I want an implant chip that projects search results
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.240]   onto my eyeball when I pointed at something.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.200]   Heads up display.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.000]   That's what I want.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.560]   Heads up display inside the eyeball.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.000]   I like that.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.920]   I am with you on that one.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.920]   Got a lot of iPhone users wanting Google goggles
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.720]   and wanting Google voice and wanting turn-by-turn maps
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.760]   on the iPhone, which were pretty much all of Android's
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.280]   kind of advantages over the iPhone.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:43.040]   A few people mentioning they want a tablet.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.760]   I suppose an Android tablet.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.800]   But Gizmo to report it this week that HTC
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.400]   is working on an Android tablet with Google.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.400]   So that would be interesting to see
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:56.440]   and how it compares to the mythical Apple tablet.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.440]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.440]   Home right there.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:02.480]   So an Android tablet as opposed to a Chrome OS netbook?
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.480]   I know.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.480]   Does it make sense?
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.480]   Does it?
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.480]   Well, I mean there's touch that'll be touch.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.000]   Well, Android-- well, there's a big-- there's an Android in Chrome OS.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.560]   Chrome OS is just a browser.
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:12.920]   Android has apps.
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:13.920]   Right.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:14.920]   I would--
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:15.920]   That's why I keep it coming back to that.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.960]   I'm very confused by that strategically.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.960]   Well.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:24.200]   Because you could have a big phone or a little computer.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.200]   Right?
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.440]   Who's to say what the difference is?
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.440]   Right.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.440]   Right.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:34.200]   I think that's why I was very interested to get past this idea of the phone.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.440]   We have to get past the idea that what we're carrying around is a phone.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.440]   It's not.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.440]   It's a computer.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.440]   It's an incredible computer.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.440]   It's always connected.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.800]   But it has all the power of computer stuff.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.080]   Because that's where Google's going to really win.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:48.240]   And if we keep on thinking of it as a phone, that's too limited.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.240]   So anyway, I'm sorry.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.240]   I'll get off this horse.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.240]   No, I'm with you.
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:54.440]   In fact, I was hopeful that Google would actually completely
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.200]   disintermediate the wireless industry.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.200]   I mean, Google could.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.680]   It's the only company that could do this.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.960]   But could, if it had got some spectrum, still could, I guess, as an MVNO, just kind
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.320]   of destroy the wireless industry.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.160]   And I don't think there's anybody who would shed a tear over that.
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:14.280]   Except maybe the people who run Sprint and T-Mobile and AT&T and Verizon.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.440]   I mean, it would be a very interesting play.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.520]   Because then the freemium system really works.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.800]   If you control--
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.520]   I mean, maybe also that's when the Department of Justice shuts them down.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:29.400]   But if you can control the distribution, give away a phone.
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.640]   And then it seems to me this is just such an obvious model.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.680]   They maybe just be scared that it's just too monopolistic.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.880]   At this point, I feel bad for Google because I think they are now at this point.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:44.360]   They're large enough now that they have to tread very carefully with regulation.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.360]   And they're seeing that in the EU, of course.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.920]   What about wave, Gina?
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.880]   What's 2010 going to bring wave?
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.480]   Well, lots of people are hoping for Gmail integration with wave.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:57.680]   I mean, I think people want wave to be something really useful.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:58.920]   And it's not right now.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:02.120]   So people are saying, I heard from a lot of folks saying, I want wave to integrate with
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.200]   Gmail.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:09.080]   I want wave to be something that I really, really want to use right now.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:12.440]   It just seems like kind of a fun toy with an interesting promise.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:17.160]   I mean, obviously, I really hope that wave does well in 2010.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.680]   And I think it's going to.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.160]   I wouldn't have written the book if I didn't.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.760]   But it'll be interesting to see how that happens.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:27.000]   I think Gmail integration would be a really good way for wave to get in front of a lot
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.760]   of eyeballs and get people playing with it.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.560]   That's what Hexvox says.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.440]   He says, I want an option in Gmail to have Google Wave be the default client.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.560]   Yeah, that would be sweet.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:42.880]   Although the wave folks are kind of opposed to, they kind of are like, email, spam, and
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.240]   it's so old and we're doing a whole new thing.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:50.600]   I hope they can kind of get over that and work in some sort of integration that pushes
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:57.240]   the new protocol forward but still gives people that degrades gracefully, that still
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:02.440]   gives people who want to just use email some sort of option to communicate via wave.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.960]   McCant says, I want to see, as an educator, I'd like to see Google develop a learning
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.920]   management system because Blackboard is so terrible.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:13.120]   There's Moodle, which I actually like quite a bit.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.360]   It's an open source learning management system.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:21.080]   I could see Google acquiring Moodle and using that to make something more powerful.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:25.720]   They already acquired what's the name of a crap you mentioned a few minutes ago, the
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.360]   wiki company that they acquired.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.360]   Jot Spot.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.360]   Jot Spot.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.360]   Thank you Jot Spot.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.720]   I guess you could do it with Jot Spot.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.720]   Sure.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.360]   I use PB Wiki for my classes.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:40.040]   In fact, that would be, you mentioned Enterprise, but there's a whole other category that they
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:45.440]   could do, I think, quite well in education and schools.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.440]   Google Docs, I'm sure a lot of schools are using Google Docs and interested in using
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.440]   Google Docs.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.280]   Has Google made any outreach to education?
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:56.080]   They've bragged about how many universities are now using Docs.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:57.080]   Good.
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.560]   Because that's boy, I think that would be.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:03.000]   Once again, I don't think they're packaging it as well as they could.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.080]   I think a number of universities are at least testing Gmail instead of the traditional email
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:09.080]   server or something.
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.760]   A number have gone over to it.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.880]   But I would like to see Google really focus on that.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.680]   I think Google could do a great job with it.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.040]   And there's a lot of reasons to do that.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.200]   You want to win over young people.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:23.800]   Look how Apple and Microsoft both fought that battleground trying to get young people using
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:28.520]   those computers as they grew up so that they'd be fans when they did grow up.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:31.000]   I think that's where Google should be aiming right now.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.440]   Well, I think you can go beyond this and change the very structure of how we educate.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.880]   And that's getting a little too high-fooling.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.120]   No, I think that's exactly what Google should do.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.880]   That's what Google has the power to do.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.880]   Exactly.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.360]   Apple's making little noises.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:51.360]   Apple with iTunes U has in a very subtle way encouraged universities to start publishing
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.800]   courseware, publishing lectures.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.760]   And it is a little bit undermining the model for universities.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:03.280]   I think we go to a model of a lot more star lecturers and then local tutors.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.280]   Yes.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.280]   I'm with you on that.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:09.280]   And that will happen in the sense of university classes.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.240]   If you want a great physics class, you'll get the lecturer from MIT and then you'll
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:17.600]   have somebody around here who can explain what the hell it means to me.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:22.440]   I'm about to, I think, join the board of Reading for Blind and Disabled.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:27.280]   And what I've learned there is that I think almost 90% of their client base is not blind,
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.120]   but has learning disabilities of various sorts.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.120]   Interesting.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.120]   Fascinating.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.960]   And what it really amounts to at some level is a form of tutoring.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:40.160]   And so there are new tutoring platforms, things like that.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:49.200]   If you dissect education into its core components of the information, books, whatever, the application
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:55.680]   lectures and then the education, the tutoring, I think Google could do amazing things of creating
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.200]   new structure around that.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:02.240]   Yeah, I mean, I think there's a huge opportunity there.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:07.880]   My dad, who's a college professor, for a long time, I think thought that the future
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:11.520]   of the university was almost in a way the past of the university.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.880]   Universities originally were kind of collegial in the Middle Ages, collegial environments
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:19.240]   for scholars to get together and discuss.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:23.320]   And it was much less hierarchical, much less teacher student.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.480]   And he's at the same opinion going along the lines of what you talked about, Jeff, that
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:32.000]   the lectures are distributed universally globally from the best lectures in the world who give
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.440]   the lecture once and it's recorded and distributed.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:39.800]   And then these small collegial environments spring up, which are really more discussion
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:40.800]   groups.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.000]   It's kind of an Oxford model.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   Oxford.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   Exactly.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.480]   What did your dad teach?
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.280]   Earth sciences, professor of geology.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.440]   Yeah, he retired about 10 years ago.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:56.960]   But yeah, I think he's funny, we've had this discussion for literally for 15 years about
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.760]   what would happen to the university.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:04.480]   And it's getting more and more clear that the current university model, I get in trouble
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:05.480]   when I talk about this.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:09.160]   Don Tapsky, I really got in trouble when he wrote his article saying the universities
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.160]   are dead.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:14.480]   But it really does seem that universities, and I say, as you and I, Jeff, have kids who
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:23.040]   are going off to very expensive universities next year, God willing, you have to kind
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:26.480]   of ask the question, is this really the best thing for a kid to spend the next four years
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.480]   doing?
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.040]   What would be the best thing to do in the new world?
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:35.320]   I think it's worse than that, Leo, is that I get hangs of guilt saying that, you know,
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:41.960]   have I wasted the last four years of my son's time and the next four years to come?
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:44.400]   Is the system that we have the best or not?
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:48.120]   My daughter, who was a wonderful writer, I now read what she puts into schools because
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.720]   they tell her to.
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:54.120]   I read her assignment yesterday, and it was a long, big assignment, and it told you to
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.960]   do it in three paragraphs.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.600]   The paragraphs were this big.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.520]   You know, the paragraph was three paragraphs.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.520]   Only three.
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.520]   It made no sense.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:08.280]   The sample is out as if they're on an assembly line, and it's just wrong for the Google
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.280]   Age.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.920]   Well, and who better to reinvent this than Google?
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:15.160]   I wonder if they've got anybody thinking along these lines.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:19.520]   Or maybe that again, this I hope Google is not getting gunshine worrying about getting
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:23.480]   government regulators involved.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:28.000]   They have this great opportunity, but they may have many great opportunities, don't they?
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.240]   Google says, "Gibran Namiya, Gibran Ramia," I'm sorry, Gibran.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.720]   Google should start making TVs for free.
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:40.280]   Eventually, every company in the world will be run out of business by Google.
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:41.280]   It's true, though.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:46.080]   They could do a freemium or cheaper than for less than free of a lot of things, right?
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:51.640]   I'm kind of surprised that Google hasn't gotten into project management app or like
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:52.640]   a task.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:55.240]   There's Gmail tasks, but it's still really kind of limited.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:57.440]   It was a lab feature.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:01.200]   They should hire you in Merlin and do a decent task manager.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.880]   I mean, I really think it's kind of needed.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.760]   Some sort of organization app productivity app.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:12.440]   It seems like this big gaping hole in their offerings, especially if they want to go enterprise.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:17.360]   With Outlook, the three things you have a calendar, email, notes, and to do, and they
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.360]   don't really have that Gmail task isn't quite--
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.000]   I should know this, but I don't.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.880]   How do they manage tasks within Google?
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:23.880]   It's just a list.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:27.280]   1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with a checkbox.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:28.280]   That's it.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.080]   There's no productivity features at all.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:32.080]   No, I don't think--
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:36.080]   Jeff, are you asking how do they manage projects within Google?
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.080]   Yes.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.080]   Internally.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.080]   Oh, internally.
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:40.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.080]   I don't know.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.080]   That's an excellent question.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.080]   There must be an excellent question.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.800]   The rare moments when I visit, I try to stick my nose up over the hidden area so you can
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.800]   see the screens and the whiteboards.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:50.080]   I think it's whiteboards is how they manage tasks.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.080]   Exactly.
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.080]   That's it.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.480]   Put it on a whiteboard.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:57.920]   I think they erased the big whiteboard that they had about world domination.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:58.920]   Remember that?
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:06.160]   In the lobby of one of the buildings, it was like a 100 foot long whiteboard that was
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:08.080]   like the business plan.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:12.800]   It was hysterical because people would write, you know, crazy-- the kind of things we're
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.800]   talking about right now.
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:14.800]   Let's see.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.120]   Let's dominate the network television industry.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:18.120]   Vince Surf was on there.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.120]   A lot of people.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.840]   I think they got rid of it.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:21.840]   Oh.
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:22.840]   It should be a shame.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.680]   I hope they took lots of pictures before they did.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:25.680]   Evidence.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.680]   Yeah, evidence.
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:27.680]   Maybe that's why.
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:28.680]   They didn't want the DOJ to come in.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:29.680]   It's not comparable.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:33.560]   CCE on Twitter says Google should buy Spotify.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:35.560]   Should they get in the music business?
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:36.560]   Mm.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:40.200]   Yeah, I saw folks-- so they should not only buy it but make it free.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.720]   Make it free to destroy that industry.
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:43.760]   That's not going to happen.
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:46.400]   It's not Google's not the destroyer of industries.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.560]   That's not their aim, is it?
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:53.200]   Well, that's the point you raised, I think, last time Leo, when you said, oh my God, it's
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.200]   a revolution.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.160]   No, that's not their aim.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.160]   But what happens--
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.640]   That's Google Ephor's waste.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.760]   The internet of Hor's middle men.
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.600]   And when you let the internet do what it's supposed to do, and if you enable it to do
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:09.280]   what it's supposed to do, which is what Google specializes in, you are going to kill middle
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.720]   men and you are going to kill the waste that went into their pockets.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:15.560]   And it's going to stay in the marketplace.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:17.680]   And so everything gets cheaper.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.280]   If not free, cheaper.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.280]   Right.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.280]   Here's a good one.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.680]   I don't know why Google never did this.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:26.160]   Hello, D.Lo says Google should do a job board.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.520]   There's no Google Jobs thing, is there?
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:30.520]   That's a very lucrative sector in the internet.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:33.880]   Well, I want to put the last nail in the coffin of the newspaper business.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:34.880]   Oh, come on.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:35.880]   They don't care.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:36.880]   It's the circle.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:43.000]   What they're doing is they're dangling this over Rupert's head.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.720]   We still haven't done a job board.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:47.640]   Soon, they'll have real estate up on local.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:48.640]   Are they going to do real estate?
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.640]   Well, you have to.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:54.120]   You're going to see, if I'm going to look at my world around me and say, oh, that place
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.120]   is for sale.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.120]   Right.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.120]   It's inevitable.
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.920]   It's data that's already up there online.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:01.440]   All they have to do is curate it and present it.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.600]   Acquire Zillow.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.600]   Exactly.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.600]   I love Zillow.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:05.600]   Zillow is great.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:07.600]   That was awesome.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.600]   I had someone say.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:10.600]   I went to a meeting of Realtors.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:14.000]   And Realtors generally hate me because I said that they're middlemen and they're not
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   worth 6%.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   Right.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   But they had me in their meeting.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   And Zillow was there.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.360]   What I didn't realize is Zillow is Zillow is very Google-like.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.360]   If you come in and start pricing your home and seeing what your home is worth and what
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:27.520]   your neighbor's homes are worth, guess what?
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.880]   The odds are you're going to be selling your home.
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:35.080]   So Zillow knows homes that are going to go on the market.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:36.080]   Ooh.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.640]   That's smart.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.640]   Intense.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:39.640]   That's predicting intense.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:42.640]   It's all intense.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:43.640]   Predicting.
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:47.640]   In the acquisitions, I had someone say, buy fever, buy Skype and buy Zoho.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.640]   Do they think about them?
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.640]   What is fever?
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:56.640]   Fever is an RSS reader that it's kind of an RSS reader with smarts.
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.640]   It's an independently developed PHP.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:05.520]   I mean, it would kind of give Google Reader smarts that it doesn't have.
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.520]   Do you use Reader still?
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.680]   I stopped using Reader.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.640]   I tried and tried.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.640]   It's over.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.640]   It's too much.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.000]   I use Twitter and Friend Feed to let me know what I should look at.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.560]   So RSS isn't dead.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.720]   I know Dave Weiner hates it when I sit.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:19.720]   Well, I did.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.800]   It's an infrastructure, though.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.800]   It's used for podcast.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.560]   We use it for all the time.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.640]   It's going to be used in a lot of ways.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:31.440]   What I really should say, and I think what people mean when they say that is readers are
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.440]   dead.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.440]   Aggregators are dead.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.240]   Like launching your RSS reader is not something that people are going to do.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.600]   Jeff, do you read in RSS?
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.880]   I got to tell you, what I actually read first is all my ego feeds.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.880]   Right?
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.520]   Because that's how that's said that it brings us together.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.520]   People say something to you.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.280]   They'll say, Jeff, you should see this.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.840]   So when it is valuable for the conversation and my ego, I use that.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.560]   I look at a few things because it's just a convenient way to do it.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:03.160]   I read paid content in RSS because I like the formatting better probably than the site.
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.160]   It's interesting.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.920]   Other than that, no.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.960]   My RSS reader has a legacy of hundreds of feeds.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.600]   What will happen is on a quiet Sunday night, I'll end up going back through and catching
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.000]   up with people, which I could do by going to their site.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.800]   It's a little easier to do than a reader, but it's not really using it the way it's meant
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:18.800]   to do.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.120]   So no fever.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.120]   How about Skype?
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.840]   Should Google, I don't think Skype's proprietary.
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:32.600]   I think Gizmo made sense because Gizmo is a sip and is open standard.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:38.720]   Skype is such an unopened standard and it would be so expensive.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.800]   But Google already has Google voice as a VoIP, right?
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.800]   Has, yeah.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.600]   It's kind of weird VoIP.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600]   Yes.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.200]   It's a late VoIP, but it does have VoIP.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.040]   And they even do have video.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.840]   On Android phones?
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:59.080]   I use frankly a Wi-Fi or does it work on the telco network?
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.240]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.480]   That's a good question.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.480]   Probably.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.680]   That's a really good question.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.680]   That's a really good question.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.920]   On the iPhone, you could only use Skype on Wi-Fi.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.920]   It's limited.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.400]   On Wi-Fi, yeah.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.400]   That's a really good question.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.400]   Of course, Google voice works on Android.
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.360]   Do I even have Skype on Android?
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.680]   I don't see Skype on here.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:22.640]   I think I use Fering, which gives you an interface to your Skype.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.560]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:30.440]   I can't see Verizon allowing people to use Skype on its network.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.960]   But Google wouldn't care.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.800]   No, Google, that's exactly the kind of thing that you might see on an Nexus 1 that you
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:43.800]   would never see on a Verizon phone.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:44.800]   So there you have Gizmo.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.800]   What was the third one?
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:46.800]   Zoho.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.800]   Zoho.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.800]   Do they need Zoho?
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.000]   That's a good question.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.920]   I mean, Zoho has a heck of a lot of products that Google doesn't, like project manager,
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:57.760]   CRM.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:03.880]   I would let Zoho remain independent just so that you can say, "Hey, there's competition."
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:04.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.840]   Same reason Microsoft didn't swallow Apple.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:08.840]   There's competition.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.840]   Right, right.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.840]   I liked it.
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:11.840]   There's competition for sure.
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:12.840]   But that's a little money.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:17.760]   It's a little stuff that could add the Google's enterprise offering.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.760]   Right.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.160]   I wonder if they should buy Salesforce.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160]   CRM.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.400]   They don't do CRM, but boy, that would be unnatural for them.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.120]   Boy, would that be unnatural.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.120]   I'd like to see that.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.360]   How about StephenF99 says elance.com.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.960]   Elance is a neat site.
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:35.880]   I mean, talking about job sites, it's kind of the opposite of a job site.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.040]   You're a freelancer.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.040]   You post on there and if people need somebody to do, say, some graphics or web designer,
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.600]   whatever, they go to elance.com and hire you.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:47.480]   In a post-employment world where we're all independent agents, that's what's going to
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:51.480]   take off and that's the infrastructural play for that change when we all get fired.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.480]   Yep.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.480]   Yep.
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.480]   Google be nicely poised.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:59.960]   It seems to me jobs and elance, that kind of thing, that's a really good place for Google
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.520]   to play.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:05.840]   Because again, intent.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.880]   Somebody starts haunting elance or haunting a jobs board.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:10.880]   You kind of know what they're up to.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.880]   Right.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.800]   So if you make it so, they don't buy Facebook, then they buy LinkedIn.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.720]   LinkedIn would be a great acquisition.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.800]   Because, yeah, better than Facebook.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.880]   Read off and know how to navigate.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.760]   Well, we didn't read work for Google.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.320]   Where did he come from?
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.320]   I forgot.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.120]   I've forgotten that.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.840]   Chrome OS tablet, you mentioned that.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:36.520]   Let's see.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.480]   Any other good ideas here?
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:43.560]   Google should design a home theater PC using Android?
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.560]   Maybe.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:51.120]   Brian K Woodward says, "Forwards, refrigerator powered by Android."
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:58.400]   Yeah, I'm seeing some kitchen appliances powered by Android as well.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.760]   I think when you were talking about Zillow, you said something that was really very interesting.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:05.960]   I guess this is something we've talked about before, but the idea of what Google really
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.480]   wants to collect is intent.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.480]   That's that is keep that in mind at all times.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.480]   It's intent.
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:17.000]   The more that they can predict what we want and give it to us before we even ask, the better
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.240]   position they are in both from the content perspective, the service perspective and also
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.040]   especially from the advertising perspective.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.040]   All right.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.880]   What about Google killing the cable business?
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.200]   Nobody complain about that.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.240]   That's what I think we're seeing coming up because, you know, look at this at the string
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:39.560]   now, so you have News Corp getting up to a dollar a month per subscriber from places
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.560]   like Time Warner.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.800]   Time Warner is going to pass that on.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.760]   Every other broadcaster is going to do it.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.040]   Cable vision out my way just dropped scripts stuff because there's a similar fight going
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.040]   on.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.040]   What's going to happen is the cable networks, which are now more desperate for advertising,
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:57.360]   News Corp has basically surrendered advertising as a business.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.520]   If you think about what they're doing with newspapers and pay walls and with my space
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:06.720]   and not performing and now with TV stations, so that's going to make the cost of cable
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:13.040]   go up and up and up and up and up and go back to what we said about Hulu and YouTube.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:16.880]   I think they're perfectly positioned and cables.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:22.120]   The next big media play to desegregate TJ Simmons would go one step further.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:28.440]   He says, Google should turn on its dark fiber and give America cheap or free access to the
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:33.640]   internet, not only kill the cable industry, kill the internet, do the whole thing.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.960]   I think they died to it away.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.120]   Gosh, that would be great.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:43.560]   When they did own for about two hours when they were the lead bidder for that spectrum,
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:50.520]   the auction, when the founders talked about it, they practically giggled maniacally.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.240]   Oh, totally.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.840]   They'd have all this wireless bandwidth.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:00.080]   Just say, hey, what they're kind of doing that, they're nudging along with the free
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.000]   Wi-Fi and the airports and free Wi-Fi and cities.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.160]   I think they're going to look at prime directors of Google.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.240]   One, as Agena said, is intent.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:13.760]   The other is the more people use the internet, the more Google benefits.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:17.520]   We get a percentage of everything as long as you're using the internet.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:22.200]   The more ways we'd have you use the internet, phones, tablets, devices, whatever, and the
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.160]   cheaper we could make it for you to use the internet.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.800]   The more reasons we can give you to use the internet, the better off we are, because we
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:28.800]   are the internet.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.800]   We are Google.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:30.800]   Love it.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:37.400]   Well, here's the one thing I think Google should do in the New Year is they should do
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.080]   exactly what Gina Trapani did.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.960]   They should ask the public what should we do.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.480]   That's a great idea.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.960]   That's a great idea.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.560]   Put it out to crowdsource it.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.840]   Tell us what to do.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:52.840]   That's a great idea.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:53.840]   Well, it's great.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.360]   Thank you all for all of the tweets and the feedback.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.160]   I think it's really fun, really interesting.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:05.240]   If you do a search on Twitter for Pound Twig or for @GinaTrapani, you'll see a lot of those.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:08.440]   There's hundreds and hundreds of them.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:11.680]   I like her and Annaries tweet.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:14.200]   He said, "Google should sponsor Twig."
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   Nice.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.360]   But I would take the money.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.360]   No, no.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.800]   We wouldn't do that because there'd be no question.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:21.800]   Oh, dang.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:22.800]   That whole conflict thing.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:25.960]   You take it from Big Leo.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.920]   That'd be pretty funny.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:35.800]   By the way, while you're searching, you might want to check out Bing.com.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.720]   Then we would be completely objective, right?
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:38.720]   We'd know we're objective.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.480]   If you have a choice, you have a choice.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:42.040]   You have a choice.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.040]   Use it.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:46.440]   All right, time for our tool number and our tip of the week.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.640]   Let's start with Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.640]   Gina?
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.640]   This is a pretty cool tip.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.680]   I got this from my friends at Life Hacker.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.760]   One of the readers wrote in with this.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:59.680]   We all know that Google suggests drop down in the search box has gotten really good lately.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:05.400]   You can use it to find alternatives for things if you use the VS, the VS shorthand.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.000]   This worked really well with software.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.800]   If you're looking for an alternative to iPhoto, say, you just type into the Google search box
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:17.560]   iPhoto space versus VS, and you get a drop down.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.160]   You can see, actually, Leo is looking at a screenshot now.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.160]   This is the Life Hacker article with Notepad.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:26.600]   Text editors, if you're like, "Hey, I like Notepad Plus, but I want to see something
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.600]   else.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:30.040]   What are other people using type in Notepad Plus, VS?"
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:34.320]   You get this list of other alternatives to that software.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.880]   It works for a couple of different things.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:40.080]   It works very, very well for software alternatives.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.920]   Is this something Google did, or is it just an artifact of their predictions?
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.840]   This is totally just an artifact of search.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.880]   People writing about it.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.000]   A lot of people have written articles about Google, let's see, I'm looking at Photoshop
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.200]   versus Illustrator versus GIMP versus Lightroom.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.200]   It does.
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.960]   It really is a great job of giving you alternatives.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:01.680]   It's just a happy accident.
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:02.680]   That's great.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:03.680]   Let's see.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.680]   It's not that way.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:08.720]   You could use it for products, though it doesn't work as well.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.040]   It doesn't work for Twitter because I get Twitter instead.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:16.600]   Twitter versus Facebook versus MySpace, Twitter versus RSS.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.600]   This is interesting.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:25.120]   You can use iPhone versus Blackberry, Droid, Android, Black Raystorm, Prompy, Prompy.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.440]   It's kind of an interesting way to see what people are comparing.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.000]   I typed in Democrats versus the first one as Republicans.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   The second one is Wigs.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.560]   I like that.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:43.120]   When I joined contact.ru, the choices for political stances included communist and monarchist.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.520]   Ah, yes.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.440]   Bring back the monarchy.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.280]   I'm in favor of it.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.280]   Good clever.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.480]   So just add VS to your searches.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.560]   It's so cool what you can do with Google's suggestions.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.200]   In general, I just keep coming up with fun things.
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.680]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:01.680]   You didn't hit it this week.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:02.680]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.680]   I stayed well away.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:11.800]   7.56, which is what HitWise says was Facebook's market share on Christmas Eve versus 7.54
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:12.800]   for Google.
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.880]   What makes it sound as if, my God, Facebook is bigger than Google.
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:24.240]   But as search engine land, Barry Schwartz points out, Google's not just Google, Google's Gmail
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:27.280]   and all kinds of other things, and these numbers don't include that.
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.960]   And we can obviously get results and get things like search suggestions without even
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:31.960]   going to Google.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:38.360]   Nonetheless, give Facebook their credit that they are now as big at least as Google.com
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.680]   for a day or two.
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:43.680]   Pretty exciting for Facebook, I guess.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:45.680]   Pretty amazing.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:51.600]   I noticed on New Year's Eve, I got a lot of people saying Happy New Year.
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:57.440]   Did you see the video from November, married couples stood at the altar and as the minister
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:03.040]   was saying, husband or wife, the guy pulled out his computer and, or pull out his iPhone
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.240]   and started changing his status.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:07.320]   So maybe on Christmas Eve, people were changing their status.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.320]   That's it.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.400]   They got and who they were and all that stuff, right?
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.440]   You just need an excuse, don't you?
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:13.440]   It's life hacking.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.440]   I mean, it's, it's life streaming.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.040]   It's part of your life, right?
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.680]   Somebody suggested we type in Tiger Woods versus.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.680]   Oh, oh.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.200]   Oh, actually it's pretty, it's pretty normal.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:28.280]   Or Tiger Woods with Tiger Woods versus, yeah, with might be interesting.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:33.720]   My, my Google tool of the week is, as I mentioned earlier, Google Health, which I had never
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:38.240]   really paid much attention to until I got this Wi-Fi scale that tweets and posts my
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.440]   weight to Google Health.
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:43.360]   So I kind of went to my Google Health account and I started putting stuff in because it's
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.960]   it's kind of cool.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:50.800]   I mean, it's a way to store things like drug interactions, conditions, medications, procedures.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.800]   What's missing, unfortunately, is the ability to import your medical records from a lot
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:56.800]   of places.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:05.640]   There's a few, some drug stores, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Harvard's
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:10.600]   Pilgrim Healthcare, but really it's surprising the dearth of health insurance companies that
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.720]   let you import into Google Health.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.400]   And I think this is what's missing.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.160]   What a useful tool this would be.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.920]   And I'd like to encourage my healthcare provider, Kaiser, which is very computerized.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.040]   My doctor, when I go into the doctor, he doesn't look at me, just looks at his computer the
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.040]   whole time.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.360]   Are you allowed to email your doctor?
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.360]   I am.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.640]   And he responds like that.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:30.640]   Wow.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.240]   And no, they really are moving in that direction.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:37.400]   And of course, President Obama, this is part of his healthcare initiative, is the, the
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:42.920]   computerization of healthcare records, the portability of healthcare records.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:47.960]   Again, I think a lot of people go, I don't know if I want to tell Google that.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:53.560]   But I do think there's a certain advantage to having this stored in a single place.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.120]   And I like the idea.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:01.640]   Doc Serrel's co-author of Cloutrain is working on vendor relationship management, the counterpart
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:03.760]   to customer relationship management.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.560]   And this is a key part of what he goes into.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:11.280]   He had an operation a while ago that, where he puts it, he and his doctor didn't make
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.400]   the best decision because they didn't have easy access to all their data.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.400]   Exactly.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:21.280]   And it's, it should be a right for us to have access to our own stuff.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:25.040]   And you know, he said instead of what you have is this huge paper file and you got to
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.960]   go rightfully through it and you can't find anything there.
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.680]   And it's just, it affects our own health.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.280]   It's, this is not just about efficiency.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.280]   Exactly.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.280]   I need to collate my information.
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.520]   I want to know this stuff.
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:40.480]   There are services that like this is kind of funny, your health by uni-val.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:46.040]   You fax them your paper medical records and they say have expert nurses quickly and accurately
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:50.000]   convert them to a format that can be imported into your Google health profile.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.560]   You have to pay for it, of course.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.640]   That's a shame that they have to do that.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:56.880]   But I think, you know, there's something, the sad thing is my Kaiser stuff, I can go
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:00.320]   to Kaiser and I can see it all on my Kaiser page, but I want to get it into Google health
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.480]   because people change healthcare providers.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:06.760]   Google should do kind of an I want my MTV campaign to be able to take this.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.360]   I want my Google health and go to where doctors and demand it.
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.640]   I just, I think this is my body.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:18.720]   Huge potential, but a potential that's completely unrealized because of the lack of support
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.920]   from healthcare providers.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:25.280]   And maybe this is the time for all of us to say, Hey, doc, let me, let me control my
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.280]   records.
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:29.440]   I'd like to, I'd like to store them in Google health.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:33.280]   Well, that's our show for the first episode of 2010.
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.440]   I keep when I say 2010, 2010, the got me every time I am going to put a little electrical
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:39.600]   buzzer in my seat.
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.800]   Maybe I can train myself out of it.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.800]   I'm going to get an Arduino advice.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.840]   Whatever you say, it's my thousand.
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.960]   That's a great idea.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.560]   Make it a large you know, Gina Trapani is online.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.760]   Of course, at her website, smarter where.org.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:16:01.040]   And you can read her on places like the Harvard Business Review, lifehacker.com.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:05.640]   And don't forget her book, which is now available online at complete Google wave.com.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:08.800]   No, complete wave guide.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.800]   Yeah, complete wave guide.com.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.800]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.800]   I got it once last week.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.200]   Oh, you did great.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.000]   Oh, well, complete wave guide.com.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   Is it selling?
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   Well, it is.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   It's doing real well.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   I'm very happy.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   It's only $6.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   Go buy it.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   Just buy it.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.880]   And you've got to get greedier.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.760]   I'm working on the print edition right now.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.360]   That'll be out this spring.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:35.320]   Actually, if you think about it, though, I mean, you know, you'd be lucky to get a buck
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:38.280]   a book when you when you write a real book.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.200]   So you get an all six bucks, I presume.
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.320]   I'm getting a lot more per copy selling it this cheap than I.
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.880]   Get a lot more.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.880]   Yep.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.120]   That's the future publishing complete wave guide.com.
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:54.400]   Maybe this will be the year wave takes off.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.400]   That's the G.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.400]   Jeff Jarvis is a blogger at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:03.160]   It is a must read blog if you want to follow media and or just read great writing.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.000]   I'm just such a good writer.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.640]   It's really fun to read it.
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:10.680]   He's also a professor of journalism at the City University of New York and their journalism
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:16.960]   school there and a great regular and also does a podcast in England.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:19.920]   Media Talk USA for the Guardian.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:23.160]   So check out your Guardian podcasts and download that.
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.240]   And we will be back next week.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:30.680]   As I said, 215 Pacific 515 Eastern every Saturday afternoon at live.2.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.920]   You'll be at CES.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:32.920]   We will be at CES.
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:33.920]   So I'm sorry.
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:34.920]   We're going anyway.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.000]   Well, I don't think so.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.640]   That's a good question.
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:39.640]   Should we do it?
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:41.200]   We should do it anyway, shouldn't we?
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.200]   You can do it.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.200]   I'll do it.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.200]   I can do it.
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.200]   I think we have the capability.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.880]   I'll tell you what, I'll we'll get to you.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:47.960]   You know, we're getting there Wednesday.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:52.120]   We should know by then if we've got enough bandwidth on the show floor to do it live.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.720]   If we do, I'd love to do it live from the CES show floor.
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:55.720]   That'd be very cool.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:56.880]   So yeah, that'd be great.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.200]   Let's plan on it and then I'll let you know if we can't.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.200]   But let's plan on it.
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:01.200]   That's a great idea.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:05.360]   We're going to do live coverage starting Wednesday night, Thursday night and then all day Friday,
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.760]   Saturday and Sunday and all.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.760]   Many of our hosts will be there.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760]   It's really going to be a lot of fun.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.760]   And you and I can both give you a bath to put on the roulette wheel.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:13.760]   Sure.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:14.760]   Why not?
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:15.760]   Sure.
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.280]   Yeah, that'll be fun.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.840]   We are also on YouTube, YouTube.com/Twit.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:25.520]   There is a twig channel there so you can subscribe and watch all of our shows and embed
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.040]   them on your websites if you like.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.000]   Google actually has a nice feature where you can do an embed with a second mark.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.880]   So if there's like a pithy comment from one of our hosts, you can jump, you can blog it
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:36.360]   and put it right play right there from that point.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.920]   That's kind of cool.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:41.880]   And you can download the show of course from iTunes or Twit.tv.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:42.880]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.680]   We'll see you next week on This Week in Google.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:54.680]   [MUSIC]
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:57.260]   (guitar music)
