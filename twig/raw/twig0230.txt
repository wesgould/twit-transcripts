[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.080]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.440]   From people you trust.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.800]   This is Twit.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.560]   Bandwidth for this week in Google
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.920]   is provided by cashfly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:36.720]   Well, a happy Festivus to you.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.440]   It is time for our annual tradition on this week in Google.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.980]   We bring together your selections
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.040]   for the best of 2013.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.040]   During this year, we've had an amazing show
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.680]   with Jeff Jarvis and Gina Trapani and many visitors.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.160]   It is-- oh, my outfit, you like?
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.760]   This is a Google Slanket.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.880]   And the traditional Festivus headgear,
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.520]   we've got the pole, the earring of grievances a little later on.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.760]   But I thought we'd kick things off with Gina Trapani
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.600]   and her resolution for the new year.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.000]   Take a look.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.760]   I ordered a DIY make-your-own-cheese kit.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.400]   I can-- like, you feel a mozzarella cheese kit right now.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.400]   I should probably just be saying that I'm not
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.920]   really-- I can function in the kitchen.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.720]   I can make coffee and I can make toast.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.200]   And I could put it together.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.320]   But I'm not exactly a cook.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.840]   Well, my wife saw this, and she just went--
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.680]   [SIGHS]
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.680]   She just sighed.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.640]   I was like, come on.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.080]   It's like, make your own-- what's it on?
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.240]   Home, come on.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.840]   This is on Amazon, right?
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080]   It's $23 on Amazon.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.720]   Oh, and the--
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.240]   Mozzarella--
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.160]   Is that the one you got?
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.520]   No, no.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.240]   It's a Kickstarter.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.240]   It's a Kickstarter campaign.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.960]   It's a Kickstarter cheese-making kit.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.760]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.040]   It's probably on my profile.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.040]   That was hysterical.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.600]   I could just probably search for a cheese-making kick-kick
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.560]   starter and--
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.040]   Fine.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.320]   It's a good idea.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.760]   Make cheese incorporated.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.280]   Let's make cheese.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.960]   Exactly.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.480]   That's it.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.360]   That's on your own kitchen.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.880]   So--
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.440]   And guess what?
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.320]   They've raised $39,000.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.840]   Wow.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.240]   It's released on what's already grand.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.640]   I can send you some--
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.080]   Modern milk and some lemon and some cheese cloth.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.280]   And--
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.400]   Did you get your kit?
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.600]   I haven't gotten the kit yet.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   I got a holiday card saying, hey, it's coming.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.560]   I think the mozzarella one ships in like--
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.600]   I know what sold you.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.840]   Look at this mozzarella-making party.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.440]   That's what sold you on it.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.040]   All right, this is the thing.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.040]   Come on, all my molds.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.560]   We're so impressed.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.760]   Turn around to eBay right now and put it up there and say
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.400]   that you can order the first cheese-making kits.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.680]   Did you pledge enough to get the mascarpone included?
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.880]   I didn't-- just straighten with it all.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.280]   But it does make 30 batches of mozzarella.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.840]   So it's quite economical.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.120]   They're 30 batches.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.760]   I'm so excited.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.080]   My wife was-- she was serious.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.080]   She was just like, you are never going to do this.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.520]   I'm like, I am so going to do this.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.720]   I'll come over.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.240]   I'll come over.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.760]   Let's have a cheese-pulling party.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.680]   Maybe I'm dears.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.800]   I'll make cheese.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.200]   Oh.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.120]   In the studio.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.520]   That's a good segment.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.080]   And now, as we approach New Year's in Ghana,
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.360]   Gina Trapani will join us to show us how to make cheese.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.360]   You're like, you're a sense of lickney balls.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.520]   And I think you-- it's like Taffy, right?
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.440]   Mozzarella, you got a stretch.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.920]   It just looks-- yeah, I've never done it.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.920]   I'm a bad Italian.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.640]   It's about time.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.240]   Come on.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.160]   I want it.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.840]   That's funny.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.840]   Sorry for the--
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.920]   You really think all Italians make cheese?
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.120]   Oh, they go buy it.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.880]   They have a cheese for us.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.480]   I used to make pasta till I realized you could just go buy it.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.520]   My name's Ella.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.000]   And I'm going to--
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.600]   Ella is a cheese maker from Calgary.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.280]   That's cool.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.920]   You know what?
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.160]   This is what Kickstarter is all about.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.360]   We did talk about Google Reader shutting down.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.040]   There have been petitions, hundreds of thousands
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.800]   of signatures.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.880]   Nobody's-- that's not going to change anything.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.040]   No, Leo, what did you think?
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.320]   I know Jeff was pretty upset about it.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.360]   I saw Jeff ranting.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.240]   I was imagining the bumper of Jeff ranting on Twitter
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.200]   and saying, you know--
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   Did they close Reader after the show?
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.400]   So we haven't talked about it.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.840]   They did.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.400]   We have not.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.800]   They close it right after the show.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.400]   I think it was a Friday-- one of these Friday news drops.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400]   Oh, OK.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.040]   He's kind of buried in one of their spring cleaning bullet
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.600]   point lists.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.040]   Did we talk about Andy Rubin?
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.600]   And he was buried in the pope.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.120]   We did.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.480]   OK.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.400]   Can you talk about it?
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.320]   I'm so confused.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.240]   So Andy Rubin was first, and then they killed Google Reader.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.760]   And--
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.260]   Yeah, I think--
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.760]   --the reader.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.400]   Yep.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.760]   So 500,000 people sign up for Feedly.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.600]   I sign up for Feedly.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.200]   It is not a Google Reader replacement.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.280]   It's OK.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.920]   It's too pretty.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.920]   Here, it did--
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.520]   I went out.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.440]   It did import all my Google Reader content.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.360]   And so the one that I often do is tech news.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.640]   And so this is kind of Google Reader-like.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.920]   This looks very reader-y.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.640]   I guess it is.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.160]   There's old Reader.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.760]   That's the one that looks like Reader.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.320]   The old reader.com.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.720]   Who's the old reader.com?
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.280]   The old reader, yeah.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.160]   This was made a while back when Google broke sharing.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.520]   If they don't, you would share on plus.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.120]   But does that make a word?
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.200]   The old reader said, well, we can recreate that.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.120]   So if you go there and import your subscription,
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.640]   it has the share-y stuff that really used to have.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.760]   Now, can they scale up to accommodate all the unloved
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.880]   Google Reader users?
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.080]   That's the question.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.360]   Because there is some server side, quite a bit of server.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.160]   Is there not, Kevin?
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.480]   What's involved?
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.560]   What is the cost of running a Reader service?
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.880]   Well, so the challenge is the crawling.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.960]   And the reason that Reader sort of took over
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.960]   and became the central sync point for everyone
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.280]   was because Google does it as a side effect of their main web
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.160]   crawl, which means that they're crawling the entire web
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.920]   all the time anyway.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.640]   They've got very good knowing when things changed.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.240]   And so that is a lot easier than the classic feed updating
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.800]   problem.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.640]   So the feed-up learning problem is the point of the feed
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.240]   is it gives you a list of the articles
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.400]   and you know when they've changed,
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.120]   but you still have to check the feed.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.600]   And so you have to go and check the feed every so often
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.360]   to see when it's updated.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.080]   And the way we used to do that was we had ping servers,
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.640]   so-called.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.720]   There was several of them.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.960]   Dave Winor ran one.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.120]   We ran one at Tech LaRati.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.000]   There was a couple of them.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.400]   I remember that, yeah.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.720]   And you would put them URLs of those into your blogging
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.480]   software, and it would poke that and say,
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.200]   I've just updated.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.960]   The problem with those became that spammers were just
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.960]   ping them all the time.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:47.000]   So by the time Dave Winor sold the web logs one to Veracine,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.640]   it was like 95% spam.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.480]   Because I was a technical writer at the time.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.240]   We would read all the fire hoses from these ping servers
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.920]   and then run them through spam filters
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.200]   and decide which ones to make sense.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.960]   And it was very hard to get utility out of it.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.400]   So there was a spam problem with those.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:12.680]   So we were trying to build protocols for sharing stuff,
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.360]   basically a big shared ping server thing.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.200]   There's one that's plugged into WordPress that's not the name
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.360]   of that does a fairly good job of this.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.440]   And then there are also the big blogging platforms
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.120]   have their recently updated pages or feeds
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.080]   that you can plug into.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.040]   There are two or three ways of doing that as well.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.480]   You can also do it--
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.040]   clients, can't you with a client app like Net News 1?
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.080]   You can do it with a client app.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.680]   Yeah, that was the other way of doing it.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.400]   But the challenge of that is that you've
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.680]   then got lots of client apps hitting your blog all the time.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.440]   So you've got to pop in a blog.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.240]   And you've got 100,000 readers.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.120]   You're getting 100,000 people crawling all the time.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.000]   So it's a hardship on the blog.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.760]   So it's a hardship on the blog.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.000]   And it's a hardship on your phone
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.600]   if it's polling everything all the time like that too.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.440]   So there's value in doing it as a cloud service,
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.640]   I think, in the cloud.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.280]   And there's also value in amortizing
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.760]   that crawl across lots of users, which
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.080]   Google was effectively doing.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.400]   And also, because they're crawling the whole web anyway,
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.400]   they were very good at telling when something had actually
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.280]   changed.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.600]   It's quite hard to work out what's really going on
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.360]   because time zones, people have their clocks set wrong,
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.240]   and people change something.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.840]   And suddenly their entire feed gets republished.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.640]   And a whole bunch of stuff like that happens.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.760]   So when I was doing the Tenorati crawl,
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.800]   it was like, oh, look, this thing's in the future.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.720]   This was a common problem.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.560]   It's a very common problem.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.720]   You can trust the time-- you know the time you crawled it,
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.280]   but you don't know the time they published it.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.920]   And Google's crawl is big enough and comprehensive enough
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.640]   and not blocked by anyone, so they were very good at crawling
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.280]   everything.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.600]   So that, they effectively displaced the entire infrastructure
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.760]   there because they would let you tap into it.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.480]   And it wasn't a formal API.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.560]   It's a sort of undocumented back end
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.200]   that lots of people use.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.280]   And the team informally connected with them,
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.560]   but they never went through the official Google API
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.480]   process to put it out there, which
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.280]   means it's not going through the official deprecation process
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.000]   where they say when they'll turn it off.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.240]   It's just going to vanish when they turn the product off.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.520]   It seems like Google should keep this going
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.920]   if only as a public service, right?
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.160]   That would be nice.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160]   Not for an even for people who use reader,
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.760]   but because it's doing this crawling anyway,
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.640]   it could really offload blogs.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.080]   So there's a group that was formed called Open Access
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.520]   Coalition, which is semi-related to this,
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.120]   that Kevin Burton of Spinner and--
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.280]   what's his face?
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.320]   What's his face does so much these days?
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.680]   He's really too busy.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.520]   I think he should stop doing so many things.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.560]   Seems like he's doing almost everything nowadays.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.560]   Especially--
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.440]   So do you think you should keep the product--
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.400]   you think they should keep the entire product running
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   as a public service or just the unofficial API?
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.200]   I mean, since the API was totally unofficial, I don't know.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.520]   Greg-- sorry, Greg Kidd of three tabs.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.680]   So they put this Open Access Coalition
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.840]   to fight for the ability for people to write web crawlers.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.000]   And this is an important issue.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.200]   The reason Google exists is because you can crawl the web
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.040]   and download the stuff and make sense of it,
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.920]   and people don't restrict that.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.440]   A Neil wrote about this this week as well about,
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.120]   we should have weird user agents.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.640]   Because the user agent is-- the client side app
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.440]   you use to connect to the web and make sense of it.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.480]   And a lot of sites are now saying,
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.400]   we will only let you connect to us
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.720]   if you're one of these known browsers.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.000]   Facebook does that now.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.920]   You can no longer--
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.160]   Really?
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.200]   If you try and curl a Facebook URL,
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.080]   it'll say you don't have a recognized browser.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.600]   Wow.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.440]   So this crawl ability has been reduced.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.160]   Also, people you put a lot of stuff in their robots.txt
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.960]   that says only the Google bot can crawl me, which is tricky
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.880]   if you're Blacko or if you're Bing or somebody else
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.000]   trying to crawl.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.440]   So yeah, there is a problem here.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.880]   Now, there are some other crawlers out there.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.160]   There's obviously Bing.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.280]   If Bing wanted to steal a march on Google,
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.240]   and say we're now the Open Company, as Google's the closed
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.440]   company, they could say, we'll provide this API
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.520]   for people-- this what feeds have been updated and which ones
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.480]   have changed.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.560]   API for people is part of our crawl.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.440]   And it would probably help their crawl as well,
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.680]   because they would get-- then people
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.520]   will be motivated to plug things into them.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.680]   Open up.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.000]   Yeah, so I can see that that--
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.640]   if someone--
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.800]   Microsoft--
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.640]   Thinking about it.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.120]   Huge opportunity for Microsoft.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.600]   They're already crawling the web.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.560]   They're already doing it.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.040]   So it's just like you just write a map
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.960]   which feeds this stuff out to the sign,
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.440]   which is what all that happened at Google.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.640]   The reason that Reeder could be built by three guys at Google
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.440]   was because they could use the existing crawl.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.040]   Microsoft--
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.160]   There's a guy right here who knows how to do that.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.680]   He'll write you a map reduce, no problem.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.480]   I'm just wondering how I write my map reduce, though.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.320]   He's probably done it a few times already.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.800]   Just take an old one.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.960]   So then the other thing there is,
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.720]   is there's this group called Common Crawl.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.160]   CommonCrawl.org, which is a crawler
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.480]   that dumps its data into an Amazon thing.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.600]   And then you can run scripts against it.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.680]   So that's an interesting project.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.800]   I know I've seen Pete Warden has done some interesting stuff
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.400]   with that.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.000]   So the idea of that is it's supposed
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.480]   to be web crawl data that could be used to make sense of this.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.240]   So there's that.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.600]   The other piece of this that could be valuable is Pub/Sub Hub
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.600]   Hub, if you remember that.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.680]   So Pub/Sub Hub Hub is designed for this problem of what's
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.200]   updated web.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.520]   And the idea is you have a Pub/Sub Hub Hub server,
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.600]   and you publish your stuff to that.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.720]   And people who want it, subscribe to that server
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.040]   and say, call me when it's updated.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.840]   And there's a verification protocol
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.640]   to check that they are who they say they are,
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.480]   and the call back URL works.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.320]   So then you post your thing to there,
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.520]   and then it does the fan out of that to lots of--
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.120]   all the people are subscribed, and those are chainable.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.240]   So you could actually build Pub/Sub Hub Hub networks.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.440]   So that was actually part of the reader infrastructure.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.960]   There's one that's hosted by Google that Brit Slack
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.320]   in built that's still running, and the feeder was plugged into.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.960]   I hope they'll keep that up as well.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:37.480]   So what's kind of happening is that somebody called it
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.600]   the breakup of the server union.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.800]   It's like all these old battles that
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.240]   were frozen when this thing take over are coming back again
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:44.740]   now.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.960]   So we can have an interesting discussion
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.120]   in protocol space for the next few weeks
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.160]   as we try and put these together.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.200]   So in some ways, it's annoying that Google have done this.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.480]   It's very annoying that Google never did a proper API
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.120]   for it in the first place.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.600]   And we've got this weird reverse engineered thing.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.640]   But we may be able to build something interesting
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.120]   and open out of this.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.440]   But that's my hope for a big chunk of this.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.760]   So to be clear, the fact that Feedly--
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.880]   and I presume others-- I'm looking at BazzCucks,
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.720]   BazzCucks.com that imports your OPML
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.240]   and gives you a very kind of Google Reader-like interface.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.800]   And you mentioned the old read.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.280]   The fact that these companies do this isn't really a solution.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.360]   You don't want a million of these going around.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.640]   What you really want is a centralized repository.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.560]   Well, no.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.280]   You want-- it depends how they're doing it.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.600]   What you really want is to define
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:45.200]   the good API between the cache of all that's changed
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.800]   and the client-side app.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.760]   And at the moment, there's an API that was designed
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.800]   by a bunch of guys at Google for their particular purposes
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.320]   and who's being used by other apps for that.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.600]   It would make sense to spend a bit of time converging
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.160]   that together and saying, what is the good API between that?
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.640]   So that may be a conversation that's going on.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.160]   But the other part is we've had--
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.840]   the other thing is that a lot of this infrastructure
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.760]   is as creepy as anything.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.400]   The feeds are messy things.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.360]   Most of them are invalid.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.880]   And you have to have a lot of--
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.000]   if you look at the universal feed passer, which
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.520]   is the best feed passer that I know about,
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:33.560]   it has something like 3,500 test cases
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.760]   that it runs to-- most of them are bad feeds
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:36.680]   and have a deal with them.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.120]   They grew from finding bad feeds.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.400]   Can't feel we're spent a big chunk of time getting that right
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.960]   and a lot of this fed stuff into that.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.520]   So the assumption that feeds of these beautiful things
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.440]   that work is actually--
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.160]   there's most of them are broken and there's
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.800]   a lot of fudging that makes this stick them together.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.560]   It's really a shame.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.000]   I mean, Google was doing the crawling.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.120]   Google had the code.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.280]   Wasn't much to maintain it.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.120]   I first thought, oh, this is a great opportunity
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.320]   for companies like Feedly.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.080]   BlackPixels, which owns Net Newswire,
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.360]   says, hey, good news.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.000]   We're working on new versions for the Mac,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.040]   the iPhone and the iPad.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.440]   That was a great news reader on the Mac side.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.720]   So an opportunity for them, but really not really
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.040]   the ideal long-term solution.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   Well, the challenge is--
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.120]   who's using this?
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.280]   The reason this is shut down is because those of us who
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.160]   were the text heavy web.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.720]   I'm not sure that's the case.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.240]   I have to think it has more to do with Google pushing Google
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.680]   plus than it does with the lack of use of the Google reader.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.480]   Same reason they took that share.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.760]   They haven't had that many users,
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.160]   but it's had lots of usage.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:46.720]   Is it what I mean?
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.200]   Right.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.560]   The people who use it use it intensively.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.480]   But it is those of us who read long-form text.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.440]   And that is-- we're a small minority of the web these days.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.080]   So the question is, do we preserve this sort of long-form
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.080]   text parallel infrastructure, or do we try and merge it
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:08.640]   with the Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest flow
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.080]   of millions of updates that are built on similar ideas,
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:17.120]   but with a very different sort of cadence of update.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.000]   Dave Weiner himself said when I hear about this, well,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.640]   you know, the inbox model is kind of out of date.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.800]   The news river model makes more sense.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.280]   That Twitter--
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.480]   Totally grew.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.480]   Well, I've had really configured to be a river for a while.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.320]   I mean, you can turn off the unread counts,
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.720]   and that makes it much less interesting.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.480]   And then you can decide which--
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.240]   you know, you can pick-- what it is,
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.640]   it's a sort of series of rivers.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.080]   You can put them in folders, and then you
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.560]   can get a river for each folder.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.760]   And that's the piece that I find useful.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.320]   And I end up with one main one that I look at most of the time,
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.640]   and I have some other ones that I'll check now and then.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.160]   And if you look, you know, Facebook has just made--
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.960]   their redesign thing is kind of that.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.080]   They've got tabs that you switch between
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.200]   to see different rivers in there.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.760]   And obviously, the various Twitter clients
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.600]   that give you columns that are now mostly owned by Twitter
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.120]   have that sort of worldview as well.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.200]   So there is a--
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.640]   there is some--
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.640]   I agree that the river is right when
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.800]   we are converging on that view.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.200]   But there is value in having these rarely updated ones
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.520]   that you look at as well.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:38.600]   Dave says in a conversation with Max Levchin on Twitter,
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.520]   he says, so it looks like there are three possible outcomes.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.760]   It's Dave Weiner, one of the instrumental guys in RSS.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.640]   He says, Google Reader's Demise 1, Google Reader's Demise,
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.560]   is also the end of RSS.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.000]   He says, which seems to me is Google's desired outcome
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.720]   based on other things they've done.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.600]   Two, as market develops--
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.080]   or A-market develops, but we're unable to get the new features
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.920]   into it that simplify the subscription process.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.640]   So it has a chance, like Twitter.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.480]   Or three, a new dominant reader comes about.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.280]   And if they're good, then maybe something good happens.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.120]   He says, I don't think there's as slight as possibility
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.800]   of that number three happening.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.920]   People in tech are too insular.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.280]   They don't study prior art.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.760]   Or even study their competition enough
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.560]   to know where the problems are, much less
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.800]   where the potential solutions are.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.320]   You think more likely a mix between one
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.960]   and two, a continued decline for RSS,
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.640]   and more and more reliance on big companies
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.080]   that couldn't care less, like Twitter.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.320]   That's depressing.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.120]   I know that.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.080]   That's a depressing outcome.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.360]   Dave Weiner's brought me on Twitter,
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.400]   so I can't read what he's tweeting,
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.400]   but I'm still with his blog.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.800]   Yeah, good old Dave.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.160]   There is a difference of--
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.400]   I still see you retweet sometimes.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.000]   But there is a difference--
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.400]   there is a difference between the centralization
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.040]   and the centralizing.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:54.880]   And he's right.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.440]   The stuff he built was decentralized.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.320]   It meant lots of us could build on it.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.320]   Right.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.520]   Again, and Nina and I were reminiscing about this.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.520]   But we were able to build these parallel things
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.600]   that had an interoperable layer.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.120]   And it was a--
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.920]   a lot beautiful interoperable, but it worked.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.880]   We could make it-- we could glue it together.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.520]   And the difficulty is that lots of the things
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.320]   that were built since were effectively
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.120]   blogging within one company.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.560]   So if you look to-- even delicious was like, oh, it's a link
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.600]   blog, except that the tags bridge across delicious.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.600]   Isn't that nice?
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.480]   We've got a link there.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.560]   Tumblr is exactly that.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.800]   Tumblr is a blog with an update system
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.480]   that feeds inside itself so that you can repost things.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.960]   And they stay within Tumblr.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:42.040]   And obviously, Twitter and Medium and--
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.880]   the other things that are like this
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.560]   have those same characteristics, which
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.600]   is it's very easy for them to interrupt with themselves.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.080]   And it gets harder and harder to interrupt with each other.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.000]   And one of the nice things about 10 years ago in blogging
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.640]   was that we had multiple mature clients that actually behave
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.680]   fairly well with each other, but publishing things
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.800]   and reading things.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:08.280]   And that is the piece that's sort of being damaged
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.760]   by decentralization stuff.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.200]   And maybe this is a chance for us to try and rebuild that.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.280]   But I spent a chunk of time trying
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.800]   to do this without consocially trying
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.040]   to make these feeds interoperate.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.040]   And it's hard.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.480]   It's hard to get companies to realize
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.720]   it's in their interest to do this, especially
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.200]   when they've got a large user base.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:35.720]   And they've got-- they like the ability to shut people down.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.320]   Facebook did it again this week.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.680]   Somebody got started building a successful messaging thing.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.320]   And they said, oh, I wish I knew down by it.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.840]   They liked that ability.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.160]   And to some extent, you need to be just shutting down spammers.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.000]   We did have a spam problem with blogs.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.960]   There was a time when Blogger itself
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:59.120]   was a giant spam factory, because it was very easy to set up
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.720]   scripts to generate blogs and post-post there
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.360]   and feed them into the rest of the infrastructure.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.200]   And it took a while for Google to realize that
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.040]   and clean that out.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.360]   So there are problems with this and how you plug this together.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.640]   It is hard to maintain who gets to talk to whom
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.440]   it is.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.760]   But we've come up with models-- the following model,
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.480]   and the subscription model, actually does make some sense.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.000]   And we've seen that idea spreading out into other places.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.800]   The challenge is, as Dave was saying in that post you quoted,
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.160]   making that work in a way that bridges between the systems
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.040]   is the valuable piece and the piece
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.360]   that we need to spend some time doing an intro upon.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.000]   But you choose how you want to see it.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.280]   He also points out, he says, I never use Google Reader.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.760]   I didn't trust Google.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.120]   And he says, make sure if you're going
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.720]   to support something like this, that it has a business model,
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.320]   you're paying for it, so that there's
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.160]   an incentive for them to keep running it.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.960]   Well, I hope you're enjoying this best of this week in Google.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.200]   We'll be back next Wednesday with a--
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.120]   this week in Gobbie Exhausted, because it's
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.840]   going to be New Year's Day.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.720]   We are doing a show in New Year's D-Chat.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.360]   Is that true?
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.160]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:08.840]   Holy cow.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.760]   Well, I'll be exhausted because I'll have been up all night.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.320]   I hope you're going to stop by for our New Year's Eve party.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.200]   Meanwhile, we're looking back at the best of 2013
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.720]   and a little battle over something Google
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.760]   like to call the Chromebook watch.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.360]   So I said the Pixel back.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.200]   I canceled my Pixel order.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.800]   And Jeff says, I'm wrong, wrong, wrong.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:38.440]   Well, I have a video showing how the Verge pops up on my Pixel.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.000]   And scrolls quite responsibly.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.160]   And scrolls just dandy.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.160]   Do you need to try to tell you a machine?
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.360]   I'm just going to enjoy this going back and forth.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.920]   If there were more pixels, I could go see if there's
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.760]   a tiebreaker.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.120]   But the next time I see somebody with a Pixel--
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.320]   Well, it's like a bio.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.360]   You see?
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.080]   Look at that.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:23:59.560]   There it goes.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.080]   Big phone.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:00.400]   You're moving.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.080]   I might say you moved very gently into that.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.080]   Oh, geez.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.400]   You must have been a real pain in the ass
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.920]   on a playground argument.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.800]   My only point is that--
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.560]   and I don't care how the Verge scrolls.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.960]   My only point was that for that price--
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.040]   For the week.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:17.920]   No, no.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.240]   Well, I was using as an example.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.840]   For that price, it should be a much faster, more
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.840]   responsive computer.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.920]   It is not particularly responsive.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.920]   I find it very fast.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.520]   Very fast.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.120]   And it works just dandy for me.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.720]   After using it for a couple of days,
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.600]   I felt like, god, this is frustrating because it's just
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.360]   kind of not responsive.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.920]   It feels a little jerky, a little--
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.560]   Like, you got the wrong machine.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.760]   That's what I'm telling you.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.920]   Last week, your entire complaint was the Verge went up slowly
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.000]   and it did on the video.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.720]   And so I was--
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.240]   You have a pixel--
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.720]   Oh, you can't do it because you're in Skype.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.840]   I can't do it, right?
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.320]   Right, I did it.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:49.920]   So I got home.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.080]   I said, I don't record this for you.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:51.600]   I can sit down.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.840]   I go to the Word button.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.360]   But you didn't have it full screen.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.080]   So you weren't really testing it.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.160]   Oh, geez.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.680]   Well, no, that's your main because what you want to do
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.560]   is fill the screen-- fill the pixels.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.280]   The point is that-- my point was that the graphics card
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.520]   in that is insufficient for the number of pixels
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.640]   on the screen, which is true.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.960]   But you're not going to see that if you have a window.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.080]   You have to go full screen on the Verge.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.240]   I don't want to be your roommate in the old folks' home.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:17.920]   No, I'm not.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.400]   No, no, no, no.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.240]   My suggestion is I think we should just have a pixel throw
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.920]   down at Google I/O. We'll get those--
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.120]   Those similar wrestler bouncy suits, you know?
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:30.560]   And you guys can just go ahead in the middle of Moscone.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.360]   Well, I stand by-- I stand by review.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.920]   It was not a broken pixel.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.360]   It's a lot of pixels to push.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.800]   It's not at all surprising with Intel motherboard HD 4000
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.040]   graphics that that is too many pixels to push.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.960]   You won't know until you put a very demanding full screen
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.960]   web page on there.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.880]   But you will see it in day-to-day operations
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.360]   because it's a very high-res screen.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.000]   Now, that's the advantage of this.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.080]   I've been using it for three weeks now,
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.480]   and I'm telling you, I don't.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.840]   You're a perfect person to own the pixel then,
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.280]   because you don't notice the difference.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.880]   Vance McAllish wrote a wonderful post
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.720]   on Google Plus.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.560]   He wrote it actually as a comment on my post
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.360]   under that video.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.160]   Right, and I read that.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.600]   Yeah, and he had a Leo video.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.880]   And I asked him to make it a whole post
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.720]   so we can put it up there.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.720]   It's very, very good.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:19.640]   And he explores why this is so polarizing.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.120]   Well, guys--
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.040]   I'll tell you why you guys have Stockholm syndrome.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.800]   You wasted your money on that.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.240]   And now you have to justify why it's a good purchase.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.560]   No, I haven't received it yet.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.000]   I'm just not using the loaner machine.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.080]   It's not too late to cancel.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:30.920]   Wait a minute, actually it is.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.880]   It's not too late.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.960]   It's not too late.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.480]   No, right?
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.720]   I was thrilled when I canceled it, like it was able to do so.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.480]   Look, there are some real advantages.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.800]   I won't deny it to Chrome OS.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.960]   It's secure.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.800]   If you're content to just run a browser
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.760]   and to do your email in the browser and everything
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.960]   in the browser, it's fine.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.440]   That's what I do.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.080]   But it's an awful lot of money to pay
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.680]   for such a constrained machine when you--
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.280]   I cannot.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.280]   --could pay less for a full machine.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:00.760]   I can't--
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.280]   fully.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.120]   So that's the thing.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.440]   That's what Vance was saying.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.960]   That there's this belief that the machine is the way they were,
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.840]   is the machine is the way they should be,
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.320]   and that there's this belief that it's somehow limited.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.120]   I'm on the web.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.120]   The web works fine.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.520]   You know, and I was thinking today.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.000]   Well, Jeff, I have to point out that you did install Linux
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.120]   on that, and you had to to run storage, which you're using
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:18.600]   right now.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.840]   You will, because of Microsoft.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.480]   That's the only reason.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.520]   And if you guys would get your act together and get webRTC
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.600]   or Google Hangout, it would be fine,
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.200]   whichever way it says, why the heck is in this show
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:27.800]   on Google Hangout?
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.120]   Because it looks terrible.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.080]   Just saying.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.800]   Because it looks terrible.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.120]   We could use Google Hangout, but it looks terrible.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:34.640]   And it sounds worse.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.400]   I should not run.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.320]   So some people don't.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.720]   So my point is, some people--
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.520]   it's like you telling me, I love Chef Boyardee.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.400]   That's fine.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.640]   Each Chef Boyardee, I'm not saying you shouldn't.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.000]   But it isn't necessarily great food.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.280]   Well, I like Armani's suits, but I can tell you don't.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.320]   No, I don't.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.200]   Based on what your word is, I'm worried.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.680]   In fact, Lisa's going to kill me, because it's a Tennessee
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.720]   Titans shirt.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.800]   Graduate, professor.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.280]   I'm nervous.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.600]   Jeff, I love you anyway.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.120]   You're going to keep this up, huh?
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.680]   We're going to have a few--
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.360]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.840]   Just before the show, you're doing the Salty Mic Chromebook
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.960]   again.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.720]   You won't let it go.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.320]   It's my fault.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.880]   Oh, now it's my fault.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.800]   Yes, it is.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.320]   OK.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.880]   Jeff is also Professor of Journalism at City--
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.240]   Oh, no, they're out to get it.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.360]   No, no, no.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.280]   Professor of Journalism is--
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.040]   Or as Gina would say.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.200]   They-- oh, no, no, no.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.240]   You weren't really doing that.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.480]   Were you doing that?
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.840]   Oh, you're the one I was.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.840]   Hey, look, there's another person here.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.240]   Also with us Lamar Wilson, YouTuber Lamar Wilson,
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.600]   the host of our show this week in YouTube every Sunday
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.480]   on the Twitter network.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.120]   How are you?
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:46.760]   Good to be here.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.520]   Nice to have you.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.240]   He's also, of course, on YouTube, Lamar Wilson.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.320]   Hey, I got a YouTube story.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.720]   We'll lead off with a YouTube story.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.960]   You know our show this week in YouTube?
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.640]   Blocked on YouTube.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.280]   Oh, no.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:58.800]   What?
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.760]   We got blocked already.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.480]   Well, not the show, but--
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.440]   The whole damn show.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.760]   The latest episode.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.000]   Well, there's only one, dude.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.440]   This is the first episode.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:08.880]   Well, we have--
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.920]   Well, zero's still on there.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.880]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.800]   Oh, yeah, there is an episode zero.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.200]   Episode zero survived.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.280]   So is it-- is it TWI-T on YouTube?
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.480]   YouTube.com/TWI-T.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.960]   It's this week Y-T.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.480]   This week Y-T.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.480]   This week Y-T.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.560]   Now, we're theorizing that maybe we don't get as much slack
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.280]   on this because we're a new YouTube channel.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.280]   I bet that's what it is.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.120]   That's why we need-- we have a contact at Google.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.080]   We need to push this probably to him.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.040]   Because I think that's what it is.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.560]   It's a new account.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.880]   And a lot of spam accounts come up new,
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.000]   and they start putting up illegal content right away.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   So they're probably treating us no differently.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:44.800]   That's what I would guess.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.920]   I would hope.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.320]   Because-- so what-- the weird thing is that it was one
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.680]   of those automatic content things.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.240]   And it was by sigh.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.960]   Remember, sigh was very famous in his first video,
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.440]   well, got in him style, that he let everybody do anything they
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.080]   wanted with it.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.360]   I don't know if they issued takedowns,
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.760]   but it was very free.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.160]   And there was--
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:06.640]   It was--
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.280]   He never did.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.400]   No, no, no takedowns.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.880]   Well, boom, he's got to know his song.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.920]   Now, I guess he's a big shot.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.160]   Doesn't need anybody.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.320]   We played just a few, maybe 15, 20 seconds of his new video,
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.000]   right?
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.520]   And talked a little bit about it.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.280]   How hard it might be to do it.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.320]   It wasn't even the whole thing.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.000]   No.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.480]   Which by the way, sucks.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.760]   But here's the interesting thing.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.000]   Now, Chad, correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.360]   He said they said the automatic content filter detected
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.760]   as a live performance of that song.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.320]   Yeah, the live performance of the new song,
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.080]   I don't even know what that was.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.640]   So we appealed it.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.400]   They did have the appeal process.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.320]   And they said, no.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.760]   Well, no, they said sure, but it's
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:51.040]   going to take us up to a month to get to it.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.240]   Which for a new show is a big deal.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.040]   That's episode.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.480]   I can make that go faster.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.200]   That's ridiculous.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.840]   Well, we're going to pull in all our chits with people like you.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.040]   And you know what I think you should do?
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.200]   You should go back and edit it.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.320]   You should just have a sunscreen that says
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.120]   "Sci is a jerk" during that time.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.040]   That's a great idea, Jeff.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.360]   And we did that.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:09.920]   Except--
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.680]   And it's still?
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.280]   Except now that our account is no longer in good standing,
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:19.320]   we can only upload videos less than 15 minutes long.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.640]   We'll have to have a mini show.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.120]   Ooh, Clark, YouTubers.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.320]   No, I have a guy.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.080]   I have a guy.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.240]   Let's take care of her.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.680]   We're theorizing that--
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.080]   because first of all, it's fair use.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.240]   We didn't play the whole song.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:31.840]   It's a new show.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.880]   It's commentary.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.520]   And normally, we can make that appeal.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.960]   Because we get knocked down all the time on all of our channels.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.440]   Well, there's so many shows that do--
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.600]   what's trending does this--
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.280]   I mean, that's the basis of their show,
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.360]   is to put other people's videos in there.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.920]   And they get away with it.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.360]   So you get better.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.520]   Yeah, but she is a lot better looking than I am.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.520]   And I think that she--
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.720]   This is accurate.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.920]   So--
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.160]   Now, let me show you.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.520]   I just got an email from YouTube.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.440]   It happens all the time.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.800]   I don't even know what show this is.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.480]   This might be a Twitter episode.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.600]   They just blocked it.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.960]   This video contains content from a Brazilian radio--
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.440]   it doesn't, by the way, from either of these--
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.440]   in a Hungarian television station.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.000]   One or more of whom have blocked it.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.400]   They pulled this video down, even though there is--
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.880]   I guarantee you no Brazilian or Hungarian content at all.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.840]   There have to be penalties for these bad take-backs.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.480]   This happens so much, we need some sort of slap shield
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.760]   law or something.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.120]   And from an article I think we saw--
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.360]   and we talked about maybe two weeks ago,
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.520]   I have to dig it up.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.160]   This may actually get worse with some new rules.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.320]   Mary, yeah, we talked about this universal got in--
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.720]   UMG, yeah.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.320]   And so there might not be any appeal process.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.720]   That's something you actually brought to light.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.960]   The episode before.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.240]   I think you should be--
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.040]   I mean, I think you should threaten Si.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.080]   And these come back as well suits.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.360]   Counter suits?
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.280]   Yeah, so there'll be-- they're clearly losing your business.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.880]   There is tangible damage to you.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.520]   I think that's going to turn this around a bit.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.920]   And Google finds itself in the middle of those things.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.720]   They don't want that.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.160]   No.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.840]   And like I said, we have a rep that reached out to us.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.200]   They like to show-- they've blessed the show.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:14.800]   They have a project.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.360]   That's right.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.000]   With YouTube in the name.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.880]   And so that's the guy I said I was going to reach out to.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:19.640]   Good.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.080]   He said, if you have any trouble, let me know.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.080]   Hey, guess what?
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.680]   We've got trouble.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.440]   But so I'm not going to whine about this.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.560]   But what it does raise is this larger issue.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.000]   If YouTube wants-- how do they balance this?
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   I mean, I remember when YouTube started before Google bought it,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.880]   we were talking to the founders of--
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.920]   I think it was Jeffrey Chen we were talking to,
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.280]   one of the founders of YouTube.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.480]   And I asked him that question.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.480]   This was the six-month-old startup.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.080]   Aren't you going to get sued out of existence?
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.200]   And he didn't have really a very good-- he said no.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.280]   But he didn't have a very good answer.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.320]   I think he was already negotiating with Google.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.960]   I have to think that this was the best way to save this company
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.520]   is to pair up with Google.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.360]   Google's response is, no, we're going
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.240]   to use the Safe Harbor provisions of the Digital
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.320]   Millennium Copyright Act.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.560]   We're going to offer DMC takedowns.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.200]   And content providers will have a good recourse.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.400]   But now it's swung so far in the opposite direction
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.920]   that independent content creators like me--
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:21.120]   and I'm sure others, right, Lamar, are getting hurt by this.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:25.760]   Yeah, it's so many people that are getting hit by this.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.680]   And some, again, journalists like yourself
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.600]   or just people who are innocently just
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.520]   trying to create good content or commentary
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.000]   are getting hit unfairly.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.200]   And again, there may be no appeal for us in the future.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.680]   And I think, on one hand, on a business side,
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:47.040]   they feel like they have to do this to keep everybody happy.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.720]   That's on the business side.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:52.240]   But it hurts content creators like us, obviously.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.960]   And so I don't see a way out of this unless we do what Jeff
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.400]   said and some type of legal action.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:58.960]   I can't--
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.360]   I can't go around suing Hungarian television and Brazilian
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:02.880]   radio.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.720]   I'm not going to-- I'm not litigious.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:05.840]   I think you're right, Jeff.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.160]   That would be a good thing to do.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.560]   But I think there's an opportunity here
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.520]   for the likes of an EFF to give cover to a Google
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.240]   to say that there's a real tangible business damage
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.720]   that's being caused here.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.920]   And we can't just really nilly take this.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.600]   And the goal to force is Google to say that if you issue
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.760]   three bad takedown notices in a row, you're out for a month.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.080]   Let's penalize them.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.240]   So there's a couple of--
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.800]   yeah, there's a couple of things that come to mind.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.040]   First of all, I think--
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.200]   and I've mentioned this before-- that people are gaming it.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.560]   I don't think either of these Brazilian or hunger.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.240]   Now, normally what I would say is they wouldn't do a takedown.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.320]   They'd want to have ads placed on our content
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.680]   and make a little money off of it.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.400]   So a takedown-- I don't understand the benefit of that.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.240]   But it's obviously an erroneous takedown.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.600]   But the second point--
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.200]   Because the ad ran on that channel.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.800]   And so they're matching--
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.320]   No.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.880]   I mean, the video that you featured also ran on this--
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.800]   No, a Hungarian--
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.840]   Well, I hope not--
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.120]   on Hungarian radio.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:02.960]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.240]   Maybe they did some commentary.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.440]   I mean, maybe kind of a similar thing, right?
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.400]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.200]   And then the bot sort of erroneously picked up,
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.840]   made the match run related.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.200]   I don't know.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.000]   I'm trying to imagine how this happened.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.040]   But anyway, so go ahead, Lee.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:15.720]   I didn't mean to interrupt.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.760]   So that's one issue.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.280]   And both those videos are down.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.920]   In fact, our channel, like this week in YouTube,
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.360]   channel is down now because we can't upload content to it.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.680]   More than longer than 15 minutes.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.760]   But then there's the second issue,
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.280]   which somebody in the chat room pointed out.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.240]   What this does do is push independent people like Lamar
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.520]   and others to go work for these YouTube partner channels.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.080]   Because the YouTube partner channels
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.560]   have the cloud and to protect you.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.480]   Which is interesting because I feel like that's
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.400]   what YouTube wants to happen.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:49.440]   At first, I wonder why YouTube allowed these networks
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.880]   to exist in the beginning.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.320]   But YouTube is still going to get-- they still take their--
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:53.680]   what is it?
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.560]   45% cut no matter what.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.680]   So they don't care if a network comes in
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.160]   and wants to cut you out some more.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:04.400]   It takes the pressure off them to have to offer technical support,
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.960]   to have to offer any kind of support.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.160]   They can say, hey, you talk to your network.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.560]   And then they'll have a rep who will handle the whole network.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.760]   So I think that's where they're moving to,
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.400]   where their hands off is like, hey, a universal made a deal
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.160]   with maker or whoever it is, that's their business.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.560]   You deal with them.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.360]   And I think that's just the wrong direction.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.920]   Because I think the whole beauty of YouTube
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.680]   is the democratizing nature of it that gives anybody
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.440]   a kid in Hungary who wants to do a show,
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:35.600]   a chance to do a show, and get global distribution.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.560]   But if he's at a major disadvantage,
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.320]   because big companies can stomp on him,
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.600]   I don't think that--
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:46.880]   What proportion of your views comes on YouTube?
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.480]   It's not hugely significant.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:52.800]   That one that they pulled down had about 5,000 views.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.240]   But this week in YouTube is going to be a little more
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:55.800]   significant.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.080]   It's a show about YouTube.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.760]   And not being able to post those shows on YouTube
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.000]   hurts us pretty badly.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.600]   I think it also should make people question whether YouTube
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.880]   should be part of their distribution strategy.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.440]   Yeah, the nice thing about YouTube
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.720]   is you get free bandwidth.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.120]   But if you get pulled off all the time,
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.760]   this is not a good way for you to consider--
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.600]   maybe you should look at Vimeo or somebody else.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.680]   That's going to hurt you.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.240]   I think that hurts YouTube.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.080]   Yeah, it does.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.560]   It'll be interesting to see what they say when
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:28.640]   you speak to your contact.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.680]   It sounds like you need to talk to a human.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.120]   Yeah, I mean, emails him already.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.480]   So he'll get back to us.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.960]   I have a Python script that can interact with him beautifully.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:41.720]   And I've been writing him.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.960]   Just looking-- if there's anything else--
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.680]   There's an amazing-- have you seen the kids
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.480]   guide to the internet, Leo?
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.800]   No, I haven't.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.560]   Oh, you've watched.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.560]   It's under other.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.800]   Others were all the best stuff is.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.840]   All right.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.880]   This was made-- I thought this had to be a joke.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.240]   Lauren Weinstein said no, it's not.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.440]   Because he looked at all the stuff.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.160]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.200]   It's old, though, right?
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:04.680]   This is not--
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.200]   It's old.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.840]   It's 90s.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.160]   Just the VCR tracking before a clear as picture.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.960]   I thought they would think that might be a giveaway.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.960]   That was a hack.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.800]   That's a bad sign.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.720]   It is, man.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.440]   It just took a lot of work.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.880]   A hometown television presents.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.360]   Why do you want to see the beginning?
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.600]   I always like to--
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.800]   I wonder, I might have worked on this.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.120]   I don't know.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   We are.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.040]   You could have been dead.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.480]   We're writing on the internet.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.640]   Cyber space.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.040]   Sex free.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.440]   Hello virtual reality.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.800]   Interactive appetite searching for a website.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.960]   A window to the world got to get online.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.960]   Take a look at it.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.960]   Come on, Kevin.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.460]   Sit.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.240]   You go and surf and on the internet.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.440]   I've done shows like this.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.680]   I got to tell you.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.520]   Is that the prisoner for--
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.440]   It's us again.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.640]   This is my brother Peter.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.240]   I mean, wait a minute.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.400]   Have we met you before?
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:55.840]   Hey, there.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.720]   It's us again.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.320]   Huh?
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:58.760]   OK.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.760]   We're the millers.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.120]   By the way, she's 48 now.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.720]   And--
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.240]   OK.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.240]   Andrew and Lisa, the--
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.240]   The internet ruled their life.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.640]   And I thought you might want to come along.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.840]   She's a little bit of a drinking problem.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.840]   But otherwise--
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.840]   --when we installed internet access on our computer,
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.360]   I got the whole family involved.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:14.840]   It's true.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.760]   Everybody had their own tasks to do.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.400]   It was a lot of work, but it was really worth it.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.080]   Now that I've gone along the internet,
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:24.160]   I'd rather be on my computer than doing just about anything.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.200]   It's really cool.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.320]   Well, the internet, we've got a whole world of--
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.400]   You know, there's naked ladies on it.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:33.040]   So I guess this is a story of how it changed our lives.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.640]   Maybe we'll use to it.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.680]   But the kids died to the internet.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:37.680]   Take a spin.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.440]   Now you're in with the tap news set.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.240]   You go and search for the internet.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.480]   Who is this aim dad?
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.680]   As Rich told you, we installed the internet
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.520]   on our computer just a short time ago.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.520]   What a hug to you.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.320]   He installed the internet on our computer.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.760]   That's a short time ago.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.320]   And already is laden with viruses, spyware, and malware.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.360]   And dad's getting the Viagra spin every minute.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.680]   I'd like to tell you the typical computer games
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.320]   that all the kids enjoy, but their curiosity for learning
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.280]   has skyrocketed.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:09.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.280]   Peter is constantly put in for--
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.400]   Dad, I'd like to go into the room, my bedroom now,
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.840]   and learn some more on the internet if you don't mind.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.760]   And dad, as he is my favorite subject.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.640]   Yeah, he's surfing.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.120]   That's a round of low.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.480]   Not to mention the improvement in Peter's grades.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.040]   And dashes, too.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.680]   Having the internet in our home has had a great impact
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.680]   on our lives.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.480]   Rita keeps up with the stock market and our investments.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.760]   And I'm able to pay the bills and--
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.520]   He has a few secret cyber affairs on the side.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.000]   Dad's been very busy.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.840]   He says he has an internet nickname, Carlos Danger.
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.240]   Look at the Netscape browser.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.360]   I love the navigator.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.720]   The next thing you'll type will be specific.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.840]   Directing you to a particular website.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.480]   MTV a co-producer of this, by the way.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.960]   Or you could just surf the net using a search engine
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.160]   to help you locate information.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:56.920]   What search engine?
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:57.920]   Online MTV.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.480]   I have the World Wide Web to search the archives of the Smithsonian
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.280]   Museum a few weeks ago.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.640]   I also had to do a homework assignment about the Wright
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.760]   Brothers for a history assignment.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.320]   Can you show us what you found?
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.120]   Sure.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.400]   Whoa.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.160]   That Smithsonian really does the state of the art, huh?
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.080]   The sad thing is we all remember exactly when the internet
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.240]   looked just like that.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.200]   Street view.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.200]   Street view.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.040]   By the way, I do believe you had to set up Windows
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.840]   to do that waving window cursor.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.280]   That wasn't the default.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.280]   That's the worst.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.480]   It was an hourglass, right?
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:39.120]   You had to turn it into the waving, yeah.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.480]   Oh, boy.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.480]   Wow.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.920]   We just figured it out.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.520]   Look, I'll show you.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:50.600]   All you have to do is go to playboy.com.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.360]   Wow.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.720]   This is great.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.000]   Is this amazing?
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Netscape.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.900]   The color-- oh, remember the color wizard?
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.200]   I remember that.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.200]   Oh, wow.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:06.400]   Oh, all about rainbows.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:12.040]   You know, seriously, I worked on shows--
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.560]   the show is very much like this.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:19.280]   I did a show, a PBS show, called The Internet.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.600]   And I was pretty much this.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.760]   Does it existly?
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.520]   Oh, have you shown it?
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.960]   No, I hope not.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.720]   Oh, please.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.040]   I hope it's long gone.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.080]   I certainly don't have a copy, but I bet you somebody
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.880]   in the chat room will find it and humiliate me in public.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.280]   Oh, Lord.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.120]   I remember Gina Smith did one where she was driving in a
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.800]   convertible down the information super high.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:48.400]   I don't know if there was singing involved.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.480]   There's Al Gore over there.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:56.320]   Look, there's my imaginary family.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:56.760]   All right.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.160]   I think we have to be finally found our replacement theme
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.360]   song for this week in Google.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.360]   Hey, maybe you know what?
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.600]   Let's listen to that.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:02.920]   You know what?
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:06.000]   Can we use that, you think, with impunity?
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.920]   You think hometown productions would mind?
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.400]   We're riding on the internet.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.560]   Cyber space.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.920]   Sex free.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.080]   Hello, virtual reality.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.080]   Cyber space.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.880]   It says what we wanted to say.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.280]   Cyber space sets us free.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.320]   We're about to appetite searching for a website.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.480]   A window to the world got to get online.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.840]   Take the spin now and with the techno set.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.400]   You're going surfing on the internet.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.000]   Hi, can we just steal that?
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   And--
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.160]   Well, you find out who has the rights when you first
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.360]   is on YouTube, aren't you?
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.800]   Perfect.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.560]   On the internet.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.760]   Indeed, that was such a catchy song.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.960]   I love that video.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.200]   Now you know all about the internet and how it works.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:45.840]   Hello, everybody.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.120]   You're watching the best of this week in Google.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.600]   I'm Father Leo Lord of the Church of the Red Hot Holy
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.920]   Peppers.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.840]   How do you like that?
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.960]   We couldn't find my Santa hat.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.760]   So this is Google's slanket.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.280]   I do have Santa on my shirt.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.920]   And this is festive.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:12.040]   All right.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.760]   If you've watched the show all year long,
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:19.040]   you know that Jeff Jarvis is a little upset.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.920]   He's upset all the time.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.080]   But he was particularly upset about the fact
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:28.360]   that Verizon would not allow him to use his LTE-based Nexus
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.760]   7 on their network.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.120]   My mistake.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.120]   I didn't know this.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.160]   And I asked him about it.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.480]   Hilarity ensued.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.920]   Hey, speaking of which, did you get your Nexus 7 LTE version yet?
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.080]   No!
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.720]   No!
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.320]   I want it.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.640]   It's for sale every day, every day of day.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:51.400]   I search for Nexus 7 LTE.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.360]   Can't you tell me when?
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.360]   I think I'll lay out.
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.440]   Get it?
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:54.800]   No.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.960]   And now here's the latest in dignity.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.640]   It's for sale in Germany, the UK.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:01.200]   France.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.800]   I'm telling you, France gets it first.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.400]   What the hell's wrong here?
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.800]   How dare they?
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.800]   They have Frenches.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.360]   That's tough.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.160]   Jeff, you have friends in Germany, though.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.160]   Just get them to send you one.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.560]   No, because it's different frequencies.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.600]   You don't want the two.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:16.080]   Oh, right.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.440]   You want the US version.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.440]   Good point.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:21.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:21.520]   Nice job, though.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.120]   We don't get stuff all the time in Canada.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:23.920]   I'm pretty used to it.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.280]   Right.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:24.760]   You are.
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:25.280]   You are.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.440]   There's no point in getting a Canadian Ryle.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:30.160]   Yeah, that's the nice Canadian thing.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:30.920]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.600]   Screw us.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.640]   We'll apologize for it.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.400]   Sure.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.560]   Send it to us a couple years later.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.960]   We're not like that down here, Ringram.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.240]   I want my Nexus 7 LTE.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.560]   You really have to adopt the American sense of entitlement
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.400]   that we're going to be on twig.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.040]   That's right.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.440]   Get with it.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.160]   Where's my Chromecast?
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.160]   I had this vision today that somebody with a sense of humor
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.120]   at Google would put it on for sale right now during the show,
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.360]   and I'd have to order it during the show.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.200]   I'll order it for you.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.360]   I've gotten very good at talking and ordering crap
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.360]   at the same time.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:02.680]   It's amazing.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.760]   I can get stuff like that.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:11.200]   And this week, I got some good news, I thought.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.880]   I got my Nexus 7 LTE.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.560]   I've been waiting for it for weeks.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.880]   I've been waiting for it to go on sale.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.720]   I finally got to order it last week.
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.240]   It didn't arrive before the show, and here it came on Friday.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.240]   And I was so happy--
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.400]   And all your dreams came true.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.960]   Right, Jeff?
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.280]   No.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.400]   Here we go.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.720]   Watch out.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.280]   All your dreams, teacher Jeff, you waited so long for this tablet
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.080]   to buy it to get-- you have it now.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:36.480]   This is it.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.040]   This is what you've been hoping for.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.560]   I know you're a picky guy.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.080]   You have very high standards.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.240]   You have very specific things that you want.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.880]   And now it's in your hands.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.040]   What's wrong?
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.800]   How's that LTE working?
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   Yo.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:58.240]   So, so, I am going psychotic on Verizon,
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:03.360]   because Verizon will not hook up my Nexus LTE.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.840]   I remember what it was announced months ago.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.080]   Google said it was going to work.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.560]   The first device that was going to work on AT&T
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.840]   will end Verizon on LTE.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.080]   Wow, there was a slide.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.400]   See, incoming weeks.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.920]   Verizon right there.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.800]   And so I walk into the Verizon store on Saturday,
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.600]   and I say, hi, I want to give you more money.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:27.680]   I want to add this to my shared data collection there, right?
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:33.320]   Well, one snottie little smartass, quirk.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.440]   I came over and said, you can't.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:34.800]   You can't.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.160]   There's work.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.000]   You can't.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.680]   I said, no, no, no, you don't understand.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.720]   I looked up things on the line.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.600]   I said, look, Verizon LTE, this device.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.080]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.040]   So I got a nice clerk.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.240]   And I got a manager over as I glared at the other clerk.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:50.840]   And they tried to put in the IMEI for this device.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:51.960]   Wouldn't take it.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.680]   Wouldn't take it.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.000]   All around.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.640]   So they said, well, maybe it's just not ready yet.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.520]   They said, oh, they've had months, how ridiculous.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.880]   But this happened with my Chromebook Pixel, too,
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.520]   where I went in and tried to get the deal, the $10 a month
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.720]   deal that they had.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.320]   And it wasn't in a skew in there.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.680]   And I figured, OK, so they messed up big old Verizon
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.560]   while they're not rich enough, but fine.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.320]   I have them call Verizon HQ.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.120]   They try to do something.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.080]   They can't do it either.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.640]   I figure, OK, this is frustrating.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.480]   I'm mad that I leave calmly.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.120]   I leave with smile on my face.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.280]   I say, thanks for your help, guys.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.200]   I get back home.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.560]   And of course, I go to Twitter.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.720]   And I say, oh, busy W support.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.640]   I need your help again.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.880]   Can you get my device hooked up?
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.000]   Because I want to be a happy customer.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.840]   I wait until days.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.600]   And then I get this response.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.920]   So you can put it back up again, Chad.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.760]   I'm excited.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:45.400]   You got your Nexus 7, but not all LTE tablets are created equal.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:53.040]   It's not part of our lineup and can't be activated.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:56.800]   I'm like, there, like the turd it is.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.960]   So I have psychotic fits all around.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:05.240]   And then people remind me that Verizon got the LTE spectrum,
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.080]   C block, as it's called, a block C, rather,
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:12.040]   in the 700 megahertz band, on the condition, which Google
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:16.880]   managed to push into the spectrum auction, the condition
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.120]   that it be open.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.320]   And Chad, if you could go back to-- and you
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:25.040]   see that first block quote-- that it must be offered--
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.040]   that no licensee quote, shall--
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.240]   sorry, licensees quote, shall not deny, limit, or restrict
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.320]   the ability of their customers to use the devices and
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:40.640]   applications of their choice on the licensees C block network.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.560]   Except in so far as there's technical problems or other
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:44.960]   regulations or statutes, right?
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:45.600]   No problem.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.440]   Well, this is a device that has been approved by the FCC.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.000]   This is an LTE device.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.680]   It works on AT&T.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.360]   It works on T-Mobile.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.560]   And I have a SIM for T-Mobile, by the way, because it came
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:59.600]   with the device.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.280]   Nice deal.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.000]   One month free.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:01.840]   Thank you very much.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.720]   Everybody is saying, why should you talk up to your mobile?
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:08.120]   Well, because, number one, I have a shared device account on
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:08.600]   Verizon.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.520]   Thanks to my Chromebook Pixel, Google, how could you have
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:14.440]   made this a Verizon-only device?
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.560]   My family has their iPads on Verizon.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.600]   What can I do about that?
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.120]   And so it's going to cost me more if I use this on T-Mobile
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:23.680]   or something else.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.640]   And plus, there's just the justice of it.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.120]   The justice of it.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:34.760]   My God, Verizon, you will connect my Nexus 7.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.400]   So I go around-- I'm about to end this year.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.840]   I go around and around and around.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:38.880]   I go a lot on Twitter.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.880]   A lot of folks come in.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:43.000]   Huge response on Google+ and on Twitter to this.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.840]   People saying, why don't you learn Verizon sucks.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:46.680]   Verizon's awful.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.400]   Go to T-Mobile.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.120]   T-Mobile's better.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.480]   And I keep on saying, no, I'm going to force them into it.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.840]   And the nice folks at Free Press sent me their complaints
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:57.720]   to the FCC more than a year ago.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.360]   In last July, the FCC had a consent decree against Verizon
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.840]   for $1.25 million because Verizon at the time
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.360]   was forcing Google to take applications that
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.480]   had tethering out of the Play Store.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.680]   That's not open.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.680]   And so Verizon was told, you have to do this.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:14.640]   And Verizon said, oh, yes, we will.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.000]   And when earlier when Google had complained about Verizon's
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   behavior and said a very tough letter,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.400]   Verizon got back and said, oh, Google, how can you?
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.200]   You're just being catty?
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:22.880]   No, no, no.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.840]   We are going to be open.
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:24.960]   Of course, we're going to be open.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.560]   Look at all the ways we're going to be open.
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.020]   I tried to find that full post, which
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.000]   has been quoted on our as technical, but of course,
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.520]   Verizon has erased it.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:36.000]   So this goes on and on and on and around and around and around.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.360]   I then get another tweet from Verizon saying once again,
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.840]   or the technical equivalent thereof.
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:45.480]   And so today I wrote and sent a formal complaint
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.720]   to the Federal Communications Commission Enforcement Division
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.920]   saying, go after them bastards.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.360]   And so I'm not going to rest.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.160]   I am not going to rest until we bring Verizon to justice.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:00.560]   Because this was the whole point of the notion of openness
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.400]   is that we have the choice.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.040]   We have the control.
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:08.200]   And Verizon, take that.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.360]   Good for you, Jeff.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.000]   Good for you.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.240]   I love that you wrote a formal letter or a complaint.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.120]   Because you can go back and forth on Twitter,
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.760]   but that's-- it's 2013 to El Hell.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.360]   I want to rename it Del Hell to Tell Hell now.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.120]   And it's just absolutely ridiculous.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.760]   It's galling in the attitude they have.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.880]   So Verizon PR didn't respond to me for days.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.520]   And then finally, after I posted it, they came back and they
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:36.680]   sent me a link to their certification requirements.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:40.560]   But the problem is, if I go by a phone here that's unlocked
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:45.880]   and on GSM and I go to Europe, all I have to do is put a CIM in it.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.640]   And it works.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:47.800]   There's no certification.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:48.360]   There's no this.
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:48.920]   There's no that.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:53.200]   I've taken my Nexus 40 Europe before it was sold there and no
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:53.720]   problem.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.240]   It just works.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:58.600]   That's the point of having an open standard, which is what
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:00.440]   GSM and LTE are.
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:01.040]   Exactly.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.320]   And it's on Twitter, have said.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.240]   That's exactly right, Jeff.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.240]   I mean, these are protocols.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:08.280]   I mean, all you have to say is, I adhere to the protocol.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:10.360]   So I've enabled the chip in my device.
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:13.680]   It adheres to whatever the standard is, whatever the protocol
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.880]   is, and it should just work.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.120]   That's why these things exist.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.400]   That's the whole reason people do these things.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.840]   They come up with these protocols.
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:24.000]   And there should be no question about it.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.160]   And I think that's why T-Mobile's whole value prop, right?
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.440]   Is bring your own device.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.680]   Just come and it should work.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.720]   And you use us.
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.440]   And don't worry about Verizon and all this crap that they send
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:34.040]   your way.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.600]   The other thing is, I wonder how much of this
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:39.640]   is because they don't have crap where I loaded on the Nexus 7.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.160]   I wonder if they're trying to hold up to see if they can--
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.920]   Well, that'll leave that in.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.480]   The second tweet I got from Verizon support, when they said,
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:48.120]   no, no, no, it can't be activated, they said,
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.960]   here's a link to all the nice things we'll sell you,
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.680]   instead of the thing that you brought.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.920]   So that's consumer fraud.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:54.880]   That's bait and switch.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.680]   That's a big problem.
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:57.560]   And by the way, when they say it can't be activated,
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.440]   that is a bald-faced live, Verizon.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.120]   Because I did take the sim out of my Chromebook Pixel.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:06.880]   I did put it into the Nexus 7 LTE.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:07.680]   And guess what?
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.160]   Bo-mo, it does work.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.360]   So it's not a question of can't work.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.560]   Can't work on the network.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:16.160]   It's a question of, "Rison won't let it work on the network."
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:18.800]   And this is Verizon's control.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.200]   It looks like Verizon posted a statement about this today.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.640]   Virgil just posted it in the chat room.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.440]   I put it under your rant on the rundown of Jeff.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.360]   "Staven on Verizon Wireless Device Certification.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:31.840]   The Google Nexus 7 is not yet a Verizon 4G LTE certified
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.120]   device, though it entered our process in August.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.160]   We expect it to be certified shortly.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.240]   Once the device is certified, we will work with Google
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:42.160]   to enable the device to be activated on our 4G LTE network.
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:44.960]   That's such a bald-faced live out there.
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.760]   Because, again, it already works on the network.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:48.840]   Because that's the standard.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:50.680]   As Aaron just said, you can put it in there.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:55.160]   The Verizon won't do is give me a sim and put it on my account.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.720]   So there's no matter a certification here.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.440]   That's horse poopy.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.600]   Yeah, they're saying that their testing protocol
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.440]   is the most rigorous of any carrier.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:06.040]   And it's focused on guarding the safety and security
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:07.920]   of their network.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.080]   Done by third-party labs.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.280]   It takes four to six weeks.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:14.560]   Interesting, interesting, pathicance.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:15.800]   Four to six weeks.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:18.000]   So what did you guys say about it on Elle and Android
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.240]   last night?
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:23.080]   Well, we were just relishing the thought of your rant today.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.720]   I was promoting through it because I said,
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.800]   you get to hear about Jeff's healthy experience.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.800]   And we pulled up your post on the show.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.440]   I thought I was rather reasonable.
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.480]   I kept a less than usual pink face.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.000]   Is it a little matter of space?
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:39.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:40.920]   That was a good one.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.920]   It was a good one.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.040]   I love the U file, the formal complaint with the FCC.
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.720]   And I bet that this statement by Verizon,
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.280]   it looks like it was published today at 18.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.440]   It doesn't have a time.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.160]   It's absolutely prompted by that.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:53.360]   Did you guys look at the certification process?
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.160]   Oh, really?
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.000]   Take a look at it.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.320]   It's ridiculous.
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:57.160]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:58.680]   I mean, so they have--
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:01.400]   if you go to that link that you just put in there, Gina,
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:03.760]   and then click on and go down under the certification
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.360]   process, yeah, go to that.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.400]   Open Networked Up Horizon.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.320]   And then under the little wrench there,
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:11.600]   there's certification process.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.200]   That's what I'm looking at right now.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:13.720]   Yes.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:14.520]   View our certification process.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.640]   So they've got four steps, right?
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.680]   Review, pre-certification, which is conditional.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.760]   What does that mean?
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:23.480]   Then they've got certification, which they test rigorously
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:24.200]   in our labs.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.600]   But they say they can test the device live over our network
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:27.560]   and see if it works.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:28.720]   And then look at the last one.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.960]   This is what I was getting at before.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.040]   Go to market.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.960]   Why do they need go to market in a technical certification?
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.680]   We build external and internal awareness of your device
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.400]   to joint public relations.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.960]   In the use of the Verizon certification logo,
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:43.960]   training our sales teams and listing your device
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:44.760]   in the device showcase.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.560]   So what they're saying is all of that stuff
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.000]   has to be done before it's technically certified.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.600]   We have to train our sales teams and do all this stuff.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:52.880]   I mean, that's a bunch--
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:55.080]   I understand one, two, and three.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.880]   I understand review, pre-certification, and certification.
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:00.240]   I don't understand why they need go to market to say
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.240]   that this is technically certified.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.080]   But what about people on me?
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:05.640]   If it's a CDMA device, which is what Verizon normally is,
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:06.920]   of course, then it has--
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.280]   someone explained to me on Twitter--
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:09.480]   I'm sorry, I can't give you credit,
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:11.720]   because I can't remember your silly Twitteric handle--
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:14.360]   that has root access to the device.
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:15.640]   It is a security matter.
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.360]   But as you said a few minutes ago, Aaron, this is a protocol.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:20.640]   This is an open, standard protocol.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:23.800]   So I could go make a phone at my workbench.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.560]   And as long as I do it to the standards,
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.400]   and I put a SIM in, it's going to work.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:29.360]   Verizon can't stop that.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.520]   And that's the irony of all this.
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.120]   Verizon doesn't understand that they've
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.280]   entered an open world.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.360]   This is the first time they've really worked.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.960]   This is the first time they've faced, I think,
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:43.040]   an open GSM device on their network.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.280]   And this was the condition.
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.680]   I can't repeat this often enough.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.880]   This was the condition of them winning the auction
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:54.720]   to get the LTE 700 megahertz C-block spectrum that they got.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:57.640]   And remember that Google entered into that auction
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:00.600]   not to win, but to put the pressure on,
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:04.520]   to have the assurance that open devices would work.
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:05.120]   Why?
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:09.240]   Because clearly, Google saw this very day coming.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.400]   And here's the day here.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.040]   Now mind you, there's another issue here.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:14.120]   Google has been silent about this.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.520]   I'm a little upset about that.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.920]   I've emailed Google PR.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:19.960]   But of course, the problem is that Google, love them dearly,
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.440]   have a show about them, write a book about them.
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.400]   The one time they get in trouble is when they do deals
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.960]   with telecos.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.960]   And they've done devils deals with Verizon.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.280]   And I'm sure they don't want to piss off Verizon too much.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:32.200]   But what's happening here is Verizon and Google
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:36.200]   are tweaking each other, and we are stuck in the middle.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:36.640]   Yep.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.840]   It puts the users in the pinch.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:41.600]   Absolutely.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:41.920]   So--
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:44.880]   Well, can you-- you could pop in the T-Mobile SIM
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.280]   and get your first free month.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.360]   And in theory, if what Verizon is saying is true,
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:50.120]   which I know you don't think it is true.
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:52.560]   But while you wait for a response to your official complaint
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:55.200]   and while Verizon reportedly goes through its certification
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:57.960]   process, maybe by the time your free month is up,
[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.760]   it'll work.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.260]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:01.440]   And I thought of doing that.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.240]   But right now, I'm trying to stay true to the principle of this.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.520]   I'm just going to keep on forcing Verizon
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:10.280]   to do what they're supposed to do under the law.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.240]   And other people have said, well, if you just take a SIM
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.680]   out of something else, but in there, it works.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.280]   Well, it's fine.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.440]   But then my--
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.720]   Then you don't have a SIM in your car pixel.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.520]   Now, they also-- the nice guy in the store
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.120]   said, well, the only workaround I can really do
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.600]   is I could try to get a SIM going and a phone and put it in there.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.720]   But then the problem is that in the billing system,
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.280]   I'd be paying $40 a month and send $10 a month for adding it.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.720]   Right.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.800]   So this is all about business conditions and Verizon control.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:42.520]   It has nothing, nothing, nothing to do with technology,
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.480]   certification, any of that.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.680]   AT&T and T-Mobile are not idiots.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.560]   They have much experience with GSM, much more than Verizon.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.000]   They are happily running this.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.760]   Now, Google, by the way, when it came out with this device a week
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.160]   ago, they sold it with a T-Mobile SIM.
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.920]   That lasted about a week.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.320]   And then they took it down for a day, or for part of a day,
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.640]   and everybody got suspicious.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.000]   Then it went back up.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.080]   And a bit later, they offer it now without a SIM, with the T-Mobile
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.960]   SIM, or with an AT&T SIM.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.680]   But notice, not a Verizon SIM.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.560]   So here I am.
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.640]   I'm trying to give Verizon business that Google is promoting
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.400]   to go to others.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.920]   I'm trying to give them money.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.240]   And the only thing that's happening here
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.760]   is in some freakish, horrible, anal control
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.960]   game that this corporation has to not let customers ever win
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.960]   anything.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.000]   Verizon, the truly evil company, the company that
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.640]   hands over all your metadata, the company-- that, by the way,
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.120]   we found out this week from the Guardian--
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.920]   phone companies never even tried to protest
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.840]   handing all of our data over to the NSA.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.840]   A Verizon executive this week also called Google and Microsoft
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.520]   and Yahoo and Company grandstanders
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.480]   for fighting the NSA for our rights.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.280]   This is a company that does not give a damn about us
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.040]   as customers.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.520]   This is a company that still thinks it's
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.720]   mobbell and has a monopoly and can tell us to go below.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.120]   Well, guess what, people?
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.120]   We've got Twitter.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.360]   We've got Facebook.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.600]   We've got fax machines.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.440]   Yeah, I had to fax it to the FCC.
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.440]   And we are not going to rest.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.840]   Good for you, Jeff.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.480]   Best of right there.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.360]   Yeah, all right.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:15.880]   All right.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.680]   That's what anything else to say about that, Rant?
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.640]   Anything in the chat room going?
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.280]   Well, I think the only thing in the chat room
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.680]   that I notice is you were talking
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.840]   about the only legal out they have from what you were saying
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.520]   is that there is a clause in there that says,
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.000]   if a device could harm the network, then they can--
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.120]   So then that's their claim.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:34.600]   But they're going to have to--
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.040]   Then there's a burden of proof on that.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:36.560]   Yes.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:37.360]   There's a burden of proof to show it
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.400]   harms the network.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.760]   And it's not harm in AT&T.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.800]   It's not harm in T-Mobile.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.120]   It's not harm in GSM networks around the world,
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.200]   where, of course, it was available before it was available
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.200]   here, which was the subject of another RantY France had it.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.440]   We didn't-- maybe I now understand why.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.000]   Maybe this has been a behind the scenes thing.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:52.520]   I don't know.
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.680]   I am eager for Google to say something about this in public.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.760]   I've gone to their public policy people
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.400]   and to their PR people.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.760]   And we'll see what comes out.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.040]   And I'll report all of this.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.560]   Who's for you?
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:06.760]   Good for you.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.080]   Yeah, forget that T-Mobile sim.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:11.120]   Stick to the principal.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.680]   But the screw is to him.
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.480]   Has anyone else-- have you found anyone else on Twitter
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.600]   or just sort of out and about complaining about the same thing?
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.760]   Have you even just sort of get--
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:24.760]   I found a lot of people who did a few things.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.720]   Some who just took a step from another device.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.960]   And before I did it showed to me that, no, Jeff, this works.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.840]   And they demonstrated it to me very quickly.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:32.680]   So that--
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:35.720]   In fact, while I was in the Verizon store,
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.080]   I went to Twitter immediately.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.920]   While I was there, and I said, I'm having this problem.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.440]   I may know anything.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.520]   And immediately someone came back and said, well, I just
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.080]   got the device.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.600]   I took the sim out of another device, put it in there.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.560]   Oh, it works, Jeff.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:45.840]   So I got to be able to state a Verizon.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.160]   No, this works on your network.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.640]   Here's the proof.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.280]   That's amazing.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.480]   That's the beauty of all this.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:56.680]   Which also, by the way, always comes back to the power of Leo,
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.520]   to the power of Twitter.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.040]   Absolutely.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.840]   Because I don't know how those kind of followers there,
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.200]   except for this wonderful show and network.
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:02.840]   So that worked.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.840]   A lot of people on Google+ have been saying,
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.640]   I was thinking about getting put on Verizon.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.200]   I'm not doing that now.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.720]   And a lot of surprising number of people, Gina.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.880]   This is a trend that I haven't seen.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.680]   Leo's been talking about how T-Mobile's pretty good.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.840]   T-Mobile's going to run here.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.640]   You know, T-Mobile's fine.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.160]   And what was happening on Google+ is
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:24.840]   the number of people who said to heck with Verizon,
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.920]   not just because you have the sim, T-Mobile's actually good.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.440]   They have unlimited data plans.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.320]   They care about people.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.360]   I have a good customer service.
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:36.280]   It was like 90% in favor of T-Mobile in this whole discussion.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.880]   10% of T-Mobile will complain.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.120]   Whereas the opposite.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:42.400]   Whereas 95% complain about Verizon and a few hangouts
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.760]   trying to defend Verizon.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.280]   Hmm.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.760]   So were people saying, I'm just going to switch?
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.320]   Because I can't.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.560]   I don't want to deal with these people at all.
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.120]   Because we should do mobile in general.
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.000]   Good.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.040]   And that's where-- I mean, you've got to follow the money, right?
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.360]   I mean, that's what's going to eventually get Verizon
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.400]   to take notice of this, is if people start leaving.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:02.120]   I think that, thank goodness for Jeff in his reach, right?
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:06.440]   His virtual reach out through the ether, so to speak,
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:06.880]   to people.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.520]   Because if it were just like a normal person that
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:12.040]   had this problem, I mean, no one's going to notice, right?
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.240]   So thank goodness Jeff's making it.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.640]   Because let's face it, I mean, how many customers
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.600]   are actually trying to do this?
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.440]   Probably not that many at this point, right?
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.360]   So it's not like someone pulled one of Verizon's key devices
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.880]   and says, hey, this doesn't work.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.080]   And it affects 80 million people, right?
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.120]   So this probably affects a small subset.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.880]   And it's the small minority that doesn't have any voice,
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.520]   really.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.720]   So thank goodness for Jeff.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.960]   Thank goodness you're raising this up.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.480]   It's a very small concern.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.120]   It's a very small audience for this.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.960]   But yeah, there is some level of responsibility
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.760]   that you have this platform like Quig
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.640]   and the blogs and such that rather than just surrendering.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.080]   Because the people said, I'll just give up.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.240]   And I said, no, I can't.
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.600]   I won't do that.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.760]   So on we go.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.280]   All right, I need a break.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.560]   I need something happy.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.800]   I need positive change in the world.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:04.400]   I wonder, has anybody ever used the made-it button?
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.760]   Who uses that except lonely guys
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:10.200]   hoping that Jennifer will answer?
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:14.720]   It's kind of like chat roulette for the Kindle.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.040]   I'm so glad I'm not the CSR.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.640]   I'm so glad I'm not the CSR.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.960]   It's the human clippy.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.000]   It is the human clippy.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.960]   I think Kevin Rose did it and screencast it
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.880]   just to see what it was like.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.880]   He didn't know.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:28.720]   He didn't know.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.760]   How do I get to settings?
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.720]   And it was a dude who looked nothing like Jennifer.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.480]   That's the problem.
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.480]   By the way, her name is Amy.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.560]   We've been corrected.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.080]   Amy, sorry.
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:36.400]   Kevin Rose Mayday.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.480]   That's good.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.800]   I thought he tweeted it a while back.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.080]   He said, it's amazing.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.600]   Man Mayday is a name.
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:45.760]   He's genius, I agree.
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:50.040]   But if your product needs that, that tells you something.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.720]   Yeah, I'm sure they debated that.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:55.560]   Should we-- yeah, see, he got a dude named Anthony.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:59.640]   And Anthony is not sitting in a futuristic space.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.920]   He's sitting in a call center and you
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.920]   can see the ducting on the roof.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.440]   It's not nearly so sexy.
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:05.560]   I'm back cloth, wouldn't you?
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.480]   Hey, Anthony.
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.800]   Yo, let's play the video.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.760]   You want to watch?
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:11.880]   Oh, thank you so much.
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.560]   And how are you doing today, Kevin?
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.160]   I'm just looking to get into settings.
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:16.240]   Can you show me how to do that?
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.560]   I'm going down from the time.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.400]   Yeah, I see that line.
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.120]   Wipe down.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.560]   It's just like a regular tech support.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:22.280]   Great.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.720]   Thank you.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.040]   You're very welcome.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.360]   Aw.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.360]   Aw.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:30.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.400]   It would be better if Kevin weren't
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.000]   looking at the latest issue of Men's Health magazine
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.240]   during the call, I must say.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.000]   I like that little flavor to that.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.280]   Aw.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.280]   Absolutely.
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.360]   That's what you're going to get.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:46.240]   Let's be honest.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.200]   You're not getting Amy.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.600]   It's a certification sound.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.560]   Amy is not working at Amazon's call center.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.960]   Having an Anthony sit in a tree.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:53.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:54.960]   Aw.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.960]   Aw.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.000]   Sorry.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.920]   Sorry.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.000]   Hope you're enjoying our best of this week in Google.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.560]   We'll be back next week with a fresh show with Jeff.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.480]   And I think Jean will be back for--
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.160]   we missed her all December.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:11.480]   She should be back January 1.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.560]   Meanwhile, we're looking back at some of the best
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.680]   of this week in Google for 2013.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:20.160]   Remember when Google had that crazy idea of internet
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.360]   with balloons?
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.120]   Let's take a look at Project Loon.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.480]   Project Loon.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:28.400]   On Sunday, we had Trey Radcliffe on Twit
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.120]   because he was one of a couple of people.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:36.840]   It was Stephen Levy of Wired and Trey Radcliffe,
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.760]   who were invited to go up in the helicopter
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:43.240]   and watch the launch of the first Google Project Loon
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.320]   balloons.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.440]   There they go up in the sky.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:49.240]   These balloons, eventually Google hopes-- this
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.040]   is a Project X plan--
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:55.920]   to provide 3G quality internet access to the entire globe
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:59.040]   from hundreds of these balloons floating 10 miles up
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:02.200]   in the stratosphere, well above the commercial aviation
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.760]   traffic.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.840]   One of the advantages of being so high
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.760]   is they can tune these balloons.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.480]   There's two chambers.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:11.280]   A helium chamber and an air chamber.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.640]   And they can tune these balloons remotely
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.440]   to make them go up or down to catch the particular jet
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:20.360]   stream flow to move these balloons to kind of keep them
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:23.000]   in position.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.200]   Are there humans actually making them go up and down
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.320]   to catch the right air flow?
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.280]   Ah, that's a good question.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.480]   Or is it just autonomous?
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:29.720]   Of course not.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.680]   An algorithm does that.
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.840]   It's a-- well, only if you consider
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.560]   a Python program a human.
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:38.120]   Yeah, so there's a dot pi.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.320]   It's a fly fly.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.120]   What is a dot pi?
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.280]   Are they pulling the signal from cell towers on the ground?
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.240]   They're not cell towers specifically.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.200]   There are towers designed to do this from cities.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.680]   Oh, that was going to say, if you let airline passengers
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.680]   know that balloons can do this, but they can't, man.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.520]   They just--
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.960]   It's going to destroy the navigation.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.280]   We're going down.
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:09:59.440]   Look at that.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.640]   These are the-- pause that, Chad.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.520]   Pause that.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.600]   These are what you get.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.120]   It looks like a red Tootsie Pop antenna.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.480]   This is what people in New Zealand who
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.640]   are the first beta testers of this will get.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:14.040]   Somebody said it kind of looks like a place pin on Google Maps.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:14.520]   No, it does.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.520]   You think that's attention?
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:18.000]   It's a 3G level, at best, I think, right?
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:18.720]   Well, I don't know.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.200]   Trey was-- no, Trey said he was really impressed.
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.960]   It was very fast.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:23.440]   Really?
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:23.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.680]   So I don't know.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.160]   It's from the whole dot expectations.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.280]   I don't know.
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.120]   It is pretty far.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.480]   I mean, 10 miles is a long way away,
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.000]   and the latency is going to be horrendous.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.520]   Every time I see photos in New Zealand,
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.920]   I always just want to move there.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.120]   I want to be a hobbit when I see photos in New Zealand.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:39.680]   Yeah, but not only--
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.840]   --when I see a balloon test photos and the videos
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.160]   are just something you can be looking.
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.440]   It's very-- what's interesting in--
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.600]   I don't know if it's intentional.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.000]   It's very near Queenstown, where Trey lives.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.400]   So he and his family drove over and got in the helicopter.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.160]   And watches made some great movies.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.920]   You can catch those on StuckInCustoms.com.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.520]   Jeff Levy's writing articles for Wired about this as well.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.260]   Gah.
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.480]   Better latency than a satellite.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.120]   That's a good point.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.680]   I mean, the satellite has bad latency,
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.920]   but it won't be as bad as that.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.120]   The point of this is to get to remote areas
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.080]   that just simply can't be covered.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.520]   And they have enough balloons up there.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:19.560]   You can cover-- if we can bring internet connectivity
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.000]   to huge swag of the earth, imagine
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.520]   what happens when there's power there.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.200]   And nobody better to do this in Google.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:29.560]   You wouldn't see-- there's no extra governmental organization
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.360]   that's going to do this, no NGO.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.560]   That's the other great thing.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.200]   If they can put some servers up there,
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.800]   maybe we're safe from the NSA.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.160]   I think the NSA can even tap the stratosphere.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:46.440]   However, this is Google's mandate.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.560]   They've always said this.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:50.160]   The more you use the internet, the more we make.
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:51.320]   They might charge for this, but I
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.400]   don't think this would be a business anymore than Gigabit
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.440]   is a business for them.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.560]   This opens up entire new nations.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.060]   Yeah.
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:11:59.040]   It's business.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.040]   There are--
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.240]   They call it the last mile problem, right?
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.880]   Yeah, last 10 miles, yeah.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.560]   Last 10 miles.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.520]   There are 5 billion people who don't have internet access.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:12.600]   So you're talking about a significant increase
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.600]   in your market share.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.560]   They're solar powered, which is really cool.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:19.960]   Yep.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.040]   Yep.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.400]   They are set up in such a way that they can take them down
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.560]   when they wear out.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.080]   They're there.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:25.480]   Yeah, they wear out.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:27.400]   They take them down the recycle apart, which is cool.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.280]   They're landing-- or collection areas, right?
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.760]   That they can steer them to, which is really neat.
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.480]   I wonder how that has to be coordinated
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.680]   with air traffic control, though.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.160]   That's what--
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:36.840]   The up and down.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.280]   Well, you know, it's not that crap.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.280]   No, it's coming down to Earth.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.640]   I don't think this is the Leo question,
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:43.920]   but when can I buy one?
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.240]   With that.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.440]   The Kevin Purdy balloon.
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.440]   There they are going up in New Zealand.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.240]   This is-- is this a Trey Rachlos video?
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:53.800]   Yeah, this is one of Trey's videos.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:55.640]   The one he was talking about with the technical demo
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.080]   still hasn't been approved yet.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:57.920]   So it's not up yet.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:01.480]   But he apparently was able to go to the staging
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:04.640]   Quonset hut and record a bunch of tech talks
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.160]   and whiteboard stuff.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:08.440]   And Google has to approve it before he can oppose it,
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.720]   but he's hoping to post it that would give us
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:12.720]   a lot of more tech information.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.640]   This is recorded using his Google class.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.880]   Pretty neat, huh?
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:17.400]   Oh.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.760]   Pretty neat.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:19.600]   I guess that's his son.
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:20.760]   I guess he did bring his kids.
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.160]   Either that or he's scratching Steven Levy's hair,
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.760]   which is a little weird.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:26.080]   No, he was on the right.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.000]   OK.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:27.840]   That was a son.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.200]   Look at that.
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:29.200]   That's really amazing.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.480]   These are more robust than weather balloons.
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.360]   They're pretty tough.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.040]   So is the solar stuff on the top of it
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:39.360]   and that on the bottom is the transmission piece?
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:39.720]   I don't know.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:40.360]   We'll have to--
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.080]   Well, from-- if you look at this photo,
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:46.200]   it looks like that bottom piece has the top layer is--
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:46.960]   is so--
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:47.320]   Oh, it does.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:47.520]   OK.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.560]   Yes, there you go.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.080]   Yep, yep, yep.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.920]   The other neat thing about this is it's a mesh network.
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:53.200]   Right.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:53.480]   Right.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.880]   They connect with each other balloons
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.400]   to do with each other to do things.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.080]   And you need that because most of them
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.960]   are not over these uplink facilities.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.640]   Those are in major urban areas.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.080]   So only one has to be above an uplink.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.760]   They uplink and then it spreads it via mesh
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.320]   to all the other balloons.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.400]   So that's pretty cool.
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:14.160]   It's amazing that the 2013 solution to this,
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:17.040]   it looks a lot like what would probably be the 1913 solution.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.120]   I know.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:18.560]   You know what?
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.560]   That's really out of the box thinking.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.560]   And I love it.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.520]   I just think that's great.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.080]   I am thrilled.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.960]   And I think this might actually work.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.480]   This is, by the way, not the first time
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.840]   people have talked about something like this.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.160]   Even a few months ago, Google was saying,
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.200]   we're going to do this in Africa.
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:37.680]   But I've heard of--
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.680]   remember somebody was going to do an internet where it was
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.640]   planes that were always up in the air?
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.120]   This was quite a few years ago.
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.280]   That's quite expensive, obviously.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.880]   Well, there were airships not long ago.
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:52.400]   Yeah, I'm not sure why they don't use Zeppelin's to do this.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.040]   But I guess this is the same thing, right?
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.040]   They're lower towels.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:56.800]   A little less expensive.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:57.360]   They do fuel.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:57.800]   That's why.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:58.880]   Isn't that cool?
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.080]   It's really cool.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.800]   What strikes me about it is that it's a little weird,
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.040]   is that it doesn't look very futuristic.
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.040]   I mean, they look like floating garbage bags.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.440]   Really long.
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:08.960]   Right?
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.120]   I would be like, oh.
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.120]   I remember Bill Gates--
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.320]   That's the land of the ocean and chokes and fish, you know?
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.360]   Bill Gates spent a billion--
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.320]   I think a billion dollars on Teladesic,
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:20.480]   which was designed to put low Earth orbit satellites up
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.280]   doing the same thing.
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.640]   But this is so much more economical.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:25.400]   So small.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:25.880]   Well, that's great.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.240]   Harmless science experiments.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:27.760]   That's what it says.
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:28.760]   Yeah, that's if it crashes.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.800]   Whose science experimenter.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.240]   It's hard.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.200]   Do not-- it is not a bomb.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.640]   It is not for the NSA.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:38.320]   Well, maybe it is.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:44.600]   We laugh because we're scared.
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.080]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.040]   You always joke about the thing that most worries you.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.560]   How do you like your glass?
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.960]   Still liking it?
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:57.360]   I'm enjoying the laughs I get when I demonstrate it.
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:01.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.680]   How about you, Gina?
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.360]   I don't see you wearing it.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.160]   I don't wear it when I'm sitting on my computer,
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:08.120]   but I do wear it when I go out on the weekends.
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:10.720]   In fact, I was just at San Diego Pride this past weekend,
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.880]   and I had them on.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:14.440]   And actually, LaToya Jackson was there, random.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.560]   She was one of the parade leaders.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.920]   And I was like, I snapped a quick picture of her.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.120]   And she had a little entourage.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.840]   She was in a golf cart, and there are all these cameras
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.680]   and stuff.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.720]   But I generally, like, I take it out.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.280]   We went to the county fair.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.920]   If I go for a walk, or if we go down to the beach,
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:28.640]   I'll take pictures.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.360]   But if I'm sitting in front of my computer,
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.520]   I don't have it on because I don't need it.
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.440]   I don't have the nerve to wear it in New York City.
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.280]   Oh, you'd get punched in the face, wouldn't you?
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:36.840]   I think so.
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:40.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.400]   It's a camera, though, right?
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.320]   Gina, I mean, that sounds like--
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.400]   the way you just described sound like a camera.
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.880]   Yeah, I'm using it as a camera.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.760]   And here in San Diego, it's really sunny.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.160]   So I always have the-- I often wear it with the sunglasses
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:52.760]   piece, which makes the camera a little less conspicuous.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.640]   Like, people don't really notice it as much.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:55.880]   I use it mostly as a camera.
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:57.440]   I use it for navigation.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:01.360]   And I do enjoy getting text messages just kind of popped up
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.680]   in my face without having to check my phone.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:05.520]   But that's basically what I use it for.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.360]   And obviously, I take tons of pictures of the baby
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:10.000]   and little short videos of the baby that grandma--
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.160]   grandma and grandma love.
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.360]   I don't know if I said this last one,
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.680]   but I think it's three things.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.680]   Three, three, three minutes in one.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:16.360]   It's a camera.
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.040]   You can record your life.
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.240]   Number one, number two, it gives you alerts.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.680]   And number three, it gives you instructions,
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.120]   including directions.
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.920]   Yeah, somebody was walking--
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:25.440]   I think was it bare-toned?
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.800]   Or somebody walking around New York
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:30.360]   and said this is a perfect use as a pedestrian?
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.760]   Yeah, navigation as a pedestrian, definitely.
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.240]   And even driving, I mean, I don't recommend
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.040]   that you have the navigation on while you're driving,
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.200]   but there are times when I'll be in the passenger seat
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:43.640]   and have it on, or I'll look up something beforehand
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.240]   to get places.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.120]   So the nav is great.
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.920]   And the walking nav is particularly good
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.920]   because it knows which way you're facing,
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.120]   which is very, very useful, especially in a dense place
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.480]   like New York.
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:55.880]   I found another fringe benefit to having it, which
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.440]   is up on the rundown.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.720]   The bottom thing on the glass is that when I'm now dubbing
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:05.400]   glass selfies, because I demonstrate them to other people
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:07.000]   and then, of course, they want to put them on them.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:07.800]   What do they do?
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:08.520]   They take pictures.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.520]   What do they do?
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:10.760]   Of you.
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.640]   So I have a whole huge--
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:14.680]   That's kind of cool, actually.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.920]   What do you take pictures there?
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.360]   Of me?
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.120]   I kind of like that.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.600]   What a handsome fellow you are.
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.440]   All right.
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.400]   I kind of like that.
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:26.560]   You're going to get me, again, me, me, me.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:29.400]   Glass selfies.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.920]   That's pretty funny, actually.
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:36.920]   So I've heard of at least two or three publications who
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:39.240]   have asked me and directly or three friends.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.120]   How do we get ahold of a pair--
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.560]   some glass so we can send a writer out to do kind of stunt,
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.160]   like see, record people's reactions to it,
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.080]   or see how weird they look.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.320]   Kind of like doing the--
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:56.960]   excuse me, but look at this glass hole piece, basically.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.840]   Which means it's jumped the shark.
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:18:59.600]   It's over.
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:18:59.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:00.880]   Time to move on.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.720]   I'm seriously--
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.520]   OK.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.040]   I love that.
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:04.520]   It's a little sad.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.560]   It says local news is doing glass stories.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.120]   It's over.
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:07.640]   It's all over.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.200]   Oh, no.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.120]   I wish I probably run down.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.120]   I don't think I did.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.240]   Did I-- oh, where I did.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:12.600]   I did.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:12.960]   I did.
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:13.240]   I did.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.240]   I did.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:14.760]   I'm not.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:15.600]   The NFL team.
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:16.080]   No, no.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.200]   Well, that-- not an onion headline.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.360]   This is a real headline.
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:22.440]   Area woman exploring use of Google Glass.
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:26.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:29.880]   How it'll affect your weekend after this.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.400]   Well, ESPN took it down to practice one of the NFL teams.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.640]   I don't remember what team it's about.
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.960]   Yeah, that's-- actually, we actually
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:35.600]   have to catch a ball.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.440]   It's pretty cool.
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.880]   Yeah, actually, the catch a ball is pretty cool.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:42.840]   Sounds like a mental tribune.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.880]   Area woman has glass.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.480]   We have a whole glass section on our rundown here.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.600]   We have a huge section.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.760]   We have the NFL players.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:55.920]   With Glass, we have Larry Page worrying at their wedding.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.080]   Oh, don't let somebody-- is it his wedding?
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:58.800]   No.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:19:59.320]   No.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.240]   He was a groom's man.
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:00.760]   No, he was a groom's man.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:01.440]   OK.
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:03.560]   Yes.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.160]   So what's the story?
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:08.640]   Are we going to see a bunch of pictures on his Google+
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.120]   of his brother's wedding?
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:10.480]   We should.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.240]   You see him doing the more subtle.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.880]   We don't see Larry Page going, OK, Glass.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.040]   We see him doing that.
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.120]   He always wearing a--
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:21.000]   Now, apparently, Google has patented Glass, a way
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.680]   of making melding Glass with prescription lenses, which
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:26.960]   is good news for people like me.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:30.760]   Most of these are pictures of Larry's attractive wife, it seems.
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:31.800]   Oh, yeah, she is attractive.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:34.080]   Where is the story?
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:34.840]   I don't know what her brother--
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.760]   Where are the pictures?
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:36.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:37.280]   What?
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:38.800]   Sorry, the pictures that he took.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.280]   Yeah.
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:41.040]   I don't know if he actually shared them.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.320]   I don't know.
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.160]   I guess I would--
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.880]   If it were my wedding, I would welcome somebody wearing Glass
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:50.280]   because he's documenting the wedding, right?
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.840]   When I got married 20 years ago, we gave--
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.880]   this is how long ago it was--
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.520]   disposable instamatics to everybody.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.400]   They were at every table.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.200]   So take pictures and then leave them on the table
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.360]   and we'll get them developed.
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.080]   This is kind of like that.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:08.440]   It was in Croatia.
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:09.800]   Nice place out here.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.120]   Yes.
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:11.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.600]   Nice beaches and things like that.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.520]   Yes.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.560]   OK, so NFL Glass.
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:18.440]   That one's pretty cool, Leo.
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:23.440]   So are these people who lent their glass to players?
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:24.080]   Yes, a reporter.
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.680]   UESP and a reporter put them on the players.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:27.360]   Oh, he had it.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.640]   OK.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.640]   She put them on the--
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:30.160]   She--
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.600]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.600]   Yes.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.200]   They had them on the--
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.880]   Ooh, that's kind of cool.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.440]   Now, I bet you-- I'm thinking she had
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:41.840]   to start the recording for him.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.720]   No, honestly, he's about to throw the ball.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.240]   Wow.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:45.400]   That's cool.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:45.920]   I guess.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:46.600]   The player really catches.
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.280]   The catching is even better.
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.880]   Wait, you know, you see this stuff--
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:50.880]   Oh, no.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:51.880]   Boom.
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:52.880]   Try here.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:53.880]   Is that playing?
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.720]   You see this stuff on NFL coverage anyway,
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:58.080]   because they have helmet cams and stuff.
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:58.600]   In fact, this is--
[01:21:58.600 --> 01:21:59.920]   Yeah, and that's what the coach was saying.
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.080]   You know, you really could see every helmet being
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.400]   equipped with this kind of thing.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:06.600]   And for viewers to be able to watch the game from any players,
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.560]   give them perspective.
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.600]   Right.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.840]   I don't know if I'd want that, though.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.080]   A little like--
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.040]   little player witch.
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:15.240]   Well, you know, because when the network's used it,
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.640]   it's a special thing.
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:18.200]   You see it all the time in race cars.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.800]   They'll have special cameras in their race cars.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.280]   The first person is--
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.360]   Yeah, there's nothing.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.640]   Turning left-- I'm turning left now.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:25.920]   I'm going to turn left some more.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.760]   There's nothing new to the idea of first person.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:29.400]   No, no, no, no.
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:33.480]   Last just maybe makes it easier.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.320]   Easy enough for an NFL player to use.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.280]   It's almost.
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:41.680]   So Jeff demoed a glass at the Guardian activate.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:44.880]   That's where some of those pictures came from.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:48.800]   You have-- that was where you interviewed Vince Serf.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.080]   Vince, the wonderful bit.
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.320]   They just put the video up this morning.
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.600]   Yay.
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.760]   I want to watch it.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.760]   Bit is amazing.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.960]   Yeah, we talked about the fact that you did it yesterday,
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:22:59.600]   or last week.
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:00.600]   But yeah.
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.600]   So--
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:02.120]   Yesterday.
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.360]   Actually, you should just not do the show and play the interview.
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.280]   Well, it's 20 minutes.
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.360]   Yeah, it's 40 minutes.
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.360]   That's the demo one.
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.360]   OK, highlights.
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:13.280]   Anything?
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:15.080]   You're not wearing glass during the interview.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.080]   I want you to do things with me.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:17.600]   Come on.
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:18.760]   I have audio from--
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.560]   Hey, you're on Google Glass.
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.560]   Big deal.
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:22.080]   OK.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:22.360]   Wait a minute.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:22.880]   Where is that?
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.480]   Oh, that's you.
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:23.980]   OK.
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.440]   Then you just click on it, but I won't--
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:26.600]   Oh, so you're using the screencast.
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.440]   You're nice.
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:27.960]   Yeah.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:31.200]   And you said they very kindly edited out the--
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.880]   It took me like 20 times.
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.640]   So the way the waiter turned the screencast on
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:37.880]   is you've got to photograph the barcode on the phone
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.760]   with the glass.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.040]   Oh, god.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.240]   And trying to get it in the right spot
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:46.760]   is nearly impossible because you can't preview the photo.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:47.760]   And so I was on stage.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:48.760]   They--
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:49.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:53.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.680]   So the good first impression.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:57.160]   When they put a GoPro quality camera on this thing,
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.800]   then maybe I'll be impressed.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.400]   But then in my feed, it takes a while for the photos
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:01.880]   to come up.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:04.040]   So then three days later, I'll see 20 pictures
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.920]   of half a key one code.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:08.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.960]   That's pretty funny.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:14.080]   We've had so many great guests on this week in Google
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:18.480]   and many regulars like Matt Cuts and Kevin Marks.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:21.520]   But I have to say, for me and Jeff,
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.400]   I think having Bruce Schneier on talking about the NSA
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:27.480]   was a real highlight.
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:31.560]   Bruce is one of the great gurus of security.
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.880]   And what is it?
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:36.760]   Schneier on security is just an incredible blog.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:39.600]   We asked Bruce to talk about the NSA.
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.760]   This was when the story was first breaking.
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.480]   Take a look.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:45.720]   So Jeff, you have booked somebody I've
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:48.640]   been trying to get on, Twit, for seven or eight years now.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.080]   One of the premier guys in security.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:57.520]   Frankly, if Bruce Schneier says it, I believe it,
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:01.400]   he, among other claims to fame,
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.440]   you helped Neil Gaiman--
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:07.920]   I'm sorry, Neil Stevenson was the crypto in crypto nomicon,
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.120]   his card deck crypto.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.840]   Yeah, I built a playing card cipher that he used in the plot.
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.380]   And the neat thing was I got to write it
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:16.640]   afterward in the book.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:17.160]   So it was.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.480]   And the extra neat thing is I got
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.640]   to come and hear about some book signings
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:24.680]   and learn that cipherpunk writers get way better groupies
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:27.560]   than the part that they ever do.
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:30.240]   Bruce, it is such an honor to talk to you.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:31.960]   Really, you are a legend in the business.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:36.800]   And especially now more than ever, we need Bruce Schneier.
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:41.040]   SCHNEIER.com.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.080]   If you want to read his blog, Schneier on security,
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:44.680]   there is really nobody who is more
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:50.480]   trenchant or accurate entertaining even on the subject.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.920]   So Jeff, since you were the guy who got us this great book,
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.320]   and I'll let you take the lead on this one.
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:57.840]   So much.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.920]   We have so little time.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.360]   We have Bruce to the top of the hour.
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.000]   But start here, Bruce.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.040]   You wrote a great piece for the Atlantic.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.080]   And about a topic that I was trying to tackle, too,
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:08.720]   but you frankly did it far better than I did,
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:11.920]   is the fear that the NSA is commandeering the net.
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:13.560]   I was thinking about it in terms of what they're
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.840]   doing, maybe to individual companies where
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.640]   there are people with security clearance,
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.760]   and their bosses don't have it.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.840]   They don't know what they're doing inside the company.
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.600]   And I couldn't figure out how to express that.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:25.080]   And you just came up with a very clear view
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:28.240]   that they're just plain commandeering the internet.
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:30.560]   And then you're also arguing that what technology companies--
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.320]   it's time for them to fight back.
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.800]   Why don't you talk about that for a second?
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:38.640]   It's really part of this very broad trend of surveillance
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:39.760]   being everywhere.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:42.160]   I mean, if you think about it, surveillance
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.680]   is the business model of the internet.
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.520]   I mean, that's how Google makes its money.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:48.440]   It surveils us and it serves us personalized ads.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:49.920]   That's how Facebook makes its money.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:53.320]   That's everyone's making their money by mining us for our data
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.680]   and then buying, selling, and using it.
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:58.800]   And then it turns out that the government wants access to it,
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.120]   too.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:02.920]   And stuff they can't get for legal reasons
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.720]   or technical reasons, they're learning
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.600]   to get from these corporations.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.280]   Either they're asking nicely.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:10.920]   We've seen example after example of companies
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.960]   willingly subverting their security
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:17.080]   or willingly handing the NSA copies of everything.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.680]   They'll do it to national security letters.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:20.680]   They'll force companies to do it.
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:23.440]   Kalea is something that's going through Congress,
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:27.080]   with the FBI, has gotten phone companies
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:30.000]   to make their networks eavesdropping ready.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.720]   So I mean, I think of this as a public-private surveillance
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:34.360]   partnership.
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:37.440]   So yes, the NSA is commanduring the internet
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.080]   for its own purposes.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:43.120]   But also, companies are surveilling us
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:47.360]   for their own purposes and using law to protect them.
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:50.480]   So it kind of goes both ways, unfortunately.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:52.160]   First, I've always been much more worried, though,
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.560]   about a government surveilling us
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:28:00.040]   than about private corporations trying to sell us.
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:02.480]   Doesn't that seem a little bit more nefarious?
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:06.320]   Well, I mean, sell us is just the beginning of it.
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:09.000]   It's being used to deny people loans,
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.160]   to deny people banking--
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.160]   Redlining.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.400]   Digital redlining.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:16.920]   But redlining, not just even denying people access to banking.
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:20.360]   There's an article recently about people
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:23.720]   judged by computer algorithms and being denied bank accounts.
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.960]   So now they're forced to use these more expensive unbanks
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:30.600]   and check-cashing services.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:34.080]   These corporations are not just selling us consumer products.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:35.840]   They're very much controlling our lives.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.280]   If you can't get a cell phone, you
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.640]   can't live the same life.
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:42.480]   You can't get a credit card.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:45.760]   So looking at corporate power, it's different than government
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.360]   power.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:49.400]   But corporate power is pretty darn extreme.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.840]   And go ahead.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.040]   Sorry.
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:56.960]   No, I mean, I just really see both types of power
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.200]   working together.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.760]   And this is weird libertarian fantasy
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.680]   that if the government does something, it's bad.
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:05.520]   And then if a corporation does it, it magically becomes good.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:09.080]   I usually tend to look at the thing and not who
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:12.960]   writes the paycheck of the people in power that are doing it.
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:15.720]   Yeah, I'm more afraid of guns, though, than I am of redlining.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:18.800]   But I'll acknowledge that both are problems.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:19.640]   How do you find it?
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:24.080]   Right now, the rock, paper, scissors in Egypt
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:27.200]   is the army always wins over the internet.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:31.520]   I'll continue on with Leo's question, Bruce.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:34.160]   When I talked to Vince Serf about this Guardian
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.840]   activate in London, someone asked him
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:38.960]   whether the solution to this is technological or institutional.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:42.360]   That is to say laws and policy and principles.
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:45.600]   How far does the technological solution take us here?
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.920]   And what are its limitations?
[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:49.280]   And how do we solve it institutionally?
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.480]   So I don't think technology takes us very far at all.
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.680]   And so here's a great example.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:54.400]   I'm asking email all the time.
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:56.200]   I want to use a secure email service.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.520]   Who should I use?
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.240]   And the truth is, I don't know.
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:01.800]   I don't know what companies have been
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:03.400]   subverted by the government.
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:06.080]   What claims are true or claims are lying.
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:10.560]   Last week, we saw two small secure email services--
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.560]   Lava Bit and--
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.760]   Silent Circle.
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.080]   Silent Circle.
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:16.520]   Schills Zimmerman's company.
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:16.960]   Right.
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:20.320]   They shut themselves down one after they received
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:23.400]   national security letters, one before.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:26.640]   So these independents are going away.
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:30.320]   What's left the big corporations that really have no choice
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.840]   but to cooperate?
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:34.680]   So the technology only takes you so far,
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:36.000]   but you can't trust the technology
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.040]   because you can't trust anybody's claims.
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:41.480]   These are very much political problems,
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:43.280]   and the solutions are going to be political.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:45.920]   Now, once we have the correct politics in place,
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.560]   there's a lot technology can do because there are a lot of tech
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:52.680]   problems, but they are subservient to the political problems.
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:53.480]   Right now--
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:55.720]   Which goes to your point.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:56.720]   Which goes to your point--
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:58.720]   I'm trying to get the tech companies to fight now
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:00.760]   that if they want to prove who side they're on,
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.880]   are they on our side, or are they collaborators
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.280]   with the government, or are they victimism, it's overreach?
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.280]   But isn't it a meaningless question?
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:09.200]   I think Bruce is probably right.
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.920]   They are collaborators, but even if they weren't,
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:12.920]   they don't have--
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.720]   NSL-- and I know Matt Cutts works at Google,
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.560]   so he's going to chime in there.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.920]   But even if they weren't--
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:21.080]   I think it's moot because even if they weren't,
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:22.920]   the law requires them to participate.
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:24.040]   And because they're public companies,
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:25.840]   they can't do as lava, but in silent circle
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:29.000]   did shut down, they have to keep cooperating.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.080]   They have to cooperate.
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:31.440]   They have to cooperate.
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:34.400]   Well, just as they had to cooperate in China.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:35.960]   They don't have to cooperate willingly.
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:38.000]   They don't have to do more than the law allows,
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.680]   and they don't have to go silently.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:45.360]   So both Yahoo and Google have been great at fighting back.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.360]   And they will-- they will-- they will mostly lose.
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:50.480]   It's sometimes we win.
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:52.200]   Bruce Jacale, the Internet Archive,
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:54.320]   fought a national security letter and won.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.120]   And his story was in the New Yorker,
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:58.560]   I think, last year, earlier this year.
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:01.760]   And there are sort of only way to beat this back
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.120]   is to fight back.
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:05.160]   And even if you lose, you're going
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:08.840]   to lose on the narrowness of the letter.
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:10.480]   You're not going to cooperate more.
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:13.320]   There's a lot of articles now of companies that are cooperating
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:15.000]   because they're afraid if they get the letter,
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.280]   it'll be more annoying and more expensive.
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.880]   And it turns out not to be true.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:19.840]   You fight.
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:23.080]   You keep the moral high ground when this is all exposed,
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.720]   like, you know, what happened to Yahoo, what's happened to Google.
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:28.560]   We're all thinking, wow, these companies are fighting for us.
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:31.760]   So even if they lose, I'm going to trust them more
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:34.040]   than I will a company that isn't fighting.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:42.120]   I also consider that we don't know what's going on because of the
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:47.320]   silence requirements of many NSL.
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:50.960]   So it may be much more than we even know.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:54.040]   And it probably is.
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:56.360]   A lot of these silence requirements are being fought,
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:58.520]   sometimes successfully.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.480]   But I ask your letters go away, but the gag order does.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:02.400]   I look at Law of the--
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:05.000]   --the daughter who apparently got something,
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.440]   but is so constrained about what he can talk about.
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:10.760]   He has to sit there with a lawyer next to him saying,
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:13.840]   whispering back and forth, what can you say, what can't you say?
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.640]   He risks prison by saying anything.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:17.120]   That's right.
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:18.040]   But the companies can--
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.440]   It's real change.
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:22.080]   And they can stand up and say what ought to be.
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.800]   They get away with the specifics of the cases against them.
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.920]   The companies need to stand up on the basis of principle
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:29.600]   and say, this is what we'll fight.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.600]   This is what will stand up for you.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.520]   You can be assured that we will do this for that.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.560]   Because if they don't even say that,
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:35.840]   right now they're being silent.
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:37.720]   The companies are not coming out and saying much of anything.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.480]   And that doesn't lead to trust.
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:42.400]   Plus, we, the users, have to give them cover.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.160]   We have to demand that they fight.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.560]   So they can say that the government, amen,
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:47.040]   we're caught in the middle here.
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.600]   Bruce's most recent book was about trust.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:51.720]   It couldn't have been more timely.
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:55.120]   It came out last year, but you couldn't be more timely.
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:57.360]   I don't know if we can trust anybody at this point.
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:00.760]   And when you see, for instance, the FISA Court itself,
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:04.760]   two years ago, trying to put out a report saying
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:06.320]   that the government is overreaching,
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:09.880]   and then that being quashed by the Department of Justice,
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:12.640]   it is all being suppressed at this point,
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:14.800]   as much as the government can.
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:15.640]   There is.
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.600]   And it's actually-- it really amazes me
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:22.120]   that the NSA had no contingency plans for our secret programs
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.040]   get on the front page of the newspaper.
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:29.480]   You'd think with the major budget and security mindset,
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:31.760]   they have some plan B.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:34.360]   I mean, here it is about a couple of months after.
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:37.120]   General Alexander was at Black Hat.
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:38.880]   And like the best he could do was
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:43.320]   explain how the FISA Court works, talk about this Iranian cab
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.880]   driver who has sent $5,000 back home.
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.120]   I mean, this is his defense.
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:52.160]   It just amazes me how flat-footed they were caught,
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:56.920]   and how even now they're just making it up as they go along,
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:58.520]   hoping for the best.
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:01.280]   And they have to believe that these thousands of documents
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:04.280]   are going to become public, all of them sometime soon.
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.760]   It's just not going to stay undercover much longer.
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:12.760]   So could I take a little bit of the worry
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.680]   that we're painting with a little bit of a broad brush?
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:16.200]   Matt cuts from Google.
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.200]   Go ahead, Matt.
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.320]   Yeah, and I don't know whether my video can come through or not.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.000]   If my video does come through, I'm actually
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.520]   holding up a copy of Bruce's book.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:25.320]   Liars and outliers.
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:25.840]   Good.
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:26.560]   You're reading it.
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:27.280]   That's excellent.
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:29.200]   Well, this one's actually--
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.600]   Oh, the other one, Shira, security, which is the classic.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.040]   Yeah, I have that too.
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:34.800]   I am a fan.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.040]   So I very much enjoy and agree with that.
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:37.840]   That's a must-have.
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:40.240]   Security theater.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:43.000]   But I do think we don't want to paint with too broad of a brush,
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000]   like talking about collaborators
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.520]   and talking about private public partnership
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:48.360]   on some of this stuff.
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.160]   Because from a lot of the coverage,
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.200]   you get the idea, the sense that a lot of this
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:56.200]   is more like a shotgun wedding, where companies are compelled to.
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:59.680]   And I think you can look at the history of companies
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:01.920]   and get a sense for which ones are fighting for you,
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:05.080]   versus which ones are like, hey, please give us a government
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:08.200]   request so we can hand over all the phone-calling records
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.200]   of various Americans.
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:12.920]   So for example, Google was one of the first to really double
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:16.240]   down on encryption, both of Gmail and on search.
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:20.920]   Whenever we got a 2005 Department of Justice,
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:23.760]   subpoena that wanted to turn over two months of users' queries
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:27.400]   for a lawsuit related to pornography, we fought that,
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:30.000]   and we won, and 33 other companies didn't fight that.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.080]   We've been very big on two-factor authentication.
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:35.000]   There's an article in Wired that talks about a little device
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.040]   that lets you do two-factor authentication a little bit
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:37.640]   better.
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:42.600]   So I think to say that all these companies are just
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:45.800]   falling over themselves on this topic to help out
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.800]   the government is not a correct characterization.
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:50.160]   I think a lot of engineers in Silicon Valley
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:52.000]   are thinking about different ways that they
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.160]   can try to protect users' rights and protect security and privacy
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:57.760]   as best they can.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:00.720]   It was really wild to watch the events around Lava bit.
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:02.720]   And I think hopefully that will give a lot of people
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.920]   in the government pause and make them think a little bit
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.640]   about just what they're doing.
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:10.320]   They're really removing a lot of trust in the internet
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:11.400]   and in the cloud.
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:11.880]   Yes.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.480]   That's the problem.
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:16.440]   CDT just came out with, I guess, a blog post.
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:19.440]   And they have been fighting the extension of Kalia.
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:22.800]   Kalia is the law that required phone companies
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:25.440]   to make their phone switches eavesdropping friendly.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:27.560]   And the FBI's were trying to extend that law
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:30.160]   to the things like Gmail.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:31.600]   And it's being fought.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.360]   The law hasn't passed.
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:37.040]   But CDT's pointing out that these attacks
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.560]   against the smaller companies that are really forcing them
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:42.600]   to close or collaborate, the inability for the larger
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.120]   companies to close.
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:46.720]   So they have to basically hand over NSA data
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:49.520]   and then light their customers about it
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:54.080]   is effectively getting this actually Kalia extension passed
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.920]   without the trouble of going through Congress.
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:00.880]   That effectively, all we have left are the large companies.
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.600]   And it's sort of impossible.
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:04.920]   You can't imagine Mark Zuckerberg saying, well,
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:06.160]   we're just not going to comply.
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:07.560]   We're going to shut Facebook down.
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.160]   That's what we have to do.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:09.960]   He can't do that.
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.280]   It's a large public company.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:12.360]   He'd be fired.
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.200]   They'd find a less moral CEO.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:15.040]   And they'd keep going.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:16.800]   Right? And it would continue.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:19.280]   So we're now entering a world where
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:22.240]   you only have the big companies that collaborate.
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:25.280]   And they're forced to in some fight and some don't.
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:28.560]   And maybe we win around the edges, but largely we lose.
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:31.760]   And no small companies left.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:33.160]   And that clears me.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:34.640]   Let me ask you another question, though,
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:36.600]   since you're the technologist here.
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:39.320]   In my field in journalism, we yammer on a lot
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:40.400]   about professional ethics.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:44.080]   And I have threatened to quit jobs over matters of ethics.
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:46.280]   And I know a lot of people who have.
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:50.600]   And I know that Janet and Zolotarov, right?
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:51.800]   No, Janet and Zoner.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:52.800]   Yeah, Janet and Zonerov.
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.360]   Yeah, Janet and Zonerov.
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:56.160]   We're a great post saying, listen,
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:57.440]   the thing you have to trust here is
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:59.760]   that if this stuff were going on and I knew about it,
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:01.600]   I'd leave the company.
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:04.400]   How much discussion is there among technologists?
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.800]   Is there enough, do you think, about the ethics
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:08.240]   of a technologist?
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:10.760]   And how much can we trust those individuals?
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:12.360]   Is that where the wellspring of reaction
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.480]   is going to come up and say, no, I
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:17.600]   refuse to do that, or I'll have to quit or whatever?
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:19.880]   Where does it get down to the individual or the individual
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:21.640]   of them, the company who has security clearance, who's
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:23.960]   treated differently from everybody else?
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:25.560]   Well, thank goodness for the Edward Snowden's
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:30.440]   and the Lidar Levissans of Lava Bit of the World, who
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:34.360]   have put their, in a way, put their life on the line.
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:36.920]   Is there discussion of these ethical principles
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:39.880]   among developers, technologists, security people,
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:40.840]   and so on?
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.680]   Yeah, certainly within Google, I
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:45.560]   think it's safe to say this is hotly debated.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.560]   And every week, we have weekly discussions
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:50.920]   where we can ask larian-surge questions.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:54.720]   And it's entirely safe to say that even though we might not
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:57.880]   say that much externally, because there's
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:00.320]   discipline about external communications,
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.760]   you can believe any hot topic outside of Google
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:05.720]   gets a firestorm of debate inside of Google.
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:08.040]   And so that's an entirely safe assumption.
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:10.200]   I assume that happens at a lot of companies as well.
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:12.200]   OK.
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:18.280]   You know, so the president gave a press conference last Friday,
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:20.400]   and he talked about-- he did a couple of things,
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.240]   which I applaud him for.
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:25.160]   One is acknowledged while he said,
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:29.120]   while our national law enforcement agencies are patriots
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:31.640]   and trying to protect our country, he also said--
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:33.760]   and I hope he believes this-- that those who are fighting
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:38.600]   for privacy are also patriots and fighting
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:43.920]   for very fundamental constitutional tenets in this country.
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:46.120]   He also said-- and I thought this was really telling--
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:47.880]   we have an unprecedented ability
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:50.040]   to gather this information.
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:52.920]   And I think perhaps what happened
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:56.600]   is that unprecedented ability to gather the information
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:58.720]   snuck up on us.
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:00.240]   And we got this ability.
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:02.400]   And of course, somebody whose job is to protect the country
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:05.720]   is going to embrace anything.
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:07.760]   And the problem is the controls and the oversight
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:10.640]   of not been there have not kept up.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:15.480]   Is it enough to say to Congress, let's get this under control?
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:16.800]   I mean, you can say it.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:19.080]   It has to get done.
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:19.600]   So Obama--
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:21.800]   Well, what else should we do?
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:23.960]   I agree that's probably the mechanism,
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:25.320]   or at least one of the mechanisms.
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:27.920]   Other mechanisms, there are court cases going through.
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.200]   Obama said he'd do four things.
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.280]   And of course, the proof is in the pudding.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:34.760]   Talk about reforming Section 215 of the Patriot Act.
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:37.080]   That's the section that has to deal with national security
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:37.960]   letters.
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:39.000]   So what does that mean?
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.520]   We don't know.
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:42.960]   To increase transparency, the FISA court--
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:46.000]   I mean, it's a good idea, but the devil's in the details.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.200]   The third is to make more information public,
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:50.120]   as can be made public.
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:51.720]   Again, good idea.
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:54.840]   And fourth is to appoint some kind of independent review
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:57.120]   board, which is either a good idea
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:01.080]   or a way to make the problem go away and put in a document.
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:05.320]   So these are four generalizations.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.680]   The details matter.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:09.640]   I mean, yes, Congress could do a lot.
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:12.600]   We saw a few weeks ago the House
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:16.200]   tried to unfund one particular NSA surveillance program,
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:19.720]   the one that collects phone metadata of every American.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:22.160]   That failed, but failed very narrowly.
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:23.840]   There are things the courts could do.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:29.600]   EFF, ACLU, EPIC are all filing lawsuits
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:32.360]   trying to challenge the constitutionality of this aspect,
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:33.640]   of that aspect.
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:34.960]   Those are ways.
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.120]   There's a lot of public pressure now.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:39.200]   I mean, Congressmen are feeling this.
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:40.960]   The president is feeling this.
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:42.560]   And views are changing.
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:48.640]   Even some of the Congressmen and senators
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:54.080]   who are pretty much on the side of security at all costs
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:57.920]   and don't really care about this are starting to change.
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:59.680]   So there's a lot we can do.
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:01.280]   You have to just push it all fronts.
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:04.680]   Is it enough or those four things enough,
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:07.240]   presuming they're done properly or is there more
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:08.680]   that you would like?
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:12.800]   I think fundamentally our privacy laws are outdated.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.080]   I mean, it's what you said.
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:16.440]   Technology continues to advance.
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:19.760]   The FBI, the NSA are continually grabbing
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:22.440]   this new technology because it's a gray area
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.400]   and not really covered under the law.
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:27.400]   They assume the most broad, expansive powers
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.160]   they can think of.
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:33.040]   And because the law is written in the 80s
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.920]   or sometimes even the early 90s.
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:36.480]   Sometimes the 1880s.
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:39.320]   You know, it's not that bad, but it's still pretty bad.
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:40.920]   It's still pretty internet.
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:46.080]   So we really need the entire body of laws
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.760]   to catch up to technology.
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:50.600]   And if we're really good to write them
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:53.280]   technologically invariant, so you don't go through
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:55.600]   the same problem again in 20 years.
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:57.320]   Yeah, that's where I'll disagree a little bit
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:58.320]   with Bruce.
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.520]   I think what we have to do is write the laws
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:01.720]   at a level of principle where, then I agree,
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:03.240]   they're invariant to the technology.
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:06.640]   The principle is that you don't suck up
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:07.640]   all the communication that occurs.
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.760]   Oh, here's a better example.
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:16.760]   Our first class letters and packages only are secured
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:19.120]   so that they can't be opened without a warrant.
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:21.720]   The metadata can be taken, but the package cannot be opened.
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:22.920]   Anything else can be opened.
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:25.320]   Our email does not have that security.
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:27.600]   Our private chats, of course, don't have that security.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:28.920]   Well, the principle at work here
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:31.320]   should be that private communication is private
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:34.760]   and is secure unless with a lawful warrant.
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:36.440]   That should be the principle that should exist
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:39.040]   against any technology, whether that's a letter
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:41.840]   or a phone call or a chat or an email.
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:43.200]   So what we have to do is actually, I think,
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:46.280]   raise this discussion, hide the level of principle
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.720]   so that we can then know what's being protected
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:49.920]   as citizens.
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:51.480]   And then the problem now is that, you know,
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:54.320]   in a way, you don't blame the spies, say,
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:56.080]   in the words of Alexander, gather it all.
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:57.680]   The more they can gather, they think that's their job.
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:59.360]   They're going to go as far as they can.
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:02.280]   And if the law is too specific to the technology
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:04.200]   and doesn't catch up, they're going to walk through
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:05.240]   that loophole.
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:06.920]   Whereas if the principle is set up that says,
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:11.040]   you cannot listen to or in any way spy
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.160]   on private communication at an individual level
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:17.160]   until you have a warrant, that to me is pre-darn clear.
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:18.000]   That's right.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.560]   And it's resistant to whatever the next thing is.
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:23.960]   Our problems have been.
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:27.400]   We had this with videotape rentals versus DVDs
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:28.680]   versus streaming video.
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:29.520]   We'll have it right.
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:31.600]   You can write letters versus email,
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:35.280]   phone calls versus Skype calls.
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:38.640]   So, you mean, if you write the laws to the technology,
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:40.160]   the technology changes and your laws
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:42.800]   no longer apply or no longer work well.
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:43.800]   If we can somehow--
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:45.560]   We can draw people laws to the idea
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.960]   that technology is going to constantly change.
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:48.800]   Right.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.080]   But this stuff is hard.
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:52.440]   You know, fundamentally, it's very hard,
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:53.760]   members of Congress, and I applaud
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:55.160]   the ones who managed to do it,
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:59.200]   to say to law enforcement, no, you can't have this.
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:02.240]   No, we're going to stand up for what's right
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:04.000]   and we're not going to give you what you want.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:07.000]   It's very easy just to come to fear.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000]   I mean, you know, I feel their pain.
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.680]   I don't, you know, I have sympathy
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:12.080]   even though I don't want them to do it.
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:12.920]   Yeah.
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:15.040]   And, you know, I think the judiciary also
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:16.640]   is going to be a big part of this,
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:20.640]   interpreting the laws to support the Fourth Amendment
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.120]   is going to be a big part of it.
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:24.280]   Bruce, we have a promise to let you go at this time,
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:26.280]   and I thank you so much for being here.
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:28.360]   All right, let's not be back, but I can stay longer.
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:29.720]   I would love to have you back.
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.680]   Liars and outliers is the latest book,
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:34.640]   enabling the trust that society needs to thrive.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:38.000]   Schnier.com is the website.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.960]   Really, a hero of mine, Bruce.
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:40.880]   So thank you for being here.
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:41.600]   We really appreciate it.
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:42.240]   Hey, thank you.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.480]   Take care.
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:47.160]   Actually, Danny told us just as we
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:48.480]   were starting the show, breaking news.
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:51.720]   Yahoo for the first time in five years.
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:55.160]   Number one on the net.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:55.760]   Is that right?
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:56.240]   It's crazy.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:56.600]   Yeah.
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:57.120]   Crazy.
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:46:57.920]   So they--
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:58.920]   Crazy.
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:01.000]   Every year, Com Square comes out when they say,
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.080]   these are the top sites or the top networks
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.080]   in the United States.
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:08.120]   And every year, the list is always the same.
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:10.440]   There's hardly ever any changes that kind of go on with it.
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:13.880]   But this month, it came out, and that turns out in July,
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:17.920]   that Yahoo popped above Google to be the number one site
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:19.000]   network in the United States.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.120]   And it's the first time since at least early 2008,
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:21.960]   since they've been there.
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:24.120]   God, that's amazing.
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:30.200]   196 million unique users to Google's 192 million unique users.
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:33.120]   And that's not even counting Tumblr.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:35.600]   Com Square has an integrated all the Tumblr numbers.
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:36.360]   So those are separate.
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:37.960]   And if you put those in there as well,
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:42.320]   then that would take Yahoo up to like about 235,000
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:44.880]   use a big, big, big gap between them and Google
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:45.760]   at that point.
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:47.440]   It's always been back and forth, though.
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:48.240]   Yahoo, Google.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:49.360]   Yahoo, Google hasn't it?
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:51.680]   I mean, Yahoo's not coming up from number 12.
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:54.440]   They've been like number two for a really long time.
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:55.560]   So it's not like they're going to--
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:00.640]   The other truth is people don't go to Google for Google.
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.680]   Google doesn't emphasize having Google.com
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:05.000]   as a major site, maps and other things.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.560]   Yahoo has been a content site, a destination site
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:10.120]   for-- since the beginning of a portal,
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:11.680]   while a portal turned destination.
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:13.120]   They're about content, aren't they?
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.160]   I mean, really.
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:16.320]   So what does that include?
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:19.240]   Mail, so would Gmail be a Google site with Yahoo?
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:19.680]   Mail, do you?
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:22.680]   That should include any Google property
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:24.240]   and any Yahoo property.
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.880]   It doesn't matter that it's on Google.com versus YouTube.
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:29.040]   Like YouTube isn't broken out from the Google numbers.
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:30.680]   YouTube isn't included in it.
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:33.440]   Well, that's content that you want.
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:37.040]   In a day or two, Google will probably say, well,
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:39.440]   if you factored in this thing over here,
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:40.520]   that thing over there.
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.680]   And so it'll be interesting to see.
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:43.920]   Because Google really doesn't like it.
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:44.880]   What about mobile Danny?
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:48.080]   What-- with people that supposedly mobiles--
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:49.680]   everything I'm seeing with the sites I work with,
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:52.080]   mobiles going nuts in the numbers.
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:53.480]   Is Yahoo or anything in particular?
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:55.400]   They have a new weather app, everybody's talking about.
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:58.680]   But is it-- is mobile a factor in this?
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:48:59.200]   I don't know.
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:00.560]   In fact, we're still trying to figure out
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:02.400]   what it is that might have popped it up.
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:03.840]   And the first thought was, well, maybe this
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:05.480]   is all the Tumblr numbers that have come in.
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:08.480]   But like I said, Tumblr's broken out on its own.
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:11.160]   So the gap has always been very close.
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:14.640]   But something happened that maybe moved Yahoo up.
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:17.560]   And it may be also that what happens in the summer
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.880]   is that you get the people who aren't searching on Google
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:20.240]   as much.
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:22.280]   The students go back to school or are out of school
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.280]   and everything.
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:26.200]   So it could be that they were so close and Yahoo's
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:29.120]   had just enough of a game that Google's chint them off
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:30.680]   of a drop might have had an impact.
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:33.680]   So yeah.
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:34.760]   Good on Marissa Mayer.
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:35.680]   That's huge.
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:37.560]   I sure there'll be some celebrations over at Yahoo.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:38.000]   You bet.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.080]   And she looks damn fine in a gown.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:43.320]   Can you believe all the attention?
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:43.960]   Let me ask Gina.
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:45.680]   She's a woman.
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:47.080]   Can you believe all the attention?
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:49.120]   I feel bad.
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:52.640]   So Vogue did an article on Marissa Mayer.
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:53.400]   It's Vogue.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.560]   Marissa Mayer's always loved fashion.
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:57.040]   We know that.
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:00.400]   That doesn't make her less of a brilliant person
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:04.760]   or an engineer or a CEO.
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:06.920]   I think a great looking picture of her
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:10.640]   in a designer dress with fabulous heels.
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.040]   Upside down.
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.760]   And people say, oh, it overshadows the story.
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:19.560]   And I don't think so.
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:21.680]   Can we live in a world where somebody can be interested
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:25.160]   in fashion and still be brilliant?
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:26.480]   Yes.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:26.880]   We can't.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:29.600]   I do think that too much is made of her looks.
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.320]   But it's kind of like it's a unicorn thing.
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:34.240]   It's like you're just not used to seeing young--
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:34.960]   Right.
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:38.320]   --email CEOs in the position that she's in.
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:41.160]   And look, I think Mayer has a lot of control
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:43.040]   and a lot of say in the way that she's presented.
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:43.640]   Oh, yes.
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:46.200]   And I think that she accepts these interviews and photo shoots
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:49.440]   and does so full well knowing what they're going to turn out
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:49.640]   to be.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:51.160]   And I think that she probably--
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:52.600]   She thought it was a good idea.
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:53.440]   She thought it was a good idea.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.920]   I wouldn't be surprised if she had final say
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:58.120]   on what photographs they finally publish.
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:01.280]   And I feel like if she's comfortable with that presentation,
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.560]   then that's cool.
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:05.920]   But I do think that a lot is made of her appearance.
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:08.040]   But I think it's human nature to react to something
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:08.920]   that looks different.
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:10.840]   It is kind of like the unicorn principle.
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:14.440]   And I think if you read the article, what is very impressive--
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:17.680]   and look at the other pictures--
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:22.440]   what is very impressive is that she held her own in a boys
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:23.200]   club.
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:24.800]   Actually, this is CEOs go a while.
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:25.840]   This is the wrong slide show.
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:28.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:32.880]   Although did they make a lot about Richard Branson dressed
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:34.440]   as in drag as a stewardess?
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:35.040]   I don't know.
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:37.000]   Was that a big story?
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.840]   Larry Allison drinking the largest bottle of champagne
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:41.800]   I've ever seen.
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:42.400]   It's interesting.
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:46.040]   I read the Vogue article on Think on Friday.
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:47.200]   And the link I had--
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:50.560]   That's not a phrase I ever thought I'd hear on the show.
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:52.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:54.360]   I read the Vogue article.
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:56.280]   You buy it for the articles, yes.
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:52:00.240]   But it's funny because I read so much on the internet.
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:02.440]   I tend to think of this publication, that public.
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:04.040]   I mean, I know Vogue and everything, right?
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:06.400]   But I clicked on the link, and I read the article,
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:07.840]   and it was only the article.
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:09.120]   There was no pictures or anything.
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:12.760]   So I actually had this weird experience where I went in.
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:14.120]   I read the article critically.
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:15.200]   That's it, right?
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:16.800]   So I read the article critically,
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:18.200]   and I'm actually going through the article.
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:19.120]   Is that right there?
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:19.920]   What do I think about this?
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:20.440]   What did that?
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:22.640]   And I thought overall it was a good piece or whatever.
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:26.320]   I didn't see the couch thing at all until yesterday, which,
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:28.720]   by the way, I recreated on Twitter myself
[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:30.120]   because I have that couch.
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:32.480]   Oh, wow.
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:35.360]   Not exactly, but I have a couch with that kind of thing.
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:38.440]   So it's a few tweets back I did yesterday.
[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:40.960]   And that is a really hard pose to hold.
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:42.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:44.400]   So it's just Rupert Murdoch.
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:45.920]   I don't know how much you did it because--
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:50.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:54.200]   You know, Danny, they have trained professional photographers,
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:57.440]   lighting technicians, makeup artists.
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:00.000]   You just-- you can't duplicate that at home.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:00.840]   And that's it.
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:03.040]   Let me tell you, my wife's like, no, you got to hold the eye.
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:04.920]   But this way, I'm like, oh.
[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:08.200]   So, you know, first of all, I thought it was a great picture.
[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:09.240]   And it went with a great article.
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:11.080]   And, you know, who cares if we want to pose it whenever?
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:12.000]   OK.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.480]   So who said this?
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:15.720]   Danny Sullivan Marissa Meyer.
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:17.200]   I really like even numbers.
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:18.960]   And I like heavily divisible numbers.
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:20.520]   12 is my lucky number.
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:22.480]   I just love how divisible it is.
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:23.640]   I don't like odd numbers.
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:25.560]   And I really don't like primes.
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:28.280]   When I turned 37, I put on a strong face.
[01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:30.360]   But I was not looking forward to 37.
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:33.360]   But 37 turned out to be a pretty amazing year,
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:37.520]   especially considering that 36 is divisible by 12.
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:38.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:39.760]   Wow.
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:42.680]   That's the lead in the Vogue piece.
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:43.160]   Wow.
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:45.480]   She may have regretted that particular quote.
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:48.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:51.720]   She's not regretting anything today, man.
[01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:52.720]   She's not regret.
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:57.680]   She is Coco Chanel for our day.
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:00.640]   No, I think it's-- I bet you it's intentional that Marissa
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:03.560]   Meyer is saying, just as she had her baby
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:07.600]   and took the job at CEO, that you can have everything
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:11.440]   and that women shouldn't be kept out of the boardroom
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:15.240]   or out of the fashion week.
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:16.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:18.680]   You can have it all.
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:20.960]   And I'm wearing heels from now on.
[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:22.680]   I don't know if you saw-- we have to--
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:24.280]   --we have to take the women in leadership positions.
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:27.240]   I think that there are women who play it kind of like one
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:27.880]   of the guys.
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:29.920]   And I think there are women who are like,
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:33.080]   like being sort of conventional-- like have conventional female
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:35.320]   interests, fashion, whatever.
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:38.000]   I think it's great that she is--
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.320]   that she's being who she is.
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:39.840]   I did, too.
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:41.840]   And she's one representation, one way
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.760]   that you can be a woman in a leadership position.
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:45.120]   Exactly.
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:47.680]   I'm not into fashion, but rock on, Marissa.
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:49.000]   That's what I say.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.680]   It's, I think, postmodern feminism, I hope.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:56.360]   And I think role models for women in both technology
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:59.800]   and corporate leadership is important.
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:02.600]   And however you-- what was the story?
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:04.960]   We quoted about a month ago of the woman who's
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:08.160]   high up in Google who dressed like a geek.
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:08.680]   Right.
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:09.840]   She finally decided enough, right?
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:10.200]   Perfect.
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:11.120]   Yes.
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:12.560]   And I salute that.
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:12.840]   Right?
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:13.840]   You can be yourself.
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:14.800]   You can be in technology.
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:15.600]   You can be in leadership.
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:16.800]   And you can also be yourself.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:17.680]   Whatever that is.
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:20.280]   And I just want everyone to know, I don't like sports.
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:22.600]   I don't drink beer.
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:24.200]   And I don't like cars.
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:25.200]   So there.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:25.800]   Because you're a queen.
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:27.000]   We just-- we just have to eat.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:31.720]   I would love some blue suede pumps.
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:33.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:35.280]   Let's take a look.
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:38.480]   Anyway, congratulations.
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:41.080]   I think you could pretty clearly point to Marissa Meyer
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:43.000]   and say that the strategy is working at Yahoo
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.840]   with these numbers.
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:45.800]   I really think--
[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:47.040]   Those numbers are incredible.
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:47.560]   Yeah.
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:48.680]   It's a little hard for me to believe.
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:50.520]   I just don't spend a lot of time at Yahoo.
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:52.960]   But I don't think any of us do.
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:54.480]   But I don't think they're representative.
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:55.680]   Real people do.
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:56.880]   Yes.
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:57.880]   Real people do.
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:55:58.380]   Yep.
[01:55:58.380 --> 01:55:59.560]   I use Flickr.
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:00.720]   I like it in Flickr pretty often.
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:02.240]   So I'm on one of those numbers.
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:02.760]   Yep.
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:03.560]   It's good.
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:03.840]   All right.
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.240]   Well, that's fair.
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:08.240]   Another great regular on the show, Danny Sullivan,
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:09.800]   from search engine land.com.
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:12.800]   Well, I hope you've enjoyed our little look back.
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:14.640]   We had some fun, didn't we, in 2013.
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:17.880]   I look forward to having a great 2014 with Jeff, Gina,
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:18.800]   and you.
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:21.360]   If you enjoy our show, are we going
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:24.400]   to be on the same time as before starting in the New Year?
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:26.040]   This twig is not moving, right?
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:26.380]   All right.
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:27.640]   Chad Johnson tells me.
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:30.880]   It will still be Wednesday afternoons, 1 PM Pacific, 4 PM
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:32.720]   Eastern time.
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:35.720]   That is 2100 UTC every Wednesday.
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:37.560]   Please stop by and watch live if you can't, though.
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:40.920]   We have on demand audio and video always after the fact.
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:43.720]   And our website, twig.
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:47.400]   Have a very, very merry Festivus.
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:50.360]   And I will see you back here next year.
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:50.800]   Take care.
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:53.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:56.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:59.540]   (upbeat music)
