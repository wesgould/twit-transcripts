[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.360]   Trappani, her monthly appearance. So glad to see you Gina. Great to be here. Hi. I am
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.840]   thrilled to have you back. Everything going well in New York. You ready for
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.720]   another winner? Actually it's 57 degrees today. It's not yeah it's not bad today
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.600]   although my basement is a little bit chilly but I'm you know already I'm
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.240]   already kind of like 10 stop and you know breaking out the big boots and
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.760]   everything I'm ready. I'm ready for a tough winter. Well you and I guess it
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.120]   turned out I had the worst winner in decades last year. Yeah you deserve a
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.520]   break. Maybe it'll be good. Thank you from your mouth. Look at the weather
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.800]   gods. Jeff Jarvis is also here from the City University of New York Buzz
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.040]   Machine.com and look at his new light. He shines with his book. That magic. That
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.280]   was a Kickstarter huh? Yeah I think so. Yeah nice. The Lumio something rather mini
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.760]   book light which we found immediately for 40 bucks on Amazon. It's Chinese. I've
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.200]   been a hundred bucks for it. I'll have mine any day now. Hey look it's Mike
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.160]   Elgin. Great to see you too Mike. Great to be here. I have I sadly say
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.040]   formally our news director and a host of TNT but Mike is is back to his
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.240]   parapetetic ways but I'm thrilled that you you will be here from as regularly as
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.600]   we can get you in here. Anytime I love the show. Yeah we love him and I I
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.400]   listen to every single word spoken on the show and you haven't given up on
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.680]   Google Plus yet. I passed five million about 10 minutes ago. Did you really know?
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.520]   Congratulations. That's a lot. I'm right under Ariana Huffington. Well you should be on top of
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.840]   Ariana when they're I think that's trouble. That's not going both that way. And no but it's
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.320]   it's and you know if we get the chance to talk about Google Plus it's an
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.400]   interesting time for Google Plus. It's in transition. Let's very much so. We lost
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.240]   another we lost another. I'm a citizen. Danny Sullivan announced a couple hours
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.560]   ago that he's like yeah I'm done with Google Plus. Yeah I know ever I know I've
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.960]   learned that lesson. I did that with Twitter once and with Facebook once and
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.320]   that you silly to say you're done with it. Well he he said I'll post occasionally
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.520]   but he doesn't like the redesign. A lot of people don't like. Oh really? Yeah. That's
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.560]   about the redesign. You know I haven't heard what does Scoble say? Scoble hasn't
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.280]   been on Google Plus in ages I don't think. Let me just say he's he went all
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.200]   in on Facebook I think. Yeah. There's a group though I've never been kissed by
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:23.560]   Scoble. That's good. I'm a proud member myself. He's got 7.2 million followers but
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.880]   that's Scoble. That's the Scoble. That's the Scoble. Scoble number. Yes. Two
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.360]   days ago is his last post. He doesn't he's not super active here. Yeah. Then three
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.960]   weeks two weeks. Yeah he's not super active. In fact this the only thing he's
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.920]   posting about looks like his email newsletter. Yeah. He's a Facebook guy. Yep.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.640]   And one of the things that that I'm gonna be writing a you know hey I just
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.520]   passed five million followers post and one of the things that's interesting is
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.280]   Lady Gaga's coming up on 10 million followers and that a geek like me can
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.480]   get half as many followers as the number one user who's a celebrity. Yeah
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.440]   because it's a testament I think to certain extent of the fact that it's not
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.840]   a fluffy yeah celebrity driven social network like all the other social
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:18.080]   networks. So there's that. You're also using. He's got that post. Not yet.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.480]   Sorry. There's another statement there. It'll be up in a few hours. Yeah. Kim Kardashian
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   is she posted. I don't know. I don't know. She out there. You know what Mike also has
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.040]   four collections. More maybe more than that. Yep. But I'm not following them all of them.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.920]   So that's that's great. Yeah. And so it's food and technology and and the
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.480]   Department of Dumb. Department of Dumb is one of I love that one because any
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.000]   stupid thing I find it throw it in there and if you can't stomach stupid things
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.040]   then you know you don't follow the Department of Dumb. Yeah. Yeah. But it's
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.160]   it's a it's a it's in a weird place I think that it has a future as an
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.600]   alternative to Reddit slash Pinterest. Yeah. And does not have a future as an
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.200]   alternative to Facebook or Twitter. But that's fine. It's it's a it's a it's in a
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.360]   weird place because right now it's for two kinds of people. It's for people who
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.520]   really enthusiastic about something obscure or not obscure. It's a great
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.760]   place for people who are you know to get together and do the original thing that
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.760]   people used to do on the well and all you know all the great social sites. I
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.400]   was a member of the well. Was your handle on the book? I don't remember. I
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.600]   have no I have no people like three letter handles. They were very short
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.640]   handles. But it was kind of exclusive. It was there were a lot of great heavy
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.560]   conversations and there's there's a lot of that in Google+ and then there's
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.080]   this universe of English as a second language. Yeah that's a little weird.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.000]   They're anticipating well they participate in a strange way as you
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.760]   mentioned last time you were on they say hi. Yeah or something like that or
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.440]   you know they're I feel like those are maybe budding spammers. I think it's
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.520]   because Google pushes Google+ internationally and then people join it on
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.320]   their phones and they don't really they haven't really yeah they don't get the
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.080]   culture. They don't understand. Yeah exactly. And they're on low bandwidth
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.920]   connections maybe and you know this is not for low bandwidth. No I'm happy
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:17.000]   if Google+ finds a niche. I'd be very happy. Yeah. Yeah. All right look what I got.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.680]   I got a big box huh and it and it came from the Googleplex so I figure either
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.960]   this is a Christmas gift from Larry Page. You know this actually could be I
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.040]   still haven't got my Lego my Lego from Google 5 so it's either it's awfully big.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.560]   It's either Google 5 Lego castle. This would be an over this would be
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:49.160]   overkill on the box or let's see. It's a really fat pixel C. It could be it. Oh it
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:56.480]   actually no C keyboard. Oh you did get it. You jerk. I ordered it at the same time as you.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:03.040]   You ordered it after me. But I did expedited shipping. So did I. So it might
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.680]   have probably appear. See in the brick house. No I think did you have one
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.160]   yesterday. Ron. No we didn't have one in studio. No. So this is the first one.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.640]   Yeah. A lot of the Google journalists like Ron and Mario got review units but
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.800]   you know in gadget the verge they didn't they weren't crazy. Ron weren't crazy
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.200]   about it. They said there were hesitation there were issues and I'm
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.880]   wondering sometimes you get pre-production models with the review units.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.320]   You don't get the production model. Some hoping that the production model won't
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:37.720]   be mine's minds out. I'm not going to get yours. I can't believe I got this this
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.760]   fast. I'm excited that it could be used as a fridge magnet. There's so many
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.760]   magnets in it you can just. They're very powerful to and you know we'll see how
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.000]   long it takes me to get used to the weird dance you have to do to make the
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.880]   because I got the magnetic keyboard you Jason got the portfolio. Yeah I think I
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:04.440]   probably got the wrong one but yeah yeah this is the one that does the magnetic
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:10.160]   dance. Yeah. I'm so jealous. And the coolest feature. The one that I the feature I
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.680]   wish everybody would copy on this is the fact that it wirelessly charges the
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.840]   keyboard when it's stuck to the tablet. Well you know it's interesting about
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.280]   Apple's Pogo pins is they don't even bother charging it just powers the
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:27.280]   keyboard. Right. And that that's how the Apple pencil should charge. It should stick
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.680]   to the side and charge. Wouldn't that be nice. It'd be great. Yeah. Easy for me to
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.600]   say. Break in the shrink wrap. There's so exciting about just opening up new boxes.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.520]   I know it's Christmas came early for me. There was a story I think the New York
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.200]   Times about unboxing as a marketing phenomenon now for all kinds of brands
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.680]   and I'm happy they had on that. Yeah I hate to say I think unboxing is over.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:54.040]   I think unboxing is a new thing and the New York Times is on it. Let's get started.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:10:03.880]   Plug. Oh it's a kind of fine print and one whole column is in French. Let's do that one.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.040]   Avid de cicullet de comes on all the shallow.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:16.520]   So there's the plug. This is type C of course right. Yep. Yep. Yep. And you want to plug that in
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.720]   John. I don't know if I'm going to need it. Pre-easily these things come with enough juice that I can
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.560]   just turn it on. People have said that it reminds them a lot of the
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:30.840]   pixel the Chromebook pixel and it's styling. Let's take a look. Yes. Which was what I like about it.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:36.680]   I just always process it more if it was in fact a pixel. Jason you just you know.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:42.520]   Well I'm trying to figure it out like you orders your your's a good after you. A couple hours after
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.000]   me. Is it the folio keyboard that's part of my package? Yeah you got the folio and I got the
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.480]   that is throwing it off. I don't know Jason I or the the official keyboard. Yeah I can see.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.760]   That was my mistake. I'm sorry you can have this though. No. I'll give this to you. It's cool.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.480]   This is going to be here today or tomorrow. I can wait. All right. So it is kind of
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:09.160]   pixel-y. It's squared a little bit with some rounding. Metal but metal back. Yeah it's that same
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:16.440]   color. Oh it's even got the. It's got the light. Kind of like ports eight megapixels of camera and
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:22.760]   it's a Tink C port on off switch. So don't think that's a light on the bed. Oh yes it is. Well no no
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:29.080]   they got to have a headphone jack. But that's it. It's kind of like the Apple MacBook. It's very
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.880]   square. It does look very pixel-y. Yeah. My brain is still broken on trying to get the Android
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:39.240]   donning on this thing. Well the knock. The knock really was that Android just doesn't have the tablet
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:44.920]   apps. Yeah. And that this would be fine but it doesn't do what you really wish it would do as a
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.960]   laptop replacement which is multi-windows right. Even though that is apparently built into marshmallow
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.640]   there's code in there we just they haven't turned it on. So I think this is going to be a machine
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:59.160]   that next year will start to start to really live up to its potential right. But who is this for?
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:06.520]   Market is this for? Smacks like me. Google fans right. Traveling writers.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.800]   I actually think that's a that's a legitimate. Right because Jeff like you're a huge Chromebook
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:17.320]   fan because you travel a bunch and you write. And I watch movies of my sevenish. This stops me
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.960]   from having to carry my seven inch and my Chromebook could be a lot lighter. My office I'll still use
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:27.000]   my big Chromebook but but when I'm for briefcase my hope is this is my briefcase machine.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.440]   Okay so this is the thing that people said was tricky.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:39.080]   You kind of have to lay it down and put it down. I've seen there's video of it. There's video it shows
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:47.880]   you slide tablet to the side flip tablet over. So I just put it on here to start.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:54.680]   No that's not the start. That's to close it. Okay to do that to do this you slide it to the side.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.200]   Maybe I did it wrong. Let's do it this way.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:04.200]   All right this is the way the magnets want to go.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:09.160]   Slide tablet decide to break the magnet right break the tablet over.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:17.720]   Touch it to the back of the keyboard and then snap and then pull it up. Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.480]   I like that. And by the way multi-angle. Yep.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:27.880]   Which is I think really good. That was something it took at Microsoft to wild understand and Apple
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:35.800]   still doesn't understand. It says type the pairing code 474271. Am I not?
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:41.000]   Might have been bother with that. Yeah it's an old Bluetooth habit right but I didn't but maybe
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:49.880]   it's not yet. It's really on there. I mean I think I must be doing it right. How's the build
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:57.640]   quality on the way you've seen so far? That was pretty solid. Yeah it looks good. Here you be the
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:03.720]   judge Mike. Yeah it's top heavy which is the same problem Microsoft had with the Surface book
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.760]   which is that the top felt heavy. Right it's the build quality is great. It feels very much
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.600]   in the league of a crumb of pixel. Can you one hand the keyboard?
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:18.440]   What's that mean? Like you hold it by the keyboard just the keyboard. Oh yeah. Yeah that's a heck
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.200]   of a like turn it upside down. You said I don't know this. I'll just go ahead and. Yeah just
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.840]   so small. I can bring myself to do it but you can't. Really on there. No it's a heck of a magnet.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:35.480]   It's like whoa. Yeah. Hey okay then thanks. So I mean it will actually snap to your refrigerator
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.120]   if you put it on the refrigerator. It will snap to it and and tightly stick there. Let me plug
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:45.960]   the I don't need to but I'm gonna plug the connector in and then don't look. I'm okay. Don't look.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:53.400]   I'm gonna type the password in. I love how the pixel light kind of tells you what's going on
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.480]   how it flashes red when you need battery. It just flashed yellow when you plugged it in. It's like
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:05.400]   it's a nice subtle. The pairing hasn't happened. Really? Yeah. Is the keyboard on? Is it on off switch?
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:16.040]   Wow you know that's okay let's let's do it again. Let's do it again. Okay you slide to break it.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:21.400]   You put it over here like that. There's no other way that you get this attachment.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.920]   And then there's like that. Yeah you know I ordered the portfolio and then I canceled
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.640]   because I think we had decided yesterday. Yeah. You got to get this keyboard. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:39.800]   Then we're just entering. Okay maybe I didn't do that right. I don't know. Let's try this one more time.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:48.200]   Pay no attention to the password I'm about to enter. I said pay no attention to the password.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.800]   Oh sorry. There we go. Sorry I was placing an order on the play store.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:01.560]   Look priorities you guys. Kind of want that. I think Jason should be able to leave his
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.480]   workstation version a second and come over and touch it. I have to say having used the
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.240]   iPad now with a keyboard which I didn't for a long time. It's really nice to have a keyboard.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.840]   Yes. Yeah. Makes a big difference. Yeah. On screen keyboards are not as good. That's right.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.800]   And this you know this is I've seen so many people use their iPad like Harry McCracken you
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.200]   and others who come in with this you know the Belkin or whatever and this is nice.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.040]   I mean I'm eager to for you to type on it. You know a paragraph.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.480]   That's how you feel. Your tablet needs to download and update and restart.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:37.240]   I wonder though if that's the thing that maybe related to the problems people are having with
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.800]   hesitation and other stuff. Yeah you know and it's not a good time to come out with a device like
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.480]   this that has hesitation problems or other problems because the iPad Pro is so good.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:53.000]   The surface is so good. It's in its fourth generation. It's totally mature.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.240]   And the whole problem of having a keyboard with a tablet is not a hard problem. Any Bluetooth
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:05.320]   keyboard would pretty much work with any tablet. It's just a question of propping up the tablet
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.720]   while you use the keyboard and that's not a difficult problem to solve. So it's you know a lot of
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:15.160]   this is not necessary. It's just kind of cool. You know what upsets me about it?
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:20.440]   What? No well no LTE. Yeah yeah that's hot. It's an Android device.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.040]   Why the heck can I use cellular connectivity? Even the Chromebook Pixel.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:29.480]   Oh I don't know what really upsets me too. Yeah but I wonder if they're saying well we figure you
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:35.640]   all have LTE on your phones now you just hot spot your phone. Why should you? Why should you pay for
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:42.440]   two different options? I don't because I have the AT&T unlimited so I have my karma which is great.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:48.920]   It's very nice but I gotta find the damn thing get it out turn it on. But they're 90. Yeah Jeff
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.640]   they're 95% of the way there just you know allow me to just connect the LTE and it's just a perfect
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.120]   experience. Open it up and use it. Yeah I think they're just I think they just don't want to deal
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.440]   with the carriers at all on a device. So they're like yeah that's their trouble bingo.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.200]   Well I'm gonna talk to those guys. Yeah. Now by the way these programmers are not going to like
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:14.280]   this because there's no tilde key and there's no bracket key. So to make the key yeah I know.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.680]   You have to get it through a uh it's probably a command. Yeah there's probably a command.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.680]   They just lost the Google employee. Well yeah I need the tilde key and the
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:29.000]   that a square bracket. Who's got a program on an Android device? Well I want to. You could.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.680]   You could. I don't there's no reason not. And that's that's the I think that's why people are upset
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:40.040]   that you don't have uh uh split windows and that kind of thing. I think people would really like to
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:46.200]   see these devices be full fledged. Yes. At least as as full fledges at Chromebook Pixel maybe even
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:51.160]   more so. Right. Yeah absolutely. Because they got apps. The whole point of Android is flexibility.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:57.560]   So why couldn't this have come with Chrome OS? Because I think this is more capable because you
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:05.080]   have this millions app app store. Chrome does not have the funny thing. The reviews complained that
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:10.120]   they're not tablets mobile. Yeah the mobile apps aren't good enough and that and that you know in
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:16.040]   Chrome you had the best of both worlds. This is like a little laptop as it is. And if the OS would
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:22.680]   give you the you know I mean I think oh you could make a case that Android is like a desktop OS.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.880]   Much more so than Chrome OS. I mean it's it's got an app. It's got a huge variety of apps.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:33.800]   They need to make the apps and and I mean you know you're the expert on this. It's completely
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:40.440]   possible to make apps that work both on a phone and a tablet. Yeah. Yeah. But they just maybe there
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.440]   hasn't I don't know. There just hasn't been a drive to do that. There's plenty of Android tablets.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:50.280]   I mean there's plenty of Android tablets and Google like definitely pushes developers to do so.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.840]   I'm actually I'm doing a Udacity the Udacity Nanodegree for Android and tablet layout is in
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.320]   literally like is in this first section. Like they're pushing it. It's right you know it's it's
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:06.120]   actually before before material. So you know just and I think introducing that basic concept of
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.800]   you've got these different screen sizes and this is how you have to design your layouts for these
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.320]   different screen sizes like in the wireframe phase. I think that's something that Google really is
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:19.960]   trying to you know get developers to do but you know I don't know it adds more complexity and
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.720]   some more code and some more layout issues to each app but it's not difficult.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:29.480]   Florence Ion just tweeted she's watching the Reddit AMA and apparently in there they said Android
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:36.600]   and the next generation will feature tablet optimization. But that's I mean when is that
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:42.040]   that's a year off. Yeah we'll hear about it in a couple of months at IO.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:47.320]   And it'll seem not so far away. Say that again the next version of Android will feature tablet
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.320]   optimization and as in oh and I gotcha. I'm guessing it's gonna be Nutella Nutella.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.920]   Nutella. It should be Nutella. It's not a should nougat. That's a brand though.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.760]   Yeah well they've known it before. Yeah.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:05.480]   No no caps lock it's replaced as it is on the Chromebook pixel with a search button that's how
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:10.360]   it was that I hope you can you can just change I hope well do you want caps lock I guess you
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.720]   write a lot you might want. Oh yeah one caps lock I especially use your own a pencil.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:23.080]   I have another thing is I'm not like something. I'm sorry that's my my my impression of Jeff Jarvis.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:32.520]   But no you probably do. All right anyway there it is that's a little unboxing of the
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.200]   Chromebook pixel. Maybe they're one of the reasons the keyboard didn't respond right
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:41.480]   away because it does have to get juice so maybe it had enough juice. It's updating right now.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:47.080]   This is a strong magnet. It's much stronger than I anticipated. I mean this is this is almost as if
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.920]   it's a one piece device now. You can turn upside down and use it as a hover board if you have a
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.560]   metal yeah skateboard park or you could put your book light inside it and have it.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:03.320]   I like it that the angle is variable. Oh but you do pry it off if you go too far. That's okay though.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:10.440]   That's pretty cool you can go that flat completely flat. I wonder how that whole hinge
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.360]   thing and the magnets and everything are going to be in two years. Three years yeah.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:19.640]   Yeah well when you want to just watch it as a tablet how does the keyboard stone how does that
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:25.240]   work. You take it off. I know that no but you're supposed to be able to put it either use the
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:29.160]   keyboard as a case or you can kind of hide the keyboards you can still use it as a cap.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.800]   Boy that is it. Feel how tight that hinges. It's got to be right because you're touching it.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:41.480]   Right. So then I could could I just do this. Yeah yeah it's kind of a little on Lucy goosey
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:46.360]   a little bit but the magnets do kind of snap in which is kind of neat. So you could do it like
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.920]   that if you want. I'm looking forward to watching a movie on it. Do you lay it flat to use it?
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:57.880]   So this is the way you do it you go like that and then boom that's actually not hard. Yeah
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:06.840]   All right well it finally came the Chromebook Pixel C and maybe the reason it was delayed is
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:13.400]   it wasn't ready and it maybe still isn't ready but they got to get it out they said they will.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:18.840]   Yeah yeah it is pricey too. I mean it's uh that's the thing who's going to buy the who's going to
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:25.560]   shell out that kind of dough. 800 bucks yeah yeah yeah although size you two years I spent
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:33.160]   $950 on an iPad Pro and without the keyboard. I know stuff's expensive.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:39.400]   The pen didn't come out yet though did it? Yeah yeah it's out. Oh did you get it? I got the pen.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:45.320]   Yeah I like the pen and then I was just showing this on Windows weekly. Paul Thorett recommended
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:51.160]   a hundred dollar PC that you plug into the iPad and now the iPad is a Windows machine.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:57.400]   Same price is the pencil. Yeah for the same price you pay for the pencil you can also have Windows 10.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:03.640]   It's only 10, 20, 20, 40, 70. Now there's a small market but people who want to run Windows 10 on
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.040]   their iPad Pro. But think about it you could be traveling around with an iPad Pro and it's not
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.920]   much bigger than a smartphone in your pocket and that turns it into a full-fledged Windows computer.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.400]   I mean that's you know there's some reason you might want to do that. I don't know.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:21.480]   The company's paying for everything that's the reason because the company said you could
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:28.040]   write. Well that's an interesting question. Would this be a suitable product for a company computer?
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:34.440]   If all you had to do was email and you know on the road and surf and stuff maybe it would be
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:40.280]   the pixels. Now I'll load it up Android Android at work. The form factor is great for a tray table.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.600]   Yeah coach, coach, tray table. Yeah the screen is a little bit forward.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:51.880]   So I'm liking it and as everybody in all the reviews said the hardware is great.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.200]   Superlative. Well Gonna count on you in a time.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:25:00.840]   Yeah you know what this is like a real keyboard. Here you're the writer. Let's let
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:09.080]   do it because he's the writer. It's not like the apple very solid flat keys. It feels like a real
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.520]   keyboard doesn't it? Yeah it's nice. You can get used to it's dish travel. It's different.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.360]   It's a learning curve but yeah it's this key travel. There are arrow keys. There's no trackpad
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:21.320]   obviously. It's similar it's very similar to like an apple bluetooth keyboard. It's the same shape
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:26.760]   of the keys. Yes. I like that flat thing. So yeah. Yeah. Oh look it's upgrading. Yeah.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:31.480]   We're getting the new Android. Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh it's done now. Select a Wi-Fi network
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.880]   connecting. I guess our update is done so I'll just let it sit here for a while and
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:42.680]   this can take a while. Is that what it is? Yeah. Well thank you. It's better than Microsoft.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:47.480]   Microsoft's on its upgrade says don't worry all your files are safe which makes me worry.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:56.120]   Right. What are you? It's like I wasn't. Don't worry. You can trust us. You can trust us. It's cool.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.280]   Everything's still there. It's going to be okay. If you use another Android device quickly copy
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.720]   your current setup yeah I always want to do that right just I'll upgrade to put all the I got 64
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.680]   gigs. You know you know by the way when I switched to my new phone the one thing that
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:13.240]   upsets me is fine. It moves all of the apps over but it doesn't move my settings.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:19.800]   Oops not the Google plus. When do it's in their own. You know I should do that. Let's see.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:26.600]   It says open this is a new experience. Open the Google app. Are you talking about app settings
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:31.000]   or are you talking about system settings Jeff? That's the Google now. App settings. App settings
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.760]   is a feature in Marshmallow but developers need to get on board with it. So a you got to be running
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:44.120]   Marshmallow be the developers have to program to it I believe to say yes these these parts of the
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:50.520]   app can be backed up say already oh watch this. Okay Google set up my device.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:27:00.520]   Getting started to set up your device your phone's Bluetooth and your Wi-Fi date will be used next.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:06.680]   Searching for devices apparently it's going to see the pixel see on the list and then I could just
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:13.080]   yep follow the on screen instructions connecting to you forever to find the Google app settings
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.720]   as opposed to the yeah I don't know when they say open Google what do you mean open Google it's always
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:25.480]   up. Life is Google. I think that's superfluous I think if you just said okay Google set up my device
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.680]   it would probably do it. Yeah I wasted a half an hour trying to find that when I got the phone.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:38.360]   What are you talking about? By the way I love this phone it's working very well but when I when
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:45.160]   I want to reboot it and turn it on this case the one with the fabric kick somehow pushes down
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:49.960]   the one of the volume buttons just enough so every time I if I just use the case and hold down the
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:57.320]   on off button it wants to go into safe mode. Okay this crashed case back trying again.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.520]   I crashed yeah nice.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:06.680]   Let's try again I'll just put it right here. It's not the way you're holding it Jeff the case is
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.960]   actually leaning on the on the volume button. I guess so just enough and so yeah so it gets
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.880]   that it gets like this frightening her ability this is no command and the little broken thing
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:21.640]   went wrong. Your case is holding it wrong. This is not encouraging so twice now something has gone
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:27.640]   wrong. This is one of those Google experiences that when it works is absolutely magical and when
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.040]   it doesn't you're like you all live. It's probably because I have some programming compatible program
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.600]   running. I mean another program crashed too so. Don't blame the victim. I'm the victim here.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:43.800]   I'm blaming myself it's okay. Well while my while my devices are trying to mate let's talk about my
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:51.000]   mattress. Yes he's crashed again but you know I know how to set up what's funny is I know how
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.720]   to set up a Google device. I don't really need to do this. It's what is just worse having somebody
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:04.760]   do it the manual way or having an automatic way that fails. It's at the end it's the same.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.640]   You're doing it the manual way. I'm gonna do it the manual way now right after being frustrated.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:18.840]   You can teach a pig to sing. Our show today brought to you by Casper the online retailer of premium
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:27.240]   mattresses and yet another great product disintermediating the middleman eliminating the huge markup
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.440]   at a mattress store selling direct to you from the factory. The factory is a US factory making a
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:39.000]   premium mattress kind of obsessively engineered bringing in latex and memory foam together
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.280]   in a way you've never experienced before because the memory foam is the bottom so that's the firmness
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:48.920]   but the give and then the top is the latex and it just works great. It comes in a box this is a
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:53.240]   queen mattress in this box if you're watching the video. I opened it. We got this at home I opened it
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:30:00.840]   up. I was in my jammies because I thought well I gotta try it out. We actually I ended up I've
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:05.480]   been buying Casper mattresses for others in my family because they're really great. My son has
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:13.960]   one at college. Debbie's son our nephew has one. It's a comfortable mattress with just the right
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:19.240]   sink and bounce and here's the best part. You don't have to try it in a store. You don't have to
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:25.000]   line it for five minutes and make that lifetime decision. You can get it home free delivery
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.880]   lying for a hundred nights and if at any time in those first hundred nights you say yeah it's not
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:35.480]   for me. They'll come and get it. They'll give you all your money back. No cost no harm no foul.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.440]   It is really a great way to buy a mattress. I have love with my Casper mattress and boy because
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:46.600]   you're getting it from the factory the price is really fair. $500 for a twin. $950 for their biggest
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:55.400]   king size. Huge huge difference because they don't have the markup. Casper.com/twig will get you 50
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:00.040]   bucks off as a member of our audience some terms and conditions apply for details about that. Go to
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:08.520]   Casper.com/terms. Casper.com/twig use the promo code twig save $50 on your new mattress.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:14.520]   Yeah now the thank you Casper by the way for supporting this weekend Google. Now the manual
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:19.560]   process just started up. It said all right I get it. It's just not working is it? So I'll do the
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:24.280]   normal thing which isn't so bad. You log into your Google account. It has all my settings there.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.680]   What was it we used to be able to get where it would do all that before you got it?
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.040]   Was that a really next to code of make X?
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:40.360]   It would come pre-configured for your account. Yeah that was cool. With a desktop image that
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:45.480]   you pre-selected and have your name in it. Oh that's right. They don't do that anymore though I don't
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:50.520]   think. I'm not sure. They still have the Moto maker thing. It's all in China now instead of
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.560]   yeah I don't think you get the maybe you do. Do you get your Google account pre-configured and all
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:32:01.000]   that maybe you do. That's what Amazon does right on your all your Amazon devices come
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.440]   knowing everything there is to know about you. Everything that you've purchased is like 22.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:12.760]   Yeah and your credit card which was weird because they sent us to review units that were pre-configured
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.640]   with my credit card. Right I really like that. Yeah it was like a field day ordering stuff. Yeah
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:23.560]   Wow thank you Amazon. That made it a lot easier. Now people.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:30.440]   For everybody. Now everybody knows why there are 18 fires in here. But you know people are comparing
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.920]   this to you know the iPad Pro and stuff but another comparison is with the Chromebook Pixel and think
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.280]   about how easy the out-of-the-box experience is with Chromebook Pixel. I know. I know.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:45.000]   Chromo I said. Just log in. Yeah it hasn't nailed. Right. It really does. You know that's a really good
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.440]   point. And I feel worried about this. Yeah I feel that they want to emphasize the android devices
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:54.440]   and not the Chromebook but they got a great thing going with the Chromebook. They really do.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.680]   I know we're probably going to talk in the show about Chromebook in education. Well we can do
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:05.400]   that right now. They're huge. We're 50 percent. Yes from from four years ago the percentage was one
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:10.440]   and now they've completely taken over that market. For obvious reasons. If you're a school
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:15.160]   you don't have money. You don't have a lot of resources for managing devices and all that kind
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:19.880]   of stuff. You're worried about security. The Chromebook Pixel handles all of that just out of the box.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:25.640]   We talked last week about the EFF's lawsuit because of course EFF says with a Chromebook
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:31.000]   you're logging into your Google account and there's some and Google storing your students'
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.520]   information. There's some privacy issues. You know it's great because Matt Cutz was on that show
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:38.440]   from Google. Yeah. And he said that you know thank you EFF for pointing this out. We're going to we'll
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:43.160]   make you know I'm sure we're going to fix this. But it is kind of you think about somebody's
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.560]   got a store somewhere right. Well yeah it's the cloud. It's the cloud. It was an attack on the
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:52.200]   cloud model not on that device. I think that's probably the case. Yeah. And so it's really
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:58.520]   naive. It's really again we love the EFF but it was it came off as naive because how do you expect
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:03.560]   it to work? Right. You had hard drives for every student. You know that they were past that. This
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:09.800]   is the cloud. It was the fact the whole point of moving to Chromebooks is that was it you who pointed
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.880]   out somebody pointed out that's the point. You can lose your Chromebook. Right. Log into the next one
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.760]   and as you say there's no setup it's ready. It's good. It's got everything you need.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:24.440]   Should I use a pattern, a pin or a password? That's one thing this doesn't have fingerprint.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:29.880]   Wish it did. I love that. Yeah but this big advice I think reaching behind with the fingerprint
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:34.680]   and all that. But you're right. When I use my Nexus 7 now it's weird that I have to use a pattern.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:39.080]   Oh I love it on the Nexus 6. It's just yeah I do too. It's great. I don't even turn it on. You
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:43.800]   just touch it. And they're so fast now that it's almost too fast. Like you accidentally touch it
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:50.520]   and unlocks everything. I guess I'll do a pin because I do a pin on surface and all of that.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:56.280]   You know my iPad. So I'll use the same pin. This keyboard's nice.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:04.440]   To real keyboard. It's a real keyboard. It's really. Yeah. The hardware is very nice.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:12.600]   It is. So let's see. Restore from my Nexus 7, my Note 5, my Nexus 6p last use today. Let's do that.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:19.880]   All apps, 159 apps. Yep. This isn't so bad. And then you say yes I'm in on Google now.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:25.480]   And this isn't terrible. You have to log into your account. You know it's not so different.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:30.680]   And that'll be restoring for another hour. And in terms of the multifunctioning and all that.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:35.080]   You basically, since I'm used to operating only in Chrome, as long as I've got Chrome open on it,
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:40.600]   I figure it'll be okay. The only weird thing is that the Chrome handles tabs differently in Android.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:47.880]   Yeah. It does. It's Chrome and it's irritating. And sometimes you can go to a Chrome tab and it
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:53.320]   will force a refresh of that tab every time you skip to it instead of just leaving it as an instance
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:36:00.360]   in memory. Is it my imagination, Leo? Or is that does that logo look like a device with Donald Trump's
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:11.640]   hair? It's a comb over. It's done. Oh, wow. Oh, I love that. That's how you know it's marshmallow.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:18.520]   It's the marshmallow look. The split navigation buttons down at the bottom. That's one thing to
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:23.080]   notice. Oh, okay. So here's Recents and here's Home. That's actually a good idea. I've never
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:29.800]   seen a tablet do that. So the home is the home in the back or on the left, lower left corner as
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:33.640]   it's in landscape mode and on the lower right corner and landscape mode is the Recents button.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:39.880]   That's actually reasonable. Do wish it there must be. I wonder they said in some of the reviews,
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:49.480]   yes, there are secret key combinations. Why secret? Tell me. Because like on the iPad,
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:56.440]   control shift home, because of age goes home. I would love to see what the secrets are.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:03.240]   Doesn't do it on here. How about all age? Well, something happened. What's that? You stumble on
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:08.440]   a secret key store. What is it? It's the on screen keyboard. But there's no without keys.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:16.680]   A B C emoji. It's the on screen. Okay, so I hadn't chosen. So all right. So alt.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.840]   Hey, oh no, maybe that's just alt.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:26.040]   What? When you're in the keyboard, alt swaps between the emoji. You will. You will eat that
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:30.840]   when you want emoji. So all pops up the keyboard. Okay. Okay. There you go.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:37.960]   Oh, I see it pops up the emoji keyboard because there are no emoji keys on a physical keyboard.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.800]   Whatever you've used last. Still, there's something. Oh, no, it goes to emoji. You're right. That's
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:47.800]   the default. There's something funny though, about a hardware keyboard key that pops up an on screen
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:53.560]   keyboard. Yeah, it should. All right. I'm sending you the keyboard shortcuts. The old
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:38:01.400]   you found him. Did you use Google? Oh, look, oh, isn't that sweet? How retro? These are
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.040]   emoticons. Let's see. Those in a while in case you forgot them. Put it in the chat. Okay.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:14.280]   So there's a secret keyboard. These are says pixel. Now, is that the pick? Well,
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:22.120]   it says pixel C. Yes, it's part of pixel C. Okay. So general shortcuts. Home is search and
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:28.520]   enter unless you change search to search enter. Oh, I guess because well, yeah. Okay.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:37.960]   Overview is alt and tab searches at Google now, which is nice. I have to update. I'm still updating.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:44.680]   Search and then search enter is home. Okay. Oh, man, you got to use a search button for everything.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:50.920]   Oh, search is the medic. Search is the medic. So opens the browser search and be
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:57.160]   contact search and see email search and e. Oh, yeah, browser search be that's good.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:05.640]   Messenger search and be is the same as search and be is music app. They mess that up.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:13.240]   Calendar. No, they mess this up. So where'd you find all this? It's on that page. I said it's
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:18.040]   in the rundown. No, but I mean, I know, but I'm just asking where you go under general shortcuts.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:24.600]   Oh, there's like a help. There's like a page. Oh, it's not secret. Tells you how to get the
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:32.120]   brackets. I was mistaken. What's the dot dot? Yeah, right here. What does that do? Actually,
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:37.160]   that plus oh gets you a left bracket plus P also pulls up the keyboard. Oh, it's like a
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:42.920]   scientific and scientific stuff. Well, then hit. Oh, when you get the bracket, so do dot dot dot
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:48.520]   and then oh, when you get the bracket dot dot dot dot, oh, so there's a key dedicated to scientific
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:56.200]   symbols, but there isn't a key for caps lock. Shut up. I don't know what I'm doing now.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:06.520]   Okay, so if I do this and then oh, that's what it says. Yeah, bracket. Yeah, no, that's right.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:12.280]   Yeah, and P is the right bracket. Yeah. All right. So that and then one is tilde.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.440]   No, that and one does something else. And then for the Chrome app, it uses control as the key.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:23.080]   Why don't you use that tilde? You got to really want it. You have to want it.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.560]   All right. Well, anyway, nobody cares because nobody else has a pixel C, but
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:33.720]   I guess we did find a new key. I didn't even notice that, but there's that there's a weird kind of
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:39.480]   dot dot, dot, an ellipsis key. Yeah, mystery. And that pulls up scientific that pulls up
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.640]   stuff that oh, you know what that is? That stuff that's not on the keyboard. These are extra things
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:49.320]   that are not on the keyboards with that is the pixel team went on read at this morning to answer
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:54.680]   questions and says right is coming. Yeah, see, I think that's all I would say that's all it really
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:59.400]   needs. And then you just kind of at the mercy of developers by that's getting hot. Is it? Oh,
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:05.160]   yeah, really? Yeah, this is that new Tigrex one chip, which is it's actually what I think it's
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:11.400]   one of those weird chips. It's got two speeds to more uses day to day uses a slower one. But if
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:16.760]   it needs, it'll kick into high gear. It's also a hot plate and a heater. Yeah, nice. This is a good,
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:22.920]   a good palm warmer. Actually, it's all right up on the left side. I like it. And I think this is,
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:27.800]   I'm going to use this. I think I will use this. Cool. Yeah. And I'd love to see split screen.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:34.600]   So as you were saying, the pixel is very popular in schools according to the chromal
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:39.240]   key ring, the chrome, not the pixel, the Chromebook. Yeah, I doubt very much
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:46.760]   these are very expensive private. Yeah, more than half. And this is devastating.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:54.280]   Sort of for Apple and really devastating for Microsoft. And it also says the Chrome OS is not
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:42:00.600]   blown away. Right. That's right. It also has to be said though that the performance of the
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.960]   Chromebook in schools is a US phenomenon internationally. It's interesting. Well, it's down in the single
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.920]   digits and some some interest markets. But killing it in the US education market.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:15.000]   Well, I think more and more schools want to do a one-to-one program. So they sit down and say,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.600]   oh, by the way, that might be what the pixel C is all about. They sit down and they say,
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:27.560]   all right, we want to do a one-to-one program. Do we buy a Mac, a Windows, iPad, Chromebook?
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:33.000]   This what this is. Yeah, the old tablet versus laptop. Now you get this is that's what this is.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.400]   And it's not and nobody's going to buy that. But it's a demonstration project to show manufacturers.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.960]   Somebody quick make a cheap one of these like that lamp thing. Yeah, this is actually too expensive,
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:46.440]   isn't it? Yeah, I did. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a Chromebook pixel, but there are
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:51.400]   Chromebooks 200 bucks. Right. So that's that's interesting. I think schools do want,
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:57.000]   I think they very much want tablets. In fact, it breaks my heart whether our local school
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.400]   district here is doing a one-to-one program with iPads. Yeah. And they're just not, it's just a
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:05.800]   waste of money. It's just throwing away money. I think you're absolutely right. They do want tablets,
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:10.760]   but they shouldn't. They should want a $200 Chromebook, right, the keyboard and, you know,
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.440]   as a touchpad on it and all that kind of stuff. That's ideal for students. But essentially what
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:19.160]   they're doing is they're caving to student demands and generation of kids who grew up on smartphones.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.920]   Not even students parents. I really think parents are what determine this. And parents
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.520]   get all excited when they hear, oh, they're giving them iPads. That's so modern.
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:31.560]   Right. And if you're preparing them for the future, yes. So get a load of this on the Pixel
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:36.840]   help page. Recovering your Pixel C using a USB device is not supported. If you're having
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:43.320]   trouble recovering, please contact us. Oh, no, that's not good. But that will, but that's like
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.920]   an Android phone. You can recover an Android phone, right? I mean, you just have to know what you're
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:57.400]   doing. Oh, thanks. Did you order one, Mr. Jarvis? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. No, I'm just like, Jason,
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:03.080]   there I'm pissed at you. Well, they maybe they, you know, they didn't send me one as a review unit,
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:07.320]   so they felt bad. Yeah. And they said, well, let's get Leo's at the door. Go ahead. We just
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:12.840]   see that one that says Jason how on that other Jeff Jarvis one put that aside. I mean,
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:19.640]   why don't we go ahead and process that for a good 24 to 36 hours before we change that to
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:24.920]   shipping. Here's the real question. Yes. Did you pay for the top of the line delivery? Yeah.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.960]   Twenty two buck delivery. I just thought of something.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:37.640]   You can do Skype on a tablet. Skype is on this. I do the show. Yes. Of course you could.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:42.040]   Does that problem is I've got to get it? I'm just going to bring a little router so I can plug in
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:47.080]   a regular USB headset. Yeah. I have a device have any sort of plug in.
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.440]   Ethernet probably not. Yeah.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:55.960]   Wi-Fi only. There's that. Well, no, but you can you can do Ethernet through through your little
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:01.080]   router. I have one of those. I have I have a. Yeah, but that's not that's still Wi-Fi. I wonder if
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:04.200]   the oh through the seat. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you did this.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:09.480]   I bought one of these. But I don't know. Does that work? We don't know. Yeah, it does. This is this
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:15.240]   is this is what works with a Chromebook. We don't know if that'll work with the pixel. You got one
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:21.240]   hanging on. I bet. I don't know. It's a good portion. We will find out. We will find out indeed,
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:27.000]   but I would find out now if I had mine, but I don't. Alas. So basically what you're saying,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.880]   Jeff is Google has figured out a way for you to not use Google Hangouts. Yes. Thank God.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:38.520]   Microsoft's alternative. Thank God. I love how dedicated Jeff is to doing these shows on
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:43.240]   using Google software or and or devices. Yeah. By the way, the sound sound last week,
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.920]   I didn't listen to it. But when Matt and I had to be in the room without a headset, how was it?
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:53.160]   Okay. Oh, okay. You were because you were playing usually you'd complain. I didn't have a choice.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:57.880]   I didn't think. Oh, okay. All right. No, yeah, people other people
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:02.280]   didn't share a complaint. Sorry, wasn't horrible. Was it Jason? I don't know what the
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.760]   final light of it sounds like, but I think all things considered last week was one of those
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.280]   shows where such a good show will take it the way we can because there were so many different
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:13.320]   voices. Thank you for being rich. You're so great. You're so great. Yeah.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.720]   Jigros was great to have. You know, I don't know how he felt about it, but it was a great
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:21.480]   discussion. Well, I don't do you think? I mean, we kind of attacked. We were talking about AMP,
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:27.080]   and Jingros is, of course, as head of Google News kind of spearheading this effort.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:32.440]   And it was a great discussion. I was a little challenging. I thought it was. I loved hearing
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:38.040]   you grill him because so many companies like Google, Microsoft, others, they're so
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:44.280]   they're optimistic about things that never work. And they act like, oh, this is just all
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:48.360]   going to work. Just fine. It's all going to be just fine. And nobody's going, no, it isn't going
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:52.840]   to be just fine. It's going to be different from what you're saying. 100% certain that it's not
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:57.640]   going to be funny. Because somebody came to me, somebody who's implemented AMP, sent me email
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:01.880]   today saying, I just watched the show and Leo doesn't understand AMP. No, Leo's playing
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:07.000]   doubles advocate to ask all the questions everybody's asking. Well, I don't know. What do you think?
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.600]   Do I not understand that? What is? I understand that. But I think I think you're more
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:15.240]   you're you're very concerned about your understanding. I understand that.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:21.640]   No, you. I understand that. You don't understand that. I want to be like Donald Trump because
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:26.760]   it's life is so easy for him. Yeah. Whatever the hell comes into your mind.
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:32.600]   No one understands AMP. No one really. No one. They're stupid foolish people. They made AMP.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:37.960]   They're foolish people. You're stupid. And by the way, and by the way, the vision of AMP that's
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:47.880]   way better, I'm a genius. I mean, I know I he's got I would love not to have any have to have zero
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:58.920]   reflective this zero self insight zero just like confidence without any qualms at all. I mean,
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:04.600]   it's extreme money. Maybe I think I bet he was like that when he was eight.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:12.840]   Yeah. No, no, I think it's extreme. He has no sense of anyone else. It's all about him.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:16.760]   Everything's about him. And it's just it's just pathologically narcissistic.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:21.800]   But I don't know. I think I don't want to I don't want to deprecate him like that. I think it's
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:26.040]   it's oh, I do. Well, I mean, I want to deprecate him, but I don't want to I want to I want to give
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:32.600]   him some credit. To pull this together. I mean, companies are kind of, you know, it's their job
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.400]   to act like Trump, right? Like so like Mike was saying, you know, companies are just like,
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:38.920]   this is just going to work. I mean, that's the job, right? Right. And it's our job to question
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:44.040]   about it. Well, maybe no. Right. Right. That's our job. You're right. Exactly. They don't have to do
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:49.160]   our job. We have to do our job. The problem is, in many cases, the press no longer does this job,
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:54.520]   which makes it really bad. But the the issue you were zeroing in on was the perfect issue because
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:59.800]   it was essentially about how everything depends on Google servers working flawlessly. And by the
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:06.520]   way, remember when half the internet went down when all the things supported by Amazon web services,
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:11.080]   when that crash that had a glitch and there was like six hours where half the stuff that we used
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:15.400]   in, even mind the single point of failure, I just feel like it's kind of a land grab for Google to
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:20.200]   say or any companies say, especially a for profit company to say, Oh, by the way, everything's going
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:25.400]   through our servers and only well, they don't get any benefit off of going through their servers.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:30.520]   It's not like why not? Because I think they're careful about that because they get smashed.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:37.000]   They're giving you free. As Richard said, a lot of companies pay a fortune for their CDN. So
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.760]   this is free CDN. Yeah, no, that's that's good. The company there should hate it. I feel like
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:45.640]   I feel like my any company that comes along and says, but this is free. Yeah. And this is a
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:50.120]   for profit company. Right. And they say, but no, I'm giving you a free CDN. You got to ask yourself,
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.920]   why are they giving me a free CDN? What's in it for them? Right. Because we will use the way of
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:50:00.520]   expansionally more when it's faster. Right. When I get people the amp demo, they're amazed.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:04.680]   Sorry, I'm changing. No, I mean, it's a Google's interest right for the web to work better, right?
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:09.240]   They they want people on the web. But I mean, Leo, like if that's the case, I mean, everybody
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.720]   should be questioning everything that Google's ever made because it's been free forever. You know,
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:19.480]   I'm totally with you. I'm completely with you. Oh, but see, we get okay. So Gmail free, but
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:24.280]   Gmail's not free because Google just loves everybody and wants the web to work better.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:29.480]   Gmail's free so that they can scan through it and give you better ads or ads that are they
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:34.760]   could charge more for their ads. It would be foolish to assume that any for profit company,
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:39.720]   I don't think it in this day and age you could say, well, no, we just we use. I mean,
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:45.080]   I bought this for a long time. Just use the web more. We're happy. It's more than that. That's not
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:51.640]   enough to say that. I think there's always got to be they have there's publicly held and have a
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:57.000]   responsibility if they share responsibility to stakeholders to make money, not to give money
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.560]   away, not to give away services. They're going to put advertising on app.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:10.760]   And by doing this, by the way, they short circuit this whole issue of ads and overactive ad networks.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:17.240]   And basically, it's an advertising block of the blocks all ads except. Oh, Google's ads, right?
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:20.600]   No, no, he dealt with that last week. No, that's not true. He said it's not going to.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:26.680]   He said other ads could be in there here. The problem is that's true or not.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:31.880]   It's up to Google's in charge of whether or not that's true in this scenario, theoretically.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:38.280]   And the other thing is that you can't even quite compare in inbox or Gmail on the one hand with
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:45.160]   AMP on the other because inbox and Gmail, that's a service you walked into and you agree to the
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:48.520]   thing you don't read and all that stuff. And it's a service. It's on the end. It's a,
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:53.560]   you know, but but AMP is like how the internet works. So it's a little different to be going
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:58.200]   proprietary on that stuff because I agree. I mean, the reality is that if you look at the history of
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:03.000]   the internet in the early days, nobody could make money on the internet. And so all the standards
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.880]   were developed in a spirit of cooperation and so on with the small number of people who are
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:14.520]   involved in that stuff. And now there are multi $100 billion corporations who all are trying to make
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.520]   tons and tons of money on the internet. And so we can't, it's harder to get standards going.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:22.760]   And so the standards bodies, you kept harping away about how it should go through the standards bodies.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:26.840]   Well, that's why because the interests that's taking, we should been here.
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.680]   You're so much more Facebook. Well, Facebook, you know, Facebook has their ultra proprietary
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:35.960]   standard for speeding up the internet. And so Google's going to have one and exactly. And that's
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:40.120]   not how it's supposed to work. Companies with billions at stake shouldn't be determining internet
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:45.080]   standards. Yeah, the standards process should be better and it's not. Well, so this is, this is
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:50.520]   what I said to the publishers. If Google didn't do this, we'd be here a year later saying, oh,
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.800]   pages are all slow and screwed up. Nobody comes to them and they're all at install.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:58.600]   Oh, you know what? The market, by the way, free handed, the magic free hand of the market,
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:03.960]   the market has a lot to say about that. That's why we have ad blockers. The markets absolutely
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:09.560]   going in saying, and, and you know, I don't think that's a bad solution. That's what Google's
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:14.040]   trying to save here. They're trying to prevent that. They say, whoa, better than ad blockers,
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:18.760]   we'll do it. But you know what? The market is weighing in. The market's saying, and this is too
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.280]   slow. So we're going to run ad blockers. We're going to run script filters. We're not going to
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:26.920]   let you do all that crap. Also, who says there has to be a kind of Moore's law for internet bloat?
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:33.720]   If the internet is way too slow, then why are companies building web pages that are so slow?
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:38.120]   You can build them faster. You can build them. You don't have to constantly accelerate
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:43.720]   the size of the page that loads. Who says you have to do that?
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:48.520]   Right. You know, it's got to, it's got to, whatever the demand is that people are choosing,
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.240]   you know, the choosing. Well, that's the other thing that bothered me. I mean, yeah, I have a
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:56.680]   one megabyte background on my website, but I do that because it's aesthetic. It's pretty and people's,
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:01.800]   it makes it a better website. I don't like the amped version because it's ugly and yeah, it's fast.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:05.480]   But I mean, it's nice that people could vote. I mean, it's nice to say, okay, I want the
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:10.360]   amped version or the non amped version. The vast majority of internet users will never
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:16.200]   know what AMP is or even know that it exists. Oh, no, it's in Tylen's side. Yeah, right.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.640]   Well, and that's what essentially bothers me is they're saying, well, don't use the image tag,
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:24.440]   we'll do our own thing. Don't use JavaScript unless we approve it. That bothers me.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:27.800]   But that's what I've got. They've got to, they've got to deal with the governance sooner,
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:31.880]   I think so. Yeah, quickly. But I didn't want to bring this all back up again. But,
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:37.080]   but I did want to report card because maybe I don't understand that. And maybe, maybe the
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:40.520]   things I brought up weren't. Well, well, if you all asked that person to come on the show,
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:46.440]   I can explain it. Is it somebody who really knows or is it just some? Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.120]   Oh, okay. Really, really, really. Okay.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.920]   Okay. All right. Yeah, please. I'll get amped plain.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:55:01.800]   Continued momentum for the AMP project. Google's going to send traffic to AMP pages in Google search
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:08.600]   in February. Twitter is going to experiment with linking to AMP content provided by publishers
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:13.720]   early in 2016. Does that mean they'll link, they'll take a link that I put in and automatically amp
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:18.520]   it? No, they'll, if there was an AMP version, they'll go to the AMP version. That's what I mean. So
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:23.080]   if I put in a link to an article, they will replace it with the AMP version. Oh, I said,
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:28.840]   yes, I believe so. Pinterest currently testing publisher AMP pages in their iOS and Android apps
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:33.560]   founded the AMP pages load four times faster and eight times less data.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:39.800]   And that's eight times less data. That's interesting. Yeah. Well, that's, yeah, and certainly the
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:44.040]   market has something to say about that. We don't, you know, we know there was constrained bandwidth
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:51.720]   on mobile line, Viber and tango, which are messaging apps, we'll do what Twitter is going to do,
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:57.880]   link to AMP content. That means I guess again, translate you URLs. I'm not sure I'm thrilled about
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:03.400]   that. I feel like if I put a link in it should go to the page, it's only linked to the page that
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:08.760]   somebody says, well, this is the better one. CMS providers like WordPress
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:14.520]   are supporting it as well. WordPress will support all publishers that wish to enable AMP pages
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:20.280]   starting in January. In analytics, Comscored Chartbeat, Google Analytics and Parsley will
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:24.040]   have AMP support in their tools. That's important because many analytics tools use
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:30.840]   JavaScript, there's a client side JavaScript and AMP would block that. So if you're going to use
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:37.400]   Chartbeat, AMP would make it stop working. So you'd have to provide a special AMP version of Chartbeat.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:44.120]   Four key areas of the AMP project advertising, the initial roadmap for ads, faster ads, ads that
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:49.320]   can resize support for viewability, integration with data management providers and sponsored
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:54.040]   content. But it just looks more and more to me like this is the Google version of the internet.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:05.160]   It's no, but they're, but they're, I mean, yes, I'm trying to carry Google's water here and not
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:10.280]   know enough about it. But I think this is their answer to the closed internet, which is Facebook.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:17.240]   And this is them trying to make it all fine. Now, you don't have to use maybe two questions.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:21.640]   If Google said, okay, screw that be in the CDN, we won't cash any contact because it makes you
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:25.640]   nervous. Does that make you more comfortable? Because you can do that. You don't have to use
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:29.800]   Google's account. No, I know they're third, potentially the third party. I would imagine them
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:33.720]   becomes a those right. I think more about that Google's setting the standard. So Google says,
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:39.400]   which Java governance, which Java's exactly what I've said. I've said, when we were at these last
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:44.360]   two Google events where I was, I've said that that you've got to get that. And some of the
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:48.200]   really smart publishers said, you know, we trust you, we're glad you built this. This is good.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:54.280]   But the thing about governance, which is funny, is what works in open source, tell me if I'm wrong
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:57.720]   here, but what works in an open source project is it's not that, well, I pick you to be in the
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:03.000]   governance committee. No, what works in open source is you're a big contributor. Thus, you have a
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:08.520]   role in governance. So we don't know who's contributing yet. So there's a bit of a lag,
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:12.520]   a syncopation there, but they've got to get people and there's a lot of developers working on it.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:21.400]   But but it can't be Google's handpicked fellow travelers either. Yeah. Well, and by the way,
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:26.040]   this I should have said this is Richard Jingress's posts from a couple of days back about
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:30.200]   AMP progress. They say, yeah, yeah, they say advertising companies that have expressed their
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:34.680]   intention to support AMP include outbrain AOL to Bula Open X double click AdSense,
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:41.800]   Pumbmatic integral ad science moat smart ad sensor rick crux polar nativo and teeds.tv.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:48.200]   I don't see AOL. I don't see if I ads Apple solution. What about Yahoo?
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:54.200]   Sorry. Joke. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what about Yahoo? I mean, are they still in that business? At least for
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:59:00.360]   one tick tick tick tick tick for another week. What is going on with Yahoo? It's unclear because
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:04.040]   you know, we saw that War Street Journal article that said, you know what, the board is going to meet
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:09.000]   and they're going to fire Marissa and they're going to sell everything off. And then we came to
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:15.560]   the conclusion on Twitter on Sunday. Well, this is probably a planted post by activist Yahoo investors
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:20.520]   who want this to happen because of course they want to get their money out part of it prompted by
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:30.040]   the fact that the IRS refused to say whether or not the sale of the Yahoo Japan and Alibaba
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:35.800]   assets would be a tax free sale. Everybody thought it wouldn't cost them.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:41.080]   And then all of a sudden there could be a $10 billion tax bill. Oh, maybe we'll do something else.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:46.120]   So they start brooding about going to the Wall Street Journal and placing
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:49.560]   stories saying, well, what if we sold the core assets?
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:56.040]   But it's unclear really what the board's going to do. One thing that's happened, Max Leavchin is off
[00:59:56.040 --> 01:00:03.960]   the board. He was, I think, a Marissa Meyer hire. So she brought him in. So former Peter
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:09.880]   Kafka. Peter Kafka had a great tweet, which was old Yahoo plan, two plus three equals five,
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:14.600]   new Yahoo plan three plus two equals five. I think the difference is there the board,
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:21.480]   everybody got nervous about the tax implications of spitting off the investments. So the investments
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.440]   have to be in the core company, which they can rename the core company like, you know,
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.400]   Gannett. It's all made up. This is like, it's all made up. It's all made up.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.280]   It's all made up. The whole it is spin off one spin off the other. It really doesn't matter.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.080]   And if you're a stockholder, you get stock in all the spin offs.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:38.040]   But the market price, like a billion and a half dollars. Oh, Lord.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.240]   What do you think? Let's talk about this.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:48.360]   Gina, you're a huge. I mean, you were a flicker user. I think you, you, you had like me,
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:53.720]   a soft spot for Yahoo. Has Marissa Meyer been good for Yahoo over the last three years?
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:59.400]   Oh, that's a hard question. I'll be honest. I haven't, I haven't been filing. I think that
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:03.320]   she had a good start there for a while. I mean, from, and I'm looking this purely from just like
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.960]   a consumer product perspective, they released a couple of interesting update, you know, new apps
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.080]   in the beginning. There was like a, there was a news app. There was a weather app. There were a
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:15.080]   couple of promising new things. Flicker had a few improvements. And I thought, Oh, you know,
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.240]   this is, this is great. Like that, you know, Yahoo is going to be part of my daily life again.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.920]   And that didn't, that didn't quite happen. I'll be totally honest. I haven't been following.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.440]   I didn't realize that this was going on. I haven't been following the store, you know,
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.640]   the board and the, you have been busy coding, haven't you?
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:36.920]   Yes, I have. I have. I have. So I just, it's just less interesting to me that part. So I'm not sure.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:44.520]   I'm not sure what's going to happen. I, I think that the hope that we all had when Meyer was
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:49.560]   installed, I guess to say was, you know, that yet Yahoo is going to have really relevant consumer
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.600]   products again. And I don't, I don't think that that's happened.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:02:00.920]   I think we overestimate the ability of CEOs to affect already large companies that already have
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:06.040]   an entrenched culture. And this is kind of like AOL in the sense that, you know, she took,
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:11.320]   I thought it was a good move for her because I don't think that if this fails, which it was
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:16.600]   always likely to do, it's really her fault. I don't think it was salvageable. I think she's
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.400]   a very competent person. She, she was very much using the Google playbook on what she was trying
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:25.000]   to do, but she didn't have Google to work with. She didn't have the world of Google,
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.280]   the culture of Google to work with. She had what she had. Well, Yahoo has always done is they've
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:36.360]   always, since they used to have what people used to use, you know, the whole, the whole model of
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.960]   having a portal, which was, you know, a completely defunct and now completely, absolutely
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:47.880]   way to use the internet. They've just acquired things. They acquire companies. They've acquired
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:54.120]   probably hundreds of companies. Humbler was $1.1 billion. Well, that, but see, that's what she came in
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:58.920]   and in that culture with those advisors with what they had to work with, all they had left was,
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.320]   okay, let's keep buying companies. And so what is Yahoo? Nobody can answer this question because
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:08.760]   it's just a bunch of companies that for some reason are owned by one company. So I just think,
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:15.000]   I mean, I'm on the outside. I'm not on the board. I'm not, you know, in the executive suite at
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.920]   Yahoo, but it seems to me that it's just over. Close it, sell off the pieces and just be done
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:25.560]   with it. It's the Yahoo cannot be turned into another. What's worth buying? Right. So let's,
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:29.800]   let's forget, you know, Verizon buying the whole thing and putting it with AOL and this wonderful
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:35.800]   new graveyard. What are the things that are valuable on Yahoo? Yahoo. The weird thing is that
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:41.640]   when you, the value in Alibaba is about 35 billion. The, the, okay, remember the stock market's
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:47.880]   valuing it. I haven't seen the latest, but around 50 billion. Yeah. 35 billion for Alibaba. What
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:55.000]   was it? 15 billion for Yahoo Japan. The core business sick. By the way, the cash they have
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.960]   considerable cash. Make that 32.9 billion. So the value, the market cap, the value that the market
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:09.320]   is assigning to Yahoo is less, less than the Ali Baba share staking. Yeah, which to me, I don't.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:17.160]   So I see scenarios like I don't understand it. Where I see scenario where the only
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:22.760]   Baba steak becomes a financial vehicle and that becomes, you know, new Yahoo one. Right. And then
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:30.360]   the way Yahoo will be is their stake in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. That will be what Yahoo will be.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.560]   And then they'll be the tumbler company or whatever. It's a tracking strong.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:37.640]   And so then if you take, if you take Yahoo functions and what the heck,
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.360]   Marissa, go ahead, you know, whatever you want, any value you can out of it, that's one way to
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:46.200]   look at it. Another way to look at it is to cut it up in pieces, which, you know, and again,
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.720]   so, so what's valuable? This flicker, some value. Yeah. Tumbler has value. Yes.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.800]   Yahoo finances. Well, the question though is tumbler's value equal to what they paid for it
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:05:00.840]   or less at this point. No, probably not. That's hard to say. Yeah. But also,
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:04.520]   let me raise this in the in the chairman. And maybe Gina, you know, from your programmer friends,
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:10.520]   but there was the thought that Meyer had kind of alienated the engineering team.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:15.880]   The good programmers left. She certainly a lot of high level executives, even some she'd brought
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:23.320]   in left. And there were some very expensive departures. I mean, she had a nearly impossible job.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:27.320]   She made some controversial decisions like the work at home decision, which not working from home
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:33.960]   decision, which I actually think was was reasonably justified. She's a hard ass in a good way. She's
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:38.920]   a product person. So which is why I hope that this was going to be about turning Yahoo into
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.320]   consumer product, a product, you know, company. There was this mythology around her, you know,
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:47.880]   hand, hand drawing the logo, you know, the new logo of the company, even though she's not a
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:53.240]   designer, but like this hands on role, perceived, do your thing to be clear. Like I'm not, I think
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:57.400]   that I'm still a huge fan. I think she's great. I didn't mean to throw her under the bus by being
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:00.520]   like, just didn't turn into the consumer product company that I thought it was going to be. I think
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:05.720]   that the Tumblr purchase was was right on. I think Tumblr, I think Tumblr is hugely valuable. It's
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:12.520]   a vibrant social network of young creative people. I mean, and you know, Flickr is used less. But
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:20.120]   yeah, I mean, she had, she had a, you know, a nearly impossible task to turn things around. I
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:24.920]   don't know. You know, I don't know what's going to happen. But the really impossible task was
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:33.160]   asshole investors. Yeah, that's really the problem. You should make it private. Like, actually,
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:36.120]   there was one thing we talked about is that perhaps they could raise the money to take it
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:42.280]   private. Well, it's over. That Marissa, I have, I, as long as Marissa's reputation is still good in
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:48.920]   Silicon Valley, which I think it is, given that the value of Yahoo core is greater than the
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:54.280]   sum of its parts. Yeah. Then what would it take for what would she have to raise to just take that
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:07:00.360]   private and be the CEO of that? You sell Alibaba, the share, and then basically what you could do
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:04.920]   is do an alphabet model and make up what's going to happen. Like, what's going to happen is Alibaba
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:15.560]   and Yahoo Japan stay as core Yahoo. They spin off old Yahoo. And and take that private without any
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:20.280]   value of the Yahoo Japan or Alibaba. That's going to stay. That's what the investors are saying.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:25.320]   We love that. That's the only thing that's valuable. So take the invaluable parts and can Marissa
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:30.280]   take it private? That's why maybe the board is not throwing her under the bus. Maybe. Maybe that's
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:35.400]   the plan is to say Marissa, good luck. You can do anything with this. Great. And we'll own a piece
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:42.600]   of what you do. And you know, you'll pay us some pennies on the negative pennies and then find.
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:49.720]   Their revenue is not horrific. They they have revenue of 1.2 billion last quarter.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:57.080]   They had earnings of 76 million last quarter. I mean, this is a profitable company. It's not a
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:02.040]   failing company. It's a great cash flow play. Yeah. It's yeah, if you were private equity,
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:09.880]   forget, I think forget Verizon buying it. I don't get that. But if if if if you could private equity
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:14.760]   could put up enough money to take this thing and leverage buyout given the negative value,
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:20.760]   I think she could then don't stop it. Maybe he's all stuff. You're right about you're right about
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:25.320]   Tumblr, Gina. When I took my daughter's high school class last year, which was there over to
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:29.800]   see Katie Couric as we're going up the elevator. They didn't say, Oh, we're in Yahoo. They said,
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:34.680]   correct. We're at Tumblr. Can we see? Yeah. We see Tumblr. But does that still the case this year?
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:41.480]   That's the problem. This stuff is very temporary. I am looking at the net earnings from a year ago
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:50.520]   were 6.7 billion this year, 76 million this quarter. So year over year, that's not the revenue was up,
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:56.600]   but the earnings were down by a factor of 10. I mean, that's or more. That's a significant.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:01.000]   So I can see why this maybe or maybe they're not jerks. But I see why this year holders are a
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:09.880]   little nervous. I just think just intuitively that the concept of just buying companies and
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:14.360]   and going after the synergies they always talk about in acquisitions is a delusion. Yeah.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:19.240]   There are no synergies. And some of these companies, some of these properties, and I'm looking at the
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:24.680]   Wikipedia page for Yahoo, own sites and services, the list of ones they've closed is much longer,
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:28.280]   by the way, than the ones they still have open. One they still have open is probably like four,
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:33.160]   five dozen Yahoo sports, Yahoo travel, Yahoo TV, Yahoo, all those different things.
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:40.680]   Some of those are being carried by other companies. And I think that to the greatest extent possible,
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:44.680]   they got to stand on their own. That's the genius of alphabet. Because what they're doing is they
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:51.560]   well, life sciences now, now called Verily or whatever, these companies have to live and die on
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:56.200]   their own. Each of them could turn into a monster and some of them could remain tiny. And that's
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:59.640]   what should happen to individual properties that are not connected to other properties.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:04.600]   And Mike, you're right, by the way, some of Google's investments, you know, Uber and such,
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:11.960]   could go out, could go Alibaba. But that's it's isolated enough. It doesn't overwhelm the value
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.880]   of the core company. Exactly. Exactly. It's really good point. And it doesn't tarnish the
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:20.440]   reputation, etc. That are part of Yahoo's problem is reputation. Everybody thinks they're old and
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:26.680]   busted. They're a dinosaur. And I think that an alphabet style model, especially if it wasn't
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:34.280]   public for the non Alibaba properties, would be could really work for them. And I think it's
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:39.560]   even a possibility, given the fact that Marissa is really in that Google culture. She's, you know,
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:47.240]   she really sees Google as the company culturally. So I like your plan. All right, let's do it.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:51.800]   Let's do it. Let's become hostile investors. That's the problem.
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:57.800]   Anybody's got even a share of Yahoo comes with pitchforks and torches. Let's take a break.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:04.040]   Yeah. Having fun. Jeff Jarvis is here. Mike Elgin. Most importantly, most importantly,
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.880]   intra panic. You're a dramatic. Yeah. So nice. We're just going to keep kissing your butt
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:14.680]   until you come back. Damn it. Yeah. I love it. Thanks for how to get that. By the way,
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:17.960]   it was a mouthful. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:23.320]   There's more coming. We have more gifts coming your way. Right here. I just had the first one.
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:30.120]   What's that? That was the peanut butter nougat with sea salt. I shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:34.920]   Well, I feel we felt a little bad setting these out because we know we're basically, you know,
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:41.560]   poisoning you with goodies. But these are now what the holidays are all about. Yes. Absolutely.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.960]   Take giving your friends things that are bad for them. Gluttony. Gluttony. Absolutely.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:50.440]   Okay. Good. I'm off the hook. Good. Well, I'm glad you got it. That's good. I'm glad. Thank you.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:55.640]   Yeah. Thank you very much. Yeah. Enjoy those. Our show today brought to you by Blue Apron.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:00.360]   You're lucky. We should send just every of Blue Apron bites. But then you got a cook. But
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:05.560]   that's part of the fun. I like to cook. You're a huge cook. Yeah. There's something about making
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.880]   a meal for the people you love. It is I feel like, and maybe this is because that's how I grew up,
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:13.400]   but this I feel like that's one of the best ways to show somebody you love them.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:18.920]   And when you make them a meal that is special and unique and has wonderful ingredients,
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:24.760]   it's helpful, but incredibly delicious. It's just the nicest thing. One of the nicest things
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.920]   you can do for somebody in Blue Apron makes that possible by getting setting you up.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:35.160]   They're like your wingman. You know, they're setting you up with all the ingredients you need,
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:40.760]   fresh from the farm. They all use local farms. Fresh meats, fishes, they have vegetarian too.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:46.040]   So if you're vegetarian, there's every diet need can be accommodated. And then,
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:51.160]   oh, my mouth always wanted to do these ads. And then they give you the recipe card and you can make
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:57.640]   in less than an hour. You can make an incredible meal for a loved one for date night for just a
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:02.200]   special occasion. This is amazing. They have family plans too. So you can feed your family
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.840]   with kid-friendly ingredients and so forth. It's less than $10 a meal. It's very affordable.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.960]   Each meal about five to 700 calories a portion and they're incredible stuff that you probably
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:16.360]   wouldn't even think of. You know, I know I find myself on a red. I always make kind of the same five
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:24.360]   things over and over. But imagine spiced pork chops with charred poblano salsa and sweet potato mash.
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:30.120]   You know what I love about Blue Apron? Two things I love about it. One of them is you just
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:35.160]   mentioned the ingredients. They send you ingredients that like, where would you get this? Like, I have
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:40.040]   no idea what sort of I would have to go find some store. But you figure that's funny to you
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:43.560]   say because I figure, oh, Mike Elgin knows what Pharaoh is. He probably cooks with it all the time.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:48.520]   I do know what Pharaoh is. But sometimes there's a lot of- I call those the Mike Elgin ingredients.
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.480]   You're like, we were watching the video here. And one of the ingredients was Turkish yogurt.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:58.440]   Okay. Turkish yogurt. What's that? Well, it's, you know, Greek yogurt is very thick. It's even
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:03.240]   thicker than that. Wow. And I actually make, I do make Turkish yogurt, but most people- I never
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:07.480]   do you get it. I can't get it. Yeah. But they'll just send it to you. Stuff from the, you know,
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.320]   the, you know, I've had the weird, unique bok choy. I wish I could remember the name of it. It was
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:16.120]   the best bok choy I ever had. And it was, it's completely unique. Yeah. Things like watermelon
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:21.960]   radishes. Yeah. I just, I, this is part of the fun of it. It opens your eyes to new ways of making
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:27.640]   things. This is Jason Howell making his lamb shawarma. And the red- Is that shot with glass?
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:33.320]   Yeah. It was. Yeah. It was. Yeah. It was. Yeah. That got the Google connection in there, of course,
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:37.720]   because he's using both hands. Yeah. It's perfect for this. So here's the deal. You can get two
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:44.760]   meals free to try this out right now at blueapering.com/twit. Blueapering.com/twit.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:50.120]   And you really get a sense of what this is like. And I just encourage you to do it. And make it a
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:55.960]   special occasion. Get some candles, some silver, some china, nice china, maybe a good bottle of wine,
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:03.560]   and make it a blueapering night tonight. Blueapering.com/twit. You'll have fun making it.
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:10.360]   Oh man, there it is. There's the. Thanks Jason. Man. The final. And then the next picture
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:15.240]   wasn't taken because I was taking a bite. Yum. So, you know, and it made the glass fall off his
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:21.480]   head. It was so good. And I can't stand hearing people chew their food. So the glass, that'd be a
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:28.760]   real problem. That'd be a real problem. What is this? Step inside your photos with the cardboard
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:34.120]   camera. You can make your. Very neat. Very cool. Tell me about this. Very cool. So,
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:39.160]   this is just making a panorama with the cardboard app. And then you put the cardboard on and you
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:44.120]   can you can now see that it's instant demonstration of art of immersive photography. But it's more
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:50.440]   than that because it actually processes 3D from the video that you take. Oh neat. So, it's creating
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:55.320]   3D video with just your camera. So, do it now. This is going to take your next call it. I mean,
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:58.600]   I don't have it yet. You have to view it within the app. Someday you'll be able to view it without
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:03.640]   the app. But right now you're viewing the app. Well, you posted that Star Wars 3D immersive
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:08.360]   video clip, right? Or somebody did. Somebody, I don't think it was a bit scoble on Facebook.
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:13.960]   There are places now you can see these. YouTube, Facebook. But the what's brilliant to me about
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:17.880]   this is of course, Google's has had a photosphere for a long time. And people always take
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:22.520]   photospheres wrong. The right way to take a photosphere is you hold the you hold the device
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:29.320]   in one place and you turn it like you rotate on the axis. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But when you move
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:35.800]   a foot or so each time you take another sector in this app, it's good. Oh, because it gives you a
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.200]   slightly different angle which gives you the stereoscopic effect. This is all about a stereoscopic
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:44.840]   effect, the illusion of 3D in depth. Okay. And that's what's great about this. And so, you want to
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:50.040]   move it at six inches to a foot each time you take another shot because you see the objects that
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:53.960]   are closer a little bit, you know, on this side of it, then you decide and then it creates that
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:17:00.200]   illusion. So this is the cardboard camera as opposed to cardboard. Yes. Exactly. So you have
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:04.840]   to take it with the cardboard camera, this photo. Yes. Yes. And it goes into your photos and does
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:09.320]   it sync up to Google photos and all that? No, no. And the other photo photo. You have to look at it
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:13.960]   within the app. So you have to use cardboard with this app to view it right now. Android only right
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.200]   now. So I think eventually it'll be like that, Jeanette, it'll be something you can just go
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:23.240]   stand up in front of and turn around and do it. Yeah, do it. All right. And it records sound too,
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:27.160]   which is kind of cool. Exactly. Does the sound move around? Oh, so the sound is on. So it says
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:32.040]   sound on. So will the sound better stand up? You better stand up to do it. That is, you're going to
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:37.480]   have to do a full rotation all around. Well, I'm on a rotating chair. That's going to be easy.
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:41.400]   Yeah, you don't want you don't have to do a full photosphere. You can do a little brief pan around.
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:45.400]   Oh, you can't. You're after the stereoscopic effect more than the panorama effect. Move your
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:50.040]   phone smoothly to the right. It told me to slow down. I was doing it in the airport. Oh, try again
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:18:00.200]   moving more slowly. I'm trying to rotate on the chair's axis. That's the key, right? The chair
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:05.240]   is going to hit the mic in a second. No, step one, get a Dr. Evil chair. Step two.
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:13.320]   Look at the back of that thing. This is funny. Hello.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:19.320]   Oh, no, it's good on point. There goes. Leo's about to on one. He's no longer connected with the matrix.
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:24.040]   And he can't hear us because they didn't want to about it.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:30.120]   I spilled everything. Oh my God. It's all. Oh, the humanity. You destroyed the pixel. See.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:38.920]   Hope that gracelcy was worth this 3D image. Geez, Louise. Leo, I wish you'd stop doing that.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.080]   Folks, don't try this at home. Pretty much everybody.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:48.200]   Sorry. It was. I didn't know that was there. This is a fun episode of Hands on Demos.
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:51.720]   Yeah, it's churning on this now. Yeah, it takes a little bit.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.800]   It takes a little bit. Not that long though. It's pretty surprising.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:58.600]   Yeah, it's almost done. It's done. It's done churning going on. It's computing. It's done
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:02.760]   computing. Yes. Now what do I have to put on cardboard? What do they do? Put it on the cardboard.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:06.520]   I mean, you don't have to. You can tap on it. Yeah. And just go like that.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:11.720]   Go tap the cardboard button. Oh, oh, so it'll give me the cardboard. And then that'll go away in a second.
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:19.240]   And there you go. That's. Oh my God. Oh, hey. Oh my God. Yeah. So if you look at it in cardboard,
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:22.120]   you'll see the stereo. Well, you may not see much stereo software because you didn't move off the
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:27.320]   axis, but well, he did. He did. He he carved the circle. Go ahead. Put it in the cardboard.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:30.760]   Because it's funny. It's not good TV to me watching me.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:35.720]   Oh, it's funny. You can't see. That's not like that. When you take your ear plug out,
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:40.280]   we'll just make fun of you. You should put on your headphones though with this, right? Because
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:44.520]   Hey, you get the audio. You get the audio. You can do. I think you could. So you can record.
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:49.160]   It is neat to have audio in there. I didn't know that. It doesn't really. I didn't know that.
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:53.400]   It doesn't really fit. Oh, you have the old card. Oh, crap.
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.840]   What the hell is your? You know, where's your.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:01.560]   What do I see it? This is weird.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:09.720]   What is that? I'm seeing the interface. You're seeing. Well, because you got it. Where's your
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:13.800]   view? You have a live view of. I have a live view of the interface. That's weird. All right.
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:18.120]   Let's do that again. Yeah. Where's this? There we go. Now it's doing us right. Got it.
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:24.200]   Right. No, it went back. It's doing. You know what? It's the NFC is changing. Well, no, but
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:29.960]   what is it doing? Look at it's. Look what it's seeing. It's seeing. It's got the menu.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:35.160]   It's the screen of the app in 3D. He doesn't understand. Ampe. I don't understand anything.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:41.160]   I don't know how I survive. Thank God. I can breathe. And you and you run tech shows? What?
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:46.680]   What? Well, that's the same picture. Oh, I see. It's the VR interface. You could tap any of
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:53.240]   those when that menu comes up and supposedly jump right into it. So if I do this, see it using
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:57.880]   a different viewer switch. Oh, you can do other viewers. Let's see what the other viewers are.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:02.760]   We have. So you have to you could tap it into the other viewers because I have the
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:08.840]   gear VR at home. And yeah. All right. Can I post this anywhere? No. It has to be viewed within the app.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:13.480]   Don't look. Can you share it with anybody else? Can I just say I can open the gallery, but what's
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:18.280]   you must be able to? I think right now it's just within the app for you.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:25.560]   I think there's something happens when I put it in the cardboard because it's looking good out
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:33.000]   right now. There. What you set up your cardboard app with a given viewer, you may have set it up
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.840]   with a later viewer. See what I'm seeing. I'm seeing the man. I'm seeing. I don't know.
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:46.840]   It's it's screwed up. What it is is you're seeing a stereoscopic view of the app interface.
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:50.280]   Interface not the thing that's not what I see when I take it out. I see the right
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:55.320]   way. But now I'm seeing the wrong thing again. It's totally bizarre. But this this app.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:22:00.920]   It's a great idea. I'm sure. It's a great idea. But it also highlights the fact that when we the
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:05.960]   stuff we call virtual reality is actually lots of things. One of them is virtual reality ones,
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:10.360]   mixed reality ones, augmented reality, very different from mixed reality. One is immersive
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:14.360]   video, which we've talked about. I know Jeff, this is something you've talked about.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:18.360]   The importance of differentiating between immersive video and virtual reality, etc.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:23.320]   And this is stereoscopic photography. It's different from 3D from a new thing.
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:27.720]   It's kind of a new thing. I mean, those view masters, that's what that was.
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.960]   Right. Well, you look at how here's Disney in 19, whatever.
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:33.560]   Right. Well, I just sent you the one I did in the airport, Leo, because if you could
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:37.480]   oh, you could go to the to the image, you could open it and something else, you can open it in
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:42.280]   Google photo, then you can share it from there. Right. And then somebody can then.
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.480]   I think I just sent you one I did in the airport.
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:53.640]   But can I get it? I'm not going to experiment anymore. This has not been my day for experiment.
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:23:01.240]   I do want to play a song through the Pixel C. We haven't heard the speakers yet.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:05.720]   Do you want to hear the speakers? I do. How about some hipster approved classic rock?
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:09.080]   Nice. Fireplace out the biggest Christmas hits of all time, of course.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:13.640]   So let's just play a little too many devices. Okay.
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:17.160]   Check with that. I can't because I have a limited number of devices.
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:23.320]   So YouTube, I can do YouTube. I thought they I thought I fixed that, but apparently not.
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:31.160]   Here's some YouTube something. Let's play YouTube. Funny cats. No. I want music.
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:37.480]   Who do you like? Who do you like on the YouTube Gaga? Speaking of the devil.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:45.400]   Sure. Lady Gaga mix. All right. Now, how do I turn it up?
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:50.200]   Good question. With your finger probably. There's no volume button on it.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:54.120]   There's a volume on the side? No. There's not a volume button on the keyboard.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:56.840]   I have to do it in the software. It's probably a something plus something.
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:01.160]   God control plus. I don't know. Can you tell me, Jeff, would you look that up?
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:07.800]   It's pretty loud though. I mean, you know, it probably doesn't get much louder than that.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:10.760]   Oh, really? I'm not the bassiest.
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:15.080]   Doesn't sound as good as the iPad Pro by industry.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:18.120]   Not even close. Yeah. You probably would want to put headphones on.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:25.800]   So there you go. There's enough of that. Sorry, Gaga. Sorry, Gaga.
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:36.040]   Best apps and best games of 2015. You probably spent some time talking about this yesterday.
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:38.040]   No, we actually didn't. All about Android. You did not?
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:39.240]   Wow. We didn't touch this one.
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.680]   Yay. You go ahead and have it.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:48.040]   You're giving it to me. Aren't you sweet? Is it in the if I go to the play store?
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.560]   Well, I'm able to see this in the play store.
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:55.080]   Apps and games. Best of 2015. Here we are.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:01.000]   Fallout shelter best game. Mobile strike. Deer hunter 2016.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.040]   Clash of clans. Crossy road. Yeah, this is all what you'd expect.
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.120]   Candy, Krasaga, Panda Pop. These are like the, this is like just, you know,
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:12.040]   greatest hits. Greatest hits. Yeah. Best apps. Color flight coloring book.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:17.560]   Haven't seen that one. Jet. That's the Amazon competitor that has no chance of succeeding.
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:23.800]   But they have a great app. They're trying and Google wants to give them.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:25.800]   These are all launched in 2015.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:33.160]   We are proud to present the best of 2015 selection across apps, games, and entertainment.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.880]   Check out the top titles of the year all in one place.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.680]   So, stuff that's new in 2015. By the way, when you press read more,
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.680]   it gives you the same sentence and that's all.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:48.440]   So, I'm just being a picky picky. No, but that's a good, what other criteria?
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.080]   Because, you know, I think Lightroom did it. No, I mean, some of this,
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:54.600]   I know, you know what? This is not a good list. This is like,
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.200]   Yeah, this doesn't look like a business. This is a, this is not what you should.
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:59.800]   You go now. Yes. Okay.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.720]   But they're kind of, they're, I feel like this is almost a paid list.
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:07.400]   This is just YouTube kids. Emphasizing kind of the junk
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:12.520]   that is all over the app store as every app store is full of junk.
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:16.760]   I don't know if it's best album, top selling. I understand, right?
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:18.200]   Yeah. Yeah. Top selling makes sense.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.520]   Yeah. These are the best sellers. And of course, Adele is number one.
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:21.960]   They're like most installed.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:25.640]   Top selling movies, but it's not most installed. It's just best apps, best games.
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:30.440]   I don't know what that top selling albums, top selling, Adele's 25 top selling album,
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:34.360]   top selling movie, Interstellar Followed by Lucy, American sniper, the interview.
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:43.320]   Fifty Shades of Grey, all four versions. Oh, God help us all.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.120]   Top selling books.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:49.560]   Because you don't want people to see you reading that.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:52.680]   Exactly. You can read this on your Android device. No one will know.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:59.000]   Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades of Darker, Fifty Shades of Freed.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.520]   That's kind of a spoiler title. It's like 200 Shades of
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.280]   there's thousands of Shades here.
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:10.360]   Our favorites on newsstands. No, that's an ad. That's gotta be, right?
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:14.360]   Oh, our favorites. Our favorites. The ones that gave us the most money.
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.600]   Why do they do this? Our favorite albums.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.800]   Properly entitled, the number one favorite album to Pimp a Butterfly.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:24.280]   Our favorite movies on TV, Dope. I never even heard of that.
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:27.880]   I want to see that. It's good. I don't know. I've heard good things.
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:28.600]   I hear it's dope.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.880]   Fargo is fun. I'm enjoying it.
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:32.280]   It is dope is really good. I enjoyed it. It's funny.
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:35.560]   Okay, but Jeff, did you watch last Monday nights Fargo?
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.240]   No. I saw it.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:40.920]   Okay, just let me know after you see it. I don't know spoilers.
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:41.400]   Okay.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:47.480]   But, suffice it to say it was surprising. Yeah, it was a surprising moment.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:51.560]   It was a surprising, it was like, what the, I knew this was coming by the way.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:52.280]   Right.
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:56.920]   Because they had telegraphed this all along, but it was, it was like, why?
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.880]   It was, it was, it was almost, in fact, now that you mentioned it,
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:04.200]   this entire show is somewhat sort of kind of like Twin Peaks.
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.960]   It is, isn't it? Yes. Yes.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.560]   Twin Peaks. Twin Peaks. You're a peaky end.
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:10.760]   Yeah. It's great. I mean, it's an amazing show.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:14.040]   And the first season was fantastic. Great performances,
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:16.680]   especially if you love horrific violence as I do.
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:17.880]   You're randomly violent.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:21.880]   Yeah. Just people get shot for no reason.
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.800]   Yeah. Like, I don't, I don't like how you're looking at it.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:24.360]   Boom.
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.440]   Since we're in this week in entertainment, have you guys seen Spotlight?
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:31.800]   No. No. No. I'm, I'm run. Go see it.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.960]   See, everybody says that. It's amazing.
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:37.000]   Everybody says that. Uh, we're not a journalist, so, so.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.280]   I'm nervous because, you know, you know, Lisa and I are looking at what to go see.
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:45.720]   I think I mentioned this. And, uh, Spotlight, 99 on Rotten Tomatoes,
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.160]   everybody says, go see it. Yeah.
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:50.680]   It's about priests and the Boston Globes investigation of priests.
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:55.000]   It's all about the investigation and, and, and molesting children.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:58.360]   And it's like, well, I don't, that uplifting Christmas entertainment.
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:01.800]   I don't think so. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.960]   I just, I couldn't, we couldn't bring ourselves to see it.
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:06.040]   Yeah. It's, I had the exact same thought.
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:08.520]   Do I really want to, you know, it's an end of the day.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.400]   And I hear it's great. Yeah.
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.600]   There's no moment. There's no, there's no moments of priests and little boys.
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.400]   There's no moment. It's like wood. It's like, uh, it's like all the president's men.
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:22.360]   Well, it's like, yeah. It's a journalist, uh, going after a cover up and, and the depiction
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:26.120]   of journalism is supposed to be amazing. Yeah. Really. Very, very real stick.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:30.040]   Give me gratuitous bloody violence any time. It's like, and be done.
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:35.720]   When I did watch, have you all seen the very Murray Christmas, Bill Murray Christmas special
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:38.600]   directed by Sophia Coppola? No. No.
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:45.640]   Nice. But, but, but can you, can you, can you, will you get kicked off the air if you, if you play, um,
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:50.440]   Ronald Cyrus's? She was very good. Oh, she was great. Yeah.
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:56.600]   There were, it's just weird. It's very weird. It's very weird. But the interesting thing,
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:00.840]   here's how we're going to make it appropriate to the show instead of just a television review.
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.520]   I was, I was waiting for this. Yeah.
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:04.520]   Is this, well, it's a Netflix original. Mm hmm.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:09.080]   And it's very interesting to me that Netflix basically is saying, well, we're going to do what
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:12.920]   television has done for years. We're going to do a Christmas special, but it's not going to be
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:19.160]   pericomo. Right. It's a, it's a hipster, you know, oddball thing, right? But it's still
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:23.000]   an hour long Christmas special. Yes.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.800]   It's a TV show. The fireplace and all the rest. Yeah. Oh, Amy Poehler, I'll watch anything of
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:30.920]   Poehler. She's got a small role. Everybody's got a small role. That's what, that's,
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:35.240]   it's Bill Murray making, maybe he's, he's mocking the, they're mocking the form. Yeah.
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.280]   And they can do that. And it's kind of a little like,
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:45.720]   um, uh, I mean, Sofia Coppola is reunited with Murray to make this and it's kind of like
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:47.800]   Lost in Translation part two. Yeah.
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:58.680]   There, uh, Sofia's husband, uh, has a French rock band that's very strange. And the
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:03.000]   Buster Poindexter is in it. David Johannes. What is his name? Johannes?
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.840]   David Joe, uh, New York, Johansson. That's a New York dolls fame. He's been, he's seen some
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:15.720]   things in life. His life is kind of, it's very weird, but it just shows Netflix ambition. Yeah.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:19.720]   I mean, and, and you know what they need to, because look at Amazon's ambition in this realm.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:24.680]   Have you talked on this show about the most recent episode of The Good Wife,
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:29.880]   which is really about Google and algorithms and who's to blame when algorithms are racist,
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:33.960]   when they're based on this, not the autonomous vehicle one. This is, this is that. So basically,
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:38.520]   what happens is that the, there's a, a restaurant tour who has a restaurant
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:45.080]   in, in a predominantly black neighborhood in Chicago, who suddenly her business dies,
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:51.880]   she claims because it was this, this, uh, Chumham site, which is Google that he's been around the
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:56.040]   Chum, the Chumham guy. Exactly. It's kind of Facebook meets, right? They had a new feature that says,
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:00.200]   well, here are the, you know, for driving directions, here are the areas you should avoid. And they
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:04.760]   said that her entire neighborhood should be avoided when you're driving around. And therefore,
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:08.280]   she lost all the, you know, traffic for people who are going to a restaurant. And then they went
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:13.880]   into the really lengthy, very savvy, very intelligent courtroom conversations about
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:18.040]   where the, what's racist are algorithms, racist? No, they're based on user feedback. Well,
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:22.920]   what are user, who are your users? Your users are 95 people. Exactly. So it was really,
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:26.760]   really good, really good episode. That's very interesting. It was on the 20s.
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:31.160]   Even Google knows that that is not, that's the third rail there. They haven't touched in that.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:35.960]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But it's, makes for a good TV show. Interesting. I'll have to watch that.
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:39.240]   We're so far behind. We have two years to go before we can get there.
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:45.880]   The mile is, if you care, the mile is never saw as in the, no, I'll save it for the
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:51.080]   end of the day. Okay. We'll save it. We'll be behind. Yeah. I just want to, there's a few
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:55.960]   extra stories I want to run through here. Gina, gosh, you only hear once a month. Please bring
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:33:01.880]   up anything that you want to talk about. I will. It's your show. How about the new emoji? You like
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:08.200]   those in 6.01? You know what I like? I want to stop getting this stupid box with the cross,
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:13.400]   right? Because everybody else has those emojis. So frustrating. I mean, I don't know if I just
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:17.240]   like hang out with a lot of iOS folks or what, but I just, I feel like half the emoji I see.
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:21.960]   Yeah. We all do. I just want to see those go away. We all have to live with those damn iOS folks.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:26.920]   It's like, it's like the green bubble thing. Yeah. It makes me crazy. So there's, uh,
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:33.480]   there's new food options like pizza and burritos chipotle. There's a burritos. Jenny,
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:37.400]   eight Lee, we used to be the New York Times. There's no one hack hackers. Yeah. She has a
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:44.760]   campaign to get the dumpling as hilarious because she dumped. She actually, she actually went to,
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:49.400]   she's now on an advisory board for the emoji board. She went to the meeting of the emoji board.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:54.920]   It's a bunch of boring, you know, white bureaucrats. It's hilarious. I like the scary clown emoji.
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:34:01.240]   Wait a minute. Holy cow. I never saw that one. There's always been sushi. They had sushi because
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:07.240]   it was Japanese originally. The problem was they didn't have a mercafoot in Japan now, right?
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:11.720]   I say with everybody because stickers are the thing now. Stickers of the new hotness.
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:15.880]   Stickers of the new hotness. Now, of course, emoji culture comes from Japan and I saw an
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:19.640]   article go by that says in Japan, they're done with emoji. It's like, it's completely full.
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:24.600]   Yeah. Nobody cares about those. Who's honey jar? Is that new? It must be. I don't remember that
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:33.480]   before. And then there's the middle finger. And there's a, now does, how does Google handle the
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:39.800]   different color? No, I guess I don't have the choices of different. Yeah, that's not that's
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:44.360]   not part of it. Yes. Oh, yeah. The difference can tell everybody's yellow. It's like, I like that.
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:51.720]   Yeah. Where's the hands? Where's the fingers? I want to show stuff I can't show on TV.
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:58.120]   Just because I can. Are there any new sports in here? What is that? Does anybody know what that
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:01.240]   is? What the hell is that? That looks Japanese.
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:11.000]   My job has always been there. Yeah. Yeah. So there's a few new ones. But this is the
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.640]   Unicode set. This is just finally adding to the operating system what has been in the Unicode
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:21.800]   set for some time. I just put up a picture in the in the chat of Jenny at the taking a picture
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:27.800]   of the meeting of the actual emoji meeting. She was so great. So there's the international
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:32.040]   emoji committee. What is this? Yeah, there's an old, yeah, there's a whole whole entire
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:37.480]   meetings with emojis. They act them out. I love it. So she went demanding dumpling.
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:42.200]   So look at the blue shirt. This is why there's a problem. Standard emoji.
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:50.200]   Shadowy emoji. Overlord. Oh, we know. There's some humor about it. Now we know who this
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:36:01.080]   shadowy emoji overlord is. There is the middle finger right above. There's the middle finger.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:08.200]   My greatest hope and wish for emoji is that everyone implements slacks emoji reactions.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:13.320]   Exactly. So that it's not just star or heart. You get to react.
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:18.600]   But that's why stickers are great. I have an telegram a whole set of Donald Trump stickers
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:25.320]   that correspond to standard emojis. So I can put I can put a little Donald at everything I send.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:28.600]   Call me old fashioned, but I think people should just write words and just
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:34.440]   forget about it. No. This is the new nonverbal speaking. And by the way, I just learned yesterday,
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:42.040]   I think that according science science, Leo, if you use a period in texting, people think you're a
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:46.600]   jerk. Yep. So I've stopped doing it for the last 24 hours of not you. Who are these people?
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:52.120]   Because I think you're a jerk if you don't. I just figure that a period goes to the end of a sentence.
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:57.080]   I just am not up that way. My kids. You're a jerk if you do two spaces after the period.
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:01.960]   No, that is. Yeah. That is. That is. That means you use typewriter.
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:05.720]   If you indent the first line of a paragraph, that's jerk. Yeah.
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:11.960]   What kind of jerk would do that? My kids though told me 10 years ago, I would put punctuation
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:16.440]   in upper lowercase and stuff in my text messages. They said, why are they mocked me? What are you
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:22.200]   doing? What are you? This is writing, kids. It's called writing. And you'll know you're very old
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:28.200]   when you put it all caps. Oh, my father does. Really? Oh, well, he had not a text. He did the
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:34.840]   textbook email. He puts all caps. He's always shouting. Hit that caps lucky. Yeah. Streaming.
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:41.160]   Emoji brings emotion to the conversation. I agree. It's what's missing from text is very hard.
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:46.600]   Unless you're a great writer like Mike and Jeff, and then you could put nuance into text.
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:52.200]   The only emotion I get is confusion. Like, what are they trying to tell them? Like, it's code.
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:56.920]   I'm like, what do I have to look it up? Well, what is the new Oxford English Dictionary word
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:04.120]   of the year? Is this a moat? Is it a publicity stunt? What is it? It's not a shrub. No, it's
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:09.000]   the crying. It's the crying. Happy tears. Yeah. It's the tears.
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:14.600]   No, it's not tears coming out. There's tears of joy or something. No, it's this. It's hands
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.320]   with things coming, shooting out of your head. Here, I'll find it for you.
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:22.440]   That's the word of the year? Yeah. I just love one.
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:26.280]   Well, they don't put it. They don't put it in the dictionary. They don't actually have.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:33.160]   So here is Oxford's tears of joy. Tears of joy is the technical name for it.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:38.280]   No, no, that's not it. Is that it? Oh, that is it. I'm I thought it was the other one.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:40.680]   Yeah, everybody knows what that is. Tears of joy.
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:46.520]   But how dumb is that? It's a publicity stunt. They want the press that they, in fact, God.
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:50.840]   This is it though. It's not a word. It's not a word. They can't put it in the dictionary.
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:56.280]   Oxford. I thought it was the one with the hands.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:03.640]   Maybe I'm wrong. So I'm reading a book now about what's I was drinking, drinking game time.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:07.480]   I haven't done this in a long time, folks. Gutenberg.
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:14.920]   Damn, I have their whiskey ready. Imagine communities. And the argument about how long
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:21.000]   it took pretty to take over was because Latin was the primary language of printing until
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.880]   printing started to go into the vernacular. And Latin had been the language of the bilinguals.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:28.920]   So to get a big enough market for printing, you had to put it in Latin.
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:33.560]   So then when the market spread and people started reading, then you could put the books
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:38.120]   in the vernacular and that's what spread it. And in a way, it strikes me that emoji becomes
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:43.240]   a new kind of bilingual language. Right? Sorry, that was a weird.
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:46.520]   No, but it is. I think you're right. It's but it's more expressive. That's, I think,
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:50.360]   what Gina was selling with Franca. Yeah. It is. But there's I mean, there's definitely times when
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:54.680]   people use certain emoji, like within certain communities, and it means a thing. And like,
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:57.320]   and there are definitely times that I'm like, I just don't know what this means.
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:01.000]   But you could say the same thing for acronyms. There are acronyms that I look at and I know,
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.640]   well, that's, you know, for a long time, I didn't know what YOLO was.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.600]   Right. Everybody was using it, but I wasn't in that kind of crowd.
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:12.680]   But you know what's preferable, though, to everybody going to a post, a post-literate
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:18.440]   symbol system is if we all just had the translation services that Google has,
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:22.600]   that Facebook has on by default, like right now in Google+, you can just hit the translate button
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:26.360]   in no matter what the language is for the most part Arabic, whatever. It just translates it in
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:30.600]   English. I'd love to have the default be just translate everything, make everything in English,
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:34.760]   and then for the people who speak or prefer another language besides English, they would see it in
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:40.840]   their language. That would be a great way. Why don't we use the amazing, amazing translation
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:45.960]   services that now exist? So we've solved this problem that's vexed mankind since the beginning
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:51.960]   of time and people like whatever. Yep. Have you ever wondered what it was that convinced Google to
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:57.480]   buy YouTube? Susan Wosicki, say her name. Wojiske. Wojiske. Wojiske. Wojiske. But there's an
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:00.520]   extra C in there. We're ignoring it. Yeah, but you have to decide to ignore it. Yeah. Okay.
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:08.120]   Susan Wojiske's favorite video, this was the video she was overseeing Google video in 2006,
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:13.560]   in charge of acquisitions. They were considering YouTube, which was tiny and unprofitable startup,
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:17.960]   ready to be sued by everybody and their brothers at NBC was just bearing down,
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:24.600]   Universal is bearing down on them. And she stumbled upon this video of two boys lip syncing the
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:30.920]   Backstreet Boys. And this was at Fortune's most powerful women next-gen summit.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:36.360]   And this was the video she says that made me realize that, wow, people all over the world can
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:40.680]   create content. They don't need to be in a studio. A light bulb went off in her head six months later.
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:47.640]   She led Google through the $1.65 billion acquisition, which I think we can all agree was a great acquisition.
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:50.600]   And this is Ladies and Gentlemen.
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:42:01.480]   Oh, this is going to be good. Two Chinese boys in Adidas track suits. Behind them, by the way,
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:06.680]   guy playing video games. What gets counter-strike? What amazing bragging rights for these guys,
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:10.120]   though, right? I was the reason that Google bought YouTube.
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:18.520]   It's actually pretty funny. You know what? Susan really did hit it right there. That's the in
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:25.480]   the nutshell. The essence today still of YouTube. I hope these guys got some Google sweatshirts or
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:29.800]   stock or something. I love the guy playing counter-strike behind it. Yeah.
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:35.800]   I know, like totally could not care less. It's so great. What's really funny is that people doing
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:42.760]   this sort of thing are now making millions of dollars a year. Wow, these two are really,
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:48.680]   really going for it with this magic boy song. What's interesting is that they in 2000s,
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:54.280]   these are the guys you should hire at Google. Because they saw in 2006, what would become a
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:59.960]   massive industry? Surely no one else was doing this kind of lip-syncing thing and or anything.
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:04.840]   Where did they get this idea? And why post it to something called YouTube?
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:13.400]   It was hilarious. I wish you could see this, folks. They're really... I thought this was going to be
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:18.440]   like two, like toddlers. These are these are these are college kids. I did say this looks like a dorm
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:22.760]   room or something. Yeah. Yeah. I like the matching tracks they're set. What year? What year was this?
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:25.560]   2006. Almost 10 years ago.
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:33.320]   Okay, you can't see this at home, but believe me.
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:41.320]   If you search for Nitro X unit 01, how'd you find that? We're still around. Nitro X unit. That's
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:45.880]   their channel. Actually, maybe that search doesn't work. I'm getting some. Yeah, don't search for
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:51.560]   that. A lot of people have hijacked it. Oh, of course they have. Wow. Three minutes and 38 seconds
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:58.760]   of Backstreet Boys and one point six. Is there a name in there? No, because nobody just BSB is the
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:04.360]   only thing that doesn't bring you anything. And if I click this, it's going to bring it to YouTube.
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:11.400]   So Nitro X unit is the channel. See, it was uploaded April 11th, 2006. And then, of course,
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:17.960]   the comments and they are way fewer than my Twitter feed, Mike Elgin on Twitter and the link is there.
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:22.600]   See this man. He knows what he's doing. By the way, 764,000 views on this video. Yeah. So that's
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:28.600]   pretty good. And half of them Google shareholders going, what? I am glad to see that Google has
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:36.520]   added in kind of response to Apple, a family version, a family price $14.99 for all Google
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:42.200]   All Access music up to six people, right? Just like the Apple thing. And you get YouTube Red.
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:48.440]   That to me makes Google play music the music choice, if you ask me. Yeah.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:55.160]   Because you so everybody in the family gets ad for YouTube, gets the music stuff plus, of course.
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:02.200]   Well, and you saw in five devices, because I can't put it on my pixel, because I always have more
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:07.560]   than five Google devices. And what they're doing is they're setting themselves up for a situation where
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:16.840]   YouTube Red becomes a television channel, essentially. I, they missed a bet they could have had that
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:23.320]   very Merry Christmas on there. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Well, yeah, when we'll go. This is the bit we
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:27.720]   always get in. If Google will were a real content company, it would have commissioned
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:33.240]   Yeah, something like that. They need to get serious and start doing that, right? Well, or,
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:36.520]   or know that you'll just scream louder that they're, that they're on channel conflict.
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:39.880]   Well, I didn't say I would be happy about it, but that's something.
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:47.960]   This year on Twitter, the traditional post every year from Twitter, the big hashtags.
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:54.600]   Is Google's that guy step yet for 20 2015? They changed the name of it. It's not because
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:58.200]   I guys to anymore, because that's their conference. Right. So it's
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:07.000]   hashtag, of course, Paris attacks, black lives matter, marriage equality. There's a lot of
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.760]   recent stuff in here. There's the only thing about it. And we have the same problem with our
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:15.960]   year enters. You tend to do the stuff that's recent instead of. Yeah, you remember it. So,
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:19.720]   by the way, Twitter TV slash best of you. If you remember something from earlier this year,
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:23.880]   we'd love to love to get your input. Yes, please. For our best of poor Jason has to put this all
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:29.000]   together. So Paris attacks, of course, black lives matter, of course, that was huge, tweeted
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:38.920]   nine million times in 2015. Marriage equality, of course, huge. They don't say how many times
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:43.960]   that was tweeted refugees. Well, that's brand new. Who's loved wins and marriage equality.
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:52.280]   Yeah, 370,000 tweets for I stand with Ahmed, the kid in in Irving, Texas national elections.
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:47:01.560]   FIFA, the World Cup, Women's World Cup. Pluto fly by. That's good. They should tell you, though,
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:05.800]   how many tweets on all of these and they don't the dress. Yeah.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:15.320]   That wasn't that wasn't this year. That was it was in February. That really lasted
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:22.120]   five years. That's a million tweets. Seems like ancient history. And then Caitlin Jenner joining
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:28.920]   Twitter. They don't mention the potus joining Twitter, but that was another big big event, wasn't
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:34.680]   it? Looks like YouTube just posted their YouTube rewind. Oh, yeah, we watched that. All right,
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:41.400]   tell you what, let's watch the YouTube rewind, which is their compilation of a bunch of stuff
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:51.560]   from sort of trending. Yeah, of course it is. YouTube stars and videos and memories from 2015.
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:56.680]   And then we'll actually I'll save it. You know what? We'll run it as the end of the show.
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:01.720]   Yeah. And one other thing about Twitter that I think is worth mentioning that's fairly recent
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:07.080]   is that Jeff Bezos started tweeting his first tweet. All right, his, well, he's done for now. And
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:11.640]   the last one was he said, finally, trashed by the real Donald Trump, we'll still reserve him on
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:16.600]   a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. And somebody pointed out that 25% of all his tweets are about
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:24.280]   Donald Trump. The hashtag send Donald to space next year. Let's have that be on the top list.
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:31.240]   How about that? By the way, Hillary. Note that she responded to Trump yesterday on medium.
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:38.040]   I find faster. Oh my God. The medium juggernaut marches on. Yeah, it does. It's become the place.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:43.880]   Twitter is the place for the offhand response. Yeah. Mediums become the place for the thoughtful
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:47.640]   full length response. I guess Ev Williams, who started both,
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:51.960]   probably is thinking, we need a long form and a short form. Yeah.
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:55.880]   And my brilliant ex agent, Kate Lee is in charge of getting famous people to
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.520]   write there. And she does a great job. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Well, she has a pro,
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:08.120]   she has like a medium account. Like she's, she's like, yeah. Yeah. Well, she's got a team, right?
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:09.240]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:18.200]   Sun Jake is working for Hillary. Really? Hampshire. In New Hampshire, yes. Oh, that's good for him.
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:20.440]   Good for him. That's great.
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:27.560]   You know what? That's, I think the, do you think that the candidates who does the best job
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:32.760]   with social media will be there? Well, I was thinking about this. So you have Joe Trippy,
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:36.120]   you know, Howard Dean's campaign manager who wrote a book famously saying the revolution will
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:40.280]   not be televised. And the, and the complaint was, you know, it's all commercials and huge amounts
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:46.200]   of money and blah, blah, blah, blah. The paradox here is that this incredibly rich guy, Trump,
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:51.080]   comes along and he's not spending any money. Yeah. He's made a campaign. He's, yes, he's,
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:54.840]   he's done it off television. Yes, he's done it with social media, but he's the evil one.
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:01.320]   And, and he has, you're almost free. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. All right. All right.
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:04.520]   All right. I don't think it's agreed that he's the evil one. No.
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:11.080]   He is a candidate. Some people are like him less than others. But let everyone know that Leo
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:15.880]   was trying to defend from horrible political tweets and such that we'll follow. But, but
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:21.080]   I don't think he's a priority, the evil one. Well, well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. So,
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:25.160]   what is it? There's other people in the running. He's the most, his most controversial thing,
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:30.040]   as he said, when American citizens who are also Muslims go on vacation, they shouldn't be allowed
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:35.320]   back in the country. That is evil. You can't deny access to the United States by law.
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:38.440]   Or poorly, I was trying to avoid this. This is like, no, I don't mind.
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:40.200]   I don't mind. I don't mind. I mean, that was,
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:43.480]   please, Uncle Joe, don't talk about it. And by the way, that's what Hillary Clinton's
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:47.800]   piece of medium was. It says, no, Donald Trump, we're not barring Muslims from entering the country.
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:52.600]   But the point is, is absolutely true that Donald Trump has shaped the discourse
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:59.560]   by adept use of not just new media, but mostly mainstream media. And somewhat of social media.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:05.320]   He's very adept at Twitter. And of language itself, I mean, he's, his style of speaking is,
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:11.080]   is very sound by friendly. Well, and this interest, because of all the candidates,
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:16.200]   if you look at the, what is the analysis they do for grade level of their writing and their speech?
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:19.320]   Is it a flash cadet or? Yeah, something. Yeah, that's it.
[01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:28.280]   According to Politico, Donald Trump's speech is third grade level. It's by far the lowest. But
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:33.880]   of course, if you're intelligent, and you know that you want to reach the electorate,
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:38.360]   I would think that's probably a good way to do it. Yeah, this is the flesh,
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:44.280]   concade grade level test. And for the record, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, Scott Walker,
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:49.480]   eighth grade level, John Kasich, the next lowest after Trump fifth grade. But Ted Cruz is ninth
[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:54.360]   grade. I see if they have Hillary Clinton in here in some of the other candidates. It looks like
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:59.240]   it's all the Republicans. But hey, you know, you want to reach the largest audience.
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:05.080]   Well, but, but it's also, I think it, I think the grade level is a byproduct of the fact that he
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:10.520]   speaks in absolute superlatives. Yeah, everything is either the best or the worst.
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:14.840]   That's what they say. Short blocky words. Yeah. And he links short blocky words into other
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:19.960]   short blocky words to create short blocky sentences, which he stacks in his short blocky paragraphs.
[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:26.680]   And by the way, there's a rhythm and a music to Donald Trump's speech. It's actually hard not to
[01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:31.000]   watch his speeches because there's a very musical rhythm to it. There are others who were adept at
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.560]   that like, I don't know, some fascists, I can name. Yeah, the other thing that's interesting
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:41.320]   about just this is a word nerd and a language geek. He doesn't, something that's common in rap,
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:46.200]   like Eminem does this a lot where he'll say something outrageous. But before you can even
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:51.160]   process it, his own moves out. Very smart. He always says, by the way, after he says something
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:55.480]   that's like, wait, what did you just and you can't react to the first thing because you're already
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:53:01.640]   trying to process the second thing. Listen to this, this is him. Well, this is just this speaks
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:07.320]   for itself. But he does exactly that technique in this little sound bite from this was actually
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:10.280]   in the same speech that he said Muslims should be banning from in the United States.
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:13.000]   Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to hear.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:18.520]   People because of the internet and we have to do losing a lot of people because of the internet
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:22.680]   and we have to do something. I love this. Actually, I'm sorry. I just want to get this
[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:28.920]   so that you can hear it. It's not very loud. This is this is somebody on Twitter. The only record
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:34.520]   apparently that exists of this MSNBC stream is somebody who held their camera kind of at an angle.
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:39.800]   Losing a lot of people because of the internet and we have to do something. We have to go see Bill
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:45.000]   Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. Wait a minute.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.520]   We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of other people that understand what's okay.
[01:53:48.520 --> 01:54:01.320]   By the way, now, boom, just as you say, very adeptly. Somebody should say freedom of speech
[01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:06.600]   and then immediately. Right. Foolish people. We have a lot of foolish people. We have a lot of
[01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:13.160]   foolish people. Fair. I mean, I petitioned. Yeah, repetition. But I don't think he's calculated.
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:16.760]   I frankly think this is how he talks. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think this is some sort of,
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:21.400]   he's like some evil genius plotting this stuff. This is just how he talks.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:26.440]   You got to close that internet up something. Close it up. And it doesn't matter if you can't
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:31.240]   call Bill Gates to close the internet. There were great, there were great treats as that,
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:37.160]   oh, Bill Gates tried. That was in an Explorer 3.0. A lot of good jokes about that.
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:46.520]   But anyway, I don't know what I did. I didn't want to go down this road.
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:52.040]   Sorry. That's my fault. I know it's okay. Actually, with AMP,
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:57.240]   couldn't Google close up parts of the internet? Don't open that one. There you go.
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:06.840]   There you go. By the way, Mark Zuckerberg did respond to the complaints about his.
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:09.880]   No, no, this is this. Yeah, he did respond to that. That's last. That's all news. We're talking
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:13.720]   about Muslims here. This is a really nice little posting. Yeah, this is about an hour ago on
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:17.800]   Facebook. I want to add my voice in support of Muslims in our community and around the world
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:23.880]   after the Aperis attacks and hate this week. I can only imagine the fear Muslims feel that
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:28.520]   they'll be persecuted for the actions of others. There's a very touching article. I think I can't
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:33.400]   remember where I saw it about Muslim school kids and the questions they now have to face every day
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:39.320]   in school. Did you plot 911? Are you part of Al Qaeda? Are you an ISIS? As a Jew, my parents
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:44.520]   taught me we must stand up against attacks on all communities, even if an attack isn't against
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:49.560]   you today and time attacks on freedom for anyone will hurt everyone. If you're a Muslim in this
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:53.960]   community as the leader of Facebook, I want you to know you are always welcome here and we will
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:59.480]   fight to protect your rights and create a peaceful and safe environment for you. Having a child,
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:05.080]   he's been he's been spending a lot of time with the max. Yeah, having a great picture of him with
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:09.240]   Max. I saw that. Wasn't that great? Oh, God, it was it was melting. Having a child has given us
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:16.760]   so much hope, but the hate of some can make it easy to succumb to cynicism. We must not lose hope
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:20.600]   as long as we stand together and see the good in each other, we can build a better place,
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:25.800]   a better world for all people. Someone said I don't know who was, I saw this, he's talking like a
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:32.760]   like a statesman. Yeah, he's really a little bit, but you know, he has a seat at the table. He is
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:38.200]   invited as you know, our other executives, but but I think that there was also a story of the New
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:45.560]   York Times today about how how social media is used by by ISIS and such and how Twitter can't
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:50.760]   stay ahead of it today or yesterday. And by the way, not just Donald Trump is saying shut the
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:56.440]   Internet. We've got we've got all of them are trying to attack, not just social media, but also
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:02.120]   encryption. It's a very scary moment for how the Internet ought to work versus how some will use
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:09.080]   this to fight the proper Internet. Today, our Harper 11th Senator from California, Diane Feinstein,
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:17.880]   reintroduced a measure of a proposed bill that would require tech companies, including Facebook,
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:23.640]   Twitter and YouTube to alert federal law enforcement about online terrorist activity. This is a,
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:30.440]   of course, bipartisan bill, Democrat Feinstein and Republican Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:36.440]   insist the bill doesn't mandate the company's monitor customers or take any additional action
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:40.920]   only that they report potential terrorist activity. Doesn't that exist? Isn't that law
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:46.120]   already? In essence, if you are witness to a crime, well, they say it's modeled after an existing
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:50.120]   law requiring them to report online child pornography. And people have pointed out that, you know,
[01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:57.240]   they are doing that. That does happen. Yeah. And quite effectively, I'm a little nervous, though,
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:05.080]   about putting the tech companies in charge of spying on their users. I feel like that is a
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:10.680]   risky road. It certainly is. And, you know, let's face it, I think that if you were to, if I had to
[01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:14.520]   bet my own money on who's going to win the presidency, it's probably going to be Hillary Clinton.
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:17.560]   But apologies to Jake. Here's a Hillary Clinton statement.
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:21.800]   She said, you're going to hear all the usual complaints, you know, freedom of speech, etc,
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:25.720]   etc. That's kind of like what's true. That's foolish, stupid, foolish people. But if we're
[01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:29.080]   truly in a war against terrorism, we're truly looking for ways to shut off their funding,
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:32.680]   shut off the flow of foreign fighters, then we've got to shut off their means of communicating.
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:37.880]   No. It's more complicated with some of what they do on encrypted apps. And I'm well aware of that.
[01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:41.560]   And that requires even more thinking about how to do it. So she's not more open-minded about it,
[01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:47.320]   but still it's scary language. But I think what both of both what all the candidates are tapping
[01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:55.320]   into is the popular notion that why are terrorists being allowed to use international means of
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:59:01.160]   communication to plot terror attacks? I think this is a huge question for a lot of people.
[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:06.600]   And all this nuance about encryption and all that kind of stuff is just lost on the public.
[01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:15.320]   It's so tempting when horrible things happen to look for kind of superficial solutions to it.
[01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:21.080]   And we all want to take action immediately. And of course, that's when you make the biggest
[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:25.000]   mistakes is when you just leap into action and say, well, let's fix this, let's fix this.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:30.200]   Or this is the problem. And if we just fix that, we just fix that.
[01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:34.760]   And I think it's a much deeper problem, frankly, terrorism. And I think if you're going to address
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:42.440]   it, you have to address it. It's roots. Gina. So part of the Times article argued that Twitter
[01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:48.120]   is missing some simple stuff that it goes from ISIS terrorist account one to ISIS terrorist account,
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:51.560]   10, ISIS terrorist account, 15. And just they just figured that out.
[01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:58.760]   Well, there's certain photos. As you know how to analyze Twitter, how hard do you think it would
[01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:04.200]   be because the argument is, well, they can't keep up. They can't keep up. First, how hard is
[02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:10.040]   it to find it? And second, because accounts are killed, indeed, if I'm going to look for this stuff,
[02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:13.960]   how come it's so easy to find it? Doesn't it take in a while to kind of propagate socially?
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:21.960]   What do you mean for anyone to find? Yeah. So I want to go in and today I decide
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:27.960]   I want to join ISIS because I had a bad day at the office. Right. If accounts are being killed,
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:32.520]   killed, killed, killed, killed, how do I go to Twitter and suddenly find the latest of
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:39.880]   80, 700 ISIS accounts? And that's one thing I think the Times kind of missed. Yeah,
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:43.560]   ISIS can create a new account, but it doesn't have any followers. Well, exactly. It's what I'm
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:47.320]   trying to say. It has to propagate socially. Well, but we also don't know to what extent
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:53.160]   people are being contacted privately on Twitter. Right. And it's invisible. You can't search for it,
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:59.560]   but there's a lot of one-to-one in the recruitment effort. They are monitoring Twitter for people
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:04.440]   with certain under certain conditions that feel alienated in certain ways, that are of certain ages
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:09.080]   in certain countries. And then they're contacting them. And if people are already Muslim, for example,
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:13.080]   they can relate to them as a Muslim and start talking to them and sort of lead them down this
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:18.120]   path. And you can't find that by searching if it's private.
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:24.520]   Yeah. I mean, look, I think Twitter and these kind of big social networks have created these
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:30.920]   elaborate systems for detecting spam, for detecting child pornography, for now getting better,
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:37.400]   helping people combat cases of abuse and trolling. I mean, I think a lot of the same principles would
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:43.320]   kind of would come into play. I mean, I think that people have to
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:50.520]   police each other or not police each other, but call out, keep an eye on each other versus putting
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:58.280]   the toll burden on the company itself. Give the community the tools it needs to help itself.
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:05.080]   And to say, this seems a little bit off. What can we do about this? The way that you would,
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:11.400]   if you met a young person in real life and you thought, I'm a little bit worried about this
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:15.720]   kid, seems a little lost, seems a little distant, seems like maybe some things aren't going so well.
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:21.480]   I know it doesn't easily translate into a social network online. And I'm not saying that it's easy,
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:30.040]   but there is some precedent for this. And I think that we can, it's about empowering
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:35.480]   community to help themselves. And I think it is in some way about watching for patterns and
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:41.320]   evolving. Spam constantly evolves too, right? But we pretty much lick that problem.
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:48.280]   Why is it Twitter doing a better job though of finding and suppressing these accounts? I mean,
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:53.640]   the time's point was, well, they're just incrementing by one. Surely Twitter could observe and figure
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:57.560]   this out. They've always tried to heal in the system. But they don't, is it that
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:03.400]   they, the Twitter doesn't want to get in this business. I don't, I think they're afraid,
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:08.120]   more afraid of airing on the side of, of censoring, content that shouldn't be censored. I mean,
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:12.200]   you can imagine it's a fine line. Oftentimes people post things and they're actually being
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:19.640]   sarcastic or they're mocking or they're something. And it can be taken by people as being in favor
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:24.760]   of the thing they're mocking or being cynical about. And so it's at, you know, languages is,
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:31.320]   is, can be subtle. And sometimes it's difficult to tell whether somebody's just exercising their
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:36.840]   right to free speech or whether they're recruiting terrorists, you know, or whatever. I mean, it's,
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:41.880]   it seems like an easy thing to do until you try to do it. And then the devil's in the details.
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:49.960]   In this case, literally, or crampus. Yes. Crampus.
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:54.760]   Crampus is in the details. That's what I hear anyway. Yes. Let's take a break. I'm so depressed.
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:04:01.640]   Okay, when we come back, we'll talk about empathy on that. No, that'll cheer me up.
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:07.240]   A show today brought to you by FreshBooks. I love FreshBooks and they get better and better
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:11.320]   and better. I love what they're doing. We've talked about them before. I first started using
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:15.880]   them more than 10 years ago when I was going to Canada one week a month and had to invoice
[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:21.080]   them for my time and my travel and my expenses. And it was just a pain. It was such a pain.
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:24.440]   I mean, I had first, I mean, they knew they wanted a Canadian dollars. That was like, okay,
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:30.680]   I'm going to figure this out. I got a fire up word, got a fire up Excel. I put it off for months.
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:34.440]   And of course, if you're a freelancer and you don't bill, you don't get paid.
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:38.520]   So that wasn't a good idea. Amber MacArthur told me about FreshBooks. Nice,
[02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:44.120]   nice Toronto company. They just started up in 2004. They helped me do these invoices and they're
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:49.560]   getting better and better for freelancers, for small businesses that need to do invoicing,
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:55.400]   but do a lot more. This is a simple, super simple cloud accounting site and program,
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:05:00.520]   program as a service that's giving thousands of freelancers like you, the tools to save time
[02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:07.000]   billing, get paid faster, create and send invoices in minutes, watch expenses. You're going to have
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:11.000]   to start using this, Mike. I just realized. I've been using it for the columns that I
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.760]   call them. Oh, yeah, because you freelanced with the computer world and, yeah, what magazines
[02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:20.280]   you write? It's those computer world, baselines, CIOs, a bunch of others. And of course, on computer
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:24.280]   world, I'm actually syndicated with an IDG. So that's PC world and all the rest. And then pretty
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:27.960]   soon you're going to be able to bill them for travel expenses. One of the great things about
[02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:32.360]   FreshBooks that I really like is, you know, one time they automatically send this perfectly
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:37.480]   formatted invoice. And you can say, oh, I just sent it by email, boom, off it goes. And there's
[02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:41.880]   a, by the way, there's a pain button, which is awesome. Yeah, there's all kinds of stuff. But I
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:46.440]   like the really simple things. One of them was I sent it to a different editor one time and they
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:51.560]   said, you know, actually, I'm sorry to ask you this, could you please send a PDF? I just prefer
[02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:56.920]   PDFs. So when back to FreshBooks, click the PDF button. So we got a perfect PDF. I mean, it's like,
[02:05:56.920 --> 02:06:00.280]   I didn't need PDF software. I didn't even mess around with it. It just happened.
[02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:05.400]   So, and then of course, if you have expenses, you can use the FreshBooks app to take pictures
[02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:10.120]   of the receipts, get them right into the invoices. By the way, time and hours, if you bill by hours,
[02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:16.760]   the app will do that for you. And again, put it right in there in the, into the invoice.
[02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:20.760]   They've got some new features, which I really like. There's something called deposit.
[02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:28.120]   You can get paid upfront. So if you cover costs out of pocket, you know, or you've got an
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:32.920]   ongoing expenses, you can request a deposit in FreshBooks. Your client could put money in
[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:36.760]   there for you, which is automatically dispersed. That makes it so much easier. You don't have to
[02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:41.240]   wait till the end of the project to get paid. They have now a card reader. Maybe you saw this in the
[02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:47.560]   news. So you're a freelancer. You can even accept credit cards wherever business takes you,
[02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:52.600]   right from your iPhone, less than a minute. The FreshBooks card reader is a, an EMV chip card
[02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:56.520]   enabled, which is what everybody wants to use now. It works right out of the box. You just open
[02:06:56.520 --> 02:07:02.200]   your end. This is so cool. You open your invoice from the FreshBooks app. You plug in the reader,
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:09.560]   you dip the chip or swipe the stripe, boom. They paid you. Man, if you're a contractor,
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:13.400]   if you're in business for yourself and you go out and you do work and you want to get paid right
[02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:18.440]   away, I expect to see this a lot now, you know, I just think this is so great. But of course,
[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:23.960]   if you have questions, help is forever free. You can always count on their support rock stars
[02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:27.240]   for the best support. Because they're nice people actually. They're really great people.

[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:49.720]   FreshBooks so much for making my life a lot easier for so long and mics too. And for supporting
[02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:55.960]   our shows, freshbooks.com/twig. T-W-I-G.
[02:07:55.960 --> 02:08:04.280]   I'm just feeling good about this Chromebook Pixel. I've got it all set up now and installed all my apps.
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:09.640]   I still want you to type something with a record of returns.
[02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:11.880]   C-L-T-E-R-O. Oh, he really is made at your own now.
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:15.240]   Oh, yeah. It's the first thing I mean, I've installed so many new apps,
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:22.840]   Android devices that I use Nova Launcher and I save out my layout. And of course, this is a tablet,
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:27.640]   so it's a little bit different. But I know how I want it, so I'm able to get the widgets I want
[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:33.960]   and everything just ready to go. I will do some typing in a second. One of the complaints is that
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:42.360]   there aren't tablet-specific apps. This is Google's Play News app. And I think that they've done
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:46.200]   it. Google at least has made something that works pretty well. Let's see what,
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:52.120]   in fact, this looks great. We've talked about that before. Let's see about the New York Times.
[02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:57.240]   If I go into the New York Times, how's that going to? Yeah, so there's a lot of white space in the
[02:08:57.240 --> 02:09:02.200]   column on the right there. I guess I have to leave them for Zulily. That was the ad has loaded.
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:07.400]   Yeah, that's all. Well, that's the front page was nice, though. I think the Times does a nice job
[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:12.840]   of that. I guess they're a little bit tablet-savvy, right? They use the layout. The Times Review
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:16.520]   says it has volume buttons, Leo. And they're easy to reach.
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:21.880]   Oh, yeah, there it is. How would you not have a volume button?
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:31.160]   Followed me. Yes, thank you, Time, for telling me how to use this. Let's see if a flip board works.
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:38.440]   Yeah, I feel like, so you said, Gina, this is the layout stuff that's built into,
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:45.240]   I should sign into my, here, hide my screen for just a second, Jason, if you would.
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:54.760]   Thanks. I'm going to log into. I like the keyboard. I really like having a keyboard with, oops,
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:05.480]   with a tablet. I found that with the iPad. It's better than having to use that on screen keyboard.
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:12.760]   Yeah. I have adored my Nexus 7. I still do. Yeah, the board looks pretty good.
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:16.840]   Yeah, this is a good, I think this is a good replay. It's a lot bigger than Nexus 7.
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:20.520]   A lot bigger. It doesn't fit in the pocket anymore, but as a way to watch movies and the
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:25.080]   plane and stuff, it does look cool. That's nice. Yeah, it looks really nice. Yeah, I mean,
[02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:29.560]   Android has all the support there. There's a concept of fragments where they're basically
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:34.920]   modules and you can define, you could be like, once you pass this threshold of a screen size,
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:41.000]   then use this layout and you can define those layouts and just their XML files.
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:48.120]   It's really not that difficult, but I think that developers also focus on who's using their
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:53.400]   stuff, right? If developers are not seeing a whole lot of tablet use, mostly phone use,
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:57.320]   they're going to see the Instagram login. Look at that. Look at how stretched that is.
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:01.240]   So now that works, right? But it looks a little wonky.
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:05.400]   Like when you look at that, you go, that doesn't look like it's going to work really well.
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:10.360]   Even Google now, which is, I mean, it should be a three column layout. I mean, there's plenty
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:15.640]   of space here. Yeah, that could be three column. I mean, you're also, your device could be kind
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:20.440]   of right on the edge of the kind of standard for defining what you're just talking about.
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:24.360]   Yeah, exactly. But I presume, oh, this is nice grid.
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:30.360]   Yeah, this is Google plus one way to expect this to be a three column.
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:33.880]   But plus has always done that, right? It's been responsive.
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:36.040]   This'll be a nice little plus.
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:38.760]   Yeah, well, that one spans the two. Yeah, that's nice.
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:46.120]   And there, of course, Pixel C communities.
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:49.000]   Oh, yeah. Immediately starting up, right?
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:50.600]   Yeah.
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:55.880]   Somebody said Slack. There are a few apps that don't know that you're in portrait mode and you have
[02:11:55.880 --> 02:12:01.080]   or landscape mode and you have to flip it. That's not good because on this device, that's, you can't,
[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:06.680]   you know, really slack. Oh, well, I think they said slack, but I'll have to, I think, you know,
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:12.360]   this people should adjust to this, although it's not the first time tablets have been here.
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:21.000]   Oh, I don't know. Slack goes landscape on a six. Gina, do you have a tip for us?
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:29.480]   Yeah, you know, my tip this week is kind of the biggest new feature edition that Google's had
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:33.880]   really this week is which is reminders in Google Calendar.
[02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:39.800]   So I obviously, I make a to-do list app. It's pretty low-five.
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:44.120]   But I've always been sort of fascinated by how Google has really danced around to-dos.
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:48.840]   Like they never really had their own task app for a while. They had tasks inside of Gmail
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:54.840]   and then they had Keep, which has checkboxes and reminders, but isn't really a to-do app.
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:59.880]   Well, they just added reminders, which are basically to-dos to Google Calendar,
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:06.280]   which means that you can say, you know, hey, I got to, you know, call the florist and it'll add
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:11.480]   this reminder to your agenda, to your day. And if you don't get it done, it'll automatically roll
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:16.440]   that reminder over to your next day. And you can swipe left to mark it as complete.
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:21.640]   And these reminders are actually the same reminders that you set up in Google Keep. And they're the
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:26.760]   same reminders that you can set up in Google Inbox. So these are across all of your kind of
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:31.640]   your Google apps. It's got that little hand with the, you know, the finger with the
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:36.040]   string tied around it. So they're calling them reminders. They're basically, though,
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:40.360]   it's a task list. I mean, it's a to-do list. And it's got all that kind of nice Google goodness
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:43.880]   where it knows, you know, if you're saying you need to call somebody, it'll look it up in your contacts.
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:50.520]   It'll kind of auto-fill the phrases. It's pretty smart. So yeah, that's reminders. And that's in the
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:54.600]   new Google Calendar app or the latest version of the Google Calendar app on Android. I believe it's
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:14:01.720]   Android only right now. So there it is, to-dos on your calendar. To-dos on your calendar. Yeah.
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:08.760]   It's very cool. Mr. Mike Elgin, you got a tip for us or a trick or a toy or a tool. I have a tip.
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:15.720]   I have a couple of tips. I have three tips. And we all know that Google+ was recently redesigned.
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:23.800]   It was the redesign. It was a mixed bag in general. They favor brand new users and kind of did it in
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:29.160]   a way that isn't great for a long time, hardcore diehard users. So a lot of the hardcore users are
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:34.280]   complaining about the redesign. There are three things that really bug me about the redesign.
[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:41.640]   And I have workarounds for them. So the first thing is that Google used to have by far the best search
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:48.920]   on any social network, not surprising. It's Google. And they still have vastly better search than
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:53.560]   Facebook. However, I would rank Twitter now as being having much better search than Google+
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:59.400]   after the redesign because they now don't let you sort by time. You can't reshuffle it so that the
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:05.000]   most recent post is at the top, which makes it useless for certain types of searches. And so
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:10.200]   they'll show it the ranking based on relevance. And that's the only option. It's a terrible thing.
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:15.640]   I think they need to fix that and go back the way it was. But the workaround is that you can do
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:23.720]   the search. And again, this is a Cluj on Google search. So go to Google search, use site colon plus
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:29.560]   google.com, and then put your search before or after that. And you can search for anything. And
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:33.880]   even with it, if something's posted seconds later, it's available on Google search. That's
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:39.160]   interesting. And you can sort by put that into Google plus is crazy. I don't know. It's so frustrating.
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:43.960]   Okay. The second thing is, and that's a that's kind of an old fact, that's just an idea. We already
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:47.640]   know how to do site colon searches with that operator. All right. The second thing is,
[02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:52.440]   people are complaining that circles have been de-emphasized. You launched it here a second
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:58.200]   ago. And of course, you saw a world of communities. So it's all focused on communities and collections.
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:06.120]   Communities are Reddit-like areas where it's all focused around the topic and anyone can post.
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:12.040]   A collections are based on the person. So each person has their own collections. And so you can
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:16.440]   opt out of certain topics that people talk about. For example, if you like to follow me about tech,
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:21.320]   but you don't want to hear my endless, see my endless pictures of food, you can opt out of my
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:25.800]   food and drink pics and you just get the tech or whatever. That's what that's what the collections
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:31.480]   are. It used to be human focused and the content was secondary. Now its content is primary and the
[02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:36.600]   humans are secondary. People miss circles. So you used to be circle based. If you miss the circles
[02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:40.520]   and you want to bring back the circles, it's very, very easy to do. And here's how you do it.
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:45.800]   You go into settings from the left bar, click on settings, then you go into advanced settings
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:49.720]   down at the bottom near the bottom of the page. And under advanced settings, you'll see a thing
[02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:55.560]   that says enable circle, stream and navigation. Just throw that switch and then look what happens
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:59.960]   over on the left. You now have circle streams. Click on that and there are all your circles.
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:03.560]   Click on those and you are now looking at the stream of those circles just like before.
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:07.880]   So I don't know why they buried this. I understand why they're not emphasizing, but
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:13.240]   don't bury it. Is there a way to get rid of circles? Well, if you don't want to follow people,
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:16.760]   you can't. I mean, you can just, you know, you can have everybody in the fall on the trash and
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:21.000]   just have no be following no one. No, but I want people. I just don't want the
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:24.520]   and you can see I've overdone it. I category something like categories.
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:30.920]   I just like I wish there were some tools. You can delete any circle management tool.
[02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:35.160]   Well, you can go into people there on the on the left and you can manage your, you know,
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:39.080]   those are all the people. Yeah. And you can circle right and you can delete circles. You can move
[02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:41.800]   people around and all that kind of stuff. You can still do the things that you used to be able to
[02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:45.800]   do, but they've de-emphasized it. I want you to think about in terms of your passion. So if you're
[02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:49.720]   into Legos, they want you to be focused on the Lego community and Lego collections and other
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:54.760]   people's Lego collections. And that's the organizing principle and they don't want to confuse you with
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:59.640]   too many options. So the hidden circles, kind of. Right. And so anyway, that's that's a way to bring
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:03.240]   it back. And I recommend everybody do that. It's nice to be able to have friends and family and,
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:11.160]   you know, yeah, in our case, Twitch staff and etc. Right. Okay. Now the third tip is going to be
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:18.760]   less useful for everyone. In comments now, you can't do good moderation. They used to auto flag
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:23.800]   people using their algorithm saying, Oh, this person's a spammer or troll or whatever. So they
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:28.680]   would hide it in a certain area where the person who did the post could go and un flag it and bring
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:34.840]   them, restore it back into the community of of comments. You can't do that anymore. Once Google
[02:18:34.840 --> 02:18:40.360]   says something is a spammer or a troll, that's it. Oh, it's terrible. Because I, you know, the false
[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:45.480]   positives are off the charts. Right. I get so many comments that the great comment, you know,
[02:18:45.480 --> 02:18:49.880]   they should be trying to drive engagement, not stifle it. And people don't even know that their
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:54.440]   comment has been flagged. Right. Nobody can see it except the person who posted it who thinks
[02:18:54.440 --> 02:18:59.240]   everybody can see it. It's terrible. So there is no solution to this. There's nothing you can do
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:04.040]   about it other than complain to Google. And so I'd like to I'd like to get together a
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:09.560]   song complaint, a mob, a mob of people with torches and pitchforks, to go rush Mountain View and say,
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:14.680]   give us full moderation again. We want to be able to restore or have perfect algorithms,
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:19.720]   which you do not. Once you have perfect algorithm, fine. But until then, let us restore people who
[02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:26.520]   have made perfectly good content comments. Those are my three Google tips. And one request.
[02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:33.080]   I like Google+, I wanted to succeed. But I don't care if it's a small, tight group of
[02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:38.360]   involved people. That's what I want. You know what? A public post on Google+ is a page on the
[02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:42.520]   internet. It's like a media post. That's what I want to look at that way. And I personally like
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:47.880]   the idea of having comments all in order of when they were posted at the bottom rather than
[02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:52.280]   the medium process of being able to cherry pick every little, you know, having the comments in the
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:59.800]   that's a thought. So I feel like it would be nice if it looked as good as medium. Maybe they
[02:19:59.800 --> 02:20:07.960]   need a display, an AMP version of their display. Well, if you're going to do AMP, Google, do AMP.
[02:20:07.960 --> 02:20:10.200]   Do AMP. Do it on Google+, where else?
[02:20:10.200 --> 02:20:18.440]   Jeff, you have a number. But before you do that, I know you also want to mention this job posting.
[02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:23.320]   Thank you. Yes. It's a big deal for both of us. We're as most of you know, by now, we're going
[02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:29.320]   to start to finally, we're going to start the Twit New York outpost at CUNY at my school.
[02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:33.720]   And we're going to produce a weekly Twit show on the New York's tech sector and the exciting
[02:20:33.720 --> 02:20:41.160]   life here. I love this idea. I have money from a grant and I need a producer. I need our Jason.
[02:20:41.160 --> 02:20:49.880]   And so this person will work full time from January through May to get the show going and get the set
[02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:53.880]   and do some prototypes and stuff. And then after that, become part time ongoing producer and board
[02:20:53.880 --> 02:20:59.800]   up and everything like just like Jason, this person will go to Twit HQ to learn the ways of Twit.
[02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:05.720]   I have one good application so far, but I need more applications. And so I did a short URL.
[02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:17.480]   bit.do/twitny. That's b-i-t.do/twitny. Apply yourself, tweet it, Facebook it, pass it on to friends.
[02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:21.880]   If you're interested in podcasts and wanted to be in the leading podcast company on Earth,
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:30.040]   and if you are interested in the tech scene, then it's a great gig. And so I wanted to plug that
[02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:35.080]   first. And we can't wait to be working. We're so excited. Yeah, a company. And I know there are a lot
[02:21:35.080 --> 02:21:40.680]   of you listening who live in the area in the New York area. I would think be very interested in this.
[02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:47.560]   And Gina, you'll be coming into the studio. Oh heck yeah, I'm going to be right there. I'm so excited
[02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:53.480]   about this. I have a very long list of people that I want you to be on the show. That's exactly what
[02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:59.880]   I want. And starting with you. And then we could probably do the show from this show too.
[02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:06.200]   Yeah, I think this is your new studio. Well, you can do it either way. But you have the option
[02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:11.880]   if you're at work. I did require that we outfit everything and hang out. It's only no Skype.
[02:22:11.880 --> 02:22:17.880]   But other than that. As long as the lights stay on during the show, I think this is good.
[02:22:17.880 --> 02:22:24.200]   You can convince them not to have that auto off switch, right? Yeah. Do you have a host in mind?
[02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:29.240]   Are you still a developer host? I'll start off. I'm going to start off. We'll have rotated
[02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:31.800]   hosts. That's why you're going to be coming to the studio, Gina. Because you're going to be
[02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:38.040]   get you to. Oh yeah. Obviously, I hope to find some brilliant new star and you know, so good that
[02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:42.680]   the public says, get Jarrah's off. Get that person. I know they say that now on the show anyway.
[02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:46.360]   But no one says that. When you say rotating house, you don't mean like Leo with the Google
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:50.200]   cardboard. That's right. That's not what you mean. If you're not rotating house, make sure you
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:54.520]   move all obstacles out of the way before they start rotating. It's my story.
[02:22:56.360 --> 02:23:02.920]   My number the number is one nine eight one. 1981 1981. I'm a car.
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:08.760]   Nineteen eighty one. That is the address on landings drive in Mountain View, California,
[02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:20.040]   where there is now a public Google swag store. Wow. I knew. Uh, new. Oh, that's awesome.
[02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:26.120]   So you can now go to the Google swag store. It used to be you had to have a Google employee
[02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:30.120]   take you in and had they had to stand there and be there with you while you go around,
[02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:34.600]   you know, debating whether you want to see this teacher or that treasure. And now you can go there
[02:23:34.600 --> 02:23:39.560]   and out right now, it's typically it's Google understated in a weird way. Because it's just an
[02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:42.520]   office block and then you walk in and there's a store and I said, people come in here. You
[02:23:42.520 --> 02:23:49.880]   have income in here. And outside are all the Android, um, uh, mascots. So you can pose with
[02:23:49.880 --> 02:23:55.160]   pictures with, you know, a marshmallow. Are they, uh, wait, the big, like the biggest
[02:23:55.160 --> 02:23:59.080]   little statues? The big ones are right outside. It'd be better for like time square. We're
[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:06.520]   had people to kind of dirty marshmallow. Yeah. Yeah. Freelancers freelancers. That means so much
[02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:11.800]   better. I'm Kit Kat. Nobody ever wants to take a picture with me anymore.
[02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:19.880]   But here have a Kit Kat. The naked Kit Kat. I'm a Claire. How do you think I feel?
[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:26.680]   That's the top list of Claire's. That's it. Claire's. This, this, this, Claire's new this.
[02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:32.040]   Uh, they also had a corner in the store where it said, you know, get the old Google by, by a
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:37.160]   piece of history, get the old Google logo. Oh, nice. Um, and I, I also had to go as a
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:44.040]   media as a Facebook. So they're clearance on the old Google. And I also got the new Facebook logo.
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:50.600]   To, uh, why now I'm up to date with my swag with my Google. Now, the Facebook store is not open.
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:56.600]   This is the old Google. I buy, I buy my swag, by the way. I bought this. The old Google.
[02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:01.640]   I never did get that. Android beanie. I ordered from really far, far away.
[02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:08.120]   Every time I see your icon with it, I go, hmm. Was that a, um, did you buy that from the
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:13.080]   storage by that? No, no, I was, where was it? It was like someone's Kickstarter. Probably.
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:17.320]   Somewhere far, far away. So anyway, uh, oh, now on time,
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:21.480]   when it was 1881, Landings Drive in Mountain View, California, just got to get the
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:26.680]   new one. They moved the statues. Look at that. Huh. They moved them. They had to, right?
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:30.680]   Cause the statues used to be in front of the, the Android building. Yeah. And I'm looking
[02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:34.920]   at, maybe they made duplicates. They must have made, maybe they made duplicates. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:39.800]   This is, this is great. So people, people, as I walk up, people are there taking selfies with,
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:46.680]   with the, the, the, giant androids. Yeah. Yeah. Very cool. Well, my pick of the week would have
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:52.280]   been this Chromebook, uh, I'm rather pixel C, uh, Android tablet, but, uh, I guess we,
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:57.560]   I'm, I mean, I don't know if it's a pick, but so far I'm so, I'm happy. It's obviously the
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:03.160]   Android tablet to have, right? Yeah. Yeah. If you got the money, go for it. I like this. I didn't
[02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:07.000]   realize I could do that. I could have it at any angle. I think that's my,
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:15.480]   says on a, on a, on a horrid knee, capped, awful economy seat. Yeah. Just the right size.
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:23.000]   All right. What fun this has been. Thank you, Mike Elgin for coming in and being part of our
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:27.160]   show. I hope you will make a regular habit of that. I hope so too. Yeah. You just,
[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:30.200]   in natural here, you belong here. This is a great show. You're all ready as a great show.
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:35.640]   Uh, you know, you notice those what we did here. See, we went the show so long. It's like
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:38.600]   doing three shows. You might as well come and do the other shows. I should,
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:42.680]   I, that said, I should just come in every week. Yeah. Show. You know, I'm seven so much fun.
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:49.960]   I even noticed good Lord. We almost took two and a half hours. I'm so sorry. I say this to people.
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:52.600]   Yo, we talk about Google for two and a half hours. You what? No.
[02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:58.360]   Oh, it's so hard to explain to anyone. Like people, like, all about Android same thing.
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:02.280]   Like, what do you talk about? Well, it's this mobile phone operating system. And they'd be like,
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:07.080]   what's it's us getting together, having a good time is what it is. People say all videos could
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:10.120]   be short. It's gonna be six seconds. I said, no, actually it could also be two and a half hours.
[02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:17.240]   Yeah. Yeah. It could be. Uh, thank you, Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com. He's a professor of
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:24.440]   journalism at the city university of New York. Don't forget bit.do slash twit. And why? And why?
[02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:32.040]   bit.do slash twit and why that put that in there for the listing for that job at CUNY.
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:36.200]   And yeah, I think the best, I think a nice perk is you get to come out here and spend some time
[02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:43.640]   to go to the brick house. Get trained by brilliant producers. Gina Trapani has two fabulous
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:51.320]   efforts. Of course, there's think up at thinkup.com. A great place to go to sign up and get your analytics
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:58.120]   for your social feeds, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter. We're doing best of 2015 right now,
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:03.480]   just like everyone else on the internet. Oh, yeah. Thank you, Gina. I got my, I got my, uh,
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:10.840]   notice from you. Oh, good. Yeah, we're doing best of 2015. We count all the stuff that
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:15.320]   Twitter analytics and Facebook insights doesn't count. Like how many times you use exclamation
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:21.880]   points, how many times you mentioned yourself who your bestie is. So it's a lot of fun. Check it out.
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:28.440]   Can we get that for Donald Trump? We should, I would love to do a flash concade, actually,
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:32.840]   analysis of people's tweets. Although I feel like it's not so too fair because tweets are all
[02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:43.960]   your tweets are a good guy. My Facebook bestie, Stacey Allegro, Pilates instructor, my Twitter bestie,
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:51.880]   Simon Zarafa. Not a surprise. Hi, Simon. My Instagram bestie. Don't know who he is. Nigel,
[02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:59.400]   UK 1962. But apparently he liked a lot of pictures. He's a fan. He's a fan. And then, of course,
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:04.680]   all of the great analytics. This is just, I love this and it looks good. It really looks great.
[02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:13.160]   Now you also have maker base. That's make up a dot S E. It's actually maker base dot co.
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:21.480]   The main name God smiled upon us. And someone took pity on us in our dot S E. And we moved to dot
[02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:26.680]   co, which is much easier to say here on twig. It was specifically for twig that I wanted to move
[02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:34.840]   away from dot S E because I hated saying it. Maker base dot co. That's great. Five of your
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:38.440]   favorite projects. And this is free. Anybody can do it. In fact, everybody should do it because
[02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:42.680]   the idea is you go in there and you talk about who makes the stuff you like. It could be you.
[02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:46.120]   It could be somebody else. Get and give credit for what you make.
[02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:50.200]   Get and give credit. Excellent. Maker base dot co. That's great.
[02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:55.080]   Yeah. Thanks, Leo. Can I go to think up dot com slash Donald Trump? What is it?
[02:29:55.080 --> 02:29:59.720]   Jade, Donald J. Trump. What is his real Donald Trump? Real Donald Trump.
[02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:04.840]   He is not a user. So unless you're a user, you don't run the analytics.
[02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:11.000]   No, because we ask for access to your friends. Yeah, Donald, we want to know.
[02:30:12.280 --> 02:30:16.840]   We want to know who your bestie for 2015 is. You can go back in time.
[02:30:16.840 --> 02:30:21.960]   Right. If you sign up today, we'd know from the past. Yeah. Yeah. You can go back depending on
[02:30:21.960 --> 02:30:27.000]   API limits. So, but anybody could go to anybody who's like you can go to think up dot com slash
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:31.720]   Leo report, even if you don't know me, right? It's Leo, the port dot think up dot com. So
[02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:37.160]   if you think yours is public, yeah, people can see it. Yeah. You can set it to private.
[02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:39.800]   If it's a private account or you just don't want people other people to see your insights.
[02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:44.200]   It's a tough to you. So you can't wait. Wait, you can't.
[02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:48.120]   Can you just analyze Donald Trump's feed? Don't ask me that permission.
[02:30:48.120 --> 02:30:56.440]   Yeah, we could. We could. We built it so that people opt in because. Oh, Gina.
[02:30:56.440 --> 02:31:02.840]   You're no fun. Such a goody two shoes. We can do. We can do more. At some point,
[02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:06.280]   we kind of had, you know, one of our open source contributors kind of kind of forked
[02:31:06.280 --> 02:31:10.360]   they go up and made it so that you could just enter anybody's. But then you're using using
[02:31:10.360 --> 02:31:14.200]   different API calls. They're a lot more limited and the insights just weren't as good and
[02:31:14.200 --> 02:31:17.320]   it wasn't where we want to go with the turnkey solution. So.
[02:31:17.320 --> 02:31:19.880]   Yeah, I suggest a product though.
[02:31:19.880 --> 02:31:25.240]   Four years ago. Is that just just just pick celebrities and do it to them?
[02:31:25.240 --> 02:31:31.320]   No, that's I mean, yeah. Right. Right. No, that's it. It's a good point. It's really a good point.
[02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:34.120]   There are other services that do that and actually it would be really interesting for
[02:31:34.120 --> 02:31:38.280]   Trump and all the other candidates. Oh, would it ever? Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Just do a candidate
[02:31:38.280 --> 02:31:40.920]   one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:31:40.920 --> 02:31:45.480]   Spoke in the beer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That would be very interesting.
[02:31:45.480 --> 02:31:51.640]   I think some journalists should just come to you and solicit your assistance in this.
[02:31:51.640 --> 02:31:57.320]   Intent. Thanks for the idea. Great to have you here, Gina. Thanks for being here.
[02:31:57.320 --> 02:31:59.400]   Thank you. I love. I love doing the show with you guys.
