[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.560]   Gene has the day off.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.500]   Jeff Jarvis is with us in studio, so is Kevin Marks.
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.960]   We have a lot to talk about, including Muslim rage
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.200]   and Jesus' wife.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.680]   It's all next on Twig.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.040]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.400]   From people you trust.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.720]   This is Twig.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.480]   Bandwidth for this week in Google
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.880]   is provided by cashfly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.360]   This is Twig.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.000]   This week in Google, episode 164, recorded September 19,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.680]   2012, Clover Lover.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.840]   This week in Google is brought to you by Stamps.com.

[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.000]   Ford invites tech geeks to join the conversation,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.760]   submit ideas, and grab a tech geek badge at social.ford.com.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.640]   It's time for this week in Google.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.320]   And we are here today with kind of an unusual situation.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.120]   Jeff Jarvis is in studio with us.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.200]   Look, he's got normal flesh colored skin.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.080]   Why do you look so--
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.520]   I'm not pink slime.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.760]   You're the same exact color I am.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.600]   I don't know what it is.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.120]   I don't know what it is.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.320]   Your flesh looks completely normal.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.320]   Anyway, it's great to have you.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.360]   We have the same hair.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.920]   Well, in fact, because of the advanced age of this panel,
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.160]   we will be taking bathroom breaks every 60 minutes
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.920]   on the show today.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.360]   So you're--
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.360]   Darantate.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.280]   [SIGHS]
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.200]   Also with this-- and I'm actually thrilled to get him,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.960]   because Gina Trapenny had to cancel at the last minute,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.080]   takes some time off.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.400]   But with us right now, Kevin Marks filling in for her.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.960]   And it's actually a big deal, because he is, as you know,
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.040]   an employee of Salesforce.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.400]   And he's at their big--
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.360]   and I mean big-- conference Dreamforce going on in San Francisco
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:08.880]   right now.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.000]   Thank you for joining us, Kevin.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.440]   Thanks for inviting me.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.800]   Yes, this is huge.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.720]   There are, I think, 86,000 people registered at Dreamforce.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.400]   Wow.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.040]   Taken over all of Moscone and Moscone,
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.280]   and the streets in between in a bunch of hotels.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.040]   It feels like, you know, South by South,
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.360]   we're walking around between venues.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.520]   It's pretty huge.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.600]   The South by South, West of CRM, which is not quite as
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.080]   hypocrite.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.040]   So what-- you know, I should probably ask,
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.400]   what does Salesforce do?
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   We do business automation software.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.840]   Originally, it was CRM customer agent management.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.520]   And we've broadened that out into helping businesses
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.000]   contact their customers, the customers
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.600]   come to their businesses, and running
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.800]   a lot of business process staff.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.960]   So some of the staff launched here was HR automation as well,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.560]   with the stuff we bought from Ripple,
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.400]   that's now at work.com.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.680]   We launched Salesforce Identity, which
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.360]   is a single sign-on with Salesforce
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.480]   in multiple applications.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.560]   And we launched Salesforce Touch, which is HTML 5-based mobile
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.400]   app development for sales.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.120]   So we're plugging lots of other bits and pieces in.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.560]   Basically, the point of all this-- and Mark's
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.440]   spent two and a half hours explaining a lot of this
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.920]   this morning-- is to let the businesses get in contact
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.560]   with their customers and get in contact with each other
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.320]   members of the business, wherever they happen to be,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.840]   through the web, hosted--
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.560]   their information has still asked,
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.560]   and it was accessible from anywhere, with APIs,
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.680]   and with open HTML 5 apps that plug into that as well.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.000]   So there's a lot of bits to this.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.480]   It's appropriate for the show, because it is--
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.000]   Talk Cloud.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.480]   It's all Cloud.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.640]   It's all Cloud.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.480]   The great evangelist with the Cloud.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.040]   You know, Cloud is Cloud for a long ago,
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.840]   with the cloudiest company of all.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.040]   The cloudiest company of them all.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.680]   And Mark Benioff, you mentioned Mark.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.480]   Mark Benioff, the CEO and founder of Salesforce,
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.280]   considered quite a visionary in--
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.840]   and one hell of a salesman, too.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.240]   And yeah, and really a character, I guess.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.880]   Yeah, I haven't met him.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.640]   But we should get him.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.760]   I'd love if you could help us get him sometime
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.920]   on one of our shows, maybe, trying to--
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.320]   Oh, he'd be so fascinating.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.360]   I interviewed him once for a charity event.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.960]   I was the last minute.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.120]   Luckily, the audience didn't know.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.200]   It was supposed to be Jimmy Kimmel,
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.920]   Jimmy Kimmel, interviewing him.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.800]   And they got me.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.960]   But he's a fascinating character.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.200]   And plus, he does a lot of charitable stuff.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.440]   Jeff Chiron comes right before Kimmel.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.000]   And he's actually perfect.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.520]   So, well, and just so if you're just tuning in,
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.760]   Kevin is in the lobby at Moscone Center, where he's on Wi-Fi.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.200]   And so the sound and the video may not be perfect.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.920]   But you know, Kevin likes to live dangerously
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.120]   and do the show from the outside world.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.680]   So I think he's made up today of about four pixels, I think.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.000]   But we know what he looks like.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.120]   So it's OK.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.400]   Squint when you look at it.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.360]   Well, I could try being--
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.400]   I could try and--
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.600]   4G instead, but that made--
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.040]   No, no, no, no, let's stay there.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.800]   Let's stay there.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.720]   Hey, though, I have to say something about 4G.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.360]   The iPhone 5 was announced this past week.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.120]   It's coming out on Friday.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.520]   And it is an LTE phone.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.600]   And it's been really interesting to--
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.960]   Verizon has LTE here.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.320]   I'm sure you have the choice of AT&T and Verizon in New York.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.120]   San Francisco has both, too.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.520]   It is so fast right now.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.400]   And I'm told it used to be faster.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.960]   But I got 23 megabits down.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.560]   And something like 18 megabits up.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.000]   Now, how much will that degrade with--
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.120]   On my Razer Max HD.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.680]   Well, and that's the question is, what's
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.720]   going to happen when--
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.720]   I think the last count we're saying,
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.320]   4 million new iPhone users suddenly
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.400]   swamp the network.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.800]   It's going to be very interesting.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.960]   They're not all on the Verizon or AT&T, but say a million.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.320]   Well, that's a good point, though.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.640]   When the phone came out, everybody swamped one network.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.560]   So that's our memory.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.080]   Now they've--
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.360]   So now they'll be swabbing three.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.600]   Should be much nicer.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.960]   Much better for all.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.320]   Wouldn't they?
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.200]   Because they're selling a lot more phones.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.240]   Right.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.200]   They sold twice as many phones as past weekend,
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.080]   on launch weekend, as they did with the iPhone 4S,
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.720]   twice as many phones.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.720]   One of your staffers was telling me earlier about a Jimmy
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.040]   Kimmel routine.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.800]   I didn't see it.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.280]   I forget what it was.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.480]   Speaking of the Kimmel.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.360]   Went out and showed people--
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.280]   Oh, he was showing him an iPhone 4S.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.280]   But the most of all--
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.200]   But the thing is the iPhone--
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.040]   And they were fine.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.800]   They said, oh, well, here I'll show it.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.000]   I suppose we'll get--
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.360]   we could play a little bit of it here.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.720]   First look at the iPhone 5 from the Jimmy Kimmel show.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.200]   Are you getting audio from me?
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.000]   Am I muted?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.080]   I believe your YouTube app is--
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.040]   It does bastards.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.400]   It's almost as if the new iPhone somehow
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.760]   ruins the old iPhone.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.480]   But it doesn't.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.800]   It's all in your head.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.560]   In fact, we set a camera out on the street today.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.480]   It's all in your head.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.000]   It's all in your head.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.840]   It's all in your head.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.760]   Apple's line is-- it just works.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.280]   Which is unavailable.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.000]   Jimmy's line is--
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.440]   It's all in your head.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.440]   Say that to a fanboy and see what happens.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.080]   It's your iPhone 4S that everyone has.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.880]   And well, here's how that experiment played out.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.040]   First look, iPhone 5.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.920]   Do iPhone 5 just came out today?
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.400]   We wanted to--
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.160]   More important.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.600]   We got the quality.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.320]   We got the quality.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.880]   We got the quality.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.640]   We now have the first clovers.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.760]   Thank you, Matt.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.960]   So they do have decaf clover.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.480]   Cheers.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.960]   Cheers.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.120]   Matt, did you make it in 90 seconds?
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.120]   I tried.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.680]   It was painful.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.360]   He ran the whole-- come here, Matt.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.720]   He ran the whole way.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720]   Yeah, I guess I'm going to try it.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.960]   By the way, this is the only guy who dresses to work here.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.760]   What's your last name?
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.240]   Kinkle.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.280]   Matt Kinkle.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:42.840]   I don't even know.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.280]   He's our intern.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.600]   And he's done a great job.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.120]   But thank you.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.360]   This is a Malawi single bean.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.960]   Did the--
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.800]   Oh, Leo, Matt.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.960]   --to the Reese to say anything?
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.040]   Do you say anything about it?
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.160]   Anything I should know about this before I try it?
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.960]   It's very hot, though.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.760]   Nothing notable.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.560]   They say that.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.480]   They say you should wait-- Kevin, drink.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.200]   They say you should wait 90 seconds before you try it.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.600]   Well, Leo, you old Matt.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.120]   Oh, that's good.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.880]   Oh, I think we spilled a little on your green tie.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.160]   Thanks, Matt.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.520]   You know what?
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.160]   That's actually quite good.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.840]   That is pretty good.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:16.940]   Yeah.
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:17.120]   All right.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.000]   All right.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.720]   You could drink it without cream and sugar.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.240]   You want some?
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:21.920]   Shall we get yours?
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.400]   No, no, no.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:22.760]   I'm fine.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:22.960]   No, no.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.680]   I'm a real man.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.120]   All right.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.280]   Anyway, we don't need to run the rest of the Jimmy Kim.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.640]   You know, you get the idea.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.560]   People were astounded by the iPhone 4S.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.200]   And we're in an Android world.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.600]   We're kind of in a similar boat here,
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.800]   because this is the new Kindle HD, the 7-inch Kindle HD,
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.280]   which I just got the other day.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.640]   And if you put it next to, say, an Nexus 7,
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.760]   or even the original Kindle Fire,
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.640]   it's kind of hard to tell the difference between one
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.800]   and the other.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.360]   I know you're big Nexus 7.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.280]   I'm now a huge Nexus 7 fan.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.520]   You know, here's the deal.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.400]   They're the same price.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.360]   So you'd be crazy not to get an Nexus 7.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.960]   It's running jelly bean, pure jelly bean, instead of--
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.000]   It has all the Google Apps.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.160]   --has the Google Apps.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.440]   You'd be crazy not to get this.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.440]   And I use Kindle like crazy on my Nexus 7.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.080]   And it works beautifully.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.640]   And they're making a big deal about the Dolby dual speaker.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.560]   I hear I'll play you some audio.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.400]   In fact, I've got my--
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.320]   this is my book on tape running.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.720]   The heavy losses in Bummer Command--
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.080]   I mean, it's been on voice.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.600]   I guess I'll play a movie, and you can see.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.040]   It's not super amazingly brilliant sound.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.120]   Here's Iron Man 2.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.600]   We'll play that.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:42.600]   This is, by the way, if you're an Amazon Prime,
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.680]   this is a free from the Amazon streaming.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.360]   Oh, and this is the other thing they were telling,
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:48.880]   which I'm trying to--
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.840]   --hear a ton of everybody on the airplane.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.520]   I kind of like is the X-ray feature.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.960]   So as you're watching the movie, if it's not irritating enough
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.520]   that you get all the controls there,
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.720]   as you're watching the movie, you can press the X-ray feature
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.840]   and learn more about Mickey Rourke.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.320]   I want to know what's wrong with this.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.200]   I want to know what's wrong with his fingernails.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.080]   That's what I want.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.960]   So it's a little dark.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.240]   You can kind of--
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.600]   let me zip it ahead a little bit here.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.920]   But you hear the sound.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.880]   It's not going to--
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.640]   How does-- this is a silly question, but--
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.480]   --over 10 years, curating that--
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.400]   --text right up my name to that.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.640]   But it's enough to watch it.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.480]   Yeah, it's fine.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.280]   Now, I don't think it's much better than the 7.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.200]   There's episodes of "Downton Abbey" on this thing.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.600]   Yeah, and if you're listening to headphones,
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.320]   which you should be doing, it will undoubtedly sound.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.640]   I was an extra guy on the plane who
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.040]   was using a small tablet a few weeks ago.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.720]   And he was playing the game full volume up
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.640]   with no headphones.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.360]   That's annoying.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.000]   Not allowed.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.440]   Sorry.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.400]   So show me a book.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.480]   You want to see a book?
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.600]   Yeah, because the Kindle on this looks good.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.200]   I would say this is--
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:48.720]   Oh, oh.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.280]   So it's no better.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.520]   But do you have whisper sync on there?
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.320]   Do you have that new audio/video whisper sync feature?
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.680]   That's-- and I have to show you this.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.040]   This is kind of a nice feature.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.720]   So I'm reading an Agatha Christie novel.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.480]   The mysterious-- by the way, in order to promote this,
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.240]   Amazon is giving away 20 public domain books,
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.200]   including David Copperfield and this.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.640]   This is an Agatha Christie.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.440]   The mysterious of failure styles.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:11.920]   But watch.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.960]   This is kind of cool.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.160]   By the way, when you get the Kindle book for free,
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.880]   you go to Audible.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.080]   You get the Audible book for free.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.640]   So it's 20 Audible books.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.680]   Classics, Ethan Fromm, Huckleberry Finn, stuff like that.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.080]   Which should be the way it works anyway.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.580]   Yeah.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.760]   These are public domain.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.320]   But they're using good readers.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.680]   And here's the audio.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.520]   I don't know if you're going to be able to hear this.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.080]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.160]   Has now somewhat--
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:37.720]   That's--
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.720]   What it does is it's highlighting--
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.560]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.240]   The text--
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.240]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.880]   I have been asked both by my friend--
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.600]   Now this isn't the--
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.920]   That's an important deal.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.160]   That's an important deal for students.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.920]   I'm on the board of Learning Ally,
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.640]   the former recording for the Blind and Dyslexic.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.520]   And they spend a lot of money--
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.280]   This is phenomenal.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.000]   --to arrange just that.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.120]   This is phenomenal.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.360]   That's a big deal.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.160]   It highlights it.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.920]   It also does whisper sync between audio and text.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.920]   So you can listen in the car, then get home
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.160]   and start reading on the Kindle.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:05.640]   That's cool.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.680]   And you'll jump to where you were on the Kindle.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.440]   You can listen on a variety of devices.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.480]   And OK, so here's the pros on this device.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.320]   It's easy.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.720]   So I think somebody who's focused on content consumption
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.840]   in the Amazon world is going to be thrilled
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.560]   because you don't even have to log into your Amazon account.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.120]   When you get it, it's already associated to your account.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.720]   It's got big icons.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.600]   I watched my daughter trying to help my mother
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.760]   in law with a new iPad.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.200]   Perfect for that.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.480]   Perfect for that.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.600]   It's great for consuming Amazon content.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.600]   Of course, it has the store.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.520]   And Amazon's very much in your face on this.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.440]   So I mean, that might be a negative.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.200]   But if you're an Amazon lover and you're
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.000]   getting a lot of content from Amazon, it's great.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.520]   It's decently fast, but it's not as fast as an Nexus 7
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.800]   or even--
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.120]   or an iPad.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.840]   So the real issue is this was a great choice at $200.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.160]   When nothing was $200.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.560]   Yes.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.240]   But now you can get the Nexus 7.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.920]   Which is just really amazing.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.840]   And I think for anybody who listens to this show certainly,
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.600]   the Nexus 7's a no-brainer.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.040]   But for somebody who is not a geek,
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.800]   who just wants to consume content,
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.960]   I actually think this is not a horrid choice.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.960]   Yeah, it's got a big--
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.000]   You know, the irony is that the Nexus 7 really
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   should have cellular service in it.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.320]   Right.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:24.840]   Well, it will.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.280]   I'm sure--
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.520]   Well, as you showed when you open it up.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.240]   So it doesn't make much sense without it,
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.600]   whereas that's fine without it.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.100]   Right.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.080]   Because it doesn't have all those other ones.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.640]   It doesn't have that.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.600]   And by the way, the next version, the 8.9 inch,
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.760]   will have a $50 a year version of 3G.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.520]   But it'll only be 250 megabytes a month.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.600]   Buy the Nexus 7 unless you're somebody who just
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.400]   is going to consume.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.680]   Buy the Nexus 7 for yourself and buy that for your grandma.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.600]   Yeah, this is for grandma.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.440]   Kevin Marks is-- I've been vamping because Kevin--
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.840]   we dropped out Kevin Marks.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.160]   He was so jealous he had to run to these Starbucks.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.680]   We used to have one of those machines at Google
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.440]   when I was there.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.400]   Of course you would, yes.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.560]   And you're putting 45.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.920]   And it makes very nice coffee.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.440]   It does.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.720]   I mean, it's brewed coffee.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.760]   It's not espresso.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.680]   I'm kind of a fan of the espresso drink.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.080]   So let's talk-- gosh, there's so much to talk about.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.920]   And we just mentioned Twitter briefly.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.840]   Because what the hell?
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.880]   First, they close off the app ecosystem.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.680]   They basically say to developers, thanks, move along here.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.520]   We'll take care of the third party stuff.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.960]   Then now they just remove third party image services
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.120]   from their app.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:47.560]   So if you're TwitPik or Wi-Frog or TwitVid, bye-bye.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.520]   See you later.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.240]   Now the newest thing that they've done
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.400]   is they've replaced the app on iOS.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.960]   What was at least a decent app when they bought it from Tweety
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.080]   with a piece of crap?
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.960]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.040]   Everybody is just very upset.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   There's no links.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.400]   You can't click links in it.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.760]   The only way to see the content of a tweet
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.320]   is to open the tweet individually.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.200]   And then you can see more.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.560]   It wastes space.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.480]   I don't have an iOS device here, so I can't show you.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.160]   But it's really-- we'll go ahead.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.160]   Have you updated Twitter?
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.520]   No, we can update it while we're talking.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.040]   I've got one.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.080]   Yeah, what do you think, Kevin?
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.200]   Have you played with it?
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:26.880]   Are you--
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.320]   Yeah, it was a little-- I mean, what it feels like is
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.960]   it feels like the Android app.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.520]   And the iPad app was better.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.360]   Right.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.360]   It had that multiple page thing where
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.000]   you could keep pulling things across.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:38.640]   And that would work.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.160]   That's all gone.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:45.280]   Now it now behaves much more like the Android app.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.200]   Oh, here comes the iPad.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   Here comes the iPad.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.000]   So yeah, it does look like the--
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.280]   in fact, it's exactly like the Android version of the app.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160]   Except they-- we'll close it.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:57.680]   Hang on.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.520]   Except that they open tweets in line now.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.440]   So if you click it, it'll expand in line.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.880]   And if there's one that has a--
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.840]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.640]   So here's some links.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.480]   Great of you.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.680]   It's got a YouTube link in order to go to it.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.680]   Now once I open it, I've got the video here.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.400]   Which then that's the whole point of this.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.000]   They don't want you to go anywhere else.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.360]   They want you to watch everything on Twitter.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.040]   Right.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:23.560]   Right.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.040]   Yeah, so everything opens in line like that.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.520]   But I was talking to somebody at Twitter this week.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.400]   And they said, well, don't you want
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.960]   to have the kind of best experience?
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.640]   And that that's why Twitter is making all these dictates
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.880]   about what's right.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.120]   Except Twitter isn't necessarily giving
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.120]   us the best experience.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.640]   It's the best experience.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.200]   That's the problem.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.640]   Look at this when you go into this realm.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.120]   Look at all this wasted space here.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.560]   This is all stuff they could have--
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.000]   It occurred to me this week.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.800]   Twitter is like a brother in law
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.360]   that you can't quite figure out.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.000]   You like-- you love your sister.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.440]   You figure she's got to see something in them
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.120]   and you've had some fun at Thanksgiving.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.640]   But he keeps on doing weird stuff.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.080]   You know?
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.000]   Well, this isn't weird.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.120]   That's the problem is this is completely understandable
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.640]   if you think, well, what Twitter wants to do
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.520]   is close off the third-party ecosystem
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.680]   and make sure everybody consumes the ads that go along
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.520]   with Twitter.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.520]   The problem is what's sad about this
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.360]   is they've taken what was a great UI tweet-y.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:23.920]   Yes.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.080]   And they have basically taken all the goodness out of it
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.640]   and replaced it with a crappy UI.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.680]   And it feels to me like it's a cynical move.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.600]   The problem is they're not saying enough.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.320]   And I urged-- we'll see if this happens.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.760]   But I urged Twitter to bring Dick Costalo to our show.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.120]   Yes.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.120]   He's speaking of the--
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.600]   That's it on that, I guess.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.400]   Well, no.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.800]   They need to be able to say more.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.320]   He's going to speak at the online news association.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.600]   He could win us over.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:51.840]   He could explain this.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.240]   He really could.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:52.920]   He's a comedian.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.280]   He could work with humor.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.360]   But what I said was that they make an argument
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.320]   that you want this button on every tweet.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.320]   And then they stop there.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.240]   What they should do is go on and say, and here's why.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.800]   Here's the rationale behind it.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.400]   Or even if they say, we know you liked that.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.800]   But here's why we had to change it.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.280]   Here's how it affects our business.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.040]   I think they've got to communicate more.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.840]   And they communicated so little.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.440]   Now, in the early days, there was a lot of a turmoil and b.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.640]   They weren't sure what the hell I were.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.360]   But if they now have a vision, then I
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.320]   think that Dick and company have to communicate that to users
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:26.840]   and developers.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.160]   And then we might understand better.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.800]   We might get it.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.240]   And I understand they've got to be a business.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.080]   The same as a newspaper that says,
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.040]   we've got to cut back to three days a week so we can survive.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.760]   You don't like it, but you get it.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.400]   John Gruber writes they threw away Lauren Brichter.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.040]   He wrote to Tweety.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.320]   Groundbreaking UI replaced it with a timeline
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.280]   where you can't tap anything.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.640]   URLs use your names, hashtags, images.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.280]   Instead, you have to open the tweet first.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.520]   I can't remember the last time I saw a Twitter client in which
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.080]   you couldn't tap URLs from the timeline.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.920]   Josh Topolsky says, let me be perfectly clear.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.720]   The previous Twitter for iPad was one of the apps
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.480]   used to show off the iPad.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.480]   It was awesome, not anymore.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.640]   And so I, and I'm sure everybody else, in fact,
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.000]   oh, Malek asked maybe everybody at Twitter too.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.560]   Now we're using Tweetbot for as long as we can.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.080]   When is the moment going to come when they are going to cut off?
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.520]   Is that going to happen?
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.040]   It has to.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.720]   That's the next-- they're going to just shut off at some point.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.800]   That's going to be a nuclear winner.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.360]   But they're going to just say no more.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.560]   How far can you push the bottom line
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.080]   before you actually have the negative impact
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.160]   of losing users?
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.720]   I don't know.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.040]   And it happened too in the case where they had to hand over
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.880]   the tweets for the Occupy Wall Street.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.360]   And they fought hard not to do that.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.400]   They fought hard to say that it's our stuff.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.120]   They went the right way.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.320]   But the thing that finally pushed them over
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.000]   was when the court demanded their financial statements
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.880]   and threatened to find.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.920]   So I get the economics of it, but it's still economics.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.600]   Do the 140 million users of whom all but 2 million
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.760]   are completely normal people even know
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.080]   this is happening or care?
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.480]   No.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.400]   400 million daily tweets.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.280]   That means a few hundred thousand of us are complaining.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:13.840]   Yes.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.240]   And the rest are going.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.600]   But I think that doesn't-- you know,
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.520]   doesn't that have some impact potentially on Twitter?
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.840]   And things like trying to draw great staff.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.880]   If you started selling out and advertising crap,
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.720]   that's a good point.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.360]   Start looking.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.280]   What do you think of that, Kevin?
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.480]   I mean, you're a programmer.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.800]   You know technology.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.000]   You know tech people.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.200]   I do think it's a shame.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:43.240]   I mean, I was at the EXO conference up in Portland this weekend.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.640]   And some of the original Twitter guys were there.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.240]   And the blame was there.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.160]   And Rabble was there.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.600]   And they were looking sad about this as well.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.320]   And looking at what can we do to build an open version of this?
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.760]   And is that something we can actually achieve?
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.360]   There was definitely a lot of that sort in the air there.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.680]   And I think that's-- yeah, I think the thing about what you said
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.360]   was significant.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.360]   I think-- remember, they went on the--
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.720]   they take the longest version.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.720]   So they are pushing this out for a mainstream audience
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.640]   who are barely not tweeting much.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.320]   My worry is, the things that we find annoying about this,
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.520]   are the same things that these celebrities, that all these people
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.640]   are signing up to Twitter to join in with,
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.680]   to listen to, will find annoying.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.200]   And they may-- and if they're not careful,
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.800]   they're going to end up--
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.600]   it will stop being the place where
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.560]   the famous people will banter with each other as well.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.000]   And they're saying--
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.280]   Not just famous people, Kevin, but also brands.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.080]   If a brand wants to promote something,
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.280]   a media brand wants to promote something,
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.520]   they want that link to cause traffic to go to their site.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.800]   If that starts dropping, they're going to not see Twitter
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.360]   as a good way to promote themselves.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.760]   Right, but that's true.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.960]   I mean, I was thinking more about--
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.280]   a lot of what makes Twitter Twitter
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.720]   is that the conversation, the banter, the fact
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.880]   that you can have a random conversation with anyone,
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.120]   including famous people, when they say they will sometimes
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.840]   retweet you or whatever.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.960]   And that is the draw of it.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.680]   But there are things they've done that made that hard.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.920]   Some of the stuff they've done is supposed
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.040]   to make that better.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:26.280]   But what I find is that the sort of back and forth stuff
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.680]   that used to be easy is not as easy with this.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.160]   Now, I'm still using custom clients,
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.760]   and when I'm using those, things are fine.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.040]   But definitely, I'll be using this one a lot later.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.120]   But this is something I'd use some other time.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.240]   Normally, I'm using Echo Phone on the Mac,
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.520]   or I use the Twitter client on the Android.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.560]   But I've got my own hacked thing that turns tweets
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.800]   into notifications on Android so that it end up
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.080]   looking like that, even if you see that.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.640]   That's interesting.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.120]   That becomes your Twitter timeline,
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.360]   is your notifications.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.320]   Yes.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.000]   So it's not all every notification-- every tweet
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.480]   that I get notifications is somewhat filtered.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.360]   I want filters on it.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.560]   The ones you want.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.320]   Where did you write that yourself?
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.120]   I thought there's an open source
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.680]   that I think was nano-tweeter that was written three years ago.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.400]   And I thought to a little bit so that it did the newer updates.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.760]   That's its open source.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.840]   This is why, by the way, everyone should learn to code.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.320]   But I need to clean it up and actually
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.520]   hand it out properly.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.240]   I swear, if you're in high school or college
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.240]   and you're not learning how to write code, basic code,
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.120]   you're not literate.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:35.560]   What was it?
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.560]   Was it Estonia, I think, that decreed
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.200]   that all elementary school children were now learned to code?
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.760]   I hope so.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:47.560]   That was the theme of the MIT Introduction to Programming
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.120]   book, which is now available online, by the way.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.800]   And I'll give you the URL in a second.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.080]   I think it's sicp.org.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.200]   They say in the intro, this is a course for everybody,
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.160]   not for computer scientists, because basic literacy
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.360]   requires understanding how this stuff works.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.040]   I don't know if that's-- I think that's--
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.200]   unfortunately, that's--
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.360]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.080]   It also is a way to think.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.920]   It's one of the former heads of research
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.680]   that at Google and in the event I went to in New York,
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.560]   is you want to think algorithmically.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.000]   You don't necessarily just want to code.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.520]   You want to think in that kind of logic.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.000]   Exactly.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.840]   Or at least understand that.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.840]   And it wouldn't be that--
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.560]   compared to the cost of going to the moon,
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.320]   how many moon shots would we enable?
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.920]   How much innovation would we enable
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.920]   if we trained every school child to code?
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.800]   Is that-- and that's Kevin?
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.240]   I mean--
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.120]   No, it makes sense to teach people to do it.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.360]   I mean, I'm telling you in the chat
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.920]   just pointing to Khan Academy either/CS.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.160]   There's lots of places to learn.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:44.960]   There's Udacity.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.520]   There's Coursera, which is just at 33 new universities.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.560]   I mean, there's lots of places.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.720]   I just wrote a post.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.400]   I just once good, because it's--
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.440]   that's where people are already learning maths and physics.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.800]   And they've built a very nice interactive editor there.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.360]   I don't know if you played with that.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.200]   They've got a--
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.040]   Khan Academy, really.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:01.600]   A very nice--
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.200]   Coda Academy.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:02.720]   Coda Academy.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.600]   Coda Academy.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.400]   No, Khan Academy.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.160]   Not Khan, Coda Academy.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:06.920]   No, no, Khan.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.360]   Khan Academy?
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.240]   They haven't ever--
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:09.600]   Really?
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.480]   You see it?
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:10.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.960]   Have a play with it.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.560]   He showed it off at Disrupt last week.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.400]   For last week.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.080]   But he launched it before then.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:18.400]   Oops.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.320]   And we'll launch that, bro.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.120]   Wow, that's neat.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.160]   Good for him.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.080]   So Khan is-- we've got to get him on one of our shows here.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.920]   So they have a code thing now, too.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.640]   Wow.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.280]   I just wrote a post for the Neiman Lab, which
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.840]   is a really, really good site that covers
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.480]   my wonky world of journalism, and trying to outline what I
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.600]   think is the future of training journalists.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.160]   And we've learned that the classroom is a rotten place
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.040]   to teach technology.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:44.960]   Tools.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.760]   I agree.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:45.800]   Right?
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.760]   Because everybody's--
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:46.760]   It's--
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.240]   --in different spots, they're an ambition.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.320]   A lot you don't teach programming by lecture.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:50.840]   No.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.160]   No.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.440]   So what we need to do is A, research the outcomes that
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.640]   are needed to know what to do in your career,
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.640]   and then B, curate the stuff that's already out there,
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.600]   like Khan Academy and all this great stuff on YouTube.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.960]   And another story I think in here is that YouTube
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.480]   is doing a grant of money to the best YouTube educators.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.200]   So it's going to get better and better and better.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.280]   Then universities and schools can still add value.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.560]   We add tutoring and certification and context.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:15.200]   Absolutely.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.840]   Not so valuable.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.320]   But the basics of how to learn how to--
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.520]   this tool, you learn online.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.040]   I love Robert getting back to our Twitter story.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.640]   And then we'll get-- actually, I want
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.960]   to cover this code thing, too.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.040]   But Robert X. Cringley writing in "Infal World"
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.320]   says, you know that Bluebird Twitter uses his mascot?
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.440]   Turns out it's really a stool pigeon.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:44.520]   We reported last week that a judge had ordered Twitter,
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.120]   Judge Matthew Shearino Jr., had ordered Twitter
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:52.360]   to hand over private information about Malcolm Harris.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.280]   He's the Occupy Wall Street protester.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.320]   And in fact, said, if you don't do it,
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.200]   you're going to have to give me your private financial
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.720]   statements, Twitter, so that I can come up
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.680]   with a large enough fine to sting you.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.800]   So now it's not merely his public tweets,
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.360]   which I understand-- the judge says, look,
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.800]   you shout it out an open window.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.600]   It's public now.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.600]   Now some are still arguing that that only
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.800]   depends if someone was listening,
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.200]   and the whole world wasn't listening.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.280]   But I agree with the judge on that to that extent.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.280]   And by the way, it's a $250 fine that Harris is facing.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:32.240]   They demanded more than three months' worth of Harris's tweets.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.240]   Which Harris said is the legal equivalent
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.240]   of busting a party with loud noise
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.240]   and demanding my phone records for three and a half months
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.240]   to see if I helped plan it.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.240]   Yep.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.240]   Not a bad point.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.240]   Yep.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.240]   I don't know if they're asking for more than just that.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.240]   It sounds like they're not.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.240]   Both are standing up on a matter of principle
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.240]   and precedent here, which is vital.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.240]   And again, Twitter the irony.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.240]   Twitter came to brother-in-law.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.240]   So Twitter at one point,
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.240]   and then Mac fought for what was right here for a long time
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.240]   and argued that this is our stuff.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.240]   Yet at the same time, now you have a company
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.240]   that just announced today,
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.240]   Nip, or Nip, I don't know if you pronounce it,
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.240]   Gee Nip.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.240]   And they have the fire hose.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.240]   Yeah, the fire hose.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.240]   And now they're going to offer the entire history of tweets.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.240]   Well, going back to 2006.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   Yes.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.240]   Now, wouldn't it be nice if we didn't know
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.240]   that Twitter had that stuff, because we can only go back
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.240]   a few thousand tweets.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   We'll go back to the principle that Twitter argued in this case,
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.240]   is it the tweets are owned by the user?
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.240]   I have them, please.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   No.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.240]   And Gee Nip doesn't give that for free, by the way.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.240]   Oh, oh, oh, no.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.240]   You have to pay for that access.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.240]   Oh, no.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.240]   Full historical--
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.240]   I mean, when Gina comes back next week,
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.240]   I'm going to ask her about this,
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:45.240]   because this is something of great use to her and think up.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.240]   Full historical access to the Twitter fire hose
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.240]   available exclusively from Gee Nip.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.240]   This is the one and only to my knowledge company
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   that Twitter did license the fire hose to from day one.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.240]   Of course, they don't say what the price is.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.240]   You have to kind of a sales person contact.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.240]   A salesman will call.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.240]   You know, Kellen did the first year.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.240]   Have you seen that?
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.240]   No.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:13.240]   Yeah, old Kellen.io/old tweets.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   And you can search for yourself and see what you said
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.240]   in your original tweets.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.240]   So did they buy it?
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.240]   Kellen crawled it.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.240]   Oh, he--
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.240]   Okay.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:27.240]   He sniped every ID number to try to get it.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.240]   ID number to try and find the right ones that actually had tweets on.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.240]   So if I--
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:35.240]   If I steal Leo Laport, this will show every tweet I've ever done?
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.240]   No, this only starts in 2006, 2007.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.240]   It's the first year of Twitter.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.240]   So this is 2007.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.240]   So, intro-- these are actually people speaking to me.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.240]   Huh?
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.240]   Right, okay.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.240]   Just read all the Twitter's for Leo Laport and I Justine,
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.240]   not sure why I did it.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.240]   My head hurts and I have to poo.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.240]   This thing will go nowhere.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.240]   This is my February 2007.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.240]   Wow.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.240]   Right.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   Huh?
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.240]   So I thought you had never thought there was a way to see all of your own,
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.240]   but maybe not.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.240]   Stocking Leo Laport.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.240]   So these are people talking about me.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:17.240]   I wonder if maybe because I didn't tweet much, Jimmy Wales says something to me.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.240]   Look at the-- I even knew Jimmy Wales in those days.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.240]   He was actually talking to me.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.240]   Hey, he's still in to me as well.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.240]   Oh, that's it.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   If you didn't-- no.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.240]   I thought there was a way to click on a user and get the--
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.240]   Maybe do I have to put @ Leo Laport?
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.240]   No, but then that would just get the @.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   No, it doesn't.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.240]   He has a syntax here somewhere, so-- but that's very interesting.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.240]   So he's been crawling it all this time.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   Well, so he just wrote a bot that would go-- basically he was doing it by using it by ID, status ID.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   Oh, here it is.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:52.240]   So he started with one that went up and wrote some code to work out where they actually were.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.240]   So user ID colon dollar sign screen name.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.240]   See if I knew how to-- oh, you don't need the dollar sign.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.240]   There we go.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.240]   And then--
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.240]   I'll then-- there you go.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   Then you go older than you.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   No, no, no, no.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.240]   Maybe I do need a dollar sign.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.240]   Nope.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.240]   Yeah, this is right.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.240]   He's already calling Kevin Marks.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.240]   I just did that.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.240]   It did work, huh?
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.240]   Were you on then or was it one of the times you quit?
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.240]   I probably was one of the times.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.240]   I don't know how far back it goes.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.240]   There's Kevin Marks.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.240]   It goes--
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.240]   His first tweet, ladies and gentlemen, Kevin Marks, December 11th, 2006.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.240]   Sneezing and heading for bed.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.240]   Kevin wouldn't check my head yesterday because he had the egg you again.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.240]   Oh, my God.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.240]   I ought to do something here, Kevin.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.240]   Wow, this is-- so that's-- but this is-- that's not a illicit, right?
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.240]   He's been scraping him and saved him as on database.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.240]   The judge should have just used that.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.240]   Whoa, this-- this is 2006, 2006, 2007.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.240]   Ah, it's all-- okay, so he must not be the time period when I was tweeting.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.240]   It was interesting, actually, when he first put this up, a bunch of people were saying,
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.240]   "Hey, first put this up, a bunch of people went through and found the first out replies
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.240]   and the first hashtags and all that stuff."
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.240]   It's quite fun for that.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.240]   Wow, that's very cool.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.240]   It is cool.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.240]   I wonder if he can find the Donald Trump tweets.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:08.240]   Apparently-- what's the headline that you wrote?
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.240]   I love this.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.240]   It's "Twitter's become a haven for celebrities."
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:17.240]   It's a medium for moles of un-filtered to make fools of themselves.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:22.240]   So Donald Trump goes after poor Kate Middleton and basically just says, "It's your fault,
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.240]   honey."
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.240]   She shouldn't have taken her top off.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.240]   But she didn't know there were paparazzi with long lenses.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.240]   No, long lenses.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.240]   Twitter's been amusing this week.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:38.240]   Together we were joking before the show about the amazing Jesus wife hashtag that's there
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.240]   because a fragment of a document was found that makes reference to Jesus's wife.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.240]   My favorite moment of this week was seeing the Muslim rage hashtag.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:52.240]   Newsweek had a rather outrageous cover arguing that there was Muslim rage, which was slamming
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.240]   billions of people as if they all thought the same.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   And then they asked, "Hey, come and talk about our cover.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.240]   Hashtag Muslim rage."
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.240]   Oh, please.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:05.240]   Beautiful part was that people took it over, especially Muslims.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.240]   Good.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:10.240]   And so, for example, women saying, "I'm having a great hair day and no one can see it."
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.240]   Muslim rage.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.240]   [laughter]
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.240]   And the humanity of it was just magnificent.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:20.240]   So to have that and Jesus wife in the same week showing humor around religion is kind
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.240]   of a wonderful thing.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.240]   That's the great thing about the hashtag, which by the way, Twitter didn't invent.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.240]   The shawarma guy wraps my sandwich too tightly so I have to rip off little pieces of paper
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.240]   bit by bit Muslim rage.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.240]   Wow.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.240]   This is great.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:42.240]   So there's a weird threat-level blog has a compilation of comedy ensues as Twitter users hijack
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.840]   Newsweek's Muslim rage hashtag.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.240]   This is what Twitter was made for.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.240]   This is exactly what I think.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.240]   Yes.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.240]   This is a great use of it.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.240]   It's what I'm saying is banter.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.240]   It's like being collectively silly and it's wonderful.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.240]   But it's more than that.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.240]   And also it brought a humanity and that I think we desperately need now.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.240]   And it became a counterpoint to Newsweek.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:08.240]   I argued in Newsweek at one point that on Twitter at one point that Newsweek was acting like
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.240]   a troll.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.240]   It was doing exactly what trolls do, which I talked about.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.240]   You know, in terms of the video that was out there.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:19.240]   It was trying to incite a reaction and did it to do that and got the reaction.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:25.240]   Zane up to Becky who I quoted last week on the show, TechSock on Twitter said, "Now, Jarvis
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.240]   is a difference here.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.240]   She's very, very smart and catches me up and said a troll is someone you don't know.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.240]   A troll is some anonymous bozo.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.240]   Newsweek has a power.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.240]   So their behavior is trollish.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.240]   They have much more power than a troll.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.240]   What do you call it?
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.240]   Sensationalism?
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:45.240]   You were interviewing that chat from the Daily Beast yesterday whose name escaped me and he
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.240]   said, "Yeah, we do do that on purpose pretty much."
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.240]   It's called Linkbait in the blog world.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.240]   I don't know what you call it in a magazine cover, but it's the same.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.240]   Yellow journalism.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.240]   Yellow journalism.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.240]   Sensationalism.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.240]   And it's as old as newspaper as Mr. Hurst.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.240]   Yes.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.240]   That's right.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:07.240]   Who invented that and created a war.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.240]   Let's take a break.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.240]   I'm sure we have to.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.240]   Yes.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.240]   Whew.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.240]   Whew.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.240]   We need to calm down and drink some more of this clover coffee.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.240]   I'm already buzzing on the Alawi stuff.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.240]   It's good.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.240]   It's good.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   It's very good.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.240]   And you know, it doesn't.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.240]   And this is apparently another selling point of this.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.240]   And by the way, they didn't buy ads.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   If they did, I would happily accept their money, but they haven't paid me a penny for this.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.240]   In fact, we paid them for this.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.240]   Yes.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:35.240]   But one of the selling points, supposedly, the machine, the clover machine that we got here
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:39.240]   in local Starbucks is that the coffee stays fresh longer.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.240]   It's so far, seems to me.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.240]   And so far, so good.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.240]   Drinking decaf.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.240]   I said, it's like flame my cardiologist.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.240]   Really?
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.240]   Because you know, I think everybody says coffee is good for you now.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.240]   It's the caffeine and it's the...
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.240]   You should have him to read more.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:57.240]   I'm more of those sensationalist trade press.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:02.240]   We're brought to you today by our friends at stamps.com.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:08.240]   Disintermediating the United States Postal Service one consumer at a time.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.240]   With the happy cooperation of the US Postal Service, they love stamps.com.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:16.240]   Why go to the post office when you could print postage yourself, right?
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.240]   This is legal.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.240]   I'm not talking counterfeiting.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:23.240]   I'm talking to you using your computer, your printer, no special ink, no postage meter,
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.240]   just stamps.com.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.240]   And it's not just the stamp, not just the postage, the mailing labels, everything you need.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.240]   You could print right onto an envelope.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.560]   It could take addresses out of QuickBooks, for instance, print your invoices, print the
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.240]   envelopes with the postage on them.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.240]   It looks more professional.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.800]   It works great.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.640]   If you're an Amazon or eBay seller, it'll take the data from there so you don't have to
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.800]   cut and paste or type your own mailing labels.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.240]   I know people actually keep IBM's Selectrix around so they can type on envelopes.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.240]   Yes.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.240]   You don't have to do that.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.520]   Stamps.com, they do the whole thing for you.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.400]   These modern printers today, they can do anything.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.000]   I want you to try stamps.com now.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.400]   We've got a special offer for you.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:08.440]   If you go to stamps.com, postage only a click away.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.120]   You see special offer $80 value.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.000]   You might be tempted to go, "Oh, yeah, I'll take it."
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   No, stop.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.320]   Up in the upper right hand corner, there's an old fashioned radio microphone.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:25.720]   Click that and use the offer code Twig, that $80 special deal, $110, $55 in free postage.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   You get the digital scale.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.720]   We love those.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.600]   In fact, we got two of them because we love them so much.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:35.600]   The $5 supply kit, the four-week trial, a no-risk trial offer for you and worth $110
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:42.640]   if you go to stamps.com and use the offer code TWIG for this week in Google Twig.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:48.600]   Really if you don't want to go to the post office, I don't know anybody who wants to go
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.520]   to the post office, this is a great solution for you.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:56.120]   Stamps.com for a small business like ours is the best.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.760]   We thank them for their support of this week in Google.
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:08.640]   Failure is a feature, says the Verge Google gobbles up startups to stay sharp.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.360]   It's almost a TLDR from the Verge.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:16.400]   It's very, very long, but it's actually a good piece on looking at their...
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.720]   What does I see TLDR?
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.720]   What does that mean?
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.720]   TLDR?
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.720]   It means too long to reach.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.720]   Long to reach.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.720]   [laughter]
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.720]   The only thing about it is the...
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.720]   I see that all the time.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:26.720]   I never knew it.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.720]   Proper punctuation is TL.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.720]   It's semicolon.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:30.720]   Semicolon, right.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.720]   DR.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.720]   Too long did semicolon didn't read.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.720]   When are you supposed to use that?
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.720]   Do you need a rubber to do any of their rubber to stand?
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:38.720]   I think when somebody...
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.720]   Reddit, I think it started.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.320]   I think it was on Reddit where people went and said, "You link to it and they come back
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.320]   and say, 'No, I'm not bothering you.'
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.720]   You tell me to read it, I'm not going to.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.320]   It's the new insutience.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.920]   But this is TL, but read.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.920]   TLBR.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.920]   TLBR.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:59.920]   This is the thesis because I saw lollipops and that's it.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:05.680]   Basically just recounting the various startups that Google has bought and saying, "Well..."
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.840]   And it started with their job.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.680]   The most recent acquisition of Snapseed, which I am very unhappy about.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.960]   Ah, do tell.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.280]   And I know Trey Rakcliffe wrote a little bit about it, but he's too diplomatic and he likes
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.920]   the Google folks too much to be honest.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.920]   So here's the problem.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:23.320]   Nick Software, which is the company they bought, is really a fantastic company that makes
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:29.560]   plugins for Lightroom, Photoshop, and Aperture that are used not only by pros everywhere,
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.720]   every time we interviewed a pro on Twitter, they said, "Oh, I love Silver FX or one of
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.720]   the other Nick plugins."
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:39.360]   But a lot of amateurs like me use it and it really isn't, it's very valuable.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:44.240]   It seems to me the case that they bought it not because of that, but because of their
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.400]   app Snapseed, which is an iOS app, which I imagine Google wants.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.120]   It's a very nice, easy to use photo feature.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.120]   And they do their Instagram and Instagram.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.120]   It's a consumer.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.000]   It's a consumer app.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:01.040]   And I think, and I would imagine they'll fold this into Picasa maybe even into other Google
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:07.480]   apps, and I'm really fear for the future of the Nick plugins, which are really, really
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.400]   great.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.240]   And I suspect that that has nothing to do with why Google acquired them.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:18.960]   So this, it may even be an acquire, one of those hires where you get these guys.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.600]   And that's one of the things that bugs me about these big companies.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.600]   Google does it all the time.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.600]   Google does it too.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:27.040]   They buy companies for the people and they shut down the products.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.040]   Dropio, which was a Sam lessons, fantastic.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.040]   Well, that was full.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.040]   That was full.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.040]   That was bought by Facebook.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.040]   And sale just entirely.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.440]   But Jaiq, Jaiq is the Google one.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.200]   Oh, and you know me.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.200]   I love Jaiq.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.040]   I thought Jaiq was so much better than Twitter.
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.160]   And obviously I was wrong.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.160]   There's a nice chart, Laura and the story.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.160]   Well, they don't know.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.480]   At the time they bought it, they had about the same number of users.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:54.440]   But they took all the engineers off it and got them working on mobile apps and brought
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.880]   Gary Timout in view to try and explain social to them, which--
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.880]   Didn't work.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.560]   And now Yuri's doing his own thing.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:05.160]   And they open source Jaiq, but I think it's too late now, right?
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.160]   It was too late.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.560]   And it was another iteration of Jaiq.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.560]   So they--
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.560]   You need critical mass.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.560]   Right.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.320]   They ported Jaiq to App Engine, which mostly Andy did that.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.040]   And then they opened the source there.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.240]   But I think they actually shut down the hosted version as well.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:25.640]   This is a great-- if it's too long, didn't read the Ben Cooper's article, at least there's
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.880]   a great infographic.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.880]   With a nice little--
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.880]   Yes.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:35.000]   So when Larry Page took over CEO, his first move is to restructure the company to seven
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.640]   groups, Search, YouTube, Chrome and Apps, Geocommers, Mobile, Social and Ads.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:47.280]   And they show how all the app acquisitions, going back to 2001, are funneled into those
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.720]   seven different groups where everything went.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.120]   I suppose Jaiq who's in here somewhere, there's so many.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.360]   Jaiq is bottom row, yeah.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.360]   Bottom row.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.360]   Jaiq who, there it is.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.360]   2007.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.800]   2007, went into social.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.080]   That's kind of depressing.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.080]   Frankly, I don't even like looking at it.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.920]   And I'm sure, but for people like Yuri, that's great.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:07.920]   They got a--
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.920]   Well, this is cash.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.920]   This is the new exit strategy.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.920]   This is the exit strategy.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.120]   And I think that that's bad for innovation.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:17.160]   I think that companies that are saying, let's build something so that Yahoo or Google will
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.160]   buy us.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.160]   Who's going to be the one who's in DeepPockets?
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.160]   2.4 billion.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.160]   Not going into Yahoo's pockets.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.160]   Not Snoll's, Molly Bava.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.160]   Snoll's going into their pockets.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.160]   Uh oh, what happened?
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:30.240]   Rissa changed and she was going to keep it as a war chest and then various investors
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.240]   went after her.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.240]   So she's returning most of that to the investors.
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.240]   Damn.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.240]   3.x billion.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.240]   I was really hoping to get a little bit of that.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.240]   She's keeping I think 400 million.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.240]   Is that all?
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.240]   Is that all?
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.240]   Is that enough?
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.240]   No.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.240]   I want more.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.040]   I thought if she had 2.4 billion she'd give me 10% at least.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.800]   Oh, that's too bad.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.800]   It is, isn't it?
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.440]   Speaking of Marissa Meyer, I was a little perturbed by the fact that everybody used the headline,
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.280]   Marissa Meyer buys iPhone 5s for employees.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.280]   She didn't.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.280]   She didn't.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.760]   The headline should be Marissa Meyer bought everything but Blackberries for employees.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:04.760]   She said you have a choice.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.320]   What does it know you did a headline which is Marissa Meyer buys whatever their model number
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.320]   is for all employees.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.920]   The Lumi and 920.
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.120]   That's a better headline.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.880]   It's, talk about sensationalism and link bait.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.880]   That's the link bait.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.360]   She didn't buy iPhone 5s for everybody.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:23.920]   She offered them iPhone 5s, Galaxy S3s, HTC One's, Lumi and 920s.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.600]   As you said, everything but the Blackberry they had been giving their employees.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.600]   Right.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.600]   Oh, well.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.600]   Got me on it.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   Got me on a little later.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:38.160]   So the acquisition thing, that was another thing of XOXO conference.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.960]   They had a bunch of people who built websites a long time ago to get up and talk.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:42.960]   Matt Howie.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.200]   I love Matt.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:48.840]   And Chris Paul of 4chan.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.840]   That was interesting.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:54.320]   But they were both saying we built this thing, we want to keep it running.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.920]   They also both said the amount of revenue we're getting from the advertising is going
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.400]   down rapidly because everyone's switching to mobile and then we don't get paid for ads
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.560]   on mobile.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.160]   So they had the Facebook problem before Facebook had it.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.160]   Right.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.240]   And Chris Paul said he's actually losing money on 4chan at the moment, which I suppose is
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.240]   not surprising.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.160]   Oh, that's sad.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.400]   Pretty much advertising from people on 4chan.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.400]   They were running adblock.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.720]   How did he ever make money?
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.800]   Yeah, Moot also said I'm not in it for the money.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.800]   This is a hobby.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   Exactly.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.040]   And he's making money from Canvas, which got venture funding for.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.280]   Canvas is an interesting, is it actually a very interesting product?
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.280]   Yes.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.280]   That's quite cute.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.320]   So it's imagery mix.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:38.480]   It's kind of like, what's the other one?
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   Mixle.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.480]   Mixle.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.480]   Right?
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.480]   Mixle.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.480]   It's like a very interesting product.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.480]   Yeah.

[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.480]   It's like a very interesting product.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.480]   Yeah.

[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.480]   It's like a very interesting product.

[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.480]   Yeah.

[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.480]   Yeah.

[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.480]   It's like a very interesting product.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.480]   It's like a very interesting product.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:16.700]   is an expert on standards on the web and a strong proponent of open standards.
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:19.780]   And the Apache Foundation made an interesting decision.
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:25.140]   So there is apparently a standard set for Do Not Track; this is a setting in the browser.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.040]   There are three choices in the browser.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.820]   It can be unset, which is, by the way, according to the standard, the default.
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:32.820]   Am I not right?
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.340]   It's supposed to be, something like a program.
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:39.320]   And then, you set it, then you're saying I wish to make sure that ad companies do not
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.520]   use tracking cookies on me.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.600]   And if you say, "Okay, go ahead, please do track."
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:49.680]   So you can have unset, Do Not Track or Do Track.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.080]   The default, according to the open standard, is unset.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.480]   Right, Kevin?
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.480]   Yes.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:00.480]   The Apache Foundation has decided to ignore the setting in the Internet Explorer 10, the
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:06.040]   next version of IE, because Microsoft, when you choose automatic settings, not when you
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:09.280]   customize it, but when you choose automatic settings, turns Do Not Track.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:14.720]   On, deciding for its users, probably correctly so, that if they only knew what tracking
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.520]   cookies were, they would block them.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:19.080]   I know, you hate it when I say that.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.320]   Just as Apple decided third-party cookies would be wrong on another source.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.640]   Only if you express it in a certain way.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.600]   If you want to starve your friends of Boing Boing, that's another matter.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.840]   Well, and this is related to that.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:30.840]   That's why I'm bringing up.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:36.200]   So the folks at Apache said, because there's a standard in the standard is unset, we are
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.240]   going to ignore the setting.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:43.400]   It needs to be explicitly set by users for us to pay attention to it.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:46.560]   Kevin, is that the right answer?
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.520]   It's kind of an arms race, and that's the problem.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:55.560]   The problem is, you know, part of this is Microsoft is doing this, partly as a way to
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:59.640]   poke at Google, I'm almost convinced, just to say, "Ah-hah, we can turn off ad tracking
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:04.040]   and that one that would hurt Google with the biggest browser," or "we were."
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.880]   And there's a bit of that going on there, almost certainly.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:13.080]   Google had, until this week, not track option in Chrome, although they say now it's going
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.080]   to be coming up in the year.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.560]   So they're going to add one, yeah.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.120]   Which is written in a reason.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.240]   It's a standard that it makes some sense, people don't know.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:24.480]   The challenge is explaining to the user what this is, and that's a problem.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.480]   And it's like the EU cookie directive.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.480]   There's now a directory that you have to explain that you're using cookies.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.320]   So every time you go to a British website, there's this little thing in the corner saying,
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.320]   "Hi, we're using cookies."
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.880]   Click here to have us explain cookies.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:40.880]   You're dismissed now, Jeeves, in sounds, yes.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:41.880]   Yes.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:48.120]   So I think, in my opinion, part of the issue is that the word tracking cookie is unnecessarily
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.120]   inflammatory.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.120]   Absolutely.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.120]   These are ad customization cookies.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:54.040]   And if you said to people, "I wish somebody would do a poll.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.640]   I wish Gallup would do a poll saying, 'How do you feel about ad customization?
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.560]   Would you prefer to have customized ads or not?'
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.560]   Yes or no.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.400]   And then say, 'How do you feel about tracking cookies?
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.480]   Would you prefer to have tracking cookies on or off?'
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.520]   It would be the exact opposite result.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.520]   Exactly.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.320]   Even though, technically, that's the same thing.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:13.000]   Part of what we have to do here is look at Microsoft's modus.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   Microsoft and...
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.320]   Newscorps, I would argue, have pretty much given up on the ad business.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.440]   And they're pulling the ladder up after them.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.080]   And they're trying to turn this into an advantage.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.040]   They've been bad at selling ads, right?
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.040]   Newscorps call me how to pay well.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:29.200]   Since we can't do it, let's screw everybody else.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.160]   And let's also make it seem as if this is a benefit we're giving you.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.000]   So you think Microsoft's pushing this notion that tracking cookies are bad?
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.880]   You know, go ask our chat room because I get an argument every time I say what I just said.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:46.480]   They say, 'No, there's spying on us!'
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.120]   What do you say, Kevin?
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:51.120]   'The voice of reason, ladies and gentlemen.'
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.480]   This thing, Jeff and I are kind of polar opposites.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.480]   Yes, yes.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.480]   Exactly.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.480]   No, no, no, exactly.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:57.480]   You could be reasonable if you try.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.480]   No, it's complicated.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.480]   I mean, that's the thing.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.680]   There's a whole bunch of this stuff that...
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:07.720]   The thing that's actually surprising to me is how big the web pages are.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.960]   My machine was slowing down with it.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:15.560]   I noticed that memory was full, so I killed the biggest processes, which happened to be
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:16.720]   Chrome browser processes.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.440]   And I had 250 megs of RAM used up for one tech crunch page.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.440]   Oh, please.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.080]   What is all that memory for?
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:27.160]   Because there's so much crust on there for all the different advertising and tracking bits
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:31.360]   and pieces and embedded other bits of sites and blah, blah, blah going on.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:36.120]   There is something very odd when the average web page is bigger than a bitmap or bits
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.120]   in memory.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.400]   That's just weird.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   I think that's right.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.720]   I think it was a discipline we all had to learn.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:43.880]   We made web pages early on.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:48.480]   I remember early in my days of running sites, the pages got bigger and bigger and bigger
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.440]   and the traffic went down and down and down.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:53.080]   And now with speed being what it is, you lose a discipline.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.080]   So I agree with that.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:58.720]   Isn't it like putting an ad blocker into a browser and turning it on by default?
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.720]   I mean, I think that's what it is.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:02.720]   You leave me like that.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:04.720]   Because the ads become worthless.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.760]   Well, okay.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.400]   There is an issue on that.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:14.600]   And I think this is also a dirty little secret is that ad customization doesn't work that
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:18.520]   look what happens on Facebook where they know everything about you and the ads are complete
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.520]   crap.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.080]   Well, that's because there's no, that's a sales problem.
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:25.600]   Well, but I think we make the case that, yeah, advertisers want tracking cookies, but
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.320]   not because it actually helps them.
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:28.320]   Well, no, but I really am.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:35.240]   It's just having, I'm dealing with one site I know that is local and the out of, it has
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.680]   a lot of out of market traffic.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.680]   Right.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.080]   So I asked them, I said, well, what's the different differential in value here?
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.080]   Huge, right?
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.080]   It's 25 times.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.080]   It's the same.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:47.720]   So on a clear channel, blocks international listeners, radio streams, they can't monetize
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.160]   them and they consume resources.
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.160]   So that's simple.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:55.400]   You start with, well, I said at Dreamforce yesterday that to help with big data, what
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.160]   media needs right now is small data.
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.920]   They need to start with the first knowledge about you.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.440]   Are you part of their audience or not?
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:03.880]   And that's tracking, right?
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.120]   That says, I've said a cookie that says, I know where you live so that I can give you
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.520]   local content and local advertising and benefit from it.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:13.400]   But is it legitimate also to have a concern that these tracking cookies are used in much
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.400]   more nefarious ways?
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.400]   Oh, over your mouth.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.000]   Let's see the transmitter.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.800]   No, I mean, what can, what, what nefarious, it's like the other man over here just said,
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.680]   they're aggregating data about my web use over many years.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.840]   And I don't know what the end is.
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:35.400]   Well, the tricky bit is that when you're using an ad network, the works are more than
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:38.720]   one site, then it's tracking your behavior across sites.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.720]   Right.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.920]   And that is the thing that makes people slightly nervous because you've been an iFrame that's
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:43.920]   got the ad in it.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:44.920]   Right.
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:45.920]   That's the third party cookie issue.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:46.920]   I said, there's a third party cookie.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:48.360]   But it's also anonymized.
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.360]   It's anonymized.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.360]   Yeah, but it does.
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:52.240]   I mean, who cares if it's anonymized because they know enough about me.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.240]   They don't need my name.
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:54.240]   That's the least of it.
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.240]   But again, right.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.240]   All right.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:59.560]   So imagine the dark room where they're using all this data.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.320]   I have you heard of a single case, a single case.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:07.520]   I'll give you the one that that's the canonical case, the insurance company who through aggregated
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:12.120]   data realizes I eat a lot of Tim Hortons and Dunkin Donuts and refuses me insurance.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:15.480]   But no, no, no, wait, wait, they can't do that from cookies because it doesn't tie to
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:16.480]   your name.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:20.960]   Oh, but that's easy enough because it's not really anonymous because one site I logged
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:26.760]   into and that that data is then not tracked with the rest of the data.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:32.440]   So when a double cookie comes along, it's not tying to Axiom in that data.
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:37.680]   It has the data of certain online web behavior, but it doesn't tie to your name.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.120]   Okay.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.240]   So why does Google capitulate that internally?
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:46.200]   Because they had agreed to be part of a standard and the standard you referenced.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.760]   They were not going to have it at all.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:48.760]   Right.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:49.760]   Right.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.680]   So I'm going to export that, but they put it in there and I also support that.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:53.680]   It's a choice.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.680]   Fine.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:56.000]   And I suspect they'll bury the choice, which is fine.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:01.200]   And here's what happens from now on or in a year or so, every time you go to somewhere
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:05.360]   like Boing Boing, it's going to say, ah, see, you're not using tracking cookies.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:06.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:07.360]   You can't read this site.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:10.520]   I wish them what I wish they'd say there's a price to doing what they do.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.680]   Now, some people will say, okay, fine, charge me.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.440]   Yeah, but how well that works.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:15.440]   It's very expensive.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.600]   You can't and people won't pay.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   No, they won't pay.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.280]   I think some sites should say this is the condition.
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   And in fact, it happens.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:26.920]   If you go to the New York Times users data, you are required to accept cookies.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:30.040]   It is a requirement to use the site because if not, you can't use it.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.200]   I am starting to see that.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.200]   You don't use cookies.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   You can't use their site.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.200]   They don't mention that tracking.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.880]   But it's really not because they're trying to track you.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.120]   It's because that's the way the web operates.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.120]   They need that to operate.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:44.160]   The New York Times needs it to be able to handle the registration structure.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.160]   Right.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:50.760]   And the other case for this, and this is something that we've been showing off a lot of Dreamforce,
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:55.160]   is helping companies get in touch with their customers.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:59.240]   So one of the things that we do customer relationship management, so that is companies keeping records
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:02.720]   of you so that they know what you bought and what you're trying to buy and when you make
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:04.160]   a complaint, they can talk back to you.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:05.160]   They're tracking me.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.160]   And we're tracking you.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.680]   Yeah, we've got a giant database full of you.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:11.480]   Oh, for other people.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:15.440]   But part of what we're trying to do with the stuff at the moment is actually when you complain
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:19.360]   about something on Twitter, help them actually connect that back to a customer record so
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.720]   that they can say, "Oh, yeah, you did get the bad one.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.840]   Here's a better one," or whatever.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:28.040]   So there's a lot of stuff with this.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.800]   And like any other tool, it's like, "Are you using this to do good or to do harm?"
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:37.880]   And part of the point of the other thing, the big push we've had here has been business
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:43.640]   social, you need to be out on the social networks paying attention to your customers, part of
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:46.720]   this world where this is going on.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.080]   And you need to not behave like a dick there.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:53.680]   You need to actually go out there and be good to your customers and not do bad things.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.720]   And when they complain about you don't bitch at them.
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:56:00.840]   This seems like obvious stuff, but it's very new to a lot of companies that they can have
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:06.280]   that direct relationship and that also, in the same thing, remarks in a private room can
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.280]   go public.
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:12.320]   And people could, if you misbehave that can spread around the web too.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.320]   So here's the...
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.320]   Go ahead.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:19.680]   The big bunch of this is, writing some tools to do this, but at the same time, expanding
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:24.000]   people that you should behave in a way that relates well to your customers with this stuff,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.560]   not use it as a way to attack them.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.280]   Well, and that is the key point.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:33.080]   And I talked about that yesterday at Dreamforce, where our business should be about relationships
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:35.880]   and delivering value in return for that.
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:39.280]   An example I've used in the show before is people in German, even Germany doesn't complain
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:43.080]   about Google priority inbox because they get value back.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:47.840]   And just asking somebody for their name as a condition of coming in or their phone number
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:50.320]   or whatever, yeah, I wouldn't do it either.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.600]   I don't like it either.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:57.320]   But if I get value back, Google knowing where I am so it can give me targeted information
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.520]   is a perfect structure.
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:02.280]   We did screw that up in our industry that we didn't explain that well.
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:03.480]   Yeah, well, and it's done.
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:04.880]   And unfortunately, what if now?
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:08.720]   I know we can try to fight the good fight and convince people otherwise.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:18.080]   But what if people actually finally just say, no, and don't track us, that add model collapses,
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:20.800]   then I really think it's a nuclear winner.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.640]   I think you get to the point where--
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.960]   No, there's going to be some solution.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:25.960]   There's going to be some solution.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:26.960]   Well, here's the tracking cookies.
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:30.160]   But the thing is that the app portal is also collapsing because of mobile.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.160]   Right.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.720]   And that's happening faster.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:38.480]   The stuff I was getting from these guys was, Matt Hall, he said that Metafilter had gone,
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.880]   you can see it going up incrementally.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:43.080]   It's over 30% mobile readers now.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.200]   He's going to go across 50% this year.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.840]   So we've got pressure from two sides now.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:48.840]   Yes, we do.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.760]   We need other ways to support these things.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:55.360]   Well, what happens is, and the chatroom is excoriating me for good reason.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:56.360]   I'll confess.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.880]   I went a little strong there.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:05.320]   But what does happen here, unquestionably, is if the ad support for media goes away,
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.800]   then you will have less content or more paywalls.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.720]   You'll just have to.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.720]   But I think paywalls don't work in some big cases.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:16.560]   They don't because of scarcity and abundance and all that.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:19.920]   Now, what I would argue the way that I've been arguing media ought to go is to build relationships
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:24.120]   with people, but that relationship requires knowing you and knowing something about you
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.000]   and being able to act positively on that.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.640]   But yeah, I think that the problem I have is not that individuals will turn on, do not
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.280]   track choices or will use ad blockers.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.280]   It's going to be small numbers.
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:40.480]   The problem is things like what Microsoft is doing and what the EU is doing and making
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.480]   it the default.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:45.960]   We've been able to safely ignore ad blockers because it's such a tiny percentage.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:51.040]   Now, unfortunately, it hits tech sites where tech-literate people are disproportionately.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:56.760]   It's why 4chan doesn't make money, frankly, or meta-filter or any of these.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.400]   And it's a problem on Boeing, because they have a literate audience.
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:03.040]   And so now, fortunately, the Boeing, the audience you probably can talk to.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.080]   Except in a way that you can't probably do a 4chan audience.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:10.600]   But those people are turning on ad blockers by default to all sides of the go-to.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:16.280]   And then that's the problem is that if do not track becomes the default, even if it's
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:20.520]   a, you know, and this is why I'm sure that the standards body said, no, it can't be a
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:21.520]   default.
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.160]   It has to be unset is the default.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:27.640]   If it becomes the default, most people not knowing what they're setting will just choose
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.640]   it.
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.640]   Well, the other model is you.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.640]   The other model is.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:32.640]   And that's what I'm saying is that people are going to have to find other.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:33.760]   I'm fortunate.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:35.200]   I stumbled into this model.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:38.400]   It wasn't that I thought 5, 10, well, actually, seven years ago.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.480]   Oh, we're going to have problems with privacy and tracking cookies.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:42.600]   So I better have a model.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:45.320]   I did know the pay-pay wall was going to work because we tried it.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.320]   Right.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:49.440]   So we figured out a way of doing niche broadcasting.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:53.040]   We know our audience only because we're such a narrow niche.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.400]   And you can't get over the ad.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.640]   You could fast forward, but, but the truth is.
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.840]   Oh, people fast forward with the ads all the time.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:05.120]   But they not busy even so people know that stamps.com, for example, and for our sponsors
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.120]   of this show.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:08.800]   We do everything we can to make sure they know a lot.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.800]   Right.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.720]   And so when those companies go out and see the effectiveness of their advertising and
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.440]   are they getting unedited recall from their consumers?
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.640]   I'm betting everything that they're, they're fine.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.640]   People know this.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.640]   But frankly, these are personalized ads.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.000]   We just don't have to do tracking cookies.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   We just know what the audience.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   We know our audience.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.240]   I mean, but that's lucky.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:29.600]   I mean, that's your luck, which is why I'm interested in this because we serve.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:34.560]   And we are doing banner ads now, which I think will be impacted by this, right?
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.560]   I think so.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.560]   You may get remnant ads because they don't know who to target.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.560]   Right.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.560]   So any banner ads is strongly targeted.
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.560]   But we sell them direct.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.560]   So they're not, we're not.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.560]   Okay, so that's different.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.000]   These are all in fact, the banner ads tend to be from the same people we're buying.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.480]   And by the way, that's the third thing.
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.760]   Remnant ads are terrible experience, right?
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.040]   The dancing month is we don't want those.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.040]   That's why when I go to Boing Boing and look at Boing Boing.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.680]   The payment for them is going down as well.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:02.440]   It looks like, frankly, it doesn't look like ads that are targeted to a Boing Boing audience.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.880]   It looks like ads that are remnant ads.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.000]   Maybe they aren't, but socks.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   eBay.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.880]   Well, the eBay is probably just a throw in there.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.440]   Well, do they use them?
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.440]   They're using FM.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.440]   FM, yeah.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.440]   Well, federated.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.440]   See, I was in federated for a while.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.440]   There are sports.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.440]   Good people.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.440]   These are tailored.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.440]   But what federated needed was volume.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.440]   The sports isn't at home decor.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.440]   That's the site.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.560]   Yeah, that's all appropriate.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.800]   Game, edge world, the game.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.520]   They're doing ads in the stream as well, as you can see.
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.640]   And chewing tobacco or something.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.640]   Chewing tobacco, really?
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.640]   No, really?
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.640]   It's not.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.640]   It's not.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.640]   Snuff.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.640]   No.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.640]   Well, that's because they have a younger audience.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:40.640]   Ooh.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.040]   You wouldn't run a snuff ad?
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.040]   No, I would not.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.080]   It's probably maybe it's a steampunk thing.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.720]   You know, I can see snuff and some point.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.640]   No, it's because they have a young audience.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:49.960]   It's hard if you're a snuff.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.680]   Get yourself in the shoes of the snuff manufacturers.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:53.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.720]   It's not an easy audience to get to because they're not watching TV.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.120]   The other thing Kevin Roth did was all the time.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.920]   Your snuff boxes.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.680]   Well, no, we actually were going to do that because what I'm going to do is you'll never
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.000]   see an ad for snuff, but you'll notice as people walk around the studio, they all have
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.240]   little round cans in their pockets.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.080]   It's a very subtle form of advertising.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.920]   And they're snor- snorfling.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.920]   And they're going.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.120]   The other impact of this, Kevin mentioned, is that in the EU, you're starting to see
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:29.120]   sites where it's giving you that tick box and they haven't even gotten into the full
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.840]   regulations that Vivian Redding is proposing that will really become irritating, where
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:38.360]   you'll constantly see this need to say, "Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.400]   What's the evil of all of this?"
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.400]   I don't know.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.400]   Here's a chart.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.400]   This must be from you.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.400]   You like infographics.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.120]   It's on extreme tech, the technological deathmatch.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.120]   Amazon, Apple.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120]   Yeah, she was kind of an interested one.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.320]   And Google and Microsoft face-off.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.960]   This chart is in the world of the next page.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.680]   So these are the products in January 2007.
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.680]   This is 2007.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.760]   Of who was in what business?
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:05.480]   It was Apple was in phone, Mac, iTunes, movies, music, browser, OS, and iOS.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.480]   And Microsoft was in a few of those.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.480]   Google was in none of those.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.480]   Fascinating how little Google was in the time.
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.480]   And that's all changed, of course.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.480]   Go down to the next page.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.480]   No, no, no.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.480]   You got to go to the next page.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.480]   Next page.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.480]   You got to get some more ad loads.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.480]   Here we go.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.480]   We're in movies back then.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.480]   Now look, it's all green.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.480]   It's fine with Google video.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:23.480]   They just weren't doing very well.
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.480]   Good job.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.480]   Phone, they got the Nexus.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.480]   The tablet, they got the Nexus 7.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:31.240]   The computer, they've got Chromebooks, books, they've got play.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.480]   The movies in play and music in play and browser in Chrome.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.480]   Yeah, look at that.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.480]   Pretty amazing.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:41.960]   Now, is that testimony to the brilliance of Apple five years ago?
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.200]   And everybody's following along?
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.200]   The argument in this piece is that it is because of mobile.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.840]   The mobile brought all of this on.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.200]   With mobile, you have to have these things.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.200]   Right.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.200]   Right.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.200]   The mobile changes a lot.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.720]   We're seeing it's changing the ad model.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:02.000]   The success of these companies is really hanging by a thread because of mobile.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.080]   It changes the business that you're in.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.080]   Yep.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.720]   Who is the winner if you presume that?
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.160]   Is Google the winner?
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:14.680]   Apple's the winner only because they made the early mobile platform that dominated.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:15.680]   But Apple doesn't really--
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.680]   Do you need to hold that?
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.160]   Apple has a structure to sell you stuff.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.160]   Google has a structure to do ads.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.800]   So you know what's missing in that thing?
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.800]   Is maps?
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.520]   Yes, which is really important because one of the stories in here is that Amazon is going
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.520]   back into maps.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.520]   Let's talk about maps.
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:32.440]   We're going to talk about maps because the iOS 6 came out today.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.320]   And already I'm hearing the noise about the maps.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.320]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.200]   But first word from Ford.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.600]   You see, we have ads.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.600]   Thank you, Lord.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.000]   I got a mortgage on this studio.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.040]   I got a pay.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.040]   Social.Ford.com.
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:55.800]   Ford has a great social website designed for Ford lovers, Ford owners.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.800]   There's something about Ford.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:57.800]   I don't know.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.800]   I guess maybe it's true for other manufacturers.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:00.800]   I don't know.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.920]   But there's something about-- I know this because I'm a Mustang owner.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:07.560]   Where you just-- you got this-- this becomes kind of part of your life.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:12.360]   And if you're that kind of person, if you're a Ford family, you got to visit social.Ford.com.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.360]   It's a site for you.
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.520]   First of all, a lot of Ford news.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:17.240]   For instance, they just announced today the new fusions.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:25.400]   The first 47, 47, 47 car, 47 miles per gallon highway city, and combined.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.040]   The new fusion, there'll be a plug-in hybrid, a regular hybrid.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.600]   I cannot wait.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:30.920]   I cannot wait.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:32.640]   But so that's the kind of information you'll get.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.720]   But you also have articles on a lot of other subjects.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.360]   You see all the subjects here, including technology.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.760]   I have a little article in here, an interview I did with Jim Butch Casky is one of their
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:41.760]   lead technologists.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:45.960]   But you can read-- I mean, it's really fun to read about the Ford technology story.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:52.200]   This is a company that has-- one of the original industrial giants in the US that has embraced
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.520]   consumer electronics and technology and everything they do.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.720]   Images and videos from Ford owners.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.720]   Great ideas, too.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.240]   This is their suggestion box.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:04.360]   Your ideas, and you can vote on others' suggestions.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.840]   Post your own ideas.

[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.840]   And I'll find out more about it.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:26.840]   And you'll find out more about it.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.840]   I'll find out more about it.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:28.840]   You'll find out more about it.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:29.840]   I'll find out more about it.
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:30.840]   And you'll find out more about it.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:31.840]   And you'll find out more about it.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:32.840]   And you'll find out more about it.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:33.840]   And you'll find out more about it.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:38.840]   Are you, Jones, for sure?
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:39.840]   Do you buy this for a Lisa's one?
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:40.840]   The mustang I bought.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.840]   I own it outright.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:42.840]   So I could trade it in.
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:43.840]   You can trade it in.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:44.840]   Lisa won't let me.
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:45.840]   She wants it.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:46.840]   Oh, it's a V.A.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.840]   She says, no, no, no, no.
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:50.840]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:51.840]   Let me down.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.840]   It's a company car.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:53.840]   She could drive it.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.840]   She could drive it.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.840]   Let's talk about...
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.840]   What was it?
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.840]   It was something exciting and new and different.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:01.840]   And you started this.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:02.840]   And I can't remember what it is.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:03.840]   Maps.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:04.840]   Kevin started it.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:05.840]   Maps.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.840]   He starts all these.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.840]   iOS 6 dumps Google Maps.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:14.840]   And already, you know, a few of the tame press, and Apple really has its tame press core,
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.840]   are saying how great Maps is.
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.840]   Almost everybody else is saying, oh, no.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.840]   This is a big loss for Apple.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.840]   First of all, why does Apple dump Google Maps?
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.840]   Well, it is more complicated than that.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:33.840]   The thing is that the old Maps app was written by Apple using Google's API.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.840]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.840]   Okay.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:36.840]   So there was not a Google app.
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:37.840]   It's a big thing to be really clear.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:38.840]   It wasn't a Google app.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:39.840]   And this is why...
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:40.840]   Is that true of the YouTube app as well?
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.840]   It was an Apple app.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:42.840]   It was an Apple app as well.
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:48.840]   They were done in the sort of early days of iOS before anybody else had the SDK.
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.840]   Remember, they shipped with these.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:55.840]   And when Eric was on the board, there was a partnership going on.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:58.840]   Those apps have not been touched much since.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:07:59.840]   Right.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.840]   And they didn't pick up all the features that Google Maps has got since.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.840]   Like turn by turn.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:07.840]   Like turn by turn, like bicycle turn by turn, which is my new favorite.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:08.840]   Transit directions.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.840]   But why couldn't they?
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:10.840]   Why couldn't they?
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:11.840]   They could.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:12.840]   They just didn't.
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.840]   They think they decided not to work with Google in that way anymore.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.840]   Now, they had a huge fight previously.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:24.840]   This was 2009, maybe, where they blocked Google Maps.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.840]   They blocked Google from putting apps in the store.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:28.840]   They wouldn't let Google put in latitude.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:29.840]   Or a Google voice.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.840]   A Google voice in the FCC had them poke at them and there was a whole bunch of...
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.840]   What's the word about that?
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.840]   Remember they asked for a letter from Apple?
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:37.840]   What the hell?
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:43.840]   And, you know, Vic Gondotra was a huge fan of iOS and wanted to ship lots of apps on that.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.840]   And after that, Apple refused to put the stores.
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:46.840]   They were like, "Okay.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.840]   We're going to do Android first for everything.
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:52.840]   We'll do iOS as needed, but only if Apple let us do it."
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.840]   They didn't because of that spat.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.840]   And that has...
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:02.840]   What has happened is that the iOS Maps app has been not keeping up with the Android one.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.840]   But anyone who's used both, that's obvious.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.840]   There are a lot of iOS-only people who...
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:13.840]   So now we've got an Apple-created version where they replace Google Maps with Maps they've licensed from.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:14.840]   I think it's Tom Tom.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:15.840]   Tom Tom only.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.840]   And that's part of the promise.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.840]   Tom was just getting into this business.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.840]   And OpenStreetMap is what I think.
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.840]   They've got a mixture of stuff in there.
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.840]   So...
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.840]   But they...
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.840]   It is not as mature as the Maps, the Google Maps has gone.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.840]   And it's missing transit.
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:29.840]   It's missing bikes.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:30.840]   It's missing Street View.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.840]   But that's what Kevin's speaking to is the value of having...
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.840]   This goes back to tracking, right?
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:36.840]   Okay.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:42.840]   If I can't track you, at least I can know where you're going, where you are, where you live, where you go every day, what you look for and that.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.840]   That has a huge value coming forward.
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:45.840]   It's an enormous...
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:46.840]   It's an enormous...
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:47.840]   It's useful, yeah.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:48.840]   And it's...
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:51.840]   So are you saying this is an information grab?
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:52.840]   I have.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:53.840]   And Amazon.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:54.840]   I have it.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.840]   Amazon too is going to start its own maps.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.840]   Amazon has licensed Nokia Maps.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.840]   By the way, the Nokia Maps are quite good.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.840]   They're kind of the underdog.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.840]   People don't know about them, but Nokia bought...
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:09.840]   They bought one of them that there's a Navtech and Telenav.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.840]   And I think they bought Navtech, right?
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.840]   Fix it on them.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.840]   One of the two big mapping companies.
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:13.840]   Bigger than TomTom.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.840]   TomTom's only now getting into that business.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:18.840]   So Nokia has great data.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.840]   They've been working on this for some time.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:21.840]   They've got great software.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.840]   So Amazon's licensing.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:24.840]   And it has an...
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.840]   And has an API.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.840]   Right.
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.840]   So you're right as an information grab, but it's also a...
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.840]   It's only reason Amazon would want to do that is so that they could...
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.840]   We just lost Kevin, we'll get him back.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.840]   Is so that they can track you?
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.840]   Not just track you, but to know...
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.840]   To have where...
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:42.840]   Do you know where you are and serve you ads that are...
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:43.840]   Right.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:44.840]   Don't forget what Amazon's going to do.
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:45.840]   And this is the story too.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:46.840]   Everybody's trying to do with local.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:47.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.840]   I mean, mobile.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.840]   They're saying, "Okay, it tells you something about it."
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.840]   If you're going to be mobile and we're going to lose all this revenue because you're going
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.840]   mobile, what can we do to monetize?
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:56.840]   Ah, we know where you are.
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:57.840]   Here's the other thing with Amazon.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:58.840]   Amazon is going to...
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.840]   Right now in California, it's going to start charging sales tax.
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.840]   And New Jersey is going to do the same.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.840]   And so what they're saying is it's going to differentiate itself by same day delivery,
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.840]   by fast delivery.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.840]   Right.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.840]   Well, knowing where you are when you order something, being able to enable that to get you
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.840]   something to you wherever you are is going to be a differentiator.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.840]   And maps are going to tell you that.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.840]   So it isn't grab.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.840]   A data grab.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:24.840]   So this is the...
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.840]   I don't want to get back in this tracking, Kookiee's thing.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.840]   But that's the point, isn't it?
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.840]   Is that ultimately...
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:32.840]   Unless people could find another way to make money.
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:33.840]   Right.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:34.840]   Right.
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:35.840]   I don't know, making shoes.
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:39.840]   Well, one of the odd things going on in media is events, right?
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:48.200]   And the economist and the FT and local blogs like Brooklyn Brownstone, make their living
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.920]   out of having events.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.480]   And that's another way to do this.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.480]   Now, and it's not a very good way.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:55.080]   It happens on events or Google events.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.560]   I know not going to work now.
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.560]   Right.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.560]   But if for something like 4chan or for Twitter.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.560]   Well, Twitter.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.560]   I mean, Ted Crench does very well on events.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.560]   You could do...
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.560]   Why don't you do events?
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.080]   You could go to New York and hold an event.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.080]   You probably wouldn't do this knowing you because you're just too...
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.080]   I'm lazy.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.600]   Well, that, but you probably wouldn't charge.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.600]   But you could charge the door.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.200]   You could pay for everybody.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.200]   Everybody's told me we should do this.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.160]   But someday, maybe.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.240]   In the summer, you can come and you can use my campus.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.240]   Okay.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.240]   All right.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.240]   Okay.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.240]   Make them come to New York.
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:32.880]   So Ted Crench, speaking of Ted Crench, says, "If I were Google, this is Drew Olenoff.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.880]   I love Drew.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.920]   I wouldn't release a map app for six months."
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.000]   Google has already released a YouTube app.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   They've already responded.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   They said, "Okay, fine.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   You're going to take out YouTube."
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   That was a crappy app.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.360]   Anyway, the new YouTube app is much, much better.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.520]   It's modern, New York, DC, and Pussy.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:54.500]   I have to think that somebody at the Googleplex is currently right now writing a better maps
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:57.480]   app for iOS that would probably be better.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.440]   But what Drew is saying is, "Let Google be a little bit petulant."
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.640]   Say, "All right.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.200]   You don't want to work with us."
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.560]   This is a quote.
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:12.040]   He says, "Like consumers experience what a really bad map experience is like.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.320]   Let them get angry at their beloved Apple.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.920]   Let Apple explain why their map app isn't up to snuff yet.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.960]   Then it takes time and talent to make something absolutely wonderful.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.480]   Let the consumers ask Apple why they kick the experience."
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.880]   But see, I think this is missing the boat because I don't think that's really what
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:29.840]   happened is it was just time.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.600]   Google wasn't cooperating after this snake food.
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.960]   And Apple said, "Look, we've got to do this.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:37.680]   Maybe it's going to be suboptimal.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:41.360]   I don't think it's bad, but I think it's going to be suboptimal for say a few months
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.360]   a year.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.440]   I don't know how long it'll take."
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:49.640]   But at some point, won't they be as good as Google Maps?
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:50.640]   I don't know.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.360]   Look at what Google is investing in maps.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.360]   It's a lot.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:56.440]   Well, in fact, it was really interesting because the New York Times had an article about
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.720]   Google's back end the week before this happened.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.720]   Yeah, right.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:03.560]   It was really placed by Google saying, "Hey, you really should do an article on how hard
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.240]   we work on maps because they're really good.
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.880]   And there's a reason why an Apple can't do this."
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:12.200]   And the other thing, David Grapp, as you said, is that one thing Marissa Meyer always
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:16.040]   bragged about was how many data points had been added to their maps.
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:21.160]   It's not just that Google's been collecting this data and using this data for years.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.160]   Exactly.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:24.000]   There's a lot of massaging going on behind the scenes.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.520]   And even Street View, which we should mention did a wonderful thing right here in this very
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.520]   place.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.920]   I'll show you that.
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:31.920]   That's my tool.
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:32.920]   Oh, sorry.
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:33.920]   Okay.
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:34.920]   All right.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:37.000]   So Street View collects data in other ways.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.600]   No, I don't actually use Street View that much.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:43.560]   I don't use the pictures, but it's there as another source of data that Google is investing.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:47.120]   You know, before I go, he says he loves it because when he arrives using Google Maps,
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.440]   he has a picture of the building and says, "This is where you're going."
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.640]   He's an old guy, he needs that.
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:57.720]   You know, I don't use that feature, but I trust interest.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:58.720]   Okay.
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:02.040]   We're still getting Kevin back on here.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.160]   I haven't used iOS 6 yet, and I haven't used the maps yet.
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.000]   I'll try it when I get home tonight.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.960]   And so I think the jury's still out.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:10.960]   You got it.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:15.560]   People got to drive around a lot and try it, but there's definitely things missing.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.600]   And it is going to hurt, I think, a little bit.
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:19.600]   Unless you're...
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:23.120]   The problem is most people who use iOS use it exclusively.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.120]   So they don't have...
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.120]   I mean, we're unusual.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.120]   They don't have an experience of what they might be missing.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.800]   So you know what's happening to me, Leo, is the Nexus 7 is what drives me to go ahead
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.480]   and switch my phone to an...
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.480]   Interesting.
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.480]   Because...
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:36.480]   Interesting.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.160]   I get an experience here that the iPhone, to me, is clumsy now.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.120]   And it doesn't have the integrated experience with the Google Apps that I use regularly.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.360]   I use Docs, or pardon me, Drive.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.360]   I use Gmail.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:49.320]   I use all the stuff and maps.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:54.920]   So being stuck by Amazon or Apple, either one, to have to use their stuff and not be able
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:59.000]   to use the things I actually use, this is spoiling me.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.720]   This is a kind of a lost leader for me to drive me into Android more.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:03.720]   That's interesting.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.720]   But I'm weird.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:05.720]   I don't know.
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.200]   I think a lot of people bought that 7 because it was so cheap.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:13.120]   That's another reason why Google should just give it away because it is a Trojan horse.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.840]   Yeah, it really is.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.080]   Google+, okay, I'm just going to get in trouble.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.480]   I'm going to say it, but go ahead.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:24.720]   Google+ has 400 million registered users, 100 million monthly active users.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:25.720]   Hi there.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:27.840]   Hey, Kevin Marks, welcome back.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.280]   We just changed the subject.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.560]   We were talking about maps.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.200]   Sorry we missed your input there, but--
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.280]   Now he's on a Google+.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:35.560]   Time waits for no man.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.680]   So now he's going to get in trouble.
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.680]   Or Mark.
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:45.680]   Well, one more thing about that, it ties back to the other fast about alternative Android
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:46.680]   versions.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.080]   So part of the-- Oh, yeah, we could talk about the Alibaba story.
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.080]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.080]   I think this connected.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.080]   Okay.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.960]   So just to give you an update, I think most people know this story.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:03.160]   But Google said to a-- it was Acer, right?
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.160]   Who was it?
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.560]   Oh, no, I got to find it.
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:12.200]   The Ali-Yoon OS, which was a highly hacked Android, Google said that is not going to
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.200]   be Android.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:14.720]   It's not Android enough.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.640]   It's incompatible.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:22.760]   So we're not going to-- we're not going to countenance it.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.960]   Well, you can do it if you want to.
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.560]   You can do it if you want to, but then you're not--
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.440]   You're making it in Google apps and you're not the Android Open handset alliance.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.440]   You're not an official--
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.440]   Certified Android.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.440]   Certified Android.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.440]   And they canceled the phone.
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:39.440]   But the company itself, Alibaba said, we respect and understand our partner's decision
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:40.920]   to postpone the introduction of the phone.
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.880]   We're dismayed by the impact this dispute has had on our partner.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.520]   They're talking about Acer.
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.240]   Alibaba is a Chinese company.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.560]   Acer officials said that Acer will continue to communicate with Google.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:53.760]   It still wants to launch the phone.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:56.560]   Does this have anything to do to that it's in China?
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:00.120]   And there are things that the Chinese government, for example, wants to put on phones.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.520]   A lot of people say Google's evil in not allowing this.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.120]   No, Google's allowing it.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.120]   You can do it.
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:08.120]   They're just saying that.
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:09.120]   We won't put it Android on it.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.120]   You can't put Android on it.
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.120]   So, OK, so there's the setup, Kevin.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.120]   Go ahead.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:19.320]   So, part of the part of this is Google uses Android to refer to two things at once, which
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.320]   is really confusing.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:25.800]   It's the open source project that is the core thing that you can build the phones on, run
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:26.800]   all that.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:32.920]   And there's a bunch of apps which you only get if you pay up for the rights with Google
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:33.920]   on your phone.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:37.000]   So as an example, I have here the Kindle Fire HD.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.560]   That's running on an Android base.
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:41.560]   But it doesn't say Android.
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:42.760]   It doesn't have any Google apps.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.360]   It's not approved official Android.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.360]   But you can't use Android logo unless you do that with Google.
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:49.880]   Google didn't say to Amazon, "Oh, you can't do that?"
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:51.560]   No, it's part of Open Hands Hit Alliance.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.560]   It's allowed to do that.
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.560]   It's open source software.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:54.560]   Right.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:55.560]   Right.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:19:01.760]   So, I wrote about this way back in July, January 2011, explaining the, there were these two
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:05.880]   parts and expecting he would have started building a replacement for the, with Google
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:06.880]   parts.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:12.240]   And Amazon was the, I believe, the first one, the second one after Barnes and Noble.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:16.520]   But they were actually, they built a sort of a suite of apps that runs on top of Android
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.040]   that replaces those Google apps.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.840]   And they haven't replaced all of them yet.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.040]   You know, there are some missing there.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.800]   They don't have a great email client.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.480]   And they have, they didn't have maps.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:32.000]   And so Amazon this week announced that they're starting to make maps for their devices too.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   So that's interesting.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.560]   I expect, what I expected was to see more of these.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.760]   And I think some of these Chinese ones are like that.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.040]   They take the Android operating system.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.440]   But they put their own apps on top of it that are part of the experience.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:50.880]   Now, Jeff, you said before that you think that the, the Google ecosystem is a big part
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.040]   of the Android experience and part of the reason you want it.
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.040]   Yes.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.040]   And that's been broadly true.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:20:00.560]   And so when you get a phone that's missing those, you feel like you got bits missing.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:04.600]   So Amazon's not a member of the Open Hand Set Alliance.
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:07.440]   So there's no stick with which to punish them.
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:12.240]   I wonder whether Google regrets making it open source.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.520]   But I think that there's other advantages to them.
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:17.760]   If I'm wrong here, Kevin, at some point they do want people, more people developing on
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.920]   the platform.
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:25.320]   If there are apps that run on Android, even on rogue Android installations, it helps the
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.320]   Android ecosystem.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:32.760]   Here's what Andy Ruben who's in charge of Android at Google said on Google+.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:36.880]   We agree that the Allian OS is not part of the Android ecosystem.
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:40.280]   And you are under no requirement to be compatible.
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:45.720]   However, the fact is Allian uses the Android runtime framework and tools.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:50.800]   And your app store contains Android apps, including pirated Google apps.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:54.200]   So there's really no disputing that Allian is based on the Android platform and takes
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:58.920]   advantage of all the hard work that's gone into the platform by the Open Hand Set Alliance.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:03.240]   If you want to benefit from the Android ecosystem, then make the choice to be compatible.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.360]   It's easy, free, will even help you out.
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.560]   But if you don't want to be compatible, then don't expect help from the OHA members that
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:13.680]   are working to support and build a unified Android ecosystem.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:14.680]   That seems fair.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:15.680]   I think so.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.680]   I think this is it.
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:22.480]   But the confusion about those two different levels of Android is partly of Google's own
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:23.480]   making.
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:27.640]   I last year of Dreamforce, Mark Benioff interviewed Eric Schmidt about this.
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:34.320]   And Schmidt was very explicit was that this app spongle and the store and all those things
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:37.960]   was the camera they used to keep these people in line.
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.360]   He was basically the same as.
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:43.520]   And this is our way to keep this system converged.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:47.120]   And there are ones that are built on Android that aren't doing that.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:54.720]   As Amazon, Amazon's member of OHA, and Google's never said word one about that, that's fine.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:58.720]   But if you're going to be a member of OHA as Acer is, then you have to abide by those.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:21:59.720]   It seems sensible.
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:04.120]   Not to go back too far, but is that a model for Twitter in a way?
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:07.760]   Could Twitter have been built in a similar way to say, all right, this part of this stuff
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.760]   here wouldn't have been great.
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:11.760]   Wouldn't it have been great to say?
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:12.760]   Okay.
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:13.760]   Interesting idea.
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:14.760]   Never.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:17.720]   Is there precedent in the open source world for anything like this before?
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:23.920]   I mean, is that how, I don't know, Java's manages anything managed like this?
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:24.920]   Kevin?
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:26.920]   Um, somewhat.
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:29.280]   Java's a bit like this.
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.280]   MySQL.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:31.280]   MySQL's like this, right?
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:37.520]   Well, what they have there is they tend to have one license, they, they, digital license,
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:40.320]   and they will, so they'll, they have extra rights.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:44.320]   So over it, people don't have it when else gets GPL, they get to do other things too.
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:49.640]   Um, it's how you prevent incompatible forks from kind of polluting the stream.
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:50.640]   Right.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.640]   Right.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:55.400]   But what, but they're still available, you know, when, when Oracle took over MySQL,
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:01.080]   um, it was, it was, it's now been for two or three times and that was significantly,
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:05.720]   there are significant, um, working forks that might seek with the behavior differently.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:08.280]   So, um, and may have different maintainers.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:11.520]   Um, and that was because they weren't happy with Oracle's stewardship of it.
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.880]   So that, that, that, that ability was still there.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:16.200]   We haven't seen as much of that with Android.
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:22.680]   Um, the, what, what, um, partly because it's modular, but I don't, you know, it's not clear
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.800]   how different Amazon's version is.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.680]   It certainly runs, you know, apps that are built for that version of, of Android.
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:32.480]   Um, nor do I have, do you want to test stuff on yet?
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:35.720]   But look, you know, you can tell it's Android if you look at the settings and so forth,
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:39.120]   but it's not, and you've got, and you can install Android APKs on it.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.160]   You know, it's, you can.
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.160]   You can't.
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.160]   In fact, there's even the checkbox.
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:45.680]   It says are you going to install a lot of installing of third party apps.
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:48.680]   Um, so it's very compatible, right?
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:49.840]   More so probably than this.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:54.840]   And then we'll see how the volume was.
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:55.840]   Right.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:56.840]   I don't know.
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:57.840]   So yeah, so, so, so, but that was it.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:02.480]   So part of the, um, part of the rules for getting the weird Google is there's a list of
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:05.880]   compliance stuff you have to do that defines a release of Android.
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:08.240]   There's a compatibility definition document, right?
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:09.240]   Right.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:13.360]   And they have, and they have different, um, they define a different one for each one.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:17.680]   And so that says that the device has to have certain characteristics, um, for it to be
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:19.960]   required as an Android of that iteration.
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:25.880]   So, um, the Android 1.6 definition required it to be a phone.
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:28.000]   It had to have telephone APIs.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.400]   Um, Android, um, 2.1 didn't say that, but it did, did say you have to have a camera.
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.000]   So there was a set of rules like that.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   Oh, interesting.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.840]   That they, that they said you can't be conformed unless you have these things, because they're
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.600]   trying to converge the platform so that you can write an app and you know that the phone
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:45.760]   stuff will be there or you know that the camera will be there.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.160]   There's so much to talk about today.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.640]   I got so many more things.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:52.000]   We started talking about, uh, Google plus 400 million signups.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.600]   Yeah, you were going to be a smart ass, weren't you?
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.600]   Yeah, but I won't now.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.600]   I'll be nice.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.600]   Go ahead.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.600]   Go ahead and say it.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:00.280]   It's no time to be snarky and a hundred million active users.
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.760]   It seems to me there's four people on there, but I, I could be wrong.
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.440]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, and they're all about you right now.
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:07.440]   They all hate me.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:11.440]   But I said the same thing about buzz and boy, and everybody on buzz said, no buzz is a live
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:18.800]   and vital and then that was it.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:18.800]   So, you know, Google, Google, Google plus will never go away because Google is basically saying,
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.280]   no, no, there's no such thing as Google plus.
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.680]   It's Google period.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.560]   And when you sign up for Google, you just, that's part of it.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.800]   Drew wrote a good piece that it's, it's the socialization of Google as a whole.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:30.800]   And I think that's true.
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:32.920]   But it's not a place people are, it's not a destination.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.560]   No, it doesn't really want to be, but it is, I, I'm telling you, it's the best conversations
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:37.560]   I have.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:38.560]   It beats the moment.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.560]   I'm not denying that.
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:44.560]   So I think Google's missing the, Google's mis, misinforming when they're talking about
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:48.720]   all these numbers because it's not like there's 400 million people, you know, or even 100.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:50.160]   They say 100 million visit every month.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:54.160]   I don't know where they're visiting, but it just, if it doesn't, it's not.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.960]   Yeah, it's, I'm sorry.
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:58.040]   It's like, that's not what's going on there.
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:03.880]   Visits to the Google, uh, site are always a ridiculous number because people encounter
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:05.040]   Google all over.
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.440]   It's not a, that's what Google's goal here is, is to get it embedded all over.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:12.440]   As long as we're talking about misrepresenting, uh, there were all the articles that Google
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:18.120]   threatening, uh, you know, the verge that Acer cancels phone launch in response to threats
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:19.120]   from Google.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:24.440]   It's really easy to write a, a headline that really misrepresents the thrust of what's
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.440]   going on.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:26.440]   There's schmucks, my colleagues.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:30.960]   And so, you know, let's just, it's just not, it's misrepresenting it to say that the Google
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.880]   plus is a social network.
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:33.880]   It's Google.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:34.880]   It's Google.
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:35.880]   Exactly.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:36.880]   Wilson.
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:37.880]   Not a destination.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:38.880]   It's just Google.
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:43.480]   Um, Samsung responding to the iPhone five with a new ad inflammatory.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.360]   It's a little strong.
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:46.360]   It's not inflammatory.
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.400]   It's just an ad saying this is what they do.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.400]   This is what we do.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:53.960]   The irony actually, if you look at the Samsung Galaxy three ad, cause it's basically spec
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:58.720]   sheet head to head and I, I use a galaxy three and I have no idea what three quarters
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:26:59.720]   of these terms.
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.800]   It's, it's like a shampoo.
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.800]   The only shampoo with a smart stay.
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:07.200]   It could be, that could be in a shampoo.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.200]   It could be.
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:09.200]   Right.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:14.840]   The galaxy S three now with smart stay, S beam, share shot, group cast, direct call, smart
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:21.680]   alert, tilt to zoom, palm swipe capture, palm dirty for the ones.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:26.080]   I know what half of these are, but come on, that doesn't really, well as an ad is ridiculous
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:28.080]   because you don't use them.
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.080]   You don't know what they're right.
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.080]   The next big thing's already here.
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.920]   It's a bad, you know, it's a bad ad.
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.920]   Although it's kind of, okay, this is inflammatory.
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.800]   It doesn't take a genius.
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.800]   That's a little inflammatory.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:38.800]   Fine.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.200]   So that's, that's trolling that bad genius.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:43.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.200]   It doesn't take a genius to use our phone.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:54.360]   Um, Hey, if you see Will Ferrell, Owen Wilson, or Vince Vaughn wandering around the Google
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:58.760]   Plex, that's because they're wandering around the Google Plex.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.440]   They're, they're filming a new movie there.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:03.160]   It should be funny internship.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:07.720]   You know, I give up on should be funny after seeing the campaign, which should have been
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:08.720]   funny.
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:09.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:12.720]   There's a lot of those, a lot of those.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.200]   In every respect, it should have been funny.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:15.640]   I don't know what's wrong with the movie.
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:16.640]   It's true.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:17.640]   Will Ferrell movies, especially.
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.720]   They should be funny, but they're not often.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:23.120]   They're not, not always.
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.120]   Anchor Man too.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:28.080]   I'm sure will be a laugh riot.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:29.280]   Back to the minds we go.
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:33.040]   Let's just call it back to the mind.
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:38.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:41.120]   So the plot is that they're middle aged or nearly, and they've lost their job so they
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:42.120]   become interns at Google.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:43.600]   Like there's any chance that would happen.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.600]   BJ Novak's in it also from the office.
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:47.600]   John Goodman.
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:51.240]   I bet you John Goodman will play the role of Larry Page.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240]   Well, yeah.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240]   Who would play?
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.240]   Larry Page.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.240]   Yes.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:58.120]   I think, I think here's, we haven't seen Larry in a while.
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.280]   He lost his voice.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.440]   I think here's the plot point.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:06.080]   He's actually been in hiding eating hohos, and he's gained 400 pounds, and he looks like
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.080]   John Goodman.
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.080]   I like that.
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:09.080]   I like that.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:10.640]   See, I should be writing this movie.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:11.640]   Vince Vaughn is writing it.
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:12.640]   Vince is very funny.
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:15.560]   It's amazing that we actually wanted to do a sitcom.
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:19.160]   Unfortunately, I don't know the talent to do it around kind of startup world.
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:20.960]   Oh, they've seen it.
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:21.960]   We haven't seen it.
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:25.280]   You know, the closest we have, of course, is Big Bang Theory.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.440]   And then there's the reality show that Mark Zuckerberg's sister Randy is doing.
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:30.440]   Right, right, right.
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:33.040]   And there is the Shark Tank, which I think is really exciting.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.360]   Shark Tank is actually great.
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.760]   But it's a funny world, right?
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:38.520]   Google has filled with funny people.
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:39.520]   No, it's not.
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.320]   No, it's not.
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:44.360]   I saw an absolutely brilliant movie at the weekend.
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:45.840]   What did you see?
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:46.840]   Indie Game the Movie.
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:47.840]   Have you seen that?
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:48.840]   No.
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:49.840]   What's it about?
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:52.400]   It's a documentary about independent game developers.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.560]   Now, that I'd like to see.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.560]   Get it.
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:59.400]   It's up on their side, indiegamethemovie.com, that you can buy it directly from the movie
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:02.800]   and then you can also buy it from iTunes and stuff.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.560]   And it was completely beautifully done.
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:10.040]   It gets the experience of programming and building things and the pressures of releasing
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.960]   it and what that feels like.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.920]   And it's a beautiful piece of weather.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.080]   There's a trailer up on YouTube.
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:16.080]   You can see where it was at.
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:17.080]   Ten dollars.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.480]   Now, see, this is a good model.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.480]   Yes.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:23.000]   And they kick started funded to the production of it.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.720]   They also then a separate kick started to put it into theatrical distribution, which they
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:32.640]   did themselves, but they went to Sundance and won and they turned down the distribution
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:39.320]   deals they were getting because they were going to take too long and they did a tour
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:43.680]   in the US themselves by calling them and then sending people to go and see it.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.680]   And they're selling it online through this.
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:46.680]   This is great.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:50.160]   Yeah, I think this is happening by the way, this American life has a movie out right now
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:53.360]   and they got their audience to mobilize their audience to demand that go into theaters.
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:54.360]   You know, we want our MTV.
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:55.360]   No, forget the theater.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.360]   Charge ten dollars.
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.360]   Exactly.
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.360]   You own it forever.
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.160]   Stream it anytime, download it in format.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.160]   Ten bucks.
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:03.280]   It's cheaper than going to a movie and you own it.
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.280]   I think this is great.
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:06.280]   I think every movie should do this.
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:07.280]   Forget it.
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:08.280]   You know, just forget it.
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:09.280]   Just do this from now on.
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:10.280]   Everybody's got a home theater.
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.840]   They can watch it on a nice screen.
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:13.120]   Not everybody, but many.
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.680]   Yeah, you can buy that.
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:16.360]   You get the 1080p piece.
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.360]   It looks fine.
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.760]   It's awesome.
[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:19.760]   Great idea.
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:20.760]   I think it's the future.
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:22.360]   Now it's good they didn't distribute the Muhammad movie.
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:25.040]   I think it's a brilliant film as well.
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.680]   You know, it was really moving.
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:28.400]   Not a brilliant film.
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:31.400]   This Muhammad film clip was Google right the White House.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.680]   By the way, this is where the Muslim rage is coming from.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:35.680]   Right.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:37.840]   Is this really bizarre, poorly dubbed.
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:42.120]   Cheesy as cheesy movie, which everybody agrees is stupid.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:46.520]   However, highly offensive to some Muslims.
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:50.920]   The White House requested Google pull it down.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.480]   YouTube said no.
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:53.680]   Were they right?
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:55.160]   I think so.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.480]   They did pull it down in Libya and Egypt.
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:59.400]   And I think one or two other countries out of that.
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:00.400]   India.
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.400]   India.
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:04.000]   And I don't like that precedent at all.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.800]   I think it puts Google in a very bad position.
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:09.080]   I'm sure they don't like it either because the next time they don't take something down,
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:10.920]   they're going to say, well, you took that down.
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:16.120]   Well, they were saying, OK, we took it down responding to local law as opposed to political
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:17.120]   pressure.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.120]   No, those weren't countries.
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.120]   I don't think they were demanded.
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:21.560]   I think they took it down because of the pressure of what was happening.
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:22.880]   And they just kind of said that.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:26.000]   But they said we restricted access to it where it's illegal.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.400]   India, Indonesia, Libya, and Egypt.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.400]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:31.400]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:32.560]   I parsed that wrong.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:38.000]   We restricted access to it in countries where it is illegal, such as India and Indonesia,
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.440]   comma, as well as in Libya and Egypt, given the very sensitive situations.
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.440]   Right.
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.440]   So they did it there.
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:49.120]   It was for understandable reasons, but it does set a precedent and it puts them into
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:50.120]   a difficult position.
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:53.360]   I see how many people have stood up for Google here and said that we don't want them to
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.200]   be the censor in the nanny.
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:59.200]   I've had a lot of discussions about this online where people are saying, well, but
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.200]   you shouldn't take it down.
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.200]   Isn't it irresponsible?
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:05.320]   Well, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that if I don't like speech and I riot over
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:09.200]   that speech, I then censor that speech in the future because then things like this will
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.200]   happen.
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:11.200]   You can't get into that track.
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.200]   Very difficult, isn't it?
[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:15.120]   And I just saw that in France, something just happened.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:20.320]   A Charlie Hebdo, I think the magazine is called, a satire magazine, put up some cartoons in
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:21.320]   Muhammad.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:22.320]   Oh, boy.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.320]   So there we go.
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:25.200]   So the French government is asking them to take them down.
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:28.080]   And the problem here is not the speech.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:30.240]   The problem here is people trying to stop speech.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.240]   Right.
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:36.640]   So the other thing, Simon Rushdie's biography came out this week.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:40.320]   And there was a very good start the week on Radio 4 interview with him and talking about
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:44.920]   it and what happened and what it meant and the things that he tried to do.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:49.760]   And that was, you know, not only is the flop was still out on him, but they've increased
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:54.000]   the reward now or somebody offered either a greater amount of money for him.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.920]   The thing that he said now is that publishers wouldn't touch the book, a book that did that
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:01.440]   because the censorship is now happening.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:04.120]   And that's the thing that's most worrying.
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:08.240]   It's not, you know, that, in what we've seen here, he's obviously worried about people
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:11.760]   trying to kill him, but he's very worried about the fact that that freedom to publish
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:13.320]   is not there.
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:16.160]   Sometimes that is spare.
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:21.760]   But, but, and we do have YouTube and Kickstarter and, and so things that we can, we can publish
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:22.760]   things.
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:28.240]   That's why I was so happy, honestly, with hashtag Muslim rage and hashtag Jesus wife,
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:31.960]   because it shows there's a lot of reasonable people in the world and we can talk about
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:33.200]   Muslims and Christians.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.760]   Amen, brother.
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:35.760]   Exactly.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:36.760]   Wow.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:42.320]   I just hope that we don't blow the place up before we figure this all out.
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:47.080]   Um, I think that's anything else we want to hit.
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:48.280]   Boy, there's so many stories.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:52.600]   I don't want to miss any biggies, but I think we've got, we got the, the Vince Vaughn, Owen
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:53.800]   Wilson, Will Ferrell story.
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:56.560]   And that was the only one I really cared about.
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:59.320]   Google fiber adding Turner channels.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:00.720]   So it's expanding, expanding, expanding.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:01.720]   That's what was it?
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:07.360]   It was 90% of all the city, all the areas in Kansas city that could get Google fiber
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:08.680]   did in fact raise it up.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:09.680]   It's not up.
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.680]   Yep.
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:11.680]   Wow, which is great.
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:12.680]   It really is.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:15.080]   Um, and I only wish we had it here.
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.080]   All right.
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:19.000]   We're going to, I think we're going to go to our tips and picks.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000]   You know what?
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.680]   I think, I don't know if we're going to get Kevin Marks back, but if we don't, he just
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:24.720]   gave us a pretty good pick.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.840]   indie game.
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:27.840]   What was it?
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:28.840]   Indie game.
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:29.840]   Oh, no, I've lost it.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:36.280]   I am just IE game indie, I and the IE, not like the race indie game dot the movie dot
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.280]   com.
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.280]   That's a good pick.
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.280]   999.
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.280]   I'm going to buy it right after the show.
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.280]   So Leo, are you going to start producing?
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.280]   Are you producing movies?
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:43.280]   No.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.280]   I don't know.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.760]   Maybe I should be kind of cool, right?
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:46.760]   We do.
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:47.760]   Remember startup.com with the movie?
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:49.760]   Right?
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:55.040]   Which was, I still have the t-shirt from the failed startup from the Govworks.
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:57.920]   And I remember that they used to come into our offices and try to pitch us and they were
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:58.920]   all full of hubris.
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:02.080]   And I told them to go low and thank goodness.
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:07.200]   And it's a hilarious, it was going to be a movie about a startup being wonderful, a
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:08.960]   movie about a startup being a failure.
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:09.960]   Right.
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:10.960]   Right.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:11.960]   You have, I think the Twitter.
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:14.280]   You know what's interesting about this indie game?
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:16.920]   They also have it on Steam and iTunes.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:17.920]   So they're very smart.
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:20.040]   Whoever's doing this, they've got it.
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:23.320]   Steam, I didn't know Steam delivered content as well as games.
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:27.720]   See, the other thing you get to too is there's a lot more moves towards serial content.
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:28.720]   Right.
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:29.720]   So there's a startup.
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:30.720]   No, that's what I've wanted to do.
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:32.720]   And I think you could add up to a movie.
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:38.640]   I want to get somebody a great scream writer, somebody like the guy who wrote the wire or
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:43.160]   something like that to write a serial where there's a, at the end of every show, it's
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:48.160]   like, no, oh, and that that's how you can get people back every week, right?
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:49.160]   No.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:50.160]   We could do that here.
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:51.160]   Twit the movie.
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.360]   I want, as long as George Clooney plays me, I'm happy.
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.720]   And not John Goodman.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:56.720]   We know you like that.
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:02.240]   John Goodman, Leo Laport has been in his office for 48 days eating hohos.
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:07.080]   I need carbs.
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:08.680]   So would you like to give us a number?
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:10.520]   I think you have like 30 numbers.
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:11.880]   None of them are great, by the way.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:12.880]   They're all great.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:13.880]   It's hard to imagine.
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:14.880]   I like the first one.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:15.880]   Shouldn't.
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:20.520]   Well, so Marissa Meyer reportedly gave 30 minutes notice to Google to Google.
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:21.680]   I am out of here.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:25.480]   And Yahoo insisted upon it because they didn't want Google to come back and offer her, you
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:27.560]   know, the island of Rhodesia.
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:33.600]   So it was, it was Yahoo said, okay, we will hire you, but you can only tell Google 30
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.320]   minutes before you walk out the door.
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:36.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:37.320]   It's like, I don't like that.
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.320]   1230 p.m.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:41.880]   July 16th.
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:43.640]   That's when she dropped the cue bomb.
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:44.640]   Yeah.
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:45.640]   I quit.
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:46.640]   What do you think the reaction was?
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:49.840]   When I quit and entered him a weekly, I know full well that the executives of time, and
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.000]   we're very happy about it.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000]   I think I said that.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.080]   I think that I think that everybody was very, he said, oh, Marissa, we wish you the best.
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:37:59.080]   You've been great.
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:01.280]   We've loved working with you.
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.280]   We had nothing for you.
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.280]   We had nothing for you.
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:05.280]   I mean, when it's obvious.
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:13.080]   The other number you have to mention this week is 47%, but we speak for itself.
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:16.400]   And if I may give a tip, I'm not going to say anything.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:19.520]   Are you getting trouble for that too?
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:20.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:21.760]   We try to stay political here.
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:22.760]   Oh, okay.
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:23.760]   All right.
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:28.880]   There, you know, it's, the reason is I am a just a horrible liberal.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.640]   I am a, you're a cushy hard.
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:34.640]   I am a bleeding heart liberal atheist.
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:38.680]   And much of our audience is exactly polar opposites.
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:42.560]   So we have agreed, I and they, not to talk about it.
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.760]   And that way we get along.
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:47.120]   I could start in here, but I won't.
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.760]   I won't spare you.
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:54.720]   I also have a tip is that the $25 credit for buying an X of seven ends the end of the month.
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:56.840]   So if you're going to buy one, folks, now's the time.
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.400]   That's a movie credit and the store.
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:38:59.880]   Yeah, I had a good play card.
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:01.880]   So get one now.
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:02.880]   I haven't spent that yet.
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.400]   Yeah, I have it either, actually.
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:05.400]   Is that funny?
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:10.720]   I actually, I watched five episodes of Downton Abbey in the flight on the way out.
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:11.720]   Such a good show.
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:12.720]   It actually is.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.720]   It actually is.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:14.720]   Oh, it's.
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:15.720]   Oh, it's.
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:16.720]   The first episode I was going to kill.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:17.720]   You're a TV critic.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.440]   The first episode, no, the first episode I was getting mad at the British class system.
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:25.800]   I was getting really Kevin defend your country, defend your landsmen here.
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:27.360]   I was getting so angry at this structure.
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:28.360]   That's the point of the show?
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:29.360]   I know it is.
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.360]   I know it's an automatic tension.
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.360]   Yeah, I know.
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.360]   The future is downstairs.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.360]   I know.
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.840]   But there's a there's a there's a there's just a tolerance of the sanity.
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:37.840]   Makes me feel.
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:38.840]   But that's the thing.
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:42.880]   You know, that's the thing, even though the that the other thing would have been to make
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:45.200]   the upper class people evil, but they're not.
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.000]   They just like oblivious oblivious.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000]   Yes.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000]   Yes.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000]   Yes.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000]   And you know what?
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000]   That's the point of the show because there's a progress through the show towards the world.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000]   And I'm really glad I read a book.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.440]   It's how World War I changes that classic.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:02.600]   I read a great book called the institutional revolution a few months ago and explained
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:07.840]   that the economic basis of the aristocracy of not working, it was hostage capital that
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:12.600]   if the if the monarchy to trust someone that someone had to invest everything in that lifestyle,
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:16.760]   well, that's interesting because if they, you know, they didn't know how to make or do
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:19.960]   anything precisely, then there was stock in our hostage.
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:24.240]   And if you sent your daughter to court to marry or work as lady and waiting, if you messed
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.040]   up, you ain't gonna see her again.
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:29.120]   And so you had this notion of hostage capital, which is really, very interesting.
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:30.120]   Makes sense.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:35.920]   And this this this logic of the aristocracy is incredibly, incredibly illogical.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:36.920]   And that book explained it well.
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:39.520]   So that helped actually with watching Downton Abbey.
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:40.520]   Right.
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:44.920]   Well, I let you get over the yes or anger, but as an American, of course, but people now
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:47.240]   yell at me, you're always feeling in America because I am one.
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:51.960]   You're 99% or anger or 43% or 47% or what is it?
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:52.960]   53.
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:56.280]   The greatest thing to come out today is it's on Stuart just on that.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:01.960]   I've had an old video of Romney's mother talking about how they survived on the doll
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:02.960]   for a year.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:03.960]   Right.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:04.960]   Right.
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:05.960]   It was a great, it was a great moment.
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:08.400]   Kevin, we said your pick could be indie gamer.
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:10.120]   Indie game, the movie.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:11.120]   The movie.
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:12.120]   All right.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:13.120]   Yes.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:14.120]   So you agree with me.
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:15.120]   I didn't want to take the pick out of your hands.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:16.120]   No, absolutely.
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.280]   No, I think, you know, having seen that, that was a wonderful film and anyone who cares
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:21.760]   about geek, or you should watch it.
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:23.360]   I did that once to Eric Clapton.
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:24.760]   He beat the crap out of us.
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:29.320]   Apparently, people have said they've used it to explain what they do to their parents.
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:32.280]   It's like, show this and you'll understand why I prefer to do this thing.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:33.280]   That's good.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:34.440]   That's good.
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:38.480]   There was a good movie about cosplay I used to show my mother what I do.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:41.400]   That's another story entirely.
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:42.680]   My tool is very simple.
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:49.200]   If you go to maps.google.com, we had a great guy named Tertius Karsten's out of Houston.
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:50.200]   Come here.
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:54.080]   Now, Google internal street view, they don't do it.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.560]   They have trusted photographers who do it.
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:57.560]   We paid Tertius.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:00.000]   He contacted us and he said, I will do it.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.200]   I think it was 800 bucks.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.680]   He'd pay by the number of pictures he takes.
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:05.680]   Karsten's 360.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.320]   CA, oh, but it was worth it, Jeff.
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:08.320]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.320]   ARST.
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:13.400]   But the hilarious thing is that they pixelated the faces.
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:14.400]   They have to.
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:15.680]   I know, but it looked like you're in the porn business here.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:17.400]   I know, it's weird.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.680]   And we got a discount.
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:22.600]   But I think that the price ranges in that range is by the number of pictures.
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:25.480]   So what about go to maps.google.com search for Twitter?
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:29.720]   He uses a normal camera with an 8 mil, very wide angle, 8 mil, and a hair lens.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:31.400]   In fact, you can see in some of the images.
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:36.040]   So show my screen, if you will, whatever your name is.
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:37.040]   Chad.
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:38.840]   He's in the pictures, actually.
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:42.320]   And so if you search for Twitter, you'll see our listing in Google Places.
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:46.480]   And the key is that there's a, there's a look inside there on the picture there.
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:48.720]   There's a little street view guy.
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:51.440]   I used it before coming here so I could know where the men's room was.
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:52.440]   Yeah.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:53.680]   We didn't do the basement yet.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:56.200]   So I might get the Tertias to come back.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:57.920]   There's a basement.
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:00.200]   And there's a lot of Easter eggs in this.
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:01.800]   So you can, and you've been here, Kevin.
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:05.240]   So you know that this is, and by the way, one of the things, one of the side benefits
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:07.880]   we didn't realize is you can read every brick.
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:14.040]   So if you bought a brick, we've been, you can zoom in on the bricks and you can literally,
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:18.040]   that's how the high quality there, you can get so much out of this.
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:21.400]   So if you will wander into the studio, I guess I've zoomed out so much now.
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:23.600]   I mean, I've zoomed in so much.
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:24.600]   Nope.
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:27.200]   I have problems with the UI of street view.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.920]   It's a little disconcerting.
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:31.560]   You can read what's on people's desks.
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:35.560]   You can, I mean, there's a, and there's little things going on.
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:39.960]   And some of the people appear twice, Andy Inako from Mac Break Weekly in Chicago, sometimes
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:41.480]   is sitting there.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:43.560]   He's actually doing a show with a chat room.
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:46.120]   You could see our CEO, Lisa.
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:49.640]   Her face is blurred in one picture, but there's one picture where she's not.
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.000]   Oh, they messed up.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.440]   Well, I don't know if messed up is the right word, but.
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:56.640]   They must have some standard, but I'll big the faces.
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:57.640]   Maybe that's it.
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:02.000]   And it turns out apparently if the face is on TV, they don't have to blur it.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000]   Because it's already public.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000]   Because it's already public.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.200]   So, so the faces here aren't blurred.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:07.400]   But anyway, if you.
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:08.400]   It's really great.
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:10.880]   Oh, it's just a really fun thing.
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:15.240]   And this is, so this is not something Google does for free, but any business with a Google
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:18.160]   place listing can do this.
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:20.680]   If you contract with an existing.
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:22.720]   How large is the pool of authorized.
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.400]   You know, it doesn't look huge.
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:26.040]   It's maybe 25 photographers.
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:29.440]   I'll put a link because I don't know the exact link.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:31.680]   But you can see there's this tripod, right?
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:34.800]   So he shoots these, he shoots in four directions.
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:39.360]   And then there's special stitching software that's Google will stitch it for you.
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:43.600]   But a good provider does does the work ahead of time and then uploads it to Google.
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:50.160]   Plus if you're getting a Google approved provider, it's much faster to get this on.
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.120]   He got this on the same day that he shot it.
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:55.440]   So there I am sitting at my desk and you can, you can zoom in on stuff.
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:57.240]   They didn't, they didn't blur your dog's face.
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:00.120]   No dogs are not, not private individuals.
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:01.120]   They are public.
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:02.280]   So there's Aussie.
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:04.040]   You can see how much you can zoom in on it.
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:08.120]   So all you have to do is search for tweet on Google Maps and then click the thing and
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:11.680]   you can see, you know, everything, everything's here.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.240]   Did you hide anything beforehand?
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:16.880]   I didn't think to because I didn't realize how high resolution it is.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.640]   So there is some private stuff in there which I'll leave for you as an exercise to the reader.
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:23.800]   You can read all the titles on the bookshelf.
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:25.440]   I mean, this is how good it is.
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:26.440]   It's really amazing.
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:27.920]   What kind of camera is he using?
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:31.360]   Not if I don't even think he was using like a, you know, high-end Canon.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:35.280]   It was a SLR but kind of probably a D60 or something like that.
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:37.960]   You can read the credit card numbers on my desk and everything.
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:38.960]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:40.080]   I've canceled all those credit cards.
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:41.400]   So don't worry.
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:44.560]   You can, you know, you can see what model TV we're using.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:45.600]   So this is a fun thing to do.
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:48.640]   But yeah, a little bit of advice to business owners who do this.
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:50.680]   You might want to clear out the personal.
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:52.920]   It's really high resolution.
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:59.120]   It was a 60D with eight millimeter fisheye lens according to Gianni Ola in the chatroom.
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.840]   Yeah, if you go in the, you can go in the kitchen and see Andy stealing snacks and all
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:03.840]   sort of stuff.
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:06.040]   Jeff, it's so great to have you here.
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:07.800]   I'm really great to build.
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:10.400]   Other staff members here at, at, at what HQ?
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:11.400]   Yeah, your first time.
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:14.000]   And very importantly, Aussie.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.200]   Aussie, the wonder dog.
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:17.200]   What do you wait a minute?
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:20.320]   I have, I have another tip to add just released today.
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:23.520]   You can actually grab the little street view guy.
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:27.400]   And there are now orange dots around businesses who have also participated.
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:28.400]   Oh, this is great.
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:29.400]   Yeah.
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:31.400]   So, so now you can see that in the.
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:33.560]   Go into our local hardware store.
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:34.560]   Right.
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:35.560]   So that's the, that's.
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:37.920]   So it looks like there's a New Yorker pizza thing right here.
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:38.920]   Sam did that, huh?
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:40.800]   Well, that's my favorite pizza in town.
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:41.800]   Right.
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:42.800]   So there you go.
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:43.800]   We can go straight in.
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:44.800]   Aussie, New Yorker pizza.
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:45.800]   Look at that.
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:46.800]   Oh, that's the jeweler store.
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:47.800]   Yeah.
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:48.800]   So the jeweler did it.
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:49.800]   Apparently.
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:50.800]   So did he make more business while he was in town?
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:51.800]   I hope so.
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:52.800]   I don't know if, uh, Trisha.
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.840]   I actually believe that he's based in Houston, but because he was a fan, he came up.
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:56.840]   He flew up.
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:57.840]   Yeah.
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:58.840]   Wow.
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:46:59.840]   I had no idea that many businesses were doing right.
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.800]   And it's actually kind of, there's, there's a few in Petaluma.
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:05.800]   There's, there's a whole bunch of you just in this bovine bakery.
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:06.800]   There's one.
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:07.800]   There's one.
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:08.800]   There's one.
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:12.200]   This website is Karsten's C-A-R-S-T-E-N-S.
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:13.200]   That's my apartment.
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:14.200]   Women.
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:15.200]   No, no, no.
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:16.200]   Go back a little bit.
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:17.200]   Oh, sorry.
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:18.200]   That's actually my, oh, that's the graffiti restaurant.
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:19.200]   Right.
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:20.200]   I leave above that bar.
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:21.200]   Right.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.200]   Right.
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:23.200]   They send up.
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:24.200]   Right.
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:25.200]   The graffiti.
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.680]   They do send up as a matter of fact.
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:27.680]   That's cool.
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:28.680]   Yeah.
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:29.680]   Uh, I should do a tour of my apartment.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:30.680]   Right?
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:31.680]   I know.
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:32.680]   No, okay.
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:34.680]   This is his website.
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:35.680]   Karsten's three.
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:36.680]   There it is.
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:37.680]   Go ahead.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:38.680]   I can show you.
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:39.680]   See that red thing?
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:40.680]   Go up.
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:41.680]   No, that's not it.
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:42.960]   Oh, that's across the street.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.920]   Anyway, never mind.
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:48.760]   You could probably find my Mustang if you look.
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:51.200]   This is his site, Karsten's 360.com.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:52.960]   But there are others that do this as well.
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:55.880]   You could search for Google Street View photography.
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:00.800]   This is a little bit of a type of perhaps discussion from earlier, which is that Google
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:06.960]   is really in the effort in doing very, very high quality measurement of the world precisely
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:11.240]   because this is their way of making it more useful and making it, making it, making it
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:14.000]   be able to start advertising and reaching emphasis and stuff there.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.040]   That's like playing a very long game here.
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:20.640]   Yeah, very long game because it doesn't, you know, I guess what happens is people start
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:24.680]   to think, hmm, hmm, what are they up to?
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:25.680]   Right.
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:26.680]   Right.
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:28.720]   But the thing is, the same thing.
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:29.720]   They're providing utility.
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:33.560]   So because they're providing utility to you with the mapping, you don't mind them.
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.760]   You don't mind the street, you call it.
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:37.760]   It's a huge utility.
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:38.760]   Yeah.
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:39.760]   Okay.
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.680]   Yeah, this is a, well, you just reminded me of something else.
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:46.160]   This would be a tool in the week if he actually ships it.
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:53.200]   A friend of mine at the XOXO conference made a little iOS app because, you know, if you
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:49:00.840]   ask for transit directions, it outsources that to third-party apps.
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:05.240]   So he made a third-party app that opens Google Maps and shows you the transit on that.
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:06.240]   Wow, that's cool.
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:08.240]   But it's not released yet.
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:11.520]   Probably, probably we're going to prove by the store because it wasn't what it's doing.
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:16.520]   But basically he hooks that, you know, if you click this, the actions thing, it says,
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:20.680]   try and get a local directions app with the idea that people wouldn't build them.
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:24.160]   And, you know, and there are trying to answer a lot of things.
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:27.480]   And he just said, oh, just pass it over to the web and let Google try.
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:30.240]   So, that's quite cute.
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:32.120]   Kevin Marks, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:35.200]   I hope you're having a great dream force there in San Francisco.
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:37.240]   I appreciate your take a time out.
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:39.040]   I guess Jeff already did his.
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.280]   What was your talk on?
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:45.280]   Media, the changes in media to the guy who handles the media clients there.
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:50.320]   And it's really amazing because as I'm arguing, not to sell sales force, but as I'm arguing
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:54.560]   they did bring me out, that media companies have to be in the relationship business.
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:57.040]   They need a platform to figure that out.
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:59.480]   So that's why it made sense.
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.000]   So I think this was a lot of fun and thank you both for being here.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000]   I really appreciate it.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.680]   We do twig on Wednesday afternoons right after security now.
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:12.120]   That's about 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:13.120]   Do watch live.
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:16.080]   It's really nice to see everybody yelling at us in the chatroom.
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:19.160]   We like that.
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:25.400]   Every time all I have to say is tracking cookie and Google plus Google plus Romney.
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:27.400]   I don't mean to be controversial.
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:30.520]   I'm just a puffy little fuzzball.
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:32.200]   We do love having you here live.
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:34.600]   We'd actually do read the chatroom.
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:39.120]   I may flick off this time to time off camera, but I read it.
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.920]   If you can't watch live, we do love it if you download.
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:43.800]   In fact, best to subscribe.
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:46.400]   If you want to support the show, that helps us out a lot.
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:53.000]   Alan iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts or just download on-demand versions from twit.tv/twig.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.200]   We'll see you next Wednesday on this weekend.
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:57.200]   Bye-bye.
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:04.200]   [music]
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:06.780]   (gentle music)
